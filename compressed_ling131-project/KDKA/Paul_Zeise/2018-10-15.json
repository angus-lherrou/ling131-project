looks different because not all of us were doing everything together and then my second son a year and a half than two years later\nMy second son graduated and um it just threw me for a loop and I had decided around that time\nThat I was going to teach at the school that my kids go to they go to a mostly Catholic but it is I'm a Christian school K. through twelve and so I decided to sort of volunteer teach fulltime because my kids were getting bigger and I had all this time and so the book starts out in this place where\nAll of a sudden I had hit the wall where I had said I had forgotten to say is just so many things\nUm and I was struggling emotionally with changes in the family and I think maybe I was trying to fill that space with doing lots of the school being in charge of the year book teaching for classes doing staff meetings and car line\nI'm all while trying to be a mama too you know kids that are even though they're not in the home anymore they still need you a lot and we still have to in elementary and my husband's an attorney with his own practice\nUm and so I was a woman that just had way too much going on and so that's where the book starts is kind of me working through the fact that even though I might be somebody who's really organized and has a great system for all these things\nThat's no replacement for real peace and which is paying attention to what God is asking of me not what I think I Want to be doing\nYou wrote a life or the other was it the ... peace with no room for taking the brunt of there was no joy oh you were ... shoes you just said you do go I didn't want you to live the way and then the light bulb moment came when God told her\nSaying yes to me doesn't mean seniors to everything what would you think you meant by that\nWell you know saw there I think it's so easy to think that we have to do the things in life that are good things you know and um you know it's kinda like well of course I'm going to say yes to being on this committee at church because it build the life of the church and um you know if we're making decisions\nJust because it's a good thing we can get into some really dangerous territory and for me\nI was saying yes to everything\nThat I saw is good and a lot of opportunities we're coming my way and so it's I find myself is somebody who you know I have this masters in journalism so it would be good for me to volunteers or writing teacher and to be helping with the yearbook and\nUm you know these were all wonderful things I mean none of them were quote unquote selfish thing but that was the problem is I was um I think I was just making decisions not based on what I\nThought God wanted me to do or what I could handle you know in light of my primary vocation as being a wife and a mom but mostly just looking at each\nYou know opportunity or each request for my time at face value well this is a good thing so I'll say yes to this and this is a good thing you know and and God finally really kind of getting my attention and saying you know I don't want you to do this to say yes to every single thing because what I started to realize too is\nI think you get a little bit of a\nFalse sense of well it's cried like\nWell if I don't do it who will do it and you know so maybe a false sense of obligation that's\nKind of wrapped up in pride a little bit um you know but also that's such a terrible distraction when maybe what I'm really supposed to be doing is have the having the time and energy to be emotionally available to my Seventeen year old son or to my Nineteen year old son you know and we think in terms of yeah but they don't need\nDinners prepared for them necessarily or lunches made in their independence\nBut if I'm so exhausted at the end of every day that I have nothing left to give my family than my you know and that's exactly where I was and so what had happened is my sense of\nObligation was distorted and I was having to give more time and energy to things outside the home than to the people that that nobody else could be there for and the same way which is\nFor in the same way which is my husband and my children\nYou knowledge of the same those certainly difficult situation and and uh also ignores renewed women to bring their lights wisdom and spirit to the world's ocean and we used to talk about order hope in order to bring peace\nIt's or to bring peace\nAnd it's not simply a matter of and I and I started to dive into this in the book and that's why I Am grateful for the things that happened to me around the time when I was working on the book because order is you know there's practical order and then there's this much more the radical\nWhich is the practical order of running a household running a schedule you know I'm looking at the units of your day and making sure things or manage nicely you know I'm aware of you know what we have going on tonight\nFor each of the children are what meetings my husband and I might have or you know though that sense of order\nI'm being aware of you know how many gallons of milk to we have left that's a big thing with a lot of boys you know keeping track of our food that brings order to we're not always running out of food\nBut and and I had that working very well but what had happened for me is that distortion of the the overall sense of order which is the balance between among all the things that you're doing and so you have peace\nPeace comes from that order and managing a home in managing a schedule\nBut then the bigger picture of order is you know are the things I'm doing in the right order do I have you know time and energy for personal prayer do I have time and energy to spend with my children um you know am I paying attention to what God is asking of me and not what I feel like\nI Want to be doing now of course\nGod you know he doesn't come and fill in the words in my calendar you know he doesn't tell me what I'm going to be viewing on Monday and Tuesday but that's the problem when things are out of order is if we're not\nIf we're moving so fast that we can't even hear what\nWe think maybe God as gently trying to tell us than we don't really have a sense of moving throughout our day sort of being aware\nOf the direction that God might want us to go um so that's the kind of order that ultimately you know is it much more important than the ability to stay on top of the laundry and keep your bathroom clean but\nThose things are also important because when we take care of those kinds of things in our life it really brings us the peace to to slow down enough to hear God's voice and ... you know here the bigger picture of the direction that he's asking us to go\nA year she wrote it orders keeping our priorities straight understanding what God has asked you to do what they're doing is giving the proper amount of attention to what truly truly matters him I'm a little reflection or in your book points out to the mother was small children should not put

... bring peace to heart and home during the first part of our program we were talking about a border\nEnergy toward them and we're not talking about perfection but talking about what it is the God wants us\nTo do in such simple ways away whoop approaching the program is there's a there's a large part about half the book is about\nA quarter piece bringing\nA piece in order into your home and a lot of practical recommendations room to talk about\nSome of those so that we can get to the end of the book and bringing the whole part about spirituality or the third part of the books that um talks about a piece and in order in our spiritual growth Jesus others and then you um\nWhenever I'm rich who you in part one of the book is titled ... piece border within the home you write in order to life is one that gives each time\nTurn to deserve this means that small tasks should get a small amount of or tension winner lives feel out of order we start to have an imbalance in\nWhere we put our energy\nSo first hand the stress that comes from the details of life being out of balance give us an example of what you mean they're from your own life\nSo I think we can all relate to that you know instance where we go to load up in the car and we can't find our car keys and you know I had that very thing happened years ago when\nI was taking my ... my boys to I think it was a holy day of obligation and I went to load us up into the\nSuburban and I couldn't find the keys well one of the little hands head move them and put them in the grid so of course that was not the first second or even the tenth place that I look for the kids so it took me a long time to find the keys\nUm you know that was one of those sort of life with little kids things get moved but that's the level of disorder that I'm Talking about you know you go to\nMake lunches for your kids and you've run out of bread or you're out of detergent and and those are all on us mistakes that happen from time to time but when you're living at a pace where you you really never have time to slow down to take stock gee you know to really\nKeep track of what you need 'em that when that ... kind of disorder and chaos and frenzy is what dictates your day instead of really doing the things that you actually need to do\nTell us about the concepts word season it's it's one of your favorites and how would fits into what we're talking about tonight\n[laughter] yes I use that word alive and I try not to use it too much in the book\nBut I think it's so important to really be aware of that you know I'm ... and that's for all of us I was gonna say for me as a mom but I think everyone should be aware of this season that they're in and that's you know something that's bigger than simply um this year\nBecause it could apply to a few weeks it could apply to several months\nI think it's easy for moms to understand this concept\nBecause life with children you know you have seasons you have a newborn season where that's just a uniquely\nBeautiful and it's very stressful time and so you have to treat yourself with a lot more love and patient you know and maybe lower standards in some certain areas\nTo get through that season as the mom of five boys and my husband helps um coach basketball basketball season is the season where you know I'm not going to maybe be trying to make really uh\nIt'd be trying to make really elaborate meals for us as the families\nBecause we're at the gym you know three or four nights a week so that's what I talk about what season is just being aware of the different variables that you have going on\nAnd then applying you know like adjusting your schedule your standard your expectations that you're not stressing yourself out or driving yourself crazy trying to make something happen at a time where it that's just not a realistic thing to do and I think especially I talk about it with prayer as well\nYou know I think um women we we see motherhood is a vocation special call from God for our lives and so we take it very seriously and we want to do good and B holy people\nUm but we can hold ourselves to the same standard of of prayer as a missionary of charity one of you know Mother Teresa now there are a priest and we have to remember that God Knows that about us like this special call that each person has in their life\nGets to tie in with all the different ways that they move towards being closer to God God you know we we get to keep that into account and and work within those confines\nInto the cause of the season than can apply to all kinds of times that we experience in in our life and you you write that we have to work hard to get border and peace but it's totally worth it if you want\nPeace you must be willing to make the change is necessary to find it it's not about pursuing perfection as we said during the first part and the God will give us the gifts we need in one of the the first\n... chapters in this section is titled home making slash household merely as we talk about the outrageously practical and I love the the quote did you use from Jay or Miller a true home is one of the most sacred of places\nFor more than we know do the strengths and beauty of our lives depend upon the home in which we do well to really think could reflect on that for quite a period of time um\nDid you point out that it's okay not to have everything perfect all the time we are human with human suffering we must be careful that we do know low cleanliness to become an idle\nAnd that's part of what you've explained no um so where should we start who knows what I'm looking forward to is a ... because I Love the ... the navy seal training if you want to change the world started off by making your ... your bed to your bed so weird yeah we start\n[noise] so if we're going to talk a little bit practically right now instead of theoretically I'm a huge believer in that concept then I and I love the book that became so popular you know about making your bed\nI'm by the navy seal um I start in the home when I'm cleaning I start with a clean sink and when I get up every day I start with a made bad and it really is and I talk about it in the book this concept of\nUm you're starting you know from sort of ... ground zero and working your way out and and in theory\nYou'll make the bed and then you'll pick up the laundry that's on the floor and you know you know you'll sort of move through even just ten or Fifteen minutes of sort of getting the day started in the direction of\nOrder and you know all the different systems working and then worst case scenario it's one of those horrible days where everything goes wrong well at least you have your bed may you know it's but it's that feeling of a things already being done and that gets you moving in the right direction\nDirection instead of feeling like you're just behind from the get go and\nI'm just to read a little more about a new boards of your bed if you make your bed every morning\nYou will have accomplished the first task of the day we'll give you a small sense of pride that will encourage you to do another task and another and another and by the end of the day the one task completed will have turned into many tasks completed\nMaking your bed will also reinforced the fact that the little things in life matter if you can do the little things right you will never be able to do\nBig things right and so if you want to change the world start off by making your bed and that's where the navy seals begin you have to be in making your bed so those were begins I'm\nThe next step in ... practically\nOrganization is the focus on keeping the room clean but in the midst of that you have a family blitz tells them about the family blitz\nLet somebody else bringing the roles let somebody else spring a side dish um maybe all you have to do is have a homeless picked up and ready for all that food to come in you know it's okay to say\nI'm this is what it's going to take for me to make this work peacefully um and again that there is a little bit of humility tight and\nI didn't have that you know I'm not perfect I Can't do it all up and I would rather do last with a lot of joy and let everybody else pitch in as well just think it's really important to keep that in mind and you know allow yourself to operate like that\n... you write a book we need a place for everything\nThat you have to be honest with the amount of time and energy willing to invest the heart of success organization is to divide and to call her the first step is a willingness to de clutter regular take this step and then we'll be right back\nBut I think that's where I'm\nLot from some news ... a radio [noise]\nThe news on the hour sponsored by liberty mutual insurance\nAnd

[noise]\nYes I just love this um a friend of mine um spent she died last year um my friend and she hits the hell out of time going up to the Madonna house um and and told me about Katherine do already but it's really this concept of\nOf recognizing that the thing that we're doing in this moment it's the same God has asked us to do and I loved it because that that um concept came to me at a time when what I was doing was\nWas barely not drowning you know I was just barely not drowning in life because I have four boys that were you know middle like elementary and up\nAnd then I had two little babies up to you know as the villain Henry were like three years apart and then the other boys were eight ten\nLike eleven and Thirteen and so life just was very difficult for me then and all of a sudden it was like I just saw this is like that this is the thing God is asking of me right now and what that means is not\nUm anything more than just I'm going to try to get through the end of today in one piece and to try to find some happiness enjoy in the midst of it but to recognize that this is the most important thing I'm doing is taking care of these children and that got you know my quest to be a saint or to be a holy woman\nIsn't on hold until my kids are bigger and I can go to add a ration longer and go to daily math no like the thing I'm doing right now\nIt's part of what's drawing me closer to being a sane and I and that's the duty of the moment which just\nYou know it makes those really difficult moments\nSomething more than just a thing to endure it's like now that God is with me here in the midst of all this craziness two\nAnd a people will tune in to say what are they talking about tonight I think it's who's paragraph there will explain their don't forget the practical part of teas doing the things that bring us peace\nPursuing order in our home finding peace within ourselves in taking care of those areas that need our attention bring us peace which helps us love our life even more determined to love your life\nWhich also means be willing to address the parts of the can be changed let's jump to part\nFree for the the amount of time we have left piece in order in our spiritual growth Jesus others and you give us kind of an overview before we talk about your specific recommendations\nShirt so you know as I considered the ways that I feel closer to God and the ... and the way that you know we grow in our spiritual life it really is and he's three different areas I mean we have our relationship with Jesus\nChip with Jesus you know our connection with Jesus but then how we deal with others is a huge part of that\nOf personal holiness because you know how many times have we had that experience I have it often where I feel so close to God and I feel like I could be a saint and then I Walk out my front door and I have to encounter somebody that rubs me the wrong way or all of a sudden I realized oh\nI'm not as patient as I thought today we grow so much in holiness and how we deal with other people and we learned to die to ourselves you know and to put other people first and then you know then the personal aspect of things have just learning\nTo personally experienced God's love ... and I and in the book kind of ends right where it begins which is finding order in our home in ... and personally mentally taking care of the things we need to take care of\nFreezes up to have order in our life to then experience God's love so that we are not running around so crazy and again like you you've stressed and I appreciate it so much\nThis is not about perfection this is not like here's a book of how to make your house clean enough so that you can have a good prayer time so that you can be a thing but it's really just the peace ... you know I like it a lot to the times where\nI'm if I'm exercising\nThen I just feel good about myself and it's not that all of a sudden you know by going out for a run\nI feel like I you know if I have a few pounds to lose that I instantly loses but it's that feeling of like I've made an effort in the right way\nAnd I can rest assured that I have taken care of that for today you know and then I don't have to fret about feeling gross because I put this effort into it and I think little bits of effort across the board and all the right areas\nReally get us moving in the right direction\nAnd you first recommendation you spend time in prayer and and you write to the greatest gift you can give yourself a spiritual life was learning to make it personal it's important to recognize the proclaim your love for Jesus\nEqually if not more important for you to embrace his love for you and\nYou point out the ... even folding laundry can be for you approve time isn't it\nIt is um that that really is I'm In my home the place that I feel closest to God I'm In it you know this whole funny little thing where I have this certain way that I you know I take the laundry out of the drier swim always folding it when it's\nWarm and I have a system so that it's not stressful for me I have little baskets for each of my kids\nAnd so you know that little bit of order creates this peace and I'm able to just you know I go in Iran in the laundry room and I I fold the things and you know sometimes I just really pray free for each\nYou know whatever article of clothing unfolding I pray for that person and then sometimes I really do just have this experience of like just knowing how much God loves me and I think it's because I'm kind of in this this really calming doing this calming little task\nAnd and kind of tuning everything else out and it's not like this every time for sure but it is a place that I have just found you know that I really do experience God's love 'em which is at just at the heart you know of the desire to be a sane is like\nLand we know how much God loves us that makes all this other stuff so much easier you know like to go about our day because we know\nBecause we know God loves us and and we've experienced that and the ability to love others which to me is like just so huge the call to love God's people like he needs to be as his hands and feet to not just to do things like not just to be its hands and feet\nBut to be his eyes and his heart to love people\nUm and so yes it's very important to go to the soup kitchen you know to do volunteer work go really just to move throughout our day seeing people the way it God sees them and loving him in the way he he loves them so that that others can really experienced that love of God as well\nTo other ways which we sure of your wisdom or was in this context is have peace with God and learn to trust and pursue holiness told us about those efforts\n[noise] um you know I think it's just like making this commitment\nTo be wholly which means um [noise] I mean you know ... and ... that's not simply a matter of just saying I'm going to spend X amount of time in prayer because you know I I found so much people in my life\nRecognizing that you know God it's also aware of the seasons that we're in and so he doesn't just say you know the only people that can pursue holiness or be saying for the people that are hitting this much daily mass in this much adoration you know it's like we use the circumstances of our life\nAh to draw closer to God and he uses them to drop closer to him which means you know that we are pursuing holiness within our marriage within the way we treat other people you know I talk about marriage um ingest\nThat such a huge way\nYou know to to die to yourself and become closer to God it's when we start to take the focus off of ourselves and to look\nMore at other people and their needs as ... you know our kids are spouse our neighbors the stranger and the grocery store that to me is pursuing hauling us as well as just like and I know it sounds weird because so much of the book\nIs focusing on you know these things in our life but the point of it is really\nWhen we focus on these things when I think about a menu and the laundry system and keeping my home clean and I've given things that were that they deserve it then I really don't have to think about it so much and then that really frees me up\nTo think about myself less ironically\nYes no question no question about it oh and and spiritual rosy and and and others um you record from um does your rubber beer in the to the point of prairie says is not to stay on the mountain\nIt's not going to the mystical experience however wonderful it is to become review with the divine light switch to share it with the world and then when you your\nWisdom news then love your spouse hopefully the community help your family pray amplify on that for a little bit\n[noise] yeah the ... you know that's a big point for and I I hear over the years you know I wrote I write up my block testosterone home dot net and then I'm a columnist for our newspaper here in the diocese of savannah down in Georgia I'm In here from women especially who want to know how to make family prayer work\nBegins why is that Rachel\nSo it's really just being in touch with where you're at and you know and again it kind of ties back in with the duty of the moment of recognizing\nWhere you're at what it is you're up to you know what you're doing right now and and applying you know the right ways of dealing all that embracing the seeds in your ... so that you know you recognize that\nYou can pursue holiness and the desire to be a saint um because God takes into account where you're at in life and and who you are in a big thing I write about this too\nNot just sort of the season you're in but all the different components of you and your life and I I tell a funny story in there about a friend of mine has a home schooling mom and at the time she had four girls and I had four boys and she wanted to um\nMake tell them as an honor of wind Diego being becoming a saint because my mother in law's from Mexico and um you know just being a special thing for us and my but we arrived and the ... boys wanted no part of\nYou know drawing a lady on a T shirt\nWith flowers and and I was mortified because I thought that that somehow it's like a direct reflection of\nMy failure as a mother you know that I didn't have not raise these boys to to want to do this the way her daughters that because you know they recognized beauty of Mary and Mary's clean and um and you know and just really learning to recognize that\nThat is part of growing and hauling is too is just embracing not just the season we're in but\nYou know the makeup of our family and I've learned so many lessons as having five sons and you know we really by the time we had our fifth on I really never expected that we would have a daughter um and and I had totally made peace with that but learning all of that too like life with boys is just\nSo different than sort of what I thought motherhood would look like with calm collected children I'm ... and that doesn't limit me from pursuing holiness either you know just because I'm not somebody who necessarily when my kids were little could go spend tons of time in at ration chapel\nGod takes all those things into account and and so we really do have to learn to love ourselves and learn to love her life and and we see it all is a gift from God\nDude on of a song what are you recommending to us here [noise]\nSo um I kinda I I tell a funny story in the section is right at the end of the book and basically it kinda goes back to the very beginning of the book which was\nUm I started to know that something was wrong with me and my life being out of order and out of balance when I went for my annual check up to the doctor and my blood pressure was so high that the nurse kind of made a funny safe you know like whoa and I thought I was totally fine I just you know but I was starting to see\nAnd what happened is I left that doctor's appointment with a prescription for medication\nThat I had not asked for and so the doctor kind of saw in me he was probably one of the first people to recognize that I was sort of living you know on the outer edge and the point of talking about getting out of the funk Israeli\nRecognizing when you're out of place in life where even if you have all the right things in order and you're doing things the right way quote unquote you know you've streamlined you learn to say no you're you're taking care of your family and you're still struggling\n[noise] find the help that you need you know for me what I was able to do is um\nTo stop to I walked away from a job that I loved it because it was taking way more for me that I could\nBut I also know that you know postpartum depression is a thing that you shouldn't just tried to pray away like get the support you need you might not need medication but you might and that's okay too and and really that part of the book addresses you know really the caviar of\nThis isn't about perfection this isn't about like if you learn to put everything in the right order you won't have any problems they're still going to be times when\nEven if you've streamlined and cut out the fat and you're you know you're doing all the things in a real simplified way\nThat you might need you know real good support from friends in a unique way in that season or maybe take some ... you know I have a friend who's a um\nA family practice doctor and he said you know we live at a pace in our life right now\nThat is just beyond the way we were made to live and and some people kinda might need you know help with that and that's not a bad thing to to be able to to acknowledge you know the pace of life that human beings live at now is just so much faster than um than what we originally created to do\nIs we ride was beneficial voters simple life when something is out of order you to assess it when you have to find the disorder adjusted things you will have peace\nAnd when you were doing it for the disorder that are non position to change or just you could do something above that will tell us a little bit about your your recommendation do be a martyr be yourself\n[noise] yeah you know\nAt the heart of all of this is just learning to let go and I share that story that I read in a book on prayer by Henry new and and um he talks about a woman\nWho an old woman who comes into the hospital and she's flailing about and they have to take everything away from her that she's holding in the last thing she has left\nIs this coin in her hand and it's followed up so tight that they finally have to pry it out of her hand you know and she feels like if they take this away she will have lost everything I'm In how ridiculous that sounds you know in the story this little coin but how many of us walk around\nLike holding on that tightly to something you know either our opinions our opinions are viewpoints um our fears\nUm our hopes and dreams and we hold so tight on to something that we um ... we're not able to connect with God the way\nThat we need to and so it it all ties together with like the simplicity of home the simplicity of heart and then the simplicity of just\nOur our view of like being willing to say lord the things that I hold onto so tightly you know my my fears for my children my my fears of what people think of me and my opinions that I'm willing to let go of all of those things\nUm because then what we're left with is open hands that are afraid to be filled by God you know I mean I think mother Theresa says that you know God he he fills empty and as he can't fill something that has already full\nAnd so so much of this is is just the letting go in the pouring out of our cells so that God can fill us up and help us to be the saints that we were created to be\nThe Jones euros not only to forgive yourself roller wears you soon but to finally let go of your ideas your hurts to open your hands and do those things to guard what kind of process is giving those things to God\nYou know it it does in fact I think to that friendship\nRelationship with God um that's really you\nBecome somebody that spending enough time with this you know this entity this person that you start to trust that he has your best interests at heart and little by little I think it's like when we have time\nWhere we see that we're cleaning to things that were fearful that were you know we have unkind thoughts that we just give those back to him and I kind of practically are I write about this in\nIn an earlier section in the book about choosing joy and it's just concepts you hear about choose joy you know in one day I was really sort of agitated\nUm and it just kind of in an agitated ... state and having a real negative thoughts and I thought you know what I'm going to choose joy and every time I have a negative thought\nI'm going to like almost serve it back to the gods away uh Wimbledon tennis player with return author and so I'd have a negative thoughts and I would just hand it back you know mentally I saw myself handing this thing to God\nAnd I think that's the same kind of way that letting go is when we see ways of thinking ways of relating\nThat we know are keeping us from from feeling got you know being close to God or from doing what he wants to do that we just say I don't even know how this works God but I'm ... I'm giving this view even the active just acknowledging I Want to give this to you I Want to open my hands I don't want to cling to anything more than you\nThat God really can do something miraculous for us\nIt was terrible thing you're right we can do is except our weakness and love ourselves in our own imperfections\nAnd all she would knowledge the need for hope when you write that all things in our life or a spouse our kids the people we love our gift from God\nBecause they cannot be what brings us peace and joy and fulfillment that must be the space that we're willing to four out so that God me fill it with himself in the fullness we find true peace and true happiness so hope\nIs that considered an expectation of a coming good\nIf our hope is rooted in our kids in our present situation than life is going to be very hard\nYou can't put your Julia on hold while your kids\nWhile your kids get through a difficult season or will be can't be a lack of difficult and this is the

[noise]\nWho's not been identified as the first death in that state now from the flu already from for this flu season the child tested positive for influenza B and had not been vaccinated\nUm so we're talking about the flu vaccine again it's going to be in the spotlight certainly as we get into the season let me ask you are you hearing\n... ... you don't hear that much opposition to getting a flu vaccine anymore as you do some other vaccines but it's still shocking when you hear about younger people kids who aren't vaccinated against the flu\nYeah kids and and an adult especially the elderly my wife and I had our flu shots just about ten days ago now and we're over the age of sixty five so they suggest the height does yeah yeah yeah how's your immune system is not quite as\nHealthy it is as it is when you're twenty five years old or a child\nAnd so they do boosted a little more with a little more of the of the vaccine itself yeah and did they say hold the child was\nUm it does not they haven't identified the child so I'm not sure how old your here she might have been\nBut it is very very important on both ends of the scale you know the very young the very old because our immune systems aren't as good as people in the middle and the flu can be very very very serious\nSo on and he can barely be devastating\nDo we do we have any sense yet these here about how effective the flu vaccine is going to be\nWell they certainly hope it's more effective than last year last year it was about sixty percent apparently and uh that's that's not high enough you'd like to get it up around eighty or so but uh there are also doing some research and trying to develop a flu vaccine\nThat is going to cover more strange\nAnd if it does that then they can develop that\nNot on a yearly basis but on a continual basis and because you know you sort of have to wait until you see what the strains are going to be here before you develop the vaccine\nAnd and it's almost ... because they want to get it out there quickly and get it delivered to everybody who needs it they just kind of a guessing game that goes on it seems a little bit in the early part of the year about what strains that are going to target\nAnd whether or not they're going to be effective with a vaccine and the other thing some people say well October's past you know I just talking to be effective that's not the case I mean you can take it even after the end of the year ... into the spring because of the flu season is sort of like October to April May\nAnd and I have you ever had the flu Joe you know what you're going to\nI'm going to put myself on the spot and because I never have so that the curse of a threat no I've never I've never really had it and it was only I gotta admit only recently in the last five six years and I've even started to get a flu shot and I realized that I should have been getting it earlier but I Do get one every year now\nWait a general ... er physician on just a few weeks ago talking about back seats okay ... and ... we asked you know what what are the symptoms and she said you feel like you've been brought over ...\nWant to die [laughter] and I said well I've had the flu or not recently but I've had the flu and I said I've had it so it seems like the trucks that back after they ran over yeah but\nUh it it is it can be very very devastating so\nWell a medical frontiers coming up after the top of the hour at seven what are you going to be talking about tonight\nWe're going to be talking about carotid artery disease is a very very important artery on each side of your neck that goes to the brain supplies a lot of the blood because of the from the middle of your brain\nAnd uh those arteries can become disease like just like arteries round the heart or your legs are arms or what have you and uh it's very very important because that can cause a stroke if you get plaque in that the artery\nIf it closes off or partially obstructed you can have a stroke which is you know sometimes very serious\nUm when you're ... if if you have chest pain it's sometimes a symptom of plaque buildup around the heart and so if you're allergic to that and you're lucky you can you can get a test do you get the same kinds of symptoms for the carotid artery\nAs that order we start to get smaller and smaller and it's a little under the opening the diameter is smaller and smaller you can\nGet some ... you may get some headaches may get some visual disturbances that type of thing so those early signs\nBut uh you you don't want the big thing to happen and that is a stroke which can paralyze you um you know one side or the other or perhaps more devastating\nI'm the same kind of treatments if you want to get rid of that that the plaques\nTo be talking about that and sometimes it can be a catheter ... to to expand the artery like a balloon are angioplasty like doing a heart sometimes this tent is put in some times the artery has opened up surgically\nOpened up surgically under

know fairly common problem are we talking about that but you know we were not to be talking about the symptoms and and the the ... therapeutic protocols that patients can have and so on to\nWhat about ... sometimes the these\nCarotid arteries can be treated with a cats are is Asian right how do you also do ...\nAbsolutely so um there's basically once you get to you made the decision to patients and intervention the question then becomes what intervention\nAnd there's basically two different interventions want us to do what we call an indirect me which is to open up the artery in clean out the plaque\nCompletely and then close it back up and the second waste to place a stent which there's two ways to do that traditionally it's been done transparently meaning you puncture the ... which is located in your leg\nAnd you come up and put put a stent that way\nMore recently in one of the cutting edge techniques that the Allegheny held their work is providing is what we call it the court procedure which has transcribe our cherry vascular is Asian which is a different way to do karate ... a small incision at the base of the neck and the advantages of doing it this way is is kind of marrying the two techniques\nAnd the sense that the advantage of and darker right Tamil where traditional transfer most than thing is that there's a significant lower stroke rate intro operative Lee during the procedure\nThe advantage of the transfer most is that is a little less invasive but the stroke rates significantly higher well if you do with the car you actually get the benefits of both where are you still have a very low strictly comparable to open surgery\nYet it's the less invasive than in direct mail you can do that a ... a such kind of bringing both ah both technique so it's a of an advantage to now we're offering and in certain patients where we feel that the best treatment for do\nOkay very good let's go to the phone lines and are surely into ... junior first caller good

to see my dog [laughter] I go to the choir practice [laughter] my nurse actually practice doctors\nAre good okay the one that outlined okay\nDid you have a problem with their carotid artery\nCan I put on\nA ... yeah you you can ... what is your what is your specific question smart I\nSound like something wrong with my arteries\nOkay ... did your doctor said that you possibly had a stroke did they check your carotid arteries\nThey did not OK okay you say you're going to hang up and listen to the radio okay a doctor resolves does that sound like he may have something wrong with the carotid artery\nWhen it's certainly a possibility um you know one of the symptoms of stroke is\nA very common is to lose strength in one of the extremities or whether it's a new right arm and a leg or just an arm and then like\nUm he smiles sounds like he may have risk factors to that at his age and you know his voice may indicate that he's a smoker based on so I think it's a possibility I Would recommend that you see your family doctor and they could do an older son 'til like whether you have significant crowded disease\nAnd a and also there's you know the image and that can be done to even look at your brain to see whether you know that something was something that you know cause any damage a but\n[noise] you know and like you said a Dodger ... the the ultra side that's non invasive it's a very simple answer is no pain with her and I knew they just put a little wand a little bit of\nA lubricant on your on your neck and a road that a Halter San Juan down there and within minutes they can tell whether or not there's a problem with the carotid artery\nAbsolutely and so it's a great screening tests\nOkay and what about the incidents have grown artery disease is it a high enough incidents that are more people should be screened\nI Would definitely I think it's a very common disease when it comes to the overall or even in the whole cardiovascular bed carotid disease is one of the most commonly in effect that and I'm definitely screening tests are very important there's a for that reason many times there's\nYou know drives to certain places where you can you come in and he's had certain risk factors you can get screened not just for crowded disease or per Fletcher of disease all the other things that are associated you know what they are terrorists circulation so it's definitely a common disease that\nScreening or is key for patients because as I mentioned you know most people ... percent of the first symptom as a stroke\nSo it would be ideal to pick up the problem prior to a stroke so that you can start optimal medical management an optimal rest modification and then if necessary intervene as well okay\nAlso mentioned that uh you know was ... dean of it and ... that type of things there is a risk of a stroke and opening up the arteries\nAnd you know taking steaming it out or you know we're putting as dent openly or whatever you do a there's also a risk could have made a stroke could occur during the surgery whoa whoa whoa whoa\nOh how uh how\nCommon is that risk yeah so that um unfortunately yeah there's definitely risk like any other surging so our job you know it's vascular surgeons is to look at a patient and basically look at risk benefit ratio is you know what's the risk of doing nothing and and what's the risk of of doing something so for a procedure of you have a procedure done by\nA a high volume vascular surgeon the risk of stroke for most patients but it's going to be somewhere around one to two percent for the procedure that's fairly low\nUm having said that um their risk of doing nothing in a high risk patient with a high great blockage particular that block is symptomatic already is significantly higher than the one to two percent\nOr so there is obviously are things that we take into account such as are the ... of the patients there are some people are going to have a high grade crowd a blockage that we may not treat charges laid off because of their other risk factors where we feel that we're really not going to benefit them\nOkay if somebody has a disease in their left the carotid artery or one is the ... the odds of having a disease in the right carotid or\nHow they're very high so for the most part when we do screening test is always a bilateral test we don't we don't do a unilateral you let's say we are more suspicious of one side of the maybe they we picked up a brewery as you mentioned earlier\nAs screening old son is always going to take both sides because they they tend to to go together you know usually have it in one you're going to have it in the other it may not be the same degree but there's going to be some disease you should move above them\nAnd somebody who has coronary artery disease or peripheral vascular disease like disease in the arteries or their legs the chances of them having some problems with our carotid is much much higher\nAbsolutely in fact I'm you know one of the screening test for corners surgery prior to having a cabbage is a crowd her older son you know because that's something they want to know ahead of time before they they go to surgery and do a open heart surgery so they definitely correlate together\nYeah yeah because you know like I said if you have one bad artery you might have more than one bad\nApple is the same risk factors in our whole body is a connected so if you have whatever risk factors are there they're going to be affecting a crowd as your heart your legs\nAnd you've mentioned smoking several times\nYeah that's right when smoking is the big one\nOkay well this is the medical front ... to take a break at next week we're going to be talking about heart valve disease another asking her problem so uh we tonight it is

three nine one ten twenty [noise]\nUm [noise] you you talked about the ... section of an order ... that's where the the layers of the walls of the artery start to separate it so you get blood\nSort of in in between a couple of those layers right yeah that that can be painful but it also that's a surgical emergency is adopt\nIt it can be a for the most part we can successfully treat a depending on where the dissection is for example for a crowded that section for the most part we country to successfully with\nAnti platelet a management and blood pressure management okay sometimes surgical intervention is is required\nA dissection and other parts of the by that we commonly see such as they are to also depends on where it's located some of them are surgical emergency mode and some are awesome how to manage medically but it's important what you mentioned about reading this disease early because of you\nCan modify your risk factors early on when you have a moderate block it's you know we can get you to quit smoking and start you on aspirin and Staten therapy and try to a sort of reverse some of these problems then it may may you may live out the rest of you laugh without ever an eating anything further if he can modify thing\nHow have we Scientifically Proven we we know that certainly statistically the smokers get certain numbers of diseases you do with their blood vessels and as long as it cetera et cetera but do we know exactly what happens to a blood vessel because of smoking\nWell I I think it's I don't know that we know exactly I think it's still um\nUm it's a complicated question I guess I Would say but we know that the smoke and do some damage to the uh the actual blood vessel wall and uh that's what leads to some of the changes to start to happen you get information and the blood vessel on that information needs to some of this plaque formation\nAnd ... that's what gets you in trouble that's starts to cause the narrowing of the love of the blood vessel and that we can ... or go to your brain\nOkay it it seems like the lining of of of of an artery is the ... and and it's a very thin membrane theirs and it seems to be that that is sort of the targeted to shoot the ditch chronic smoking can attack right\nAbsolutely and unfortunately can attack the uh throughout the entire body\nYou know it and we know also that it's it's it's involved with them for ... you know because in apparently in in smokers there is a higher rate of inflammation in the lining of our blood vessels\nAnd ... and are lining of the other parts of the body to raise you know as far as our joint you're concerned and so on so\nThis is from a from a standpoint of of of reducing some of the risk of disease and you've mentioned smoking a number of times tonight it it seems like you would really be foolish to start smoking as a young person [laughter]\n[laughter] yeah absolutely I mean nothing good can come from it and uh you know what you'll save a lot of money if you don't start smoking on top of\nThat you know especially with the price of cigarettes I think in New York there what ten dollars a\nPack and I you know try to encourage my patients to quit smoking is and what I tell him as a little bonus to themselves just keep buying the the patch of smoke from yourself put in a little jarring to during the year you can probably take it very nice trip to the Caribbean you know what that kinda money\nAbsolutely okay before we take a nice break let's go to a Ana Marie in Pittsburgh and a breed you have a question\nYes I have very many I\nCan just share the fate and got I have a slight equation on one side for the man\nI'm I Am now I don't know if you get sick and I can say that and I tend to back all\nPharmaceutical drugs if I can I uh I guess what they think that at play with it and secondly I often have a small micro out I'm probably that face and I think are there any connection\nOkay how about a ... so Staten\n... um you know for the last ten years I feel that year after year there's more\nAnd more uh evidence of the benefit of that and so I Would definitely highly recommend to you that you would be a consider starting this that and you know what we know about Staten originally they were or are they still are used to treat people's cholesterol and um but\nIn my particular cases a vascular surgeon while I Do on your cholesterol to be well controlled even if you have normal cholesterol I'm going to start your own uh Staten improperly high dose that and because what it also is able to do is is the closest decreases information that we are talking about inside of a plot by decreasing information inside of a plot like you can then\nStop plaque from rupture I mean and you know when a plaque ruptures not only does it get bigger but it also can ... and lead to a stroke so I Would definitely recommend that you would consider starting a stat and and I talk to your family doctor about that and uh go in and\nThey'll turn into a\nProblem with that anything they get more than just now that I have\nNow so that's the most common one or you know that's that that's I guess the big one than most people when they're intolerable to Staten which is a very small percentage of patients it\nA percentage of patients at the big one is exactly what you mentioned which is just\nSome ... or muscle pain so other than that it's a relatively safe profile there was some concern early on about liver problems but that hasn't panned out to be big problem either I think overall this it's a very good drug uh and I'm very beneficial for with people with are terrible disease\nIf anyone in particular that with that tree karate for one\nOr two great question I think that's a debatable question but I Would tell you that just probably any Staten would be beneficial\nAnd also if one Staten is cause you must get her pain you try and you can try another one and then ah\nAnd sometimes that's just as short a trial and error you know until you find one that can keep your cholesterol under control and you can tolerate and don't have the ... or a doctor results how about a fifty percent of collusion is not one she should follow and so on\nBut it's not one that ah we just short of destined to be nice to have that treated ... think in the future or not\nNo not necessarily make you feel particularly when you start taking status and you take a daily aspirin is a very good chance you could live out the rest of your life without ever progress into whatever you need an intervention okay\nThat sounds pretty good any connection with the mitral valve\nAnd now the mitral valve and carotid artery or a would be unrelated as far as the diseases contract K thank\nYou you talk to you Anna Marie thanks so much for the call we need to
