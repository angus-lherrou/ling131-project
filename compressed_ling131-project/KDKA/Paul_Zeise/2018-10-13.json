bb\nOh absolutely 'cause as you are I I think I may have told you this before there's a website um ... this was a pro Syrian website it's I'm an attorney from Syria that lives up in Canada and he put together a website called Syria in perspective okay\nIn it you're you know he normally does but two or three paragraph kind of blog and then the comments I I mean some of the most recently a blog post he said Seventeen hundred comments things like that\nAnd if you've just scroll through them you realize there are all these everything from trolls to patriots to spies to troublemaker\nHe well it's the Internet age it's the Internet I Know such a wretched sky are ... are we all\nWell it's ... and if you look at the you know Ben Franklin when he put together the original libraries or he was he was basically he knew that\nYou would end up with this treasure trove of of you know in your window and scholarly ah works and that if people just sort of drew it long enough they figure out the truth\nWell now you're dealing with a cultural attention span deficit\nYeah maybe but um you know you can't know everything so that's why a library is pretty handy yeah but I I was recommended list Syria in perspective because if you start to go to war in search of ... all of these different um\nThese different um take some of them for example apparently ... show game\nHe was very he was very well known by people that thought he was an important good guy and people that thought he was an important bad guy which would have been in the ... you know if you're a dissident from a country there are people that run the country that aren't Monday you just buy the definition\nRight but in other words he was he interviewed bin Laden and and apparently you know ... years ago before nine eleven he interviewed bin Laden\nAnd uh he was a he was kind of like a you know one of the I wouldn't say a Fox News commentator but you know in New York Times had an ... an established journalist and ah you remember New York times got caught up in justifying the bushes war on Iraq and what\nThe way you know why are you trying to paint this guy is something other than any journalist\n[noise] well ... that's\nIn line rewind well known right right it's in un do\nYeah and so the ... and I don't know I you know I have I honestly don't know but ... what's interesting about his death is is that it's almost as if it's killing a witness\nBecause this guy has been an insider you know for Saudi Arabia is an insider for New York an insider for the military industrial complex he\nWas an insider and have him killed and in fact I think he went into the Saudi embassy in order to he's getting he was getting married and he needed to get some paperwork to get his marriage of filled ... and then he didn't come out\nSo you know to be on a kind of a mundane mission\nAnd not come back right now there is something happened and now you got ... we saw this as soon as that happened what a turkey

thought of what I Am an oddity of uh oh I hate us I hate them\nNow if you want to get a good set of speakers and I've done that get a good set of speakers and a good e cue and all of that stuff that's fine but\nBoy when you're playing the record at the wrong speed to hear different nuances\nThere had been by accident\nI wouldn't have seen that makes me feel a little bit battered just said you didn't do it on purpose my roommate my roommate Wes you couldn't touch it you know the little fuzzy barrage into spray fluid and have to clean the record and if there was that line lint he'd have to clean it again\nA fifth inning you made me start thinking [laughter] not the first\nAlbum that I purchased myself as a ... full\nAlbum hippie uh-huh and then we went from albums to eight tracks right\nOkay and you name it I had it\nTo the point where the boy scouts for having a drive and eight tracks for so far gone out of existence yeah I ended up do they like five hundred eight tracks and an eight track player to the boy scouts\nSure and when the cassettes oh\nMy God I mean the first cassettes I ever bought was a yes close to the edge yeah do you have songs like remember buying it off of Kennedy's school\nYeah it was a it was a lot of neighborhood kids would stop the Don McLean eight track I think cost me a quarter you know\nThat well then that was a thing where the guy came up to the house by what am I Will be bases ... ended up giving him a great deal on a box of cassettes soon as they went by the ... and now I probably got about two thousand CDs are there\nBut yeah I'm I'm like just a music nuts I Can't get enough of it you name it I probably oh that at one time\nRight you at least even if it's not something you say I'm going to listen to this and Thirty years you go through that process of exploring all the different kinds of music 'cause Lou Reed said at a long time ago and yeah I Know he was a horses but to me that he said something that was exactly\nRight before the time if all you hear is the music that is released by your big record companies you might hear ten percent of the music that is actually being produced or performed in the world\nAnd that is that's exactly right\nThat other guy at one point was heavy heavy into songwriting mhm and we did get some down Saturday tree and then after that and they put it on the shelf look for somebody to do it right and well nobody did it\nSo I'm thinking if we were like that there's probably thousands of songs but nobody's ever going to hear of right you're right it's the amount of music\nIt's like the ... come out of a human being right oh some\nHim back in the day it could have been the greatest music in the world but uh like the Tom Petty line the a and R man doesn't hear a single if a record company back then\nDidn't put it out and back then it there wasn't sub record companies and affiliate record companies in smaller feed a record company there was the big boys one of the first ... quote unquote underground record companies that I noticed that wasn't\nCBS or Warner Brothers or Colombia or Casablanca\nWas IRS which was Stuart cope lens brothers label and that's when you started seeing these not monolith but it back in the day of one of those big big boys didn't put your record out you you couldn't afford it\nAnd you weren't going to get the distribution\nSo there was no chance of it that's the cool thing about now I I rant about technology about its heinous and ... all the good one of the good of it Shawn if I go home tonight and I'm struck by lightning and suddenly have talent\nAnd I write an album and I record the album which I can do on a computer if I Want people to hear it all I have to do is click and they can hear it\nThat's cool it more difficult to sort out how to monetize it but more opportunity to make money for more people is cool\nI'm Wondering if I get a hold of you could just show me how to do to\nHow to do a recording music at home\nOr know how I'm doing that I I'm actually doing an acoustic Christmas album really yeah\nAnd I would love just to have it out there for people to hear I don't care for like a penny off well then I guess\nMy limited computer skills you know the blindness of all that I don't know exactly to\nThat's the beauty of it the way you see in type maybe a psychedelic Christmas record brother [laughter]\nYeah may get a hold of me on social media get a get a hold of me on like you usually do\nIts trust me it's super simple to do if I understand that anybody can understand it but the day\nWhen that happened\nI
