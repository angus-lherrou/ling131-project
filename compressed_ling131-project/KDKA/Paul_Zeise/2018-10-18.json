yeah yeah\nUm so tell us or the title the book and what the book is about this this children's book which will hopefully help kids learn how to deal with the politics\nIt's so they know the title of the book is my place in the world and it is about a young girl named ...\nWho goes on adventures and meet lots of different characters on those explorations whether it's a mom a black bear brown bear or as mama snowy owl and\nIt's made sense to me to animals animals he creatures and sea creatures are also animals but you know um\nBecause they were they jettison at the book really came when I just ended my campaign for lieutenant governor and when you're traveling all across the state I rarely got those moments actually late ... down for bed\nAnd tell her story and you know that whole routine that you do with little ones and so I told my husband I'm like I got this tonight and I later down I read her story and she was when you know shut off the light and she's like mom just one more\nYou do with kids you make them the main character in the story that you're telling\nThem so to that end up being the basis for what became a children's book tomato that is\nThis book okay like very few edits um because the next night she asked for the same story and to like she's just over two that was unusual and so I came downstairs I told my husband like she just asked for the same story that I made up two nights in a row and he's like well what is it\nAnd I told it to him he's like you do write that down that's a kids' book [noise]\nOh I Do some through the book at the end of the books on me but you have the other day but I don't want to give the whole thing away sure I'm trying to make a lot of talk about it without [laughter] oil and everything but\nWhen asked me the character the book also the name of your abuse real trial um approaches these creatures some of them tend to be territorial yeah like what are you doing on my turf yeah uh what was the point about\nThat that is I really want kids to go find their own place right find where they fit in in this great world that we have and that means sometimes you're going to fight you're going to go somewhere and some of them sorry I've I've done all the work here I built this place this is where you're supposed to be\nAnd I don't want them to give up I Want them to keep going and keep searching and keep exploring until they find that place that feels just right and when they do I want them to own it\nOf kids around the world yeah and you know as they get older\n... yeah I'm ... and what do you think that you ... we like the story\nA well probably because her name was in it [laughter]\nI think a little bit because she got to explore right through my my word she got to feel what it might be like to run into a mama snowy owl on the top of the great big mountain or ... you know shark in the depths of the ocean and\nHow did you choose which animals to\nActually so that was one of the small and it's like in on it um was I the creature that I had her first run into on the mountain was it yesterday\nAnd I was like wow those aren't real I should probably pick something that's real um but they were just things that are in our back yard we live out in Marysville around four acres and\nI'm pretty sure there's a little bear that Rome's back there\nAnd so you know that was how it kind of started I'm like well in our backyard outlay would put on her yellow boots which she actually owns and we would go adventure through our four acres and go march around and run into creatures all the time deer rabbits are never the bear but you know it's kind of considered it might be out there\nAnd how does the fact that the characters in your book we're territorial and suggesting that maybe we should back off a play into you try to teach them a lesson about politics [noise]\nIt was really when it comes down to I Want them to I Want this to be an opportunity for parents to open up the conversation right so in the end at Lee does find herself on the steps of the White House\nAnd the ... should I saw the guy kind of looked like a guy named Donald Trump but yeah a\nLittle orange yeah [laughter]\nBut you were telling me before well he's a Trump like figure he has a trouble maker so she says oh Mr President now you\nOut of 'em but I think what it does it allows parents to start to have this conversation about politics I don't see this as the end all be all but I think that this is a great way to start I'd like to see this book become a series where we can start to tackle some other issues like immigration\nLike you know people coming to this country has what built this country you know people coming from other countries to say I want to live out this American Dream so\nLike you know people coming to this country is what built this country you know people coming from other countries to say I want to live out this American Dream so breaking that down into a bite size easy to understand concept\nSo in a way it may apply already in the sense that if a big barrier thinks this is my territory don't want you in your uh Allah Donald Trump doesn't necessarily want [laughter] and immigrants as as you may know\nRight now I Know and see and that's the thing I think that as I campaigned as they went through you know talking about some really serious issues as I have lived some really serious issues I've had to explain to my kids I'm\nBig of an example by any chance or who to\nI don't know when it's so let's talk about the refugees from Syria um my son at the time I Want to say he was like in fifth or sixth grade when that was you know we really I ... on the news every single day\nAnd as his mom I have to explain to him why we're banning people from other countries I have to explain to him why we're not letting refugees into this country even though that's what this country's been built on and\nNot one have them be afraid or scared but to really understand not only the history of it and actually my husband really helps with the history of it he's so smart when it comes to that but\nThere are a politically a very politically knowledgeable experienced political operative if you will yes at about ... [laughter]\nUm and so he really helps and kind of given that history but then I kind of can come in and break it down and such a way that makes them feel like they get it and\nAnd a lot of kids don't have that I didn't have that growing up we never talked about politics or the impacts of political policy on our life and so\nThis really I felt like could be a way for other parents who maybe don't come from a political background to be able to start breaking down somebody's really serious issues that kids can understand them\nOr we're going to get this book by the way we should do people yet so I'm actually can get it on my website which is our ... dot com or you can get it on Amazon and just search for either ... or my place in the world\nMy place in the world or I liked the title of come up with a I mean I guess it's sort of quote or because of the story but yeah that's it you'd never gets considering the mill snow like bears are scary [laughter] nothing will so fishing or whatever [laughter] or at my place in the world is good\nUm and I guess you haven't had much of a chance to get response so far 'cause you just are really to the public this\nWe yeah we launched the book on Monday um we had a some pre orders I'd want to say we've sold over a hundred copy so far so good for being in business for two days yet [laughter] so um but yeah things are going really well I you know those that have\nRead it love it they love the illustrations I should say that my illustrator is Liz ... uh she is from Pittsburgh as well and I made a concerted effort to make sure that I hired locally to to help you know contribute to incomplete this book it look\nLike classic children's book illustrations to me I mean I'm almost in the tradition of stuff you've seen but I mean there was a compliment in a good way thank you you pick the good old trader I've heard in my opinion I thank you very much in the book signing ... well I was there for a short period of time but\nYeah it was really fun we had cupcakes with like the little alley figures and some little yellow boots and um lots of kids playing and eating cupcakes those wonderful\n... what can be better by now right ah let's continue our conversation with area of the ... children's book author Iraqi war veteran candidate for public office and God Knows what the future or it took six three and I want to ...\nAnd you were a

cave\nIt's awesome anyway we stop blaming each other dinner homework and read that a smart way to consolidate debt is to get a fixed rate loan but getting a loan was brutal ad time drain so I was in my man cave researching personal loans and I found the best egg yeah they have an a plus rating with a bb\nParticular confirmation of Kavanaugh\nParticular confirmation if Kavanaugh could in fact be one of those moments that the revolutionaries the activists like us go wild man if we can't win that what are we going to win and that worries me\nOr not to get too much into the weeds here but I'm Michael ... who is you know as a lawyer to represent Stormy Daniels or had his alleged victims who who claimed to have a witness or Kevin uh and his friends participation in\nA I guess gang rape more or less yeah um\nBut to me that was the ... there were there was less evidence of seemed to me of course I never saw the Victor the alleged victims ah well actually I did see one interview anyway so I Believe that that sort of took beer out the window to the sales for the other two victims who appeared at least to me to be more legitimate and credible um who knows\nYeah and it's just one of those things are now we have to deal with a repercussion of that right right so we we went through those hearings we you know they everyone did their best to advocate for they were out on the steps of\nYou know Congress trying to make people understand that the significance of this and yet those members of Congress\nStill confirmed him and the Senate and here we are\nYeah and then Trump to saying he was totally proven innocent at a campaign rally a few days later which of course is ridiculous I mean he was proven guilty there wasn't but it was not all proven in no\nNot at all and it but here he have to take it for who was saying at a man that has been accused by what twenty two women of sexual assault something like that so of course he his perspective his framing of this particular issue is going to be one in which he feels like he's in the right because\nI'd had women say those things about me and that was an assault\nYet we caught him on audio recording of him saying that he wrote women so I mean what do you do\nWell he also just like is he is now in the case of the crown prince of Saudi Arabia who allegedly authorized the killing of the of Saudi journalist who also works for the Washington Post\nIf you quote unquote strongly denied any accusation against you if you were vehement in your denial is Vladimir Putin was that it must be true\nRight I I just that is one of the most idiotic things I've ever heard him rationalizing it actually saying into a camera look the guy said he didn't do it and not only that he was really forceful so\nBut that's what Trump does yeah right he sits there and it's forceful and his denial of things that are a hundred percent fact and so when Russia comes in and\nSays oh we had nothing to do with meddling in your election but yet all of the evidence points to them and doing it ... of ... here we have a national security issue because we've got world leaders who are taking the same tactics that Trump has with the just denying the facts and denying the truth\nYeah some people believe the Saudi crown prince was embolden just by Trump's attitude right and knowing in advance of probably only had to do is deny it evidence to be damned enough and Trump or ... right or at least would tell everybody believed it I Can't figure out that out half the time whether he's lying or crazy or both [laughter]\nUm so do you have friends who are um Trump supporters and how to communicate with them\nNo [laughter]\nAbout road [laughter] no [laughter] I well here's the thing\nSo many people that were ... I Will say that there were many people I served with in the military that we when we were in uh Iraq and and actually when I was in Iraq it was more about Afghanistan\nPeople I served with in the military that we when we were in uh Iraq and and actually when I was in Iraq it was more about Afghanistan that Iraq I was there a little bit earlier than you know when Bush turned his attention to Iraq but you know when we were there\nWe there are some of us we certainly didn't agree on politics\nBut you go in and you have a job to do and you get it done Trump has changed the way that people think about politics and it has divided our country in such a way that honestly I don't have any friends that support Trump I don't have any family members that support Trump because they look at\nWhat he has turned are very much I once had you know office that people look up to and it is scribe to be a part of an gun ... I don't even really want to pay attention to that any more\nOh so you think not only has he encouraged a a win at all costs philosophy which could be dangerous obviously just some people just sick and tired of politics because there's a ... a tweet that's a controversy every other day\nYeah I mean we knew the news cycle revolves around tweets now which also didn't happen before Donald Trump is president\n... we we would see our president's tweet occasionally about policy or you know some basketball game that you know someone who won or the NC double A. or whatever it is right it was never to the point where this was the form of communication with the American public\nAnd it has just changed\nI think the way that we manage all of this for the worse\nWe don't seem to ... in some ways we seem to be incapable being shocked shocked any longer when he gave the speech and Mississippi I think it was we're just totally mock Dr Ford eerie too\nYes very to that's right I mean mocked mercilessly\nAnd if you're already don't like drop you don't like it but if you do if you don't care like you can't go did you hear what he just said I Know you're like the guy but did you hear that they're they're impervious to write sort of realizing the guys as horrible as he is but then again I bus [laughter]\nOr or one more segment with Ariana ...

Wednesday Pompeo told reporters as he departed Riyadh that neither side would talk about the facts of the case before Saudi officials were able to complete a thorough investigation\nHe claimed that the country's leaders made no exceptions on who they would hold accountable right this is just another big fraud by the disgusting relying Trump administrator\nTrump is not that dumb he may be a buffoon and he may be mentally ill\nBut he's not a complete idiot he knows that the Saudis killed columnist ... he just doesn't care because he is a moral\nHe likes to attacked journalists it doesn't bother him at all that the Saudi Government authorized the killing\nOf a journalist who works for an American newspaper even if he isn't an American citizen\nHe it doesn't bother him in the slightest he will not lose a wink of sleep because er an evil dictator from an ally had a journalist killed\nIn fact maybe he thinks a journalist will think twice before criticizing him and that makes them happy [noise] a Huffington\nPost reporting the incident has put them in the trash pressure on the Trump Administration including from Republicans to take action President Trump on Monday floated the idea that road killers were involved\nOkay this is another a typical a\nPart of the pattern of the lying is politician and certainly the lying is president ever in the history\nOf the country\nCould

agencies didn't\nWhich I Know it could be some a foreigner bound side guy in his basement All right no it couldn't be because U.S intelligence agencies didn't have any intelligence that indicated it was China and nobody had any evidence indicating it was four hundred pound fat guy in his basement but U.S intelligence intelligence agencies had plenty\nOf intelligence that indicated it was the Russians\nNow rogue killers that's just from making stuff up that's him just just pulling stuff out of his posterior nobody knows anything about any role killers he's already trying to create a fake excuses\nWell real excuses but fake information\nAbout the killing because he doesn't care at all he cares and then he said the other day that he's never done any\nBusiness with the Saudis even Fox News fact check that they own an entire floor of Trump Tower they bought numerous condos from him how do I know because he has set it in the past publicly that Saudis have purchased condos from him he's had quite a\nBit of business to do with the Saudis and he said he doesn't because not only does he not care at all\nAbout a\nAn evil dictator killing an American journalist well I'm Sorry a journalist or Saudi journalist who works for an American newspaper\nHe wants to do business with everybody he'll do business with him and if he's nice to people while he's president whether he's thrown out in twenty twenty or God Forbid actually won a second term\nHe still may live long enough to be a businessman for a while and he wants that Saudi money he loves the Saudi money\nI'm so he cares much much much more about his personal wealth and doing good business deals in the future with people who are just as an ethical and horrible as he is and therefore would be glad to do business with him he cares much more about that then the killing of any journalist\nSo he's making stuff up there are no roads killers and ... says he's waiting for the Saudi investigation the Saudis are investigating themselves\nGee do you think they're going to find that they didn't do anything wrong when they're investigating themselves and they've already denied having anything to do it and what about this ridiculous Trump habit of saying he strongly denied it and he strongly denied it and he denied it strongly and that I can tell you believe me he strongly denied it believe\nMe and then I can tell you ... ...\n... as long as you're denial as forceful than you have to be telling the truth right when pollutant allegedly quote unquote strongly denied interference in the twenty sixteen

be diplomatic\nTo understand the importance of what's going on let me share with you a portion of an opinion piece from Bloomberg News\nIs now clear the Trump Administration will not be holding Saudi feet to the fire over the disappearance of the journalists ... instead it's looking to give them an off ramp a route to escape responsibility having waffle between promising severe punishment for any official a Saudi involvement and speculating about rogue killers\nWhich is right there that was highly irresponsible to speculate about real killers why because Trump has absolutely no idea what are there any real killers these pulling it out of his butt\n\nOr having leveled says the Bloomberg opinion piece between promising severe punishment and speculating about rogue killers President Trump finally revealed his own mind Tuesday when you compare the international pressure on Riyadh to allegations of sexual assault against judge Kavanaugh\nSince we know where Trump stood on Kevin uh it it's safe to assume he's decided before the conclusion of investigations in Riyadh and Istanbul that the Saudi authorities\nAre blameless\nAny hope that us secretary of state Mike Pompeo would play bad cop to the president's good cop during his visit to Riyadh was belied by ... grip and grim photo ops with king Solomon\n\nAnd the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman\nFollowed by a statement endorsing their serious commitment to determine all the facts and ensure accountability this says the opinion piece from Bloomberg flies in the face of Saudi\nAbout turns over the facts of the case you remember prince Mohammed initially claimed a good job he had left the consulate in Istanbul shortly before entering it a revised narrative from Riyadh is at the Washington Post columnist with the

I\nStill lived in Saudi Arabia\nAll right well that would actually makes some sense yeah that sounds logical thank you for that a bit of information and\nAnd the uh the for the Trump supporters are or you know whatever\nHow do you how do you handle the other side do regardless of which side you're on you know yeah\nWell I'm I'm actually very lucky uh my whole family of Republican\n... let me say side then as a fence\nYeah the only person that was ever a Democrat was my grandmother but she grew up with\nLike in Virginia and stuff like that old school Democrats which are like nothing compared to what they are today like if you actually like Google the history of the geo pay and the history of the Democratic\nParty it's completely like different and like that like he was\nYou know old school Democrat and old gold southern where she was like a little racist a little right into the\nCity and um [noise] ... but that that generation grew up she I mean he'd been keeping on like a like a eleven years\nBy so you say your family's all Republicans how 'bout you had any friends who are not\nI Do have some friends and they do pick on me um\nBut it sounds like you keep it simple I I Try to they know oh I see and and\nAnd I try to like if you actually look at the history of the Republican Party where the party that and I and these are the belief that I have like we were the party that freed the slaves we are the party that that was instrumental for women voting we were the party that had the\nFirst Latino governor the first party to have a woman as as a member of the salad and stuff like that and we were all through the first party\nYou have [noise] um\nThat were registered with them so I think Nineteen sixties or liking twenty something like that\nGreg I'm up against a break but you're right about all that which is ironic that it is now has turned to do with the party of Trump which to me is quite the opposite of all that but thank you so much for your call a news radio ten twenty kitty cat\nHere's something I didn't know you could be paying up to eighty percent less for your family's medications\nThat's because the exact same medicine you take doesn't cost the exact same everywhere you go find out how to get the best price at your local pharmacy used by going too good our ex dot com good or rex compares prices of every FDA approved drug in pharmacies here in Pittsburgh\nIn offers free downloadable coupons\nSo you get the best deals on all your medications you'll be surprised at how much the prices can differ even at pharmacies on the same block last\nYear good Iraq's saved Americans over two billion dollars on their medications imagine paying even less than your insurance co pay\nDo you have any friends at all who are uh well like ...\nOr my ah ...
