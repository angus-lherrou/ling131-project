mhm at him into therapy means that what what is being done is tweaking our own native immune system\nSo that our immune system recognizes that cancer cells as being bad cells and going after those and if you if you're a treat with radiation therapy or chemo or with surgeries there's a possibility that you're also damaging good tissue\nWith human or therapy if you can tweak it\nPrecisely enough so that goes after the cancer cells had nothing else so our own body is doing what the immune system should be doing\nGetting the immune system right now looks at a cancer cell and thinks well that's part of us so don't bother it\nThat's right so what we need to do is tweak that system so that it recognizes that has a bad cell and goes after it and doesn't go after any good so it and this could be used in what we call auto immune disease what happens in an auto immune disease is that our our immune system recognizes\nLet let's say like Crohn's disease and recognizes the cells in the small ball as foreign and starts going after it an causing inflammation scar tissue and so on and so if we can tweak it to recognize\nThe ball as okay cells [laughter] and not going after but at the same way with lupus multiple sclerosis rheumatoid arthritis those are all auto immune disease\nSo that that's a big deal if we can teach our immune system not to go after those cells and recognize them as non for\nIs there any potential negative side to going down this line\nWell yeah and that's why it's still experimental who we don't know what the long term results are\nGoing to be when we tweak the

system then begins to attack healthy cells well\nI guess that is a concern and that's why it's experimental so we find out whether or not those are some of the ...\nOkay you just mentioned a chronic

symptoms you know the symptoms in Crohn's disease are usually Billy Payne\nOf you you can you can get obstructed of first enough scar tissue and so on and and so it can be very very miserable and then die it doesn't seem to have a whole lot to do with symptoms of crumbs diseases NATO immune to it where our immune system is recognizing\nThose cells in a small ball as foreign so they go right or to attack it you know\n... one of the downsides of what what are the downsides of minimizing potential symptoms is there are are there any\nWell you would think that the symptoms are better that something is happening positively as far as they say ...\nWell my concern is is that if we mask symptoms aren't symptoms a sign of a problem and if you can ask them well enough is it possible that you won't be able to discern that things are getting worse potentially\nRight and and it might be that the kind of us oil is just acting like a\nLike an energy using taking care of the pain and it's not

I I guess the jury is still out on that but the ... let's talk to the expert here a doctor [noise] um [noise] ... what are the indications for using a mechanical ... versus the ...\nSo the main thing the difference between the mechanical valve and the tissue about than we have these conversations with patience is how long they last and what you need to do to take care of that though\nUm and so for patients that are younger we tend to favor mechanical vowels um because they can last forever you know the comedy out to that is that you have to be on a blood thinner for the rest of your life and you have to be on top of your blood though the levels of your blood\nUm but the tissue vowels\nThere is no blood thinner but the valves tend to wear out there there's no perfect ... that will last a lifetime but they are getting better so I have to say that even on some of ah the younger patients I talked to that you know are in their thirties but maybe in their fifties\nI Will sometimes discuss using a tissue vowels because they do last a bit longer and\nActually now than we were discussing about the trans Catherine vows now that we have those around were actually able to\nPut those vows through another tissue vowed that we've put in before um so that if a patient tissue Val didn't last maybe if it lasted Twenty years we'd have an opera another option without open heart surgery to replace that though again without\n\nThose pretty amazing does that answer your question bread\nIs a guy but another thing out\nA a a fifty six years old lacking in the early twenties he had cancer and he was treated with radiation\nAnd they said that what made you move out and go ... age fifty six and a I guess that's what the ... valve and go bad\nBecause that is not unusual correct\nYeah absolutely um radiation especially to the chest anywhere in the chest or you will particularly see over the years it the the buildup of calcium whether it's on the vows or inside the heart or around the back of the heart of all that can happen and they can progress pretty fast so we did and he had nations\nAnd ... and ... and test that's where they didn't radiation\nWell as fortunate that we have the ability to uh take care of some of those problems you know you you don't want to\nTreat cancer and caused so many difficulties but sometimes and today or some of the radiation techniques and so on for for Hodgkin's or more targeted to not such a wide area and so on but it anytime you go through a\nNormal tissues there certainly is a is a chance of having some problems was radiation\nSay doing great I Do have a little trouble getting a button or regulate into time than income time that they can they're kinda get not regulated now I mean about three weeks ago yeah\nOkay is he home now yeah stayed home ... good\nOkay well thanks so much for the call and good lawyer here saw no good\nAll right so\nIt's just kind of interesting I was over the reading it all again and I spent some time in Denver govern display there are in a remote McGovern conference center about\nSo I was over the reading it all again and I spent some time anthem McGovern\nDisplay there in a row govern conference center about\nYou know the sort of the advent of these mechanical valves and so it was really amazing\nThe research that has been done and how things have improved over the years and now they're just like your gentleman who are saying put it in Belgium through the ... is just absolutely amazing and the patients\nAre really the ... you know the ... research that they're they're really getting the benefit of the snow and usually it'll only in the hospital a day or two after this procedure when they used to be in a hospital for a week or ten days I think you first open heart surgery patients\nThat were done you know in in the world you know a\n... was considered a success if the pressure was able to be discharged multiple [laughter] who knows that it was the mortality was very very hard okay let's go to Mary Ann in Ross township [noise] Mary and you're on the air [noise]\nHi doctor if ah I have I can get through this All right it might have had in fact you already have a tear on it\nAnd it was the guy on ... and he was getting dark for eight hours that he didn't make it because they couldn't stop the bleeding and um they\nDid say was probably age related he'd be very healthy and had no symptoms\nOkay and she said you have a specific question Maria\nWas just wondering what they say about you know something like that happen suddenly like that what what usually is a mind and you have any sympathy for\nOkay Dr ... sometimes you see any of sudden symptoms yeah Mary and the first four sorry for your loss\nOf you know a number one that you mentioned terror in the ... most likely not to ... rather than in the wars that it says what to call the dissection and it actually cause may be leaking backward and causing leaking of they will take five\nA these are usually a present and people who have high blood pressure or or a family how or if you don't mind to ask you how old was your husband\nSeventy four so okay uh usually we usually we see\nThat and people who have high blood pressure they have a family history of a ... dissection or ... it means that station of the worst ah and usually they can go a symptomatic and uh the first sign actually as extreme chest pain and that ... or to\nUh unfortunately sometimes you know ah the mortality is extremely high with these especially if they don't uh get you know on time and even with the best surgical hands you know it it can be very much involved they have to repair the entire a war that they have to actually\nPut a decrease the profusion to the brain and the you know China the flow from the brain that and unfortunately the people can get a you know poor brain profusion during this procedure and can have a stroke or the details of the survey off your husband I'm not aware of\nUh but uh the mortality rate with a with a or ticket dissection surgery or is a is not like a simple heart surgery or a\nYou know or a ... or something like that or the Scots probably will it will be able to mention maybe how high isn't worth ... okay doctor\nStent or something like that to discuss it probably wouldn't be able to mention maybe how hot it was the most that it's even okay Dr a no brainer ...\nJust expand a little bit more on this is a is actually a surgical moment of emergency right right when that happens when you have a section of the order yeah so\nThey set up here in the bank and stuff from starting with Iran from pain in his chest and our job a lot of rushed him right away and we got there they had already had him on a ventilator\nOkay yeah I\nHave not I don't have that and he never had high blood pressure\nRight um so of all of our heart surgeries that we do this is probably the one that we haven't you know it's it's it's a very difficult surgery the outcomes are not as good as they are with all her other surgeries I mean are most most of the surgeries that we do\nThat are planned an elective we anticipate and no higher than a one to two percent mortality risk of dying however with dissections they are only actually true emergency to be honest I'm for the most part but ah and that's because the risk\nOf dying from that surgery is so high in terms of surgery is probably somewhere from ten to twenty percent in a healthy individual\nYeah that's exactly what they said everything you said about the blading and and ... higher risk and they fall by everything ratcheting back way\nI Will say that you know high blood pressure is probably the most common thing we see and we often have patients coming that say they don't have a history of high blood pressure they don't know about it but maybe they did and it was an diagnose but that said there are a lot of other reasons that this happens well\nOK well Maria and again we're very sorry about your husband ... thanks so much for the call we appreciate it okay thank you are right now does this medical printers were talking about heart valve disease tonight with Dr Hough Brunner and also Dr ...\nAnd so if you have a question give us a call at eight six six three nine one ten twenty we'll be back [noise]\nIf you don't dispose of the early ... prescription drugs in your home they might think when you're when they

twenty seven and ten am to ... to find a collection from the ... term ... take on broad term\nWendy what a spot that burglar when he's case in your home or after he said asked John who's blink camera alerted him a burglar tried to break in while he and his family were home or Shannon who's blink camera caught a thief stealing packages both times blink video clips were sent to police to help convict the crooks\nFor a for ... ah it's mostly ... about their noses or we don't have yet to a way to repair the er Nikki ... dress with a trance catheter or you know with a ...\nExcept for ah if they have a previously a ... a\n... percent it means they have a tissue ... if they have additional work vibe that sneaking ordinary down we can't put the vibe inside the order of five and repair the leak or the narrowing of the worst vice\nIf this is a previously a you know if they have a previous tissue Vyvanse\nOkay Dr ... or what about uh the surgical approach to a much ... problem of where you actually hoping to Charleston Open the heart and replaced so the the ... of of or you're still doing a lot of votes\nYeah they\nDo quite a bit of them again they they becoming a lot of variety like Patrick Wilson in ... we see mostly to noses um for my children as we see mostly ... PLUS Loan backwards as opposed to can't afford\n'em an occasion we do see my interest in doses and sometimes it's related to rheumatic heart disease I'm\nIn those cases typically with my choice to notice the only treatment as surgical valve replacement um there are some minimal invasive corrections that we can do um they work okay they're pretty good but they don't sometimes they're not long lasting says sometimes so a lot of patients do wind up with a replacement\nTheir actions that we can do um they work okay they're pretty good but they don't sometimes they're not long lasting says sometimes do a lot of patients do wind up with a replacement a with a regurgitate nation the leaking backwards and ... the valve or the mitral valve\nUm most of the time if it depending on what it is if it's a degenerative disease meaning it just like that who have said pro lap singing about we can also often just repair that valve and you don't have to get the valve replaced which is favorable because that's your own tissue at your own house and it lasts your whole life for the most part but they're they're\nOkay how about the truck ... do you ever have to replace the truck ...\nWe do um it's not that often that we see it and then oh and even sometimes when we see a leaky try custard valve it's usually not a problem as far as it doesn't really affect the patient but oftentimes we\nWe do see it and uh most of the time it's it's for a parable meaning we just the valve itself has stretched out and we just need to tighten it back down so we put a little band around it to kind of tight knit down\nOn some occasions we do replace it if the vows destroyed or if there's a lot of infection or something and the only option is to replace that\nThough okay and so any other ... and the hard to to get problems\nThe ... from on again it can be a stand I'll take it can be narrowed down or leaky are using the this is in younger patients will have a contract and heart disease and\nThe a mainstay off actually a treatment for advice then or says is a\nA size of the ... but uh now we can put also at ... ... what you got in diplomatic position so we actually\nUse the actual at a or think about that you have a made for the you know but you put it in diplomatic a position of most of these patients out a younger they have a ... or ... or they have you know or\nThey have other callers that to heart disease but yes there are transcripts of options for ...\nAnd it's really amazing what what has been done [laughter] you know on both of you your your your own but um but some of those things you're doing today you really didn't see in your fellowship with so [laughter]\nYeah most of the stuff we actually trained and learned as we went in our practices and we had to go through special training programs and like everybody else because they feel is fairly young I mean this is was talking about than a decade of technology only\nKnow okay well we're ... we're talking about the
