Republican political analyst Heather welcome to the program\nHappy to be with you John because you're my friend and I appreciate you and I love you\nWill back at ya I'm and You're welcome to join in on the loved us do they take six three and I won ten twenty\nAnd you know if it was it this president it if it wasn't if it was just a president I'm\nPresident should come to a scene of mass tragedy\nBut I think you should work with the local political leaders and they can all make a decision about what's the one of the best time to come home when when everybody tells you don't come yet and then he shows up anyway to me that's Donald Trump just being eleven years old again you say don't do it I'm doing it\nWell I'll tell you specifically folks from my office left at four thirty yesterday people who take a bus and they couldn't get on the bus till seven o'clock\nBecause everything was shut down so there was an an enormous amount of people working people who take a bus who couldn't get anywhere yesterday for three hours they couldn't pick up their kids from daycare they couldn't pick up their kids were sporting events so to come in at four o'clock\nIn it in a town in which is already streets are shut down in squirrel hill I'm it it it really ... through a monkey wrench in the transportation\nI was just reading in the Washington Post again before he went on tens of thousands of people signed a petition please don't come at least not right a lot of it was like fifty thousand okay that's tens of thousands yeah five tens yeah I'm\nThe political leaders ask you to weigh too if they don't say don't come you know so and so they say just because we got to bury the dead as the mayor kept saying um\nAnd he just can't help themselves that's like ... and as you also know he invited postseason Schumer didn't want to go invited McConnell and um [noise] speaker of the house Paul Ryan I don't know if he didn't want to come I shouldn't say that I'm presuming that but they didn't they didn't come back and uh\nThe pet to me to come and I who wants a photo op with a guy pretending to have empathy who is has the least empathy in the history of empathy and humanity\nWell you know in the Jewish faith and I'm not Jewish I'm Catholic but as I understand\nSo to kind of force a presidential visit was shutting down the parkway and all of the extra law enforcement with the law enforcement that needed to be there to make sure that the funerals were safe\nAnd with all the protesters that were there and all the people that just wanted to be near the tree of life synagogue while the funerals are taking place on the outside of the sidewalk and it really press the system and I think that's what I think\nThat's what mayor producer was trying to say\nOf course it was exactly what he was not only trying to say but said and the president doesn't listen\nAnd the other thing that I thought you know I I I should have taken some time before I came here tonight to look it up but\nI I I Believe very strongly that there are many occasions and my six years on the earth in which a president has expressed a desire to attend something or go somewhere and a message has been sent through back channels or otherwise\nIt's not a good time you're not kind of welcome here just for political reasons and usually there's an excuse made something came up you know the president has other duties so they don't want to be embarrassed you know they don't they don't want to acknowledge that they've been unwelcome and I'm so maybe\nYou know I just kept thinking that maybe the president could have said I on behalf of the American people not myself on behalf of the American people I Want to honor the dead and I want to condemn what has happened and I would like to come to your city\nI fully understand that the mayor is indicating that if there's too much law enforcement pressure right now and so I Would like to extend my visited other week and I just I just wonder if that wouldn't have been magnanimous sure it\nWould have been one of the opposite of Donald Trump which has magnanimous um it just it stuns me this is a guy who cannot take a hint\nYou know the caller's kept saying I'm Katie ... he's our president mayor ... should have have recognized him\nYes he's our president\nYou know we have to respect the office of the presidency we have to respect our fellow citizens who voted him in and I do respect that but at the same time I have a First Amendment rights my fellow citizens have a First Amendment rights and then there's the matter of practicality\nSo I think everything could now as it turned out\nIt it it didn't you know nothing happens thank goodness but it just I think his presence impinged\nOn all of the grieving people who really feel that there's a connection between his rhetoric\nAnd the Davis isn't is in America I'm On so many fronts immigration\nAnd and and minority groups um and he has in his past said very anti Semitic things even though he has um a Jewish son in law and a Jewish daughter um I just feel like in this time when so many people were grieving and were reeling\nFrom a gunman coming into another place of worship\nThat he could have ... he could have\nMade people feel better about him and what he needed to do if he had waited\nYou know the shooter bought ours was talking about people invading the United states and he wants to kill all the Jews as everyone has heard 'em and while in a social networking Bowers said he didn't like the president because he thought the president was a national is he's a global is I have no idea I reached that conclusion\nUm and while in his social networking Bowers said he didn't like the president because he thought the president was a national is he's a global list I have no idea how he reached that conclusion especially when Mr Trump says admits that he's a nationalist\nUm but there are those who believe that the president's divisive rhetoric helps\nCreate an atmosphere in which people like this are in Boulder number one number two Trump keeps talking about the caravan is an invasion apparently any social networking Bowers talked about an invasion so it's not hard for me to put two and two together and believe that minimum the guy at least may have\nBeen involved in 'em by the paranoia that is stoked by ah people like President Trump who use that to ... [noise] you know\nI don't get me wrong obviously you can't blame him directly if he wasn't in the room with a gun\nYeah I get I get nervous about the cause it to the fact because clearly no amount of rhetoric\nWhatever cause anyone to do that or force you to [noise] yeah right but your point that candidate send you know obviously crazy people over the edge right if you say for sure\nIf you think maybe we're being invaded and the president says we're being invaded especially when it's alive because we're not been I don't even\nHave to get that far yeah I don't even have to get that the rhetoric is going to cause crazy people to be crazier\n... we ... the rhetoric is wrong in its own right\nWhether it causes anyone to do anything bad or not it's it's not what the president should be doing\nWell especially wasn't out now live the caravan from everything I've read consists of a bunch of people many of whom are refugees you need to get out of dodge because they're\nBeing a discriminated against it home you know the other is the president says there might be middle Easterners or criminals among them zero evidence not that any group of people can have bad people among them obviously they can go ahead I interrupted\nYou know I was going to interrupt you um you know I was reminded today and I don't know why this popped into my head because we've talked about it a million times but it just I think it's worth it to say it again you know when the Irish came over they were just ... filed\nThey were hated they were discriminated against they were dumb they were lazy they were vial\nAnd you know the Irish or loved so why are we demonizing\nYes and then from what I've read a when you tell in started coming over the Irish were mean to them yeah and then the Italians I forget who they were made to but whatever the next big wave of immigrants was yeah why\nDo we have to be me and why do we have to hate people that we can have rules\nAbout who can come in the country and who can't and we needed a safe clearly everybody doesn't get to come in right yeah just like every other country in the ... right but to demonize people to demonize\nMe after he he's doing it because he spoke paranoia which is effective in getting his base to turn out to vote apparently\nApparently works well for them I Believe that he is very cognizant of what gets his group a sure energized\nOr no question about uh eight six six three and I won ten twenty\nI Know I'm going to take a break soon but I'm not sure what time I'm going to take a break because I see no time on the screen\nAs to when I should take a break that some inside baseball fascinating commentary uh from John McEntire in John McEnroe show the aptly named and very cleverly thought of name for the show John back their show oh look\nIt's we're twenty seconds away from taking a break so a happy Halloween everyone amid this horrible tragic circumstance I got twenty seconds how they're doing any Halloween stuff\nNow but it'll ... is it raining out so I feel bad for the kids yes doesn't that Iowa as ...\nTwenty seconds how they're doing any Halloween you know but if it's raining out so I feel bad for the kids yes does not ...

occurred\nAnd\nHe he didn't have any problem with people saying Walker up or CNN sucks I mean and these are the people that say Democrats or political\nIt just it just amazes me that how a all is one

mark and Cleveland Highmark\nHello hey whatever we thought of Trump or coming yesterday or there was no doubt that are running up until the up a package the package bombs in the shooting lived there was it was him are pushing a narrative\nOr that somehow the a Soros uh was behind um this caravan are coming to the border um you know the ... one of the reasons why a tree of life was\nA target it was it's a I think housing or or relationship with a Jewish are refugee organization which is now or one of the handlers of a refugees um and of all our religious persuasion\nBut today and fortunately or the president or when asked me one day after whether he thinks the George Soros is funding this caravan that for all of this stuff\nHe says he wouldn't be surprised if Soros says now my question or to have there is you know why isn't the case with this type of rhetoric this time but truly purposes not responsible\nOr directly responsible at least ... why is it the case that no person and your party who I otherwise considered decent\nBefore Trump's coming back office\nA regardless of ideological sides has the courage to go up to the president\nUsed the bike of the Senate usually make it harder to say Mr President this rhetoric this debasement of a public discourse must stop in the name of human decency and the faculty does it\nA lick lick food is the second question how could you in good conscience stay as their Republican and this type of party George\nMark thank you so much for your call uh I Would like to end when word in defense of Heather she's one of the few Republicans I Know he's had the courage to speak publicly numerous times about her displeasure with the president and I'll give you my answer and then I'll let her see whenever she wants\nA everybody values in political life not everybody but most everybody can devalue their political life position more than they do calling out the president and the president's base as powerful and they want to be reelected uh but uh go ahead Henry was asking you the question well\nSo you know I I think you know mark made one factual error you said no one in the party and I think that's that's true I think Jeff Flake the sender from Arizona has has been very critical I'm John McCain before he passed\nAnd I think that's that's true I think Jeff Flake the senator from Arizona has has been very critical I'm John McCain before he passed I'm a Paul Ryan today was critical the president in terms of the uh\nCitizenship yeah I usually do you you can't over during the fourteenth amendment was an executive order right\nRight um the center for a Tennessee Senator Corker I'm as a pet to me has been critical of the president on occasion I'm so it's not true that no Republicans have I certainly would say that I Wish more\nAh would stand up and and say I\nI I Hope I always say this to parents that ugly I Hope when a someone from your party mark\nOr does something that is shameful that you will have the courage to to stand up because I I think that we do get aren't tribes and we won't criticize her own tribe I certainly have and uh and you know I I I'm happy to have the consequences from it I'm being a being kind of out of the circle now\nAre we won't be invited to the White House anytime soon I should\nKnow and lots of other consequences but\nI'm ... you know I I I cannot anymore I I I Am who I Am I\nI I view the world as a conservative I don't want my liberal democratic friends to be conservative I Want them to understand my position I Want to argue my position sometimes I've changed hearts and minds\nSometimes my democratic friends have change my heart and mind on a political issue I think the country is better served when we have two political parties or maybe we should have more and we argue positions and we come to a compromise\nI don't think it would be good if we had one party rule we have one party rule in Allegheny county and it is not good because there's too much uh infringement of power with a one party rule system I I Know that there's a Republicans who think everybody who's a Democrat is wrong and there certainly are Democrats who think\nEverything or

I'm trying to get through it okay what I'm trying to get ... on a so this would object let's pose just suppose we took an arena we put all the dogs are all different types of dogs are I mean I was in the world at that\nLevel that we built it would put all the cat's little cats so why isn't fires you know we keep guard\nWhich was survive will be ... one of the you know I Hope you understand what I'm saying if you turn of the cats were slumber cats are going to kill each other with Joe ... which was\nUnderstand what I'm saying if you're tired of the cats were from a cats are going to kill each other with Joe ... you know what you want to survive the liberal preserver blood\nDogs will do the same thing on their own little Chihuahua garde not by a German Shepherd so this is what I'm saying this this was our people around that's real world there are no ... I Hope you understand me\nJerry thank you very much appreciate your call here's rich in squirrel hill I rich\nHey John thanks for taking the call 'em what a hit you with a coat the subject by may or you know on the on the heels of 'em they changed the whole tragedy could my neighborhood\nAnd I'm like what the worst religious massacres our nation's history is that\nCorrect that's ... that's what it's been reported so I Believe that to be true yes\nOkay opportunity last on the world stage and when I say opportunity I mean it was an opportunity on both sides to maybe possibly bring ... all one step closer together and here's what I mean opportunity last by mayor ... do do\nExecutive Fitzgerald and our other representatives opportunity last by President Trump somehow ...\nBut we only had ... let me interrupt you the elected leaders said the Trump is the welcome just wait a few days and Trump bowling a China shop is way in hell when he wanted to anyway how is that the fault well Pluto or a pitcher object\nOut only answered obviously the president to run a very tight schedule that\nPresident Obama was in Sandy Hook less than forty eight hours after\nThat law was in ... they didn't tell them not to come he's the president right now than I did it but if they had told them not to come he wouldn't have in fact there was some tragedy I Believe\nJohn if you are on it or if you look at President Obama's trip which I'm Glad when and if you look at President Obama's trip into Sandy Hook he went in a long\nYou want in a loan to meet with families and I gave them all the credit in the world I did not vote for the gentleman I get them all the credit in or did the right thing for me he's my president he did the right thing much the same way President Trump yesterday course there is one president\nTrump made a mistake and this was probably pie in the sky wouldn't have been something that President Trump landed yesterday in aboard air force one was bill and Hillary Clinton aboard Airforce one was President Obama and Michelle the bushes\nYou boy I I don't think he invited any of them you know that's why I said wrong you're not listening I Am because frankly\nWith all due respect what you want side\nI'm trying to strike a balance here it he missed an opportunity he didn't invite and you're exactly right that's why being critical see I'm looking at this from both sides\nAnd that's what we need to do in my humble opinion that's what we need to do moving forward because this isn't going to ask you about the same age this is not going to end\nIf we continually kill me and everybody else if we can you choose sides here and pick apart the other side was opportunity last a local level and on a national level at all in all opportunity to to send the wall the message a very powerful message\nHere is is enough we have finally hit the ceiling is Suzie knocks\nAnd again I Do believe that as much as we lost an opportunity here at the local level with our elected leaders we lost at the same opportunity on a national level with our elected president again it it\nIt is playing a sky but I don't know I just think that there was that was a there was a better way to go about sports I'm blown up president came on I Would have been just just as happy if if the President Clinton to come in when needed this we needed this community\nI let me see what you're saying the most people from what I've read didn't want him to come in and they're\nAnd then leave that we need this community\nI learned is that what you're saying that most people from what I've read didn't want them to come in and there are no way that he came in so what do you who's the we needed this\nWon't John let's begin let's begin with let's begin with a synagogue leaders shelf\nWho said he wrote welcome him who said he would welcome him as he came not please come and please come today he just sitting holding but\nWe're we're going to pick apart from\nEverybody else was the monster demonstrably outspoken inner desire to not have them write so as soon as one long route I I'm going to play every bit as much on his desire to have the president in as you said they regard have\nNo no I mean he's sincere and I admired him for doing that in the face of a lot of U.S Open you know the other side but I just made I still don't remember him saying please come today he just said if the president wants to come I Will welcome them and good for him\nA rich like how much recall I get your point look\nThe only reason I'm to one side it is I Believe currently the other side is impossible to deal with do you know that Bill Clinton and Newt Gingrich actually worked on some programs uh from what I've read\nWhile the Clinton impeachment was underway because they still wanted to get some policy stuff done and they're also practical if if it's a good for America and if it sounds good or whatever it is they were conspiring to produce then they both went politically as well um\nI got to be one sided 'cause Donald Trump is the most dangerous president hit to the country he's the most dangerous demagogue in the history of the country he is a moral he has no empathy he has no common sense he selfish she's immature he is utterly ridiculous\nOr what you even suggest that the Obamas in the bushes and all those people oh they might have been able to arrange that well how would they have had a the time to arrange that they could have waited a week like put Mr potato and Mr um Fitzgerald ask him to do and then maybe the logistics about all that could have worked out\nUm\nWe needed it I think it's the last thing we needed we were grieving\nAnd we're still as ah the mayor pointed out a bearing the bodies more services today they don't get me wrong if it was good for you that it was good for you God Bless you that's fine I mean\nUm but there you're saying we miss an opportunity there can be no opportunity when the most divisive hateful president who's rhetoric encourages an atmosphere which allows but it's kind of thing to be encouraged is in office if we're going to start the new thing where it's pie and this guy 'cause we all want pie in the sky even if we think it's impossible\nHow are you John thanks for taking my call her a\nFirst off my heart goes out to the folks in school the Pittsburgh community for this tragic event that happened mhm I'm obviously um it's a it's a huge one ...\n... when I was driving home you said you had recorded on the space shuttle recorded on some major events and obviously this is right up there\nBut I'm kind of want to voice an opinion on on overall leadership and government uh regardless of what a sit on a um it goes both directions and as people are as taxpayers\nI'm forcing nothing getting done nothing and you take an event like this that occurs and\nNot only a you know the neighborhood of the county executive or the county or the other states writing his name but right down the street and now we're nit picking on when the president should er about I have a question if the president would have held off for a week do you honestly think that that put it on and Fitzgerald have showed up yes\nBecause bill said that he would in a week and therefore he would've because he had a I think he's a person who's word to be he started will look bad if you didn't once he said hey wait\nA week would have made a difference right I Do go to he didn't go to when when the penguins on they wouldn't go to the White House we we are clear to that point now\nWhere we can't go to to celebrate a victory and obviously I'm this is you know this is this is devastating and we still have to draw a line here it's ridiculous it's ridiculous\nOK thanks for your call it's not ridiculous\nThe great majority of the people of squirrel hill didn't want him to come what is it about that that people can understand who wanted him to come pretty much nobody\nWho asked him to come that day I'm pretty much nobody won rabbi said if he came he'd welcome him in the spirit of Brotherhood and God Bless that rabbi\nBut who was who like\nCalled the White House said please come today answer no\nBut and God Bless that rabbi but who was who like called the White House said please come\nToday answer ... body they're burying the dead they're grieving he is a a polarizing figure who is convincing nut bags like the shooter that we're being invaded\nThe shooter said on social networking that he was worried about an invasion he didn't like the Jewish organization helping refugees to be settled somewhere possibly even the United states an invasion of refugees\nSo Trump and other demagogue stir up bags like this and the next thing you know they're in a synagogue within AK forty seven and three blocks it it's\nA false equivalency to keep break blaming both sides and here's why because Trump is worse than everybody\nTrump is worse than the worst Democrat Trump is worse than the worst Republican if John Case it was in there a Republican who I find tolerable even though I'm not crazy about him the world would be a much more St place if Marco Rubio had been in there if Jeb Bush and I didn't want another Bush just like you didn't want more Clinton's or some of you\nAre but I Would take a Hillary Clinton or Jeb Bush I Would take anybody else who ran on either party\nBut but we were duped by this this incredibly\nClever con man\nWho is a fake populist who was really interested in not in anybody else\nBy himself self aggrandizement the money he's already making violating the constitutional law Molly humans clause the money he's going to make because former presidents the United states they already do quite well but they don't have multi million dollar businesses or the potential to have multi million dollar businesses\nA Trump is really gonna cashing or once it gets out which is fine you know we're a capitalist society doesn't bother me that anybody the Clintons the bushes or anybody has given speeches for boatloads of money after they leave I feel like if somebody's got the money and they want to pay it I don't care\nI'm\nDonald Trump is a uniquely divisive polarizing dangerous demagogue unlike anything we've ever seen in this country and that's why I Believe that is a false equivalency when you say well you know the other side that it to you know the data and a Fitzgerald I should just welcome to Maine right then\nI mean the thousands of people tens of thousands of people signed a petition saying please don't come who crashes a funeral who who does that and insensitive bowling a China shop eleven year old\nWho needs to get his way and do what he wants to do even if very few if any people in the town want him there at least on that it's ... it's beyond selfish\n... I don't know\nPeople say I'm One sided I'm I Am I'm trying to sound the alarm to any of you who are independence or who might be a light bulb may have gone off in your head that even though you didn't like Hillary this is a disaster\nBecause I'd like to avoid these kinds of disasters in the future and I'm Talking to who was ever listening on the worldwide Internet as everybody else who works at the radio station but I'm also talking to the people of western Pennsylvania unfortunately from my point of view play they distinct unique and decisive role in putting this mad man\nOr in the White House [noise]\nAh it took six three and I won ten twenty if you'd like to comment or you can go to Katie can radio dot com click on that Alabama gets an access a somebody's on hold and we'll get to them on the other side do video ten twenty ...\nReach us out on ... radio marijuana and its\nHold and we'll get to them on the other side do radio ten twenty ... to get\nRid of some of the time and you don't want you to get radio marijuana and issues of Joe to steal their story or a couple of real concerns rather article marijuana programming Pennsylvania in the car ... radio\nGigi B.
