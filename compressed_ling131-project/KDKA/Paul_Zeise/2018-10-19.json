the program but thanks for having me John\nUm [noise] so how big the blue wave at first I thought oh it's going to be giants huge and then it's cabin I happen to this and now there's enthusiasm on the other side yeah ...\nThe idea of a blue wave has definitely fizzled only a little bit I mean the Democrats are still going to make huge gains in the house um they're not quite going to get there with the Senate but I mean you're right with the Kavanaugh's confirmation you see a big enthusiasm gap bomb for Republicans\nA candidate seem very excited over this issue you know President Trump is accomplishing his agenda putting justice on the court the economy's going well and\nUh you know you're seeing that but I mean the Democrats I you know from from all analysis we see Doree that are still going to take the house\n[noise] yeah but probably not the Senate although I'm not counting any chickens for sure just because it seems like it's such a crazy time it's more difficult to predict than it used to be or I'm not as certain when the pundits pontificate as I used to be that they're right\nI think it's definitely the candidates I think it's that Scott Wagner and Lou Barletta haven't exactly gotten the support that they probably wanted I mean even with Lou Barletta he's been with Trump so many times Trump's come out with him to fundraising campaign and national Republicans still don't seem to care about the race\nOr but I guess they're just looking at the polls like everybody else shore yeah and there's so many places were Republicans are playing right now across the country that why would you play here\nA while so it's got ... a bit of a bizarre guy what's new Barletta like I guess I really haven't seen that many ah ads are I mean I've seen a bunch of political ads of all stripes but I haven't if I've seen that many ... Barletta as it's not coming to mind\nIt's been a very quiet race and the way that you know in twenty sixteen you add to me and McGinty and they spend twenty billion dollars I mean like a lot of money that was a brawl see I was an all out brawl and this I mean the outside spending has been so tame that you're not seen many ads on the waves and\nI mean Lou Barletta I was just on his campaign bus yesterday talking with him because he was in town he's\nTraveled a lot he's done a lot of stuff ah especially in the county surrounding Pittsburgh and surrounding Philadelphia I mean that's his territory um but he is a very level headed well spoken candidate\nWho I think just didn't get the support and didn't get the timing in this race that that he needed and there was a lot of excitement at the beginning with him because I mean he's a famous ... I mean when he was in hazel town as the hazel ten is the mayor he\nWas nationally known for standing up against illegal immigration at the time this was in the mid to thousands and it just that name recognition got him further than he probably ever would have gotten and now national Republicans aren't stepping up to the plate\n... again I guess I assume they're just looking at the polls but um and it would also uh\nInterests me is that in this age of larger than life candidates or at least\nAgain I guess I assume they're just looking at the polls but um and it would also uh interests me is that in this age of larger than life candidates or at least the president or just you know\n... you know Bob casey neither Bob casey or a governor welfare exactly charismatic dynamo is\nOr what I guess neither their opponents for that matter so yeah um chose their opponents well\nRight and and Bob casey I mean the whole thing that blue Barletta has been saying about him on the trail is that Bob casey is the leader of the progressive socialist Democratic Party because he voted to or he was going to vote to oppose Kavanaugh regardless of the nominee that Trump chose\nBartlett is trying to paint Casey as this extremely far left you know abolish ice universal healthcare candidate and\nAnybody looks at case he's record doesn't think that but hasn't\nCasey issued a few statements in recent times at at least looked a little more left the than the Bob casey I remember from awhile ago\nOh sure and that's actually you almost said something that Barletta says every single time he stepped on the stump and it's it's that I don't remember this Bob casey I mean there's Bob casey seems to be different and his voting record hasn't exactly shown it much but I mean you're right about ... ... yeah his\nVoting record may be more moderate but his tone is become a little left ear\nFor sure and he's been one of the most vocal critics of the president he has been one of the right yeah I mean he there was a time there for two months where you couldn't go a day without a viral Bob casey tweet just ripping the president and this was before it was even before was popular in the Senate for Democrats to walk that line so yeah I mean in that sense live our lives right\nUh yeah he is right but in that but it seems to be working for Casey I I just\nWonder how he came about that a decision you know what we ought to issue more left these statements bashing the president and clearly as well as the polling\nBut yeah it's interesting because I mean the president one here in twenty six to ... he's facing reelection against a a ... a candidate who is you know on the far right of immigration is a hard liner you would expect that case he would want to go as far to the middle or even a little bit conservative in this race\nBut no he's definitely you know move in a direction\n[noise] how much do come in contact with uh my first hour I was asking people and we got a couple of calls what are you going to do during the holidays\nOr if you're a Trump supporter and you have friends and the other side or if you're a Trump paid her friends and the other side or the place you work or uh any social situation that you might encounter you're going to confront um you're going to be mean you're just going to be diplomatic\nA and a few calls I did get indicated that uh the obvious\nWhich is the tensions are still really really high the one guy said hey you know what Kevin uh I mean I was already a Trump guy but now I'm ready to uh take the pitchforks and uh get the torches and you know burn the other side because that fire me up all over again\nIt's a it's more and more divisive every day if you just look on the airwaves and look at the campaign ads that both sides are running they both want to label each other as an angry mob and as soon as that word comes out which has been like legitimate verbatim angry mob\nOf course you're going to go to your family dinner and just eyeball your uncle and you know start a political conversation which by the way my family does too and I have to stay out of it because I'm a you know I'm a reporter and I say that but\nWith ... ... if assuming you have biases just because we all do or don't they already know you pretty well on where you might\nBe coming from you'd be surprised John I don't I don't and I I'm really happy\nAbout that I've worked very hard to do that line just thinking some day I might be a political reporter I always work out [laughter]\nYeah very good very precedent\nOf you um well do you have people on both sides in the ...\nYeah very good very precedent\nOf you um well do you have people on both sides in the family\nOh yeah yeah certain guy and in both\nThe far side I mean ... are about as conservative as you can get and they're probably listening to this right now I Hope ... um and and they they would very gladly admit that but of course I I also have some some Obama voters in my family too and they get into it and I have to I have to step aside\n[noise] uh now do the conservative was accused of being fake news Julian\nYeah they do and they they say that about the Pittsburgh Post Gazette either they will call it a a liberal rag I get that a lot still have handed\nOut that the that the people now in terms of the editorial page happen to be conservative\nI've tried to point that out just factually and right you know it doesn't it doesn't come through because I mean the fake news attack is something that the president is still rolling out and it's still a part of our daily conversation and I you know I don't think that's going to go away and by the way joking aside it's it's an extremely dangerous\nYeah I was just going to a a Trump is exceeded in truly damaging the credibility of the fourth estate period\nYeah he he really hasn't I went to the rally up an eerie the other day and I fell on me that I was ... it was one of the most uh you know insane rallies you could ever imagine and that's every single Trump rally there it's packed people are there at two in the morning waiting to see this guy they\nWas true because I didn't know how many people were waiting as long as Trump\nA hundred percent true and and at this rally an eerie there were so many people waiting that they actually put like a big screen outside sort of like they do with the penguins games yeah yeah\nAnd gather people around and the energy in that room he is the greatest campaigner that I think anybody has ever seen no matter if you like the guy you don't like the guy he's been able to to have\nThat in on that and that's pretty incredible\nIs is one of the rallies where he was mocking uh Christine afford\nNo I Know that that was middle rally right before okay this one this one though is the first time that he uh publicly accused Hillary Clinton of directly colluding with the Russian so that was a little bit of history that we got up and Uri\nHe's I don't know if he's brilliant other than that but I'll just finish with a brilliant projecting I always feel like whatever he's doing he points the finger at the other guy it says that they're doing it as a matter lazy yeah yeah it is it's a masterpiece\nOf politicking that I don't think anybody's ever seen before\nAnd I I sit here or once ... while I'm On two nights a week and railing against Trump blah blah blah so I really hate when he makes me laugh like I think Pocahontas was ridiculous when it caused Elizabeth Warren that but just as a disparaging nickname it's kind of funny at least in my head I'm not asking you that if you think\nIt's funny I'll just add you know the leap and Bob casey a you know he's he's had nicknames for people around here I forget what the one with Conor Lamb was this week but if you get a nickname he becomes in this like distinguish bunch and but the at the same time with the Pocahontas stuff\nIt's galvanizing voters and it at the same time as he thinks it's helping him you're seen a lot of people you know get turned off by it\nNo absolutely right it helps his base in rages and in flames his haters yeah\nNo question of Susie in Ohio if you could do me a favor and hang on because I've only got thirty seconds to the break and or I Want you to have more than thirty seconds I'm but you're enjoying yourself in this in twenty seconds we have many before

now and what they want from the future I mean you definitely have like younger people who are you know trying to take up\nA you know the the throne here but you know Joe Biden is still like in the lead guy he's polling even right now yeah and I think it's just because he's been so vocal about Trump and people really appreciate any bit of ... Obama and establish that they can get especially in the Democratic party but\nHow about her comments on voter apathy\nOh that's that's really interesting to me\nIn a fire up a situation where both bases there hairs on fire there's still plenty of people who don't give a damn or like she said just thinking you know just the system doesn't work for me I I'm I'm Out\nThere you know what I Would say to that and this is going to be so idealistic but if you look here in the in the Pittsburgh area John fed Herman back in the day one by one vote and that put him on\nA track to potentially being lieutenant governor having a political future that some say could lead them to being governor for or you know US Senate ... sure um I think that the stat that I heard recently and this may or may not be true and you might be able to back me up is that\nHillary Clinton would have won if Thirteen more people per precinct came out in Pennsylvania which could have changed the whole election\nI didn't I haven't heard that like micro statistic but it wouldn't surprise me\nAnd that and I know if that is your vote matters to that extent where\nThat's what we can only Seventy thousand votes or something like that among three states yeah definitely terms\nThat are often show that day and it's a different the country is different and it that it matters and there's there's a lot of times in election for crying out loud exactly and you see this over and over again and yeah it might seem intimidating and and it might see the odds are against you to making a difference in the political system but uh you got to do it and people are very excited this time around\nOn the dollar bank it's an excess Howard and green trees says rothfus has never been a good candidate the only reason he

sensible district his shortcomings are manifest says Howard of green tree\nI'd be interested to know what what shortcomings Howard thanks congressman rock this has happened\nIs I've only done one interview with him he just seemed really boring but not dumb or you know what I mean seem to know is stuff well or habits talking points down like you could spin 'em out\nHe's a very good politician and is that right see I don't even know you you what you said about him is very true and that he sticks to his guns and he sticks to exactly what he wants to say and the messaging for him has been on points the economy is the way he's thrown you know his whole entire chances on\nYou know if you feel like the economy is benefiting you better than it did before vote for me and that's I mean it's great messaging or for people in in the district but again we already talked about how you know the perfect storm against him but I'd be interested in knowing what what people think are the\nThe um the the shortcomings of Ross as a candidate\nAnd she also mentioned\nWhere the jobs I I hear both sides I hear the economy is ... ... when I complained about Trump people called ... what's wrong with you the economy is fantastic but other people like the caller from Ohio will say like gather part time jobs they're low wage jobs you can't live ... that's why according to her middle class families are going to the food bank\nDo you hear much chatter about that as you cover these various candidate we've\nDone a lot of reporting on this and Republicans\nOn November six are going to succeed if people believe all over the place that these economic benefits are coming down to them and there's not a lot of research that shows that that is true a lot of the research that's out there shows that this a while adding a lot to the deficit\nHas benefited people who are wealthy and I'm not sure if that was intentional that's not for me to decide but the results that are up\nThat has benefited people who are wealthy and I'm not sure if that was intentional that's not for me to decide but\nThe result that are up soon is tax cuts for the rich largely\nShort right and and but you know at the same time to give the Trump Administration a lot of credit ... a small business confidence is out of high consumer confidence is at a high the economy we're getting great numbers every day it's just who is that benefiting the most and if if voters go to the polls and think the Republicans helped them personally\nThen they'll do well but I've never I haven't talked to many voters who actually believe that or the money in their paychecks\nUh how about health care how is that playing these days\nHealth care is interesting because you've seen Republicans almost acts like Democrats in the sense because like for example um you know you've seen Lou Barletta talk about his defense of pre existing conditions you've seen Keith Rothfus\nAlso do the same thing even though both gentlemen have voted continuously to repeal and replace Obamacare which would have protected preexisting conditions\nPiece on NBC News tonight about that just a bunch of Republicans who tried to kill Obamacare announcing preexisting conditions were all about that\nExactly and it's it's plain to the the uh you know older voting bloc here who are afraid that since the deficit is running up so high Republicans are going to come after Medicare and come after Social Security and Conor Lamb that that is most of his platform\nIs I'm here to protect these things for you when Republicans get a little bit

I'd say the bottom line is this going to be a wide open\nVery divergent very diverse democratic nomination battle that's my production\nYeah even currently her own Bill Clinton was kind of an unknown at least on a national level back in Ninety two he was a fresh face yeah\nYeah and it often becomes not the person who everyone's talking about ... two years before the nomination but someone that would really comes out of the blue\nOrganizes well raises money well captures the enthusiasm attention the energy at a particularly important period of time in a nomination process so there's a long way to go\nI think that the truth yeah we we have to ... when I'm done with them interviewed for granted allowed here's Matt somewhere out there and radiolab Hi Matt\nOkay how are you guys got a couple of comments I wouldn't want to buy\nIt I Believe what we're talking about the next presidential election but that's what we do in America um I think you know in a car with count on my own down the line was among the bronco bomb it was basically I'm known and I and hang out at work or a A R a look a\nLittle a little girl uh the mayor of New Orleans I think are going to be true to names you'll hear of\nOkay I'm I'm I mean are you guys have higher soundbite with ... with a Trump fan you know it's a very rarely severely punished and then and you said you won't even say I have you got to listen to your own soundbites\nHe said if it's proven they're going to severely\nLaw where you want to wanting to severely punished or if it's not proven would do\nBut I still think it's a lot of double talk and a lot of uh a phoney baloney I don't I don't think he wants to punish him I think he wants to let him skate\nWell I I mean who knows if it's if it's an awful tough situation learn because it is an ... because they are the only power this lapsed due to oppose Iran and that region\nOf appreciate you call and that's a good point but I guess that means they get to kill journalists it will because they're they help us a fight Iran\nYeah absolutely and I think there is a distinction I've heard Republicans setting up straw men over the last couple of days saying well we can't possibly never talked to Saudi Arabia we can't possibly never have a relationship with Saudi Arabia because as this caller rightly pointed out is that there are very important player in the middle east\nAnd uh at the answer is there is a very large swath of possibilities between doing nothing and never talking to Saudi Arabia again and saying that we're not going to do anything at all because they're buying a whole bunch of military weapons there's a ...\nSaudi Arabia again and saying that we're not going to do anything at all because they're buying a whole bunch of military weapons there's a whole series of stages in between there said the strong man doesn't work saying we can't ever talk to we can't not ever talked to Saudi Arabia again there was a\nSolid serious severe middle ground that there can be penalties that Saudi Arabia pays and you could still have diplomatic relations with them which you need to have in the middle east\nIs also as I understand it we still are important quite a bit of oil from Saudi Arabia but not nearly as much as we used to before the U.S energy revolution and fracking et cetera\nThat is true and and look at it is the political pressure that has brought Donald Trump to the point where he says something worthwhile to day a week ago he was saying uh who knows a on friday I'm tired of people being\nYes just like judge Kavanaugh guilty until proven innocent\nYeah and he makes that point and it's the it's the political pressure it's the American public\nAnd the politicians on the other side largely Democrats who have said that doesn't cut it this is the United states of America we have the moral obligation we have a moral authority to protect\nIn this world and you have to do better than that and as a pressure some ounce yes Donald Trump has taken very tiny steps towards some more realistic important moral position\nMy step to the biggest steps in the history of steps huge\nOr this from 'em by the way of Mr producer meant there's enough time let me know like a time by which I should get out\nOf this from political dot com since journalists ... cars shaggy disappeared early this month President Trump acted like his own world class spies and hackers don't exist U.S intelligence community is reportedly increasingly convinced that\nA crown prince Mohammed bin Salman is culpable in ... killing\nPublicly though Trump has events no knowledge of the state of the investigation into the incident for some intelligence veterans and foreign policy specialist it's a pattern that's become all too familiar and troubling\nTrump started the presidency by public quibbling publicly quibbling about intelligence report that said ... and had been involved in hacking date in twenty sixteen presidential election more recently disabled when pressed about reports that his own intelligence agencies believe North Korea is still working on its nuclear program\nSuch proclamations of ignorance on major and tell us relations issues are not unusual for Trump despite the fact that senior officials insist cheesy attentive and engage during daily intelligence briefings for many working espionage national security it's yet another signal that after nearly two years in office the commander in chief is still unwilling or unable to trust his own intelligence apparatus\nI think it's very powerful point and there's no question that they're presenting to the president United States are doing their job they're presenting this intelligence information directly to him and when he wants to he acts as if\nThat person is a ally in some important sense of the world you still have to stand up and tell them the wrong and make sure that they're going to pay a price in the United states is the one who has the set what that price is\nThat is important to the rest of the world and that's a position this state's government must take now\nI Know we've made her comments about President Trump here and how we strongly disagree I strongly disagree with ways him as\nMore troublesome to me by the way is the complete absence of any Republican leader in the United States Senate or nine States Congress they've abdicated their own moral authority they've abdicated their own responsibility\nThey are one branch of this government and regardless and despite what this president does yes he's the leader on foreign policy issues but they have significant power significant influence significant moral standing on their own\nAnd this Republican Party is silent shame on them and they had to pay a political price for not standing up and doing the right thing\nI did think I heard a Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and John Kennedy of Louisiana up at least complained about it and say something ought to be done\nI heard some snippets like that that is right but there could be action by the United States Senate for example they could do a resolution immediately saying we call on United States government to do the following things I introduced legislation for example I'm Republican presidents Republican senator so and so\nAnd I just introduced legislation this that the Saudi Arabians will pay this kind of economic price and here's my legislation and I wanted voted on in these in the Senate which Republicans control the ...\nThe ravens will pay this kind of economic price and here's my legislation and I wanted voted on in this in the Senate which Republicans control the again they're abdicating their more responsibility I think they're\nGovernmental responsibility and we'll see if they're abdicating their political responsibility or whether they'll be a political price to pay for this kind of um really abject Cal telling to Donald Trump on this issue\nOr from political Turkish intelligence officials have privately said they have video and audio recordings that help prove\nA group of Saudis close to the crown prince commonly known as M. B. S. helped dismembered envy head ... in retaliation for his public criticism of the royal family ... you wrote for the Washington Post was living in self imposed exile in Virginia went to the consulate in Istanbul to obtain marriage related\nDocuments Trump has said he doesn't know whether such gruesome tapes exist [noise]\nWe have asked for it if it exists probably does possibly does right there in that sentence probably does possibly does he still hedging his bets and having an ... [noise]\nYes I Would make the case again in my opinion that the United states intelligence agencies are very clear about what happened I mean these are the best intelligence agencies in the world\nAnd and but Trump doesn't seem to understand that at least you're led to believe\nOr he doesn't want to understand that when it's convenient to him\nAnd he acts as if they work for someone else that they're not part of his administration I have no doubt that the best ... intelligence agency in the world has informed this president of exactly what they believe happened\nAnd so despite having that information you think about this despite having that information he still takes the positions that he's taken over the last two or three weeks\nA here's editor he'll district I add\nYour car or you know the thing that really probably about the ladder the fact that this guy because they Saudi Arabia thread of and he ... he wrote a column\nCriticizing the kingdom\nWill clear the thinking I mean he must have known he was committing suicide when they were all like oh\nYeah even if he um was unable to obtain\nMarriage related documents wherever they are what I Would say single and stay out of the Saudi conflict\nNo it's uh yeah it it sort of there is an important point I appreciate the call they're making it and I think it demonstrates the bravery and the courage and this is a gentleman who absolutely knew what the stakes were\nAnd despite that he felt strongly enough to say I don't like what my government's doing I'm going to stand up and say it I'm going to write columns I'm going to editorialize about it I Want\nThe people's Saudi Arabia to understand that and what governments and people around the world to understand that and that takes incredible brave really encourage and he had that in spades and they also had\nA well at least one person or outside of Saudi Arabia must be happy remember a President Trump a hold of numerous times that the enemy is\nProud of it my right for it he must be pretty happy\nAbout that although it locked up but I don't know I Know you've happy\nI hear you and thank you yeah one fewer enemy of the people\nAnd I think at the other important point at reminds us of this that the crime quote unquote that this gentleman committed against his own government was simply writing editorializing an openly criticizing the way his government behaved\nHis own government was simply\nWriting editorializing an openly criticizing the way his government behaved that's what he was beheaded for that's what he was dismembered for\nNot some attempt to subjugate the government of Saudi Arabia for example other than by what he wrote on a piece of paper the positions he stated publicly that's why he was murdered\nSteven decaying if you can hang on we'll get to your question of for my V. on eight six six three and I won ten twenty if you'd like to get in our last segment with Mike John academic show back in a flash news radio ten twenty ...\nComing strong and ruin any day outside Katie Hanna Rosin the one that will do for for all kinds of weather and climate him or any time on the CBS model that was a young news radio ten twenty Katie Kay\nIvey you or a loved one been diagnosed with lung cancer ... colon cancer or throat cancer if so you may be entitled to compensation even if you smoke many local area trade them and and the workers were exposed to his masters and didn't know if you are suffering from lung cancer ... colon or throat cancer\nCalled the Pittsburgh law firm Goldberg ... in light\nAt one eight hundred complex for a free consultation that's one eight hundred complex or online at ...

it is you know Halloween pretty much means distorted the Christmas shopping season started already and of course Neiman Marcus is out with the some of the most expensive\nGifts in their heart holiday catalog every year uh one of them are for offered by Neiman Marcus this year is up it's called black to me that what is the travel experience company that offers once in a lifetime vacations\nYeah you got to be nice if you want to share in the in the one billion dollar prize joining me under this Institute of Pittsburgh news line is Jamie Meredith senior vice president and a half or until it's and and the question for Jamie I guess is what should you do if you know\nTonight at eleven o'clock you won a prize ... will be the first you know what's what's the realistic thing to do Jamie\n... I think the first thing you do is you you are well who really really loud but I\nThink the key and there's been a lot of folks that have studied lottery winners and there's some commonality there I think the number one thing is you have to strive really hard to keep private\nAnd that's hard because there's a lottery rules that that force you to publish names winners so you you you make sure there's no fraud or nepotism\nOr anything like that but one of the most important things is you have to seek expert advice you you need an attorney you need an accountant you need a financial advisor who is a experienced in dealing with a large amount of wealth\nBecause the problem is when people receive the this big amount of wealth they think it's a bottomless pit and it isn't it's like getting in shape when when you when you're in shape people think\nYou can stop while no once you're in shape you've got to work even harder to stay in shape [noise] once you receive this money your problems aren't over you've got a whole new set of problems you may have never imagined from family members calling you out of the woodwork to the IRS to just all of a sudden looking at your account and it's it's gone\nWell people think you know again when we fantasize about this kind of thing and you always hear the uh the the the statement a disclaimer\nThat it's worth a billion dollars but if you take cash shoots worth you know roughly a half that are a little more than half that what what what kind of factors go into deciding whether in fact you take a long term payout you take the cash up front\nWhat how it's originally structured is it's what's called an annuity payment so they don't advertise that but by default your option is to receive this money in thirty payments on the billion dollar prize you would receive thirty three million a year for the next Thirty years\nNow few convert that payment stream into a lump sum while that's about five hundred and sixty five million I still take that that's a lot of money\nAnd then you've got to throw tax on that you're you're probably going to be an excess of of easily forty percent when you add on the federal tax plus a surcharge and plus the state\nSo roughly if you if you cut it in half cut it in half again that gives you a pretty good idea of of what you would receive and that thirty three million on an after tax basis that some about fifty five thousand dollars a day so it it will solve a lot of problems but again that's not at an empty pit of of unlimited money\nWhat kinds of things do you consider when you're looking at how to invest that kind of money what are the what are the vehicles you might use uh obviously I mean I mean I I Know it's a tough question to answer because everybody's\nSituation is different tax situations are different family size how you want to share that kind of money but what are the options for investing such a big hunk or cash\nWell it's it when you're dealing with significant wealth like that you you have to look at diversification and you can only buy so much in any particular mutual fund before you say well I've got a lot there you only have so much you can buy in stocks but the real big issue is now\nSo much in any particular mutual fund before you say well I've got a lot there you only have so much you can buy in stocks but the real big issue is now you're dealing with laws in taxes that most folks don't deal with if you give your friends or your parents or your siblings\nIf you give them money now you're dealing with gift taxes which again could exceed forty percent when you die your children could didn't inherit that wealth with a significant amount of federal or state tax on it as well\nSo there's a there's a lot of things that that you must consider especially if you're relatively young again if you take that annuity when at fifty five well that annuity runs out at eighty five and you may have another decade and a half of of life expectancy\nIn what do you do it was really really important\nTo look at the big picture before you really dive into those details with a client that one of about ten million and the lottery and and they wanted they had a whole list of things that they wanted to spend but we had to sit them down and say well hold on let's let's crunch these numbers before you spend a penny\nYou're always going to ask you that was my next question ... you're the vice president of France it let's have you advise people who have one big lottery prizes\n... we we have a few it's very rare you know the statistics I looked up the uh it's it's one in three hundred and two million and that's hard for our brains\nTo a wrap around but if you take a bucket fill it full\nOf sand your chances are of winning this lottery is someone ing pulling out your exact grain of sand in that bucket full of sand so\nIt's it's fairly rare but we do have a few clients not ever want a billion dollars but they've they've won you know sizeable amounts and again the number one thing is to sit down and calm down planet all out make sure there's no surprises make sure there's no unintended consequences\nAnd another reason why you need to have\nUm a really experts on your size on your side just because your phone is going to bring from\nYour cousin ten times removed say Hey Joe I really need your help I've gotten into a bad spot and from lottery winners that have one big they said that's one of the biggest news you want to help friends and family but that phone call never those those phone calls never end\nI suppose maybe the first thing you there was a change your phone number and change your email you know I went to school there was\nA there was just a a a a lawsuit from a lottery winner she won about fifty million and she wanted to remain private and she actually had to sue the state to keep private because again the state has laws that and they were trying to prevent fraud that\nThey haven't they want to read a lottery winner to they want to be transparent Jamie Beckley thanks for your time it's good advice maybe one day when it was all have that problem\nBut I Hope so I have my ticket so I'll be watching when everybody else\nJamie America as vice president and lets them as folks are getting ready for the mega millions don't I\nSay when you look at the very hardest hit or ... ... ... six forty five
