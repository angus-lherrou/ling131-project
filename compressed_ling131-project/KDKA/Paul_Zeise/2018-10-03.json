scary part and the scarier part is this is the warm up for the bigger step for the same reaction is going to occur\nThe FBI investigation comes back and says they're going to say one of two things we\nFound more stuff or we didn't find any more stuff\nLet's say they come out and we found more stuff\nTurns out he he got into a fist fight at all I Love that show too or something\nAt the FBI investigation comes out and said we got more stuff about this guy it will be pooh poohed and dismissed because the FBI is out to get the administration and those seeds have already been some\nIf the FBI comes on says there's nothing here this guy is cool he can go to any concert he won\nThe people that have a problem with him will start screaming that there's information that the president didn't let them investigate\nYou can't there there there is no answer that's going to make everybody go oh okay that's what happened and part of the fault in that that scenario allies in the administration

A. dot com [noise]\nNow it's on our blog it's at a a buddy Katie\nWelcome 'em and you know great to have you\nUh we're talking about mortgages tonight of course a Mike Henry with us senior vice president of residential lending adult or bank and Mike when it comes to getting that mortgage many people have a lot of different questions are but the one that people focus on first and foremost his interest rates\nAnd because that's ultimately what matters and I want to know where things stand with all her bank\nWell I'm an interest rates are very interesting time for interest rates 'cause we saw the Federal Reserve last week raise interest rates again that raised a primer eight to five and a quarter percent but here we are still at four point six to five on the thirty year fixed rate oh and so we've seen the fed hike interest rates a couple of times this year\nOr the economy is growing stronger than anticipated\nSo there's a lot of growth happening we've seen recent activity in the stock market hitting highs once again and\nHere we are with mortgage rates that really are fairly stable now we're getting into somewhat of a flat yield curve meaning you know short term rates in long term rates are getting closer and closer together\nLet's back up for a moment this somebody have to be convinced than their own mind that they're going to get a mortgage they can qualify for one before they even call\nNo absolutely not in fact that's the reason you want to call us to find out that you can't you don't need to be convinced that you're going to get one or if you're convinced that maybe you won't get one unique either way you need to call so we can go over how you get one and what's ... what's required what's the phone number is eight hundred three four four five six to six\nEight hundred three four four five six to six so for somebody who's listening right now and they rent a home and they may be telling themselves that they can't qualify for one day should still call to\nAbsolutely um ... you know a lot of people think well I don't have enough money I don't have enough saved her\nUm my credit is not good enough I have to have perfect credit I have to have a large downpayment closing costs are high it can't afford all of that I'm In some cases that may be true but um it's you know if you look at the programs we have available\nThat there are many ways to purchase a home without having a large downpayment without having a great credit score um you have to have a decent credit score you have to have relatively good credit\nRight now the great credit score is\nA great credit score really I guess would be anything seven forty or hire fifty is a perfect credit score you rarely see things in the AIDS but occasionally we do um the average credit score on our conventional loans has actually around seven sixty that's what the average we see\n'em all interesting you know it'd be really you know good credit score Greg ...\nWhat do you have to be seven hundred to get a dig it alone ... absolutely I Do absolutely have to be in the six hundred to get along\nI'm pretty close we can go six twenty for conventional loan six twenty is the minimum credit score\nSo there's probably some credit issues if you have a six twenty credits or it could be a lot of credit could be some delinquent sees ... six twenty and six forty bucket you're still eligible for conventional financing it's six twenty it's not an automatic that you're approved mhm uh but you know if if your debt incomes go your employment history is good\nOr we can verify everything you have sufficient access free downpayment closing costs weak you can get a mortgage with six twenty\nUm F. ha financing\nWhich typically we look at if your credit scores blow six eighty or below six sixty because interest rates it that for enough ha alone are better at that level\nOr they'll go down to a minimum of five eighty credit score so you have some definite derogatory credit some potential collection accounts um recent derogatory credit but it still makes you it somewhat eligible\nFor an F ha mortgage that's available um are random more prone to we have no defined credit score ... minimum uh but typically you you need to be in that five eighty or higher range\nRange um so you so you can get started I mean the better your interest rate or the better your\nCredit score is the better your interest rate is and certainly the easier it is to get into the property okay I'll certainly you don't have to have a seven forty or higher risk our average credit score on an F ha loan is is six eighty\nAren't as I'm listening to you I'm thinking okay the credit score doesn't have to be great\nJust decent yeah credit in five eighty or above and something can happen or the down payment we're going to talk about can be very very low a very very close and not all of his era yes\nIt sounds to me though that what may be most important is do you have a work history ... I can use shows that even working consistently for a period of what up to two years\nYet we are as long as we're looking for a two year employment history doesn't necessarily have to be with the same employer um it just can't be in radically different lines of work let's say you were in a salaried\nWorker and and and an accounting firm and you turned around and became that car salesmen and a hundred percent commission we need to see a good long history of being a commission car sales person because we have no income to calculate or any history to calculate\nUm if you're a salary employer and you've been doing it for two years or an hourly employee you know we're gonna average income\nSo we're looking for a two year history of employment and you're right the income is really the number one driver and qualify if we can't demonstrate the ability to repay and we calculate that by using debt income ratios\nThan it does matter what your credit scores um if you get out you could have excellent credit and have bad debt to income ratio is\nAnd it's difficult to be approved for a long\nAnd the income that you have coming in to the home doesn't necessarily have to be work either\nNo absolutely not it can be it can be any time it was if you're retired it can be retirement income and could be pension Social Security if you have Social Security now of Social Security disability something of that nature that's qualifying income we're looking for things that are going to last for at least three years or more\nOkay so regularly taking money out of your four one K. if you're at that point\nYeah absolutely um that would be the depletion of an asset like you were using money you're taking out so if you're using the formula for ... percent a year of your hire a retirement savings four one K. as your annual income as long as we can document that we can use that qualify and we often do um\nCan you use disability income\nAbsolutely yeah as long as it's I'm considered permanent disability if that's your sole income or the the income that we're using to qualify for the loan or part of the income\nYou can't be a temporary disability because it has the ability to end could\nParents do you use the disability income of a child that they are intending to get for at least three to five years as income to qualify them for a long\nYeah as long as it's like I said a permanent disability and it it's kind of geared towards that household so it'd be a minor but yes yes and use that income\nOr what happens if you as a mom who's on Social Security and she's living with you are you able to use her income to help qualify for that loan\nUm in some cases you can there is one particular loan program the one I mentioned earlier home ready which allows that type of income to be an offsetting factor if your debt to income ratios are tightly can offset it without having her\nOn the mortgage or a homeowner she doesn't have to own a home or be on the mortgage and if we document that correctly you can use that income as an offsetting factor to the debt to income ratio is that that you have now because of this household it's money coming into the home to help support it so um it's reasonable to look\nIt's reasonable to look at that and that's only for that particular program where that's considered allowable you have to be you don't have to be a first time homebuyer but your total income cannot exceed\nOne hundred percent of the hub median income to qualify for that program and that would not include that grandmother mother whoever it might be um it it would be the income or using to qualify you for the lone okay we don't consider that income to qualify it's an offsetting factor\nNow what about income of individuals that wouldn't necessarily be on the note is there a scenario for that too\nYeah no well we know we need them on the no they don't have to be on they don't have to take ownership of the proper OK okay but every borrower assigning the notes\nAnd they don't have to be an owner of the property they just promised to be a part of paying the note on the property\nYeah right in fact you know as a lender and the more on the note the merrier but um [laughter] you know that there's more of but um\nYeah so a good case would be if somebody buying their first home and the parents are coast signing they don't have to take ownership of their property but they would be moved using their income and their debt mhm and qualifying the primary who's going to be living in the property\nMade and even though you're going to have multiple people on the note and use those different incomes in order to uh come up with enough money to afford the loan you can't do that with multiple people on in order to get a better credit score that's going to order to qualify for that low\nWhoever it regardless of the number of borrowers on alone we're going to use the lowest credit score of so if you have to three people and the\nOne credit scores seven forty one seven Twenty one seven hundred we're going to use the seven hundred and processing underwriting end price pricing alone so we're always going to use the the the lower credit score\nWhen we're on credit we actually get three credit scores for each borrow we're beginning one from experience Equifax and transfer union\nAnd like I can tell you generally speaking all three of them are different maybe not by great margins but a lot of them they're different all the time and we used the middle score to determine what your credit scores\nIf you have any questions You're

about his new my subject touching without notice and\nF. ha allows us to pay up to six percent of the closing costs in prepaid\nI'm assuming they get up to six percent at the bar or has to have a minimum contribution to go back to the VA you're going to have zero percent down in the cellar has really really technically no limitations on how much they can pay as far as your closing costs they can actually this is interesting about VA and we don't know that just don't see as often\nBut but it can occur where the seller can actually pay debt the veteran has that may help him qualify so if he had a alone is some kind\nThe seller could actually pay that loan off to help and purchased the home\nThey could to it let's say they had two months left on their lease get actually pay that two month to month lease that this is VA loan and it's a little more complicated of a level here but it's technically that's how\nGood a VA mortgages for veterans and the benefits that they have is really very good and should be you know looked at a it's not utilized by all veterans and probably something they consider but\nUm those are the kinds of things to do with the VA mortgage no ... there were about a government backed loans is three and a half percent down and you have to have three and a half percent into the transaction the seller can pay the rest of your cost\n'em in the cellar does and you have five or six percent of the purchase price you would need for closing costs pretty page and could be a size seven percent\nUm but as a minimum three and a half percent down that I can also be that three and a half percent\nCan be a gift from a relative blood relative you're allowed to get that so you don't necessarily have your own savings a first time homebuyer often gets a gift from their parents to help with the purchase of a home or so that\nUm ah so that's totally acceptable so you don't have to have this great savings account minimum credit score on an F ha loaned us five eighty\nSo anything six eighty and under is one eight percent higher interest rate than today's rates and actually F ha race or a little bit lower than conventional rates so it was a lot of benefits one eighth yeah that's the ... so for that they were four and five eight something conventional loan\nOf the ethic the F ha interest rate is four and a half percent\nIf your credit scores blow six eighty it's four and five ... percent so it's very little change in your on your credit\nSays over anyone who's thinking okay my credit scores and all that great it's going to be really expensive for me that's just not the case either no\nNot at all in fact this is quite the opposite now there was an F. ha mortgage insurance\nUm which you have to pay that something you pay for the life of alone you can you can you cannot get rid of it\nIf you have an older half ha loans just in case this listener has an older ... some of them you can still have it removed it just depends on how long ago you took it out but recently um you know the rules have changed for the last five years or so that you cannot have that removed\nUm and maybe even longer than five years but it's for a life of loans so that's a disadvantage compared to conventional but you have good interest rates low down payment higher ability for the sellers to assist you with down with closing costs sellers cannot pay any of your down payment\nYour downpayment can't be borrowed it can be borrowed against the scary asset\nWhich you know would be basically for most maybe of alone against their four O. one K. you can do that don't recommend it but you can do it [laughter] um so that that's FA chain that we have to first time and there's first of all if ha you do not have to be a first time homebuyer and there's no income limitation you only limitation is the amount you can borrow\nAnd that's in to I'd have to look it up I don't know the exact number of thought my head it's lower than\nConforming limits where conventional loans\nThat it's four fifty three it's lower than that on an F ha law\nWe have a written more program which is the first time homebuyer program which has two features to it it's either zero percent down where it's three percent down\nIn the way we divide that is if you're low income which means you're you're fifty percent of the hub median income which is going to be around thirty to thirty three thousand dollars a year and a household income\nWe have zero percent down program no mortgage insurance no private mortgage insurance the pie and my you hear about which is a monthly premium that you pay if you're putting less than twenty percent down there is no private mortgage insurance on this loan interest rates are same interest rates we'd been talking about four and five ... percent today\nI'm great proud of you have to be the first time homebuyer mhm and from there you can the seller can pay up to five percent of the purchase price towards your closing cost so you can pretty much get in there for almost nothing nice um we have matching grant programs that are available for that type of loan or if you were that we will match some of your savings\nUm you you work through our program will will match up to three dollars for every dollar you put into\nFor up to a thousand on your side and three thousand on our side which gives you four thousand dollars available on that's done to our community development group and it's a program you enroll in as a matched savings or said there's a lot of pass to get in with nothing down if you're at that income level\nThe second version is three percent down and that's it at that as if you're at eighty percent of the hub median income household income basically the same loans just three percent down versus zero percent down so you have to have a large a down payment but still very low\nUm so we haven't even talked about five percent loud conventional financing\nAnd sing um I can tell you the average bar or putting somewhere around ten percent down so when you hear the statements there's still a recent surveys that show many renters more than forty five percent believe you have to have twenty percent down in order to purchase a house I'm\nYou know to avoid things like ... or you won't get approved for it because of your your your debt to income or your credit and it's just simply not true the ... the average down payment we see on the purchases ten percent\nIn one of the reasons why it's not true is because it is true in other markets\nIs that the cost of a home\nIs a on a typical home is much lower here than it is in markets where they're creating these stories New York mhm washing their I write a guard or LA San Francisco Seattle where they just get into a home you're in a jumbo loan\nJust to get into just anything and some of these more\nYeah I mean if you're looking at you know Silicon Valley in our average purchased prices across the region is around two twelve that's the average purchase price the median is lower than that\nUm I Believe in well not Silicon Valley San Diego comes to mind because I looked it up recently it was six Seventy six so that's a jumbo financing right out of the gate for most people\nThat we do five percent down loans up to five hundred thousand and that's that exist in those markets so you have to have ten percent down till you're about\nSix fifty you know once you get above that you really need to have twenty percent down if you get above a million and a half we typically in the thirty to forty percent down but that's not uncommon in some of those areas run or in Manhattan I'm you know a million and a half dollar\nCo op is maybe maybe a two bedroom maybe maybe you know I remember looking at a time to share a bathroom with him you know you you know you do get that for a million and a half dollars need to get into\nGetting raised with us senior vice president of residential lending a dollar bank more in a moment\n... plugged in
