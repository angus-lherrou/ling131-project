ball great Jim Brown was there to a ... but he didn't have much to say go ahead and\nWhile he knows because it's toxic to even be standing next to ... if you happen to be black\nSo why why would you want to go in and look like a step infected type character as Kanye West there and he's only being embraced by the rights because he he brings out their famous talking points about welfare and the Democrats the story\nYeah I Know him that live here and all that other apparently glad to be known since the welfare people apparently just keep having more babies to get more money or at least ... years preparing news\nFlash to white America and welfare only benefit of black people it wouldn't exist there is no program in this country that only benefits certain group okay so if that all the year\nAnd there are there are more white people on welfare than black people\nI Know I just told you if it benefits only black people wouldn't exist anyway right\nLet me just say that that's an absurdity but it's a talking point that the white and blue food one in great shape themselves to the rights to pull out\nAnd this is the same call and you see this tells you that we're living in bizarro twilight zone world this is saying Kanye West who say George Bush is a racist and every white person that was Republican anything shipped out of town with the Dixie Chicks remembered\nOh yes Oh yes yeah he's a George push to George Bush doesn't care about black people\nAnd he hates black people doing that Katrina and unfair yeah they want any amount of how they wouldn't even bother them out of the country\nSo this is all phony fake nonsense that Trump thinks that this somehow in great shape to sell the African American you know you're always going to have a segment of African Americans who want to go against the grain and that's fine it's a free country but when you pull somebody out\nLike this is Jim Crow type character and I am for what every agitated back in some spare gee that ... that that points black folks in a an unflattering light the white America Easter off 'cause that's what he did today and he only did it to themselves and do talk about 'cause\nOut of the majority of people know that was just with the prophetic\nAnd it it it it was said there was a sad display it really was going to fit in Trump's stir and its crowd they just want to help 'em at any measure and African American community I told you yesterday what they want to but a good economy will help out ... that's just natural\nThat's just a natural way so that may give me some sort of benefit because the gay Bill Clinton a bit of it but not Kanye West nobody nobody respects Kanye West majority of people in the African American community we called him a joke but one thing he's hanging out with the card to asking those wipers\n[laughter]\nAnything else what means there are no that's good though that was good speech I like that [laughter]\nWell it's true yeah and like I say I don't speak for all black people but I Know the polls I'm In I'm In the black community I mean and and the barber\nShop well we talk about oh a sort of thing and I when I when I go out to somebody like him also talk about things that are happening the nuances of the day that a lot of African Americans don't agree with it and I've done that yeah absolutely\nSo I so I'm pointing it out just to be fair of the conflicts 'cause sometimes when we live in our own wars we don't understand what other people think it's something that we have to look to other people's print them\nAnd and and my ... my looking at America it's completely different than your outlook of America because we've grown up a different world and let's be honest being African American and being ... and being white\nYou're not really segregated in this country is very few times that was outside of work maybe we we enter jak we don't do it at church\nWe don't I mean just so it does it does happen so I think it's always good to hear a another opinion on state aid if Mrs uncomfortable but not his opinion because I wasn't make anybody who goes that is made everybody look stupid that happened to be in a room with them\n[noise] Anthony thanks so much for your call and I I totally agree with you a chrysalis who writes for CNN it was a particularly Trump being spectacle Tanya was invited along with Jim Brown a sense of what you're talking about prisoner foreign but was really brought to the White House because he's a celebrity and because he says nice things about Trump any guarantees eyeballs and buzz\nEverywhere he goes\nAnd of course everyone watch says ... even if they\nSaid they didn't want to or didn't care because it was impossible to tear yourself away from the spectacle con you didn't

gowns like it's actually even if you haven't seen the video you listen to that\nIf you know as an actor which I Know do I feel like I'm Still buying it he just looks you just looked real yeah All right back on the subject of a Kanye West\nWho has been diagnosed with bipolar and arguably a suffers from that end or other forms of mental illness based on his behavior at least one could argue Sondra from the south pills a veteran color to the radio station who was talked about her struggles with mental illness or has some thoughts on calling us Hi Sandra\nHi how are you miss the Mac and power Mr Leon thank you for taking my\nCall thanks for calling\nYeah Kahneman Wes had jak gas up by Mr Obama now [noise]\nI mean clearly he has a mental illness he's all over the place he was so high I don't know if he was on anything else but just the mental illness for a loan\nMe he was just so high with that bipolar saying that he couldn't even stay warm point and it was so bad that\nHe was allow to perform like that and actually he said knocks then about the plight of African Americans in this country\nIn either the president and it was that oh no up where we stroke Trump's ego\nIn Mr Trump should have been taking care of presidential business like ... we have ... like\nPuerto Rico the hurricane yet or [noise]\nOr Florence or any of these things and he's the he's let him come in to the White House in use swear words I mean that's the president's seat come to an ... west if so sick\nReally he needs to go\nAnd get the psychiatric care he needs and get himself together I don't know what his family ... family what oh let me walk around in a state like some of these people's families let them walk around\nAnd said that all up to date and see what it is it is so so just the other being that he would allow that in the White House ... office it's a shame\nIt was the best thing and it's a sad day for our country\nA ... a good speech\nBar a few minutes management there yeah yeah\nYou some powerful comments there and I tell you again I'm encouraged by two colors uh we had both wise women speaking or not only clearly in our took your way\nLater Donald Trump and uh\nIt was I Know we've used this term so many times but unprecedented historical Kanye West is pounding on the desk in the oval office making comments that I still can't figure out what the heck he was talking about\nUh so we live in this surreal world in Donald Trump's reality t._v. show and we have a ... a west to think about this this real nature of the Kanye West is endorsing Donald Trump\nA a rapper\nWhose endorsing Donald Trump and we have Taylor Swift a\nCountry singer or a pop singer who is now come out for Democrats\nHow about that and I heard upside down yes and I heard some people just feeding this but others are crediting her as you know with a inspiring thousands of voters to suddenly register\nYeah they've had the data they suggest in Tennessee alone and she was speaking about race in Tennessee both the United States Senate race and they congressional race in Tennessee and within twenty four hours after her Instagram post\nAre saying that you need to get out there and registering at some of the vote that they had a a two hundred and fifty percent increase in voter registration and ... state of Tennessee and nationwide they had I think it was a two hundred and fifty percent increase to the website\nAt that would inform you how to register to vote in your particular state\nSo do you give either a the congressional candidate or the Democratic Senate candidate both Democrats 'em a chance in Kentucky which would also be quite a cool at least in the city yeah Tennessee I'm Sorry yeah yeah\nUh I think the races competitive for the United States Senate is a former governor of the Democratic side who's attempting to win an open seat this is a seat that Bob Corker the president Republican United States senator has decided not to run again so it's an open seat\nAnd there is a Republican Congress woman by the name of Marsha Blackburn running on the Republican side never liked her\nI never cared for her at all I'm not [noise] not her styles and certainly not her politics\nBut as the governor I think it's competitive I still have to give the edge the Republican is state of Tennessee but kudos to tailor sweat for speaking out for the first time by the way and I know there's a lot of criticism sometimes the fact that I heard a Republican on TV just the other day saying here comes Hollywood again now Taylor Swift has nothing to do with Hollywood right she's a music\nRight she is a big entertainer but she's not Barbra Streisand or something yeah yeah he's not\nA the left wing Hollywood crowd Chinese\nSomeone who has worked very hard to fact appeal to middle America in her music and she's been a phenomenal success and very popular so I gave her a tremendous credit she knew there would be backlash and push back you take a political position but anybody ought to have a right to South America to take a political position so I was really proud of her\nThat she took it as particularly proud of course that you took a position on behalf of\nThe Democrats it was effective\nOr see someone that people do respect he reaches out to a younger crowd in particular and especially and I think someone like that can make a difference\nAll credit to Taylor Swift for speaking up speaking out and look count Kanye West has a right to speak up also\nAll I'm quoting him the only reason the vote Democrat lift you're tired of winning\nAnd I thought that was pretty ironic because in the history of the president of the ... have been a bigger loser from when he met with food at how finicky for eating surrender\nThrew a rock and then I made a and M. then invited him okay if I'm just too hot and then I invited him why and how um the day after the ... of a meeting you level Republican senator sharply where the five\nAre newly meant a traitor Pauline he'll perform of treating those those spray for shameful we step backwards to pop et cetera so they really got into him on that\nBut you know so given the surrender of health okay what I Want to know what the president knows about women I mean no president and the country\nHave this great film self has lots of it is that Sunday night in Helsinki\nAnd hopefully no president on our love to have a future of the second thing on this thing was he back for a young I I Am a Republican called of\nKelly I I don't have a first name here oh Mike Ellie and the one reason one of the ... on the facts by Kelly because Kelly is hard on five and my ...\nMy wife and live the president to be careful what you wish for because the Robert Mueller believing\nTougher on crime is taking down some of ... there is for the thoughts of a a thought that was my swim laps of a security advisor jars ...\nForeign advisor and Rick Gates ... campaign manager [noise] and that's that's not the leaves of of the last\n... the most important guy I spoke to our Michael on\nA lawyer who will south from down the river to avoid spending the rest of his life sharing a cell with some guy named fire in a trial it was a traitor and believe me it can fire with barrage of\nAnd I can't wait will feel the ... midterm elections are over so ah lifts or a healer and bring four of 'em have it on um Mr Cohen that will probably take for president down\nOr ed thanks so much for your call 'em from your lips to ... uh I still wonder if he's going to fire sessions right after the midterms and what if any effect that will have on whatever Miller does in how prepared Mohler is to spill whenever beans he has or if we're still months away [noise]\nHard to tell I now know when what his timetable is but I certainly believe very strongly that Donald Trump will fire just sessions immediately after the midterms I think that will have repercussions on what their Mueller investigation will be I think Trump will\nDo his very best to put into place and attorney general who will not recused himself of course\nAnd will uh have a lot to say about how the Mueller investigation proceeds them so these cards are yet to be played this is going to be a ferocious political battle\nIt's not going to be a legal battle in the court of law it's going to be a political battle played out in front of the American people Donald Trump as we know has worked very very hard to talk about the fact that\nThis investigation is a hoax that there is no collusion that this is all made up phoney baloney by the Democrats\nAnd he's making his political case the American people sewing Muller plays his cards there will be a political battle I Want to say this I was just so encouraged again by this caller ... here and\nUh I think it demonstrates what the data is showing what the polling is showing what we're seeing anecdotally what anyone sees who's a political junkie are paying any kind of attention to politics can see over this country people on both sides\nDemocrats and Republicans are paying heightened attention to this election I think people understand more than usual and perhaps more in a couple of decades how important this\nMidterm election is and you're seeing many many more average people become engaged take a look at the issues and the Democrats are making a strong case that we need to put a check on this president the best way to do that to elect a democratic United States Congress but these callers I think are demonstrating these\nAre folks who are paying close attention to articulate about the issues they've done their homework they have something to say and again it gives me renewed\nHope in great encouragement that that is not just the colors to John McEntire show and Katie K but there are more people like that all over America we're taking another look and making a case of their family friends and neighbors that we need to put a check on Donald Trump elect Democrats the United States Congress\nI remember a sitting in the radio studio downtown to the old Katie case studio with Jim Rada you're on the election\nOn the election of two thousand and six he was sort of doing analysis you know he was the Republican Guard executive in the head of the county Republican Party has at least regionally a prominent Republican figure\nAnd their returns kept coming in and he just couldn't believe\nThat the blue wave was hitting as hard as it did ah and I'm not making fun of because he was Republican they had a bad night I just when he was genuinely shocked and I guess I'm just hoping for\nVisions of two thousand six dancing in my head and if you because as you as you point out anything could happen it could be a huge wave minor blue wave they can take out in the Senate they could only take the house but not as many seats the optimist think um\nI don't know a lot of unknowns there really are\nAs a Yogi Berra said is one of his famous quotes was to say no it's very difficult to make predictions especially about the future [laughter]\nSo ah we don't know but there's a there is a lot of polling or is data there are plenty of anecdotes there are good reporters writing good stories and I think that there there's no question that Democrats are in a very good position to capture the United States House whether that's by\nYou know the twenty three seats for example do they get twenty five seats they get thirty seats the Democrats are very likely to be in the majority I don't know by how many seats\nThere was a great article in the Washington Post over the weekend by the way and I thought they had the best polling the most fascinating interesting analysis of any of the polling projects I've seen to date\nBecause they specifically polled\nWhat are considered the sixty nine most competitive United States house races so set of looking at the whole country whereas set of taking two or three seats they looked at these sixty nine competitive seats and did very specific polling\nJust in those sixty nine seats so the analysis was about the most competitive sixty nine U.S House seats in the country and there was a lot of good news in there for Democrats\n[noise] uh one more second would be on your opportunity to weigh in at eight six six to nine one ten twenty Republican Doug Saltsman joined us at ten o'clock live in the studio news radio

carriers we invite above them if they'd like to end but we're going to work with with a prize um Allegheny county it's a program or in the area agency on AJ and film account or even if you are presented for that\nAnd what kind of issues can people expect to see addressed\nThe biggest issue is what happens when the when the consent decrees over or if I currently have this coverage I see this doctor what what does that mean for me um what happens to me you know come July\nUh you know I I I read an article today we're now there's usually somebody in your state that consent decree in January so a lot of those questions will be cleared up um and that's what that's really wouldn't want to do we want to bring everybody together and say this is just there's nothing in it for ... sunrise than just educating our seniors\nHow much can really make a difference when it comes to seniors that are living at assisted care facilities or nursing homes\nOr at nursing homes is this something that really does ultimately matter to them maybe even more so\nMore so because then I'll give you an example so for us in the north hills with infection home which is literally across the street from passive it a lot of my folks who either seniors whether it's in the independent living our personal care\nMay have Highmark product for example but they they utilize passive and hospital but when the consent decree it up they're not able to do that anymore\nUm so they need to understand what that means and if they want to continue the hospital this is what you have to do um if if you want to stay with the doctor you have and the doctor you have can't go to that\nParticular facility you have to understand that so they're going to be a lot of confusion and I think if you have to have a lot of coordination even what the physician practices that are owned by either UPN see or um Allegheny health if there's an independent physician they need to understand also or what their patients insurance is\nOkay or once in ... and ... is joining us what's been sanctioned now this event that you have scheduled for Wednesday October seventeenth ... what time and where\nSo it'll be nine AM at the

in ... and um we trade by medical products after Nuremberg dealer patients and patients are found the ...\nThat we have the calibrate them such as currently on the market is like that phrase physically designed to improve posture balance in the book but feel we actually received a patent\nFor the brace can graduation Tajik I mean that's that's no small accomplishment waited about three years I'm In the making and liberate says now I'm paid for and during the existing Medicare payment to the guy that got even better yeah\nIt is so we'd love the fact that we have the ability to a patient access to the brace and we're in we're thirty five states right now\nThat's an amazing accomplishment started but about two or three years ago together we found it\nFounded in two thousand fourteen and the Braves lodged in two thousand and sixteen gotcha\nWhen I think really interesting about the story is the fact that you started this because the mother suffered from a Parkinson's correct and that really inspired you to do this is I think it's just an amazing story I mean you're just doing the things you're tell us about that Hank\nYou yeah um I actually am not originally from Pittsburgh I'm from Baltimore um went to college at some college which is in each VCU in Atlanta for then had the fortune of getting accepted to Carnegie Mellon um peppers called business\nAnd setting organizational behavior in theory much what's amazing and experience and my thought was that I Would be a business school professor and do research I was really passionate what went wrong\nI Know the thing that that I I think shifted my perspective with my mom she had Parkinson's and um she had tremendous travel with her posture [noise]\nIt was helping I wasn't helping her at all in terms of her walking um she was falling a lot\nOf this was offered to breathe and so I called the national park and some time nation and ask them for resources and just sort of trying to find a product and they said they didn't have any that they can recommend that I'm going to build this right now my goodness I was like such a thing\nI thought at first they will just be something for her but it ended up realizing that there are about three hundred million patients ear every year that suffer from these back issues that really could use this device so that's what prompted me to create my company\nWould have to point the market out there with the ability to really positively impact quality of life for people [noise] as far as that goes to I mean obviously getting the product or you're not getting it in the markets thirty five thirty five states\nWithout being part of this mission and being able to do more connections in the ... of the capital intensive company you got to build these things you got to scale them dirty selling them which I think it's just so fantastic so why shouldn't force you to stop all be part of these types of business mission spray\nThe first I have to just think that Pittsburgh technology council leap and a member some censoring really started the company and you're like a lifelong member yeah yeah absolutely and it it's been fantastic in terms of the resources I think one of the biggest lessons I learned\nFrom being an entrepreneur is it really is who you know and access\nTo a network um this is actually my second mission trip that I've gone on 'em and this came at a perfect time because Seattle is of course are home to Amazon headquarters and I know we were there and the other day it was very much for the other day and it was very surreal but Amazon of course is\nThe biggest online platform force for good\nAnd um they got to really apart from that we would love to be on and so you've been apply for the launch ...\nAgain ... already submitted to the Amazon launch pad program is a program that was founded in twenty Fifteen\nFor a start up companies that have typical products to scale in the south\nUm and so since then I think the statistic was that they've sold ... million dollars and it was a crazy number like that I mean there are so it may be getting a piece of that\nPile a little bigger tiny fees I'm just start that would be fantastic so this trip came in a perfect time one of the things with them ... missions are all seemed to this mission I feel was about\nSaddam hardware and physical products and how to actually scale and salad everybody that we've talked to has been giving us advice about selling about scaling manufacturing product what does that look like a ... scale and that bag with anti that's\nFor sure I mean and it seems like I can tell everyone here has been very open everyone's like let me more food you can reach out for you would have been some\nYou would have been some your key takeaways for anything really surprise you how\nI think for me I'm One of the statistics I found out just talking to somebody was Seattle has Ninety percent of its inhabitants are actually transpired of some ... of people who live in Seattle are actually not from Seattle [noise]\nUm and I think that really tributes to um to folks here are just sort of saying hey I got here because of some\nCrazy is it a career move or whatever it let me help you because I see that you're moving in a new direction I think even a bill to look so\nPeople have been incredibly supportive very helpful and very open one of the judge when we spoke with actually knows people like the gates and [noise] um you know a founder of Amazon and so you know ... to think here like two degrees of separation from these things\nAre right right oh but me on that or the name brand it's just a name that it's just thinking about\nWho in this ecosystem\nIs excited about Pittsburgh technology and everything I found that there was actually fight a lot of ties\nI found that as well to exactly I was in her and people just and we knew about Pittsburgh and people are coming back like I hear these things and I'm like a new record\nIt and I've been plugging the whole week um the the new non-stop flight that Alaska air recently rolled out from Pittsburgh to Seattle so now we should say there are new friends and it's easier to get here now is not very easy yeah I Know I have\nAnd how cool is that Alaska stepped up to helping the entrepreneurs out there I mean I think that was so much fun for them to do that I think\nOne of the things that people don't realize is\nThe cost of travel for entrepreneur is when we're trying to ask where there's really nothing was going in since ... speaking of someone shaking their hands and let them in the eyes\nYou can email and Skype and all those things are very very useful but pressing pressing flash yes you need to be in person and so for Alaska air to be able to sponsor us to come out here was invaluable too\nCruel says some quote unquote our partners like the ... law firm to hoping to make introductions and working with the airport authority is it's an open you Pittsburgh kind of came around to make this trip happened and I just get so excited 'cause I I see the connections happening for you know as long as you get the thirty six to eight [laughter]\nStarted back in ... yes I I think um so the Web law firms that are um attendance of the gay choir summer and right and that has been invaluable I really we we just learned a session about um health care\nAnd I O T and health care [noise] um I just talked about the founder sort of creating companies to rake primary care accessible on platform so it's just been said nominal just to hear what's going on outside of the ... area and then what we're doing and how we might have partnership\nI see how much you've gone out of this and I think he really maximize your time you're we talked earlier you said you'd be president and that's absolutely true I mean like you were at every meeting just to paying attention you're meeting people you're shaking hands he\nThrew it under the every opportunity you can hear that you're still happy to go to see that you're doing that because that's just helping you grow that company for two more people to help improve the quality of life you're awesome product to people and we're about a dual

information and take that to your doctor to get it filled out and get a break and then we have the information about press [noise]\nBe guy I'd have to go up\nAnd just real quick were one of these some of the two or three top things you're starting to be thinking about when it comes to your ID and things like that\nOne of the things I think is just foundation is don't be afraid to talk to experts especially you work and what does he like don't be free got at night because you called credit the Web but like your like we're not going to the no ... around and talk to you right and give you advice exactly God Forbid right I mean not like\nThe the legal by specifically like you know this is what people do and your industry exactly it helps them get a quiet for a big number that was free\nAnd it's not every inch of needs to be but my goodness I you know that\nIf you don't talk to an expert\nIn Pittsburgh so it's a cool town because you met him in the like you are acceptable and what had held out you know don't be afraid and and the ... year reputation goes back so long as they can be prevented IP for him in Pittsburgh and you got that cause you reach out and you always have caught on to somebody in absolutely\nAbsolutely I reach out number one number two I don't discount things that you don't understand\nSomebody right and you can make a good assessment right so you don't go and you\nJust buy a car or when you do some research and talking to people know about those cars he he knew some understanding of the price that I was going to be repaired same thing in the legal world she had talked to the guys to know what's going on and that kind of bill you begin informing and make sure start off in the right\nFoot I Love it you better is hanging out downtown Seattle do you live in an interview here in the middle of it all but electric bikes are owned by other cycle where a man of the attributes of a mess\nI absolutely love a man some great things for helping us out a block from talking to brag crowd that will block robotics hang on site man he's coming up this is the second air cool things shown\nTo actually nothing better to like hanging out in Seattle because I feel like I'm actually in Pittsburgh here though they were actually outside in Seattle downtown outside the pill Chuck ah\nA glass museums is pretty amazing haven't reception here with our our start up

company tells us there's ...\nThanks well a velocity is building the Internet uh tools we are improving productivity on the construction site with a technology\nEnhanced power tools they enable\nContractors to basically work faster work more efficiently ... for that so [noise]\nWell one thing is we all live in buildings we work in buildings and so like the real world is such an important part of our daily lives and so when I decided to start a company I wanted to do something that was impactful to all of us and so I thought well [noise]\nWell the other thing is I bought a really old house that's\nThat would be my first increase right there I have an old houses all too so I Know how powerful your tools routine\nAnd we did a ton of the Iowa I work in the house and I can't tell you have any ideas that I came up with during that process is working on the house and so I thought a ... and and also I have a background that caterpillar mid a lot of work with building equipment and everything and so from there I just I thought\nOkay well I'm going to target the construction industry I don't know what I'm going to do but I'm going to figure out something and so I started talking to guys in the construction industry\nI decided I'm gonna quit my job and build a company that's a bold move [noise]\nYou know in hindsight that was pretty like God what did I Do [laughter] yeah I've been to the for the day that I left I felt like\nA you know that Indiana Jones movie where he steps off the cliff absolutely yeah so that is exactly what I kind of visualize I was stepping off a cliff and I had no idea they really anything they're not\n[laughter] tell us about your future in Seattle or some of the key takeaway do you got a meeting with like Amazon launch pad Microsoft hanging out of the choir\nBut what about ... yeah so\nIt was great to me it was launch pad and kind of get an understanding of that program and what's in the future we're a little bit early for them right now\nAre the same with Microsoft Ventures the some of the key takeaway as I thought were from the CEOs that with a geek work on friends' ... insight and kind of inspiration there right yes stuck with you yeah so um [noise] let's see there was this one quote [noise]\nI'm trying to remember what it was now I can\nRing was like if I stop I die that really hit me how 'bout you [laughter] yeah so I I think that's kind of\nOne of those things that we chose start up founders get into it's like this had space where you know if I failed and there's nothing else you know\nAnd uh\nAnd I think that's actually not true I think there's always there's always a backup [noise]\nBut um but it was interesting\nTo hear him say that and to hear that you know he had that same kind of fear the same fear of failure that I think\nWe all have some level right and ah so that that was pretty cool I think at some level that's why that's another reason why I got into the start up thing is 'cause you know I had done the corporate thing and they were so many great things about it but you know you had to you had to play their game and I I wasn't up for that in the long run I'm\nGlad you're doing what you're doing I'm Glad to get to join us ...\nAnd I'm Glad you to join us on this trip honestly like he was such an honor to be hanging out with you and the other on perjury or
