down of for saying that we said some bad things\nI think you and Anthony a perfect examples of why America is divided\nAnd see your last call from a meant for Donald Trump about ISIS being abolish ISIS has turned into so many different things uh were acting as ISIS is Airforce even though some people call me and correct me or\nTry to correct me on that I think we're in Syria at least a bombing

always speak our minds because it doesn't matter what you say because\nUh Anthony will attack you are based on the facts as he sees them aired will attack you\nBased on on opposite a and a metric clear polls set of facts and so I guess when you stand in the middle of the road you get run down from both sides and has to be expected but I'm a big guy\nAnd I can take it and will continue to take it for as long as they grant me the privilege of this microphone let's go back to the phones in gym in the mind valley I'm Sorry to put your butt you talking about something that was not germane\nTo what we want to close the hour we're to know what happened is for young lady in the ... valley\nOr some young girls ... mother and dad was a minister and she had taken her life and I didn't know her from Adam better on is what I heard route and the little town people talk and they say that she was more bullied sum up on she committed suicide ever the bowling so I Can't even imagine what that would be like but\nI grew up in Charlotte boy and I was torture were names that called names just\nTo this day I Know that they stay by other\nWell ... how did how did he survive at a gym I I'm I imagine that probably did have money how did you how did you survive that kind of hate\nMy pay federal law word in mind or it in the garage and the good God that's how I Survived it and I kept on going you know I don't look down the sidewalk and chain like I used to it because people call me names I hold my head up high today but they're paid to hate I Know what it looks like bother\nYou you know when the cat's away the mice do play right\nAnd I'm On valley here they are they might have we'll let you go to the people I've ever met I've been around the world or come from a rich family I've travelled extensively and I've never met more people have to pay for my life and what they do is downtown shower it's\nBeen on the hill downtown is like a ghost town all the stores are closed and if it wasn't a big cars come down to the poor people live downtown and boxing the immigrants and they circle around and around and around like the weather it's had on the right before I got on there\nWell I got on there and they've been their neck I had somebody in the car and emotion and they got around these capable and one day if you could I could something's gonna happen there's daycare type and our computer on Facebook and stop people in this town but if you remember\nHigh school reunion with ... where she got back revenge him all did you ever see that movie\nI don't think it was called high school reunion but yeah I remember yes\nYeah well you know and it was called ...\nAnd Jim thank you for your call a gym was talking about hey\nUh I remember the Maya Angelou called the descent hate it caused a lot of problems in the world but it is never solved one problem and so all the people who call here and start talking about who hates soon\nUh I I Wish you would uh remember my Angelo and her quote on that uh All right let's go to a gym in ... what's going on\nAnd on and then when you go to war it up and they give you a million dollar check it goes along with that\n[laughter] you know yeah you know let me hold some\nHello yeah man you can have half of it right away\nI just won't hold on anyway okay listen to Anthony and listening to the I don't um you know as far and a little bit Mm ah actually respond back and forth they were showing that a cage fight\nIt was on TV [laughter] did you did did it look at something like a verbal ... fighter sounds like a verbal get on and\nThen Mike Tyson come out and he said ... and it's so awful and he's got a bit somebody's ear off during ...\nHe is [laughter]\nA man you gotta you gotta except humor but anyway uh hey you know what I always go any farther than that\nYou know I think the reason that so many American men have flocked to those kinds of fights in the cage with the damn it I I don't know what all that I'm unclear I don't as\nA but I think two ways why they're flocking to it is because they put a square skirt on all the quarterbacks on foot ball and you can't hit anybody room and I used to show the highlights of the biggest hits the weak and all that time maybe ten Fifteen Years ago and now if you fall on the quarterback dates or flags on un\nPenalize you and all sorts of things and so I think Americans want something there's ever a brutal my wife ... if I even flip through the channels looking at a desk and she said and I like boxing but not the case of\nSt Louis too brutal is too brutal and we're not that we're looking at stuff in a cage it is awfully brutal man but I think people like it because they cleaned up a football too much and Americans crave violence\nYeah it's pretty crazy with a couple of things I agree with Anthony I'm you know I'm a little more than I Do with Donald because or somewhere along the line okay we're going to have to pay for that massive tax cuts that they gave to a you know to the rich\nIf they would have put some strings attached to it you know on a impulse do you know innovation in the U.S if they were involved training and the U.S and things like that and these companies basically what they did is they turn around in their executives all work off of a\nYou know the bonuses are based on performance of the company if they got all that funny uh you know the list of all the you know the huge huge bonuses that all these uh you know different companies shop you know received their a top executives\nWell what about the ads point when he he wrote us at the dollar back against an accent center that most of these companies that are getting the tax breaks or your local painter somebody was given music lessons the children of your convenience store and all the rest of these grants for that right\nOn I'm not perfect right we'll see we'll see where that parents on January ...\nKnow good it's when it's all going to have that is when everything's going to hit the fan because I think uh you know a in this state you know you've got this Wagner guy you know he wants to track Social Security income uh currently there's Thirteen states attacks Social Security income and uh you know I was just looked it up a good way to know some of them are pretty pretty hefty ah you know pretty hefty taxes\nI think the last ... sea is having a hard enough\nIs it is trying to return and live alone or\nThose limited funds or the to tax that would seem like double taxation to me\nExactly and that's our money any way I mean yeah with that money in there and you know even like you know Anthony said or over the years you know every president that's been and there's been Robin ... you know it's like a pick anything from but\nUm you know I I think we really need to be cautious of a you know who who you vote for him put in there and as far as the landslide you know with Democrat is getting in there\nIf you look at these Trump rallies that he has once or twice a week ago cage building this base I mean you know that base is very strong and um if you know I don't agree with it at all and but what are the Democrats on\nThe Democrats are lining up and you know these kids are getting arrested and that's the thing about that the first thing they asked you when you go for a job you know if you have a criminal record by was arrested for a no protest and um you know I'm the Supreme Court justice getting then we're still on your record\nOkay and a lot of people you know to apply for jobs and that they're not going to be given a job because they got what that one stupid arrest record of it you know they're going to record\nWhen I Hope they're not that's not a felony or and I I have a lot of Tony I'm going to say that as a badge on and like Martin Luther king did from the Birmingham jail\nYeah but if you if you own a business or something like that and you're bringing somebody and do you want somebody that could be disruptive\nAnd yeah it's I guess they look at your background and everything you've ever done don't they\nDo exactly in the last thing I Want to say as a couple of weeks ago I spent some time with Marty a and his wife and you know it's just er and things like that\nAnd ah you know reports of his tail spin they're ... really got me to thinking you know uh we we talk about you know there's all this talk radio all the time we talk about you know I'm you know this that and the other thing you never know you never know when something's going to drag you down I mean he just again\nBut you know reading the article that they had to friday's paper you know fathers infection and things like that um you know it's it's sad I mean he got young kids and you know and it's it's sad that you know you think you've got everything going for him\nAnd then they ... vice right and uh but yeah you're right you never know you you know ... and then the grace of God go why you're right\nYeah but uh you know uh you know say a prayer from Marty in you know hopefully for him and his family I mean whether you agree with is you know ... it doesn't matter you know I'm just hang in there and you are yeah now I got you on radio I got you on record as saying you're going to share some of that\nAnd it's right check you're young you have to check that I get a little ... [laughter] I'd rather have a good\nShow are you doing things by a at the top tax land this Tex gay men switch over the twelve fifty listen to a smart dog shows I invite you to do that if you do get the hell out of dodge only ...

presidential power and his views of the triumph of national security of our Fourth Amendment rights and such but amber weapons Richard I don't know if you know him but he's a longtime correspondent in the United states for one of the London papers I Believe it's the telegraph\nRead an article last week in title and I can't quite get the title exactly but it's something about\nA Brett Kavanaugh's failure to get to the truth\nA portrait goes back to the days of ah the Watergate investigations and Ken Starr Kavanaugh at that time was one of the deputies to Ken Starr and I believe if you recall the circumstances\nOf a one Vince Foster a guy who was a high presidential assistant of some sort of a suicide in Fort Marcy Martin\n... and they had his own to push in uh the fact that they saw in was not suicide alliance was down on that we're seeing Bridget are being interviewed on a couple of shows\nSo you're you're familiar yeah on\nBut but I guess that's completely in keeping with his uh I

governor\nOr senator is from Texas when\nI was being interviewed and she kinda cavalierly made some remarks about the effect about what we can just go take those\nIt goes out and the reporters who are listening kind of their ears perked up and saying you know what exactly are you saying here and I think at that point he may have realized that she engages your mouth before she engages your brain and
