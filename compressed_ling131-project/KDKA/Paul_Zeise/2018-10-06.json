what I the only reason I notice that I didn't you know it's it's kinda funny 'cause it's like I was a witness but I didn't really I I Can't tell you much other than the fact that the guy had like a blue black a bicycle helmet on but he almost got clipped and the intersection\nNot me I Am a veteran screenwriter I Am a veteran I made it Thirty years riding the streets I Know how to do it is like play on it all it is like this\nWas one of the village where it wasn't a bike or you know what I mean\nI don't know but yes you're right and sometimes bad things happen no matter what but ah\nDo you play golf it's a golf they're all okay the golf everything's way you know\nThe deal if you ain't my shot and you'd think if this doesn't go well where can they do poorly and I still be okay you look for a mess it up but not too bad place\nNot too bad place that's the way you ride a bike on the streets it hardly\nGo away to right that's it what's the worst case scenario it hits me in the crotch people giggle and I'm the hero yeah\n[laughter] so uh I I called because you mentioned about China being\nCommunist ... a ... it's a lot more than a Samantha garden on but actually China at this point is kind of it's kind of um runaway capitalism on steroids a\nWhole lot of Chinese business executives own a whole lot of European soccer clubs likely don't they\nYeah and there's I mean there's I mean all the definition of the literal definition communism if everything is okay ...\nYeah I'm there there if you look at the numbers of private privately owned a car's purchased in China a KFC\nBranches anything that you would describe as as a western capitalist I'm kind of\nYeah domain and among the started and\nIt reminds me a little bit of what we saw after the fall of the iron curtain with Russia yeah the oligarchs yeah it's like who's ... if you want to know who's got money in\nThe world look at who is the major stake colder in the time ... European soccer clubs and look through the sponsors are on the jerseys you see and you can't watch English soccer and Nazi Emirates in your sleep there is some bucks there and you look at those boards\nGazprom I think Gazprom sponsors half of the German league\nThat is that the Russia or is that the Brazilian\nNow that the Russian that's the Russian oil come yeah it does run there is a\nBrazilian one that sounds a lot like the Russian one\nPossibly a subsidiary\nSo yeah but that might why would it suggested anybody anybody um\nIt's like I Would think that the people take a look at the way China's economy and the government has developed that it it's kind of a good warning for us to be careful in the way we're going with with um with things because I'm\nYou know there's a there's a really really strong governmental control everything is being is being\nTaken up by very wealthy individuals [noise] um the people for the most part are you know that they have that kind of guys of freedom of choice but they're still things like the Internet or is totally control\nRight well let let here's the deal with that you're talking about a first generation that's ever had relatively any freedom so you know if you're a dog and they let you out of the kennel but they put you on a chain chain still feels a little bit better than the candle\nYeah very true but I I think I think we may pass them on the way I'm a they're on their way while they're already off the top but I mean in terms of the way the government's work if I fear that we're heading and more of that type of um that type of situation with the repeal of net neutrality\nAnd things like that it starts or anything so I'm\nLike Newman said he who controls the male controls in information\nFor our right as you have the bucket to add that didn't that shouldn't the person receiving the male have the bucket on [laughter]\nUm will for rambling I've got a lead us I Can't look at him and not think that and

in school\nAnd now you got if you're yeah if you're if you're the kid you're not going to that school anymore he's being home schooled and part of the lawsuit is nothing that the people did accusing him which now I guess has been recanted none of those people face they mean sort of breath precautions that's also part of the laws that\nWere I I I don't understand all that but\n'cause that's total defamation but anyway he I guess his parents are suing the the parents are the girls and I think that's the source of the civil lawsuits\nI dunk comment on the Kavanaugh situation\nGreg you call you can comment on anything you want Mr\nWell it disturbs me because I heard a woman calling before she sounded like a very nice lady and she's very upset about the appointment of judge Kavanaugh\nJudge Kavanaugh and I think that he's not aware that the witnesses that Chrissy Ford brought forward did not and you could not corroborate her story at all in fact they denied any knowledge\nActually they did to act now the ex boyfriend that talked about that's not true that was a lie\nAnd see that's where it gets ... for people to sort out Greg if I Know I'm only getting part of the information might conspiratorial brains already down I'm going to assume what's up and from the beginning of the investigation when it was specifically said this will be limited in scope investigation\nAnd I said right then well it it it don't mean nothing and it won't mean nothing no matter what gets an ounce and it didn't\nWell they went back they went back and talk to these witnesses and the FBI report you know there was no core operation of of a mess Ford's claims that [noise] so\nYou know you ... have you read the FBI report [noise]\nWell I just watched the senators I'm you know and their assessment of the FBI report the FBI report I don't know that it was disclosed fully to the public\nKnow it wasn't disclosed the it was disclosed one copy\nAnd you had to read at one at a time in a room and it couldn't come out and it was over a thousand pages are hungry US Senators had two hours to read one copy over a thousand pages and here's the man an American average American reads\nOne page every two minutes

government\nIs that just as far as deciding things for every American\n... exactly and and the fact that the they have issued\nServed the a legislative branch\nSo and I'll give you a ... case in point and ... and and this is this goes to this is addressing a lot of the people that call in and say oh they're they're strict constitutional if they're just interpret the constitution it's just a it's just a cover their hind him either cover when they say that those those are those are talking points from way back um the prime example that he said it was the\nUh uh the two thousand election when they stopped the recount um\nThere is in no way shape or form does the constitution say that the Supreme Court had the power to do that yet they did it and they and it was the largely a conservative members of the Supreme Court that stop that recount\nI Believe that was the hanging Chad that was the hanging chads where\nAnd and the video was of all these people locked in rooms in Miami going

enough people in there but the Democrats take over and change the number of justices to eleven\nJust add more and you just explained the roster is what you're saying well\nI I think that there is no set number four justices of the Supreme Court\nAnd they're like guitars Hammond he's the right amount one more\nBut [laughter] that's right how how many they have one more maybe maybe we should only have one yeah and it turned it into a ... borough and just have a room full of people screaming at each other hey we're just\nAt a place just vote\nJoe I don't think that's good advice for Democrats I think that's good advice for every body I thought that was good advice for everybody but for the presidential election and twenty sixteen but the fact remains for that election and twenty sixteen that\nEverybody was screaming and everybody ... and this is where we are now look what happened before and popular boat versus electro college ... yes here's reality\nHalf of the people that were eligible to vote in this country did not and I can appreciate\nVoter suppression arguments and this and that and the other and then\nWhen we get about fifty percent I won't worry more about what people because\nFor every one person and this is on all of us and this is not on any one side or the other but for every one person that doesn't have the paperwork the boat\nAnd they go away from the polling place disappointed for every one person falls in that category I suspect there are dozens and dozens and dozens then had the right paperwork but didn't show up\nAnd that's the there's one thing I keep coming back to with with the president and the Trump Administration and everything where we are politically right now the one great potentially great thing or a lot of people engaged in the process that never paid attention before\nYeah becoming bombed in the process the next five weeks are going to be historic a hundred years from now history books\nOh the history books will be written about what's going on between two weeks ago and six weeks from now I don't know what's going to be written but it will be written about Lou ... mood swings recalling how are you\nA good hey I'm a couple things like\nThe Democrats were pretty much guaranteed to take the house before this mess than I assume they still will but if they do boy Dianne Feinstein really put your this process and and the night to some people I don't think they ever were going to take the Senate and then I don't think they will\nBut no president has ever not ... it's only happened twice average that you're usually going to lose about twenty five see\n'em and with Trump be so hated I think it was going to be more so that's going to be interesting to watch and um I Want to say that I'm surprised people I talk to that um you know Hillary voters or just kind of people don't care about politics\nHow outrage they were you know on behalf of cabin all my father in law's a Hillary voter and big Democrat and he was like well this is kind of be asked and my mom this kind of ... so I I think they overplayed their hand quite a bit\nAnd uh finally on the ball or investigation they may Cape right now there's a ... a grand jury investigation or ... or whatever you know grand jury convened to see if he committed crimes that he was the main\nInvestigated beginning of that and all that comes out that he gets charged with crimes that's going to be an interesting twist and I I don't think it's going to be what a lot of people think it's going to be I don't think I'm there's any evidence of collusion I think they may try to charge him with obstruction of justice but the more pieces\nThat fall like McKay than other people page that were tied to the original investigation if they be proven to be liars are were acting you know whatever maliciously that's got to take some steam out of that and I'm more of what he was handed it\nYou know you hear these things are they true or not that the the obstruction case he said it was a piece of garbage\nAnd he said there was absolutely nothing there and um and and also the attorney who came out this week who said yeah it was all funded by Clinton the original thing and they took that stuff that he has to do\nWhat attorney what attorney came out this week and said that what attorney came up this week and said that low I think last year alone in the ... are you are you there yeah what attorney said that this week he worked\nFor the department of justice and he came out and said yeah we use all quite and stuff and it took that to the FBI or was the big story this week well net at nine thirty press conference on Tuesday was as big as the people in the right hoped\nObviously by ... by a quick question for you yes or do you think's going to have a smaller 'cause I Know you're from the opposite side of the aisle you're an anti Trump guy\nI'm only now now now now wait a minute I'm not an anti anybody die if something than right to uh I'm left
