more rapidly although I've fallen into\n... or ... or early ... hold on\nMore of a whole day and people are accepting technology more to get mental health care where they live and not always having to come into our clinic to get the care\nOf course as friends and family owned the front lines if you will allow me to use that phrase\nAnd wish that uh we are the ones that can oftentimes have the greatest impact initially any advice in recommendations for us to actually be a part of helping our loved ones who are veterans dealing with depression\nYes I think they should leverage family members and friends more than we ever had to bring them into the care a process and help them the veterans will that will let their sentence be known to those that are closest to them first\nAnd windows that are closer to them notice signs and symptoms of risk and they're able to do something about it and that's when we know that were working in the right direction when it comes to suicide prevention\nDr ... to ... when was this executive director of suicide prevention for the U.S department of Veterans Affairs what should we be looking for\nThings should be looking for everyday small changes so subtle little changes like whether or not they're starting to withdraw\nUm are they isolating themselves from family members or friends or the quick to anger um are they engaging in high risk behavior they drinking more than they ever have 'em and and if you're if you see any of those kinds of things done by while I should mention things like hopelessness and helplessness\nAnd get it if they all feel like their burden on themselves or a burden on their family these are very high science side of the Tigris\nAnd what you want to do is stay with them physically present and get them and get care call the veterans crisis line right away and make sure that they get access to quite the stabilization support through through are quite to find so\nOftentimes we want to engage in health and say and do things what should we say and most importantly I think maybe what shouldn't we say\nYes that is such a good question on you want to be non judgmental and you want to validate what's going on for them and say you sort of want to reflect back to them what you're seeing what your\nUm what you what you're hearing in a way that doesn't make them feel um feel worse he don't want them to feel judged in any way whatsoever one of the most important things I've always taught people can say is it okay if you're not okay\nAnd I'm here for you and um when people know that people are genuine and their willingness to support them through a rough period they will open up\nBelieve it or not they will they will tell you their story they will tell you what's going on for them if you ask and then from there you can lose yourself as a resource to to help them you can offer support and you can help facilitate getting in the care\nYou can also and open up your OWN Network maybe they want to engage in and other type of care maybe they want to learn more about going to church maybe they want to get a new job maybe they you know you can really help them with all facets of their life when you're willing to be genuine and offer support\nThere was a brand new campaign with the Veterans Administration is be there is there any changes and it was great is is that we can play a role in all of this

that mean\n[noise] yeah so how I think about a Medicare Advantage plan is it's a plan that gives you a lot of coverage all in one premium so Medicare Advantage plans like the ones offered by Highmark will typically offer\nTypical medical coverage like you might get with primary care visits or surgery or inpatient hospital but also offer things the traditional Medicare doesn't cover they'll Highmark plans include prescription drug coverage dental vision\nBut also the impact that those illnesses have on the individual as well as their families and then outward with communities which is why immunization is very important to us as well because we spend a lot of time with health promotion and preventing disease\nOkay very good and [noise] of Dr ... reasons we brought up to the word vaccination ... few words\nAbout the flu vaccine inch in particular of I'm sure that you're a disciple of actually ... the Russian agent against the influence of our lives in a ... how about this next year last year we were hit pretty hard or are we expecting another big flu a period of her\nHome it's a little earlier tell when the flu season's going to be like a last year was particularly bad because I think that the actual um proteins and antigens that they chose which they choose Eighteen months in advance probably did not have great coverage for the flu that we actually had so I think people\nWho even got the vaccine still got sick may have not got gotten as sick\nSo I think we sort of have to see on some of the first cases are um\nAre are cropping up and uh in western Pennsylvania what that's going to show and what the numbers are going to show despite the fact that the ... the flu season was terrible last year the flu vaccine still um save millions of lives\nAnd you were talking millions absolutely brilliantly life and and also you know in these before the ... actually you know I think was was Nineteen he team where there was a big big epidemic in the United states should flu were\nThousands and thousands maybe millions of people died and uh and it it was kind of interesting that that year of the ... those people who had the flu that year and have them to survive\nActually were part of a covert cohort group leader who developed ... oh I just kind of interested yeah very and she'd go\nYou or a shortly or those ... and I\nHeard I read somewhere maybe it was on the Internet that they are working\nTo be able to produce a vaccine earlier\nThat will be more effective though is I guess it's a ... veil a vaccine the undercover ... so strange ... should have you heard about the other view than any ah any word above that getting closer to being developed to be hurting going\nNo I haven't heard anything for about a year or two and I had heard that they had started into some human trials along those areas and there were several different formulations that they had been\nElation that they had been trying with different strains as well as the you know the hope that one day we'll be able to vaccinate one time for all strains so\nWhich would be great amount of work to it and it was good to know that they're working on those who do but it but it also is do we understand the science that it is it's not perfect and there are various strange for\nThe flu to give you a flu symptoms just like there are many many stranger give you the common cold I think it's probably up to a couple of hundred no and that's why we're probably never going to have a vaccine for the common\nCold and yet the unfortunate thing is that viruses are very smart so they often will change and and modulate they'll make disease I'm more problematic for humans\nYou know so we just have to try to be smarter than the borrowers who if they they they come up with a mutation that is going to keep them from\nOf the er or ... keep them are able to cause the flu and individual we just have to get smarter than they are ...\nThere was a study that came out from ah Cleveland Clinic that was very interesting that if you get the flu vaccine and like every year even if the vaccine doesn't match particularly well to the disease there is something to be said that your immunity is even better\nSo that may have an about is for the streams that were there and they're getting\nAnd they're getting sort of revamp within that said oh I'm so set a vaccine so that the ... let's go do\nThat and I think that's why off in a lot of health care workers whose jobs require them to get a flu vaccine tend not to get the flu because we've been doing this for our whole lives\nAll those great well another vaccine the locally has has had certainly some exposure to wearing a sober recently in Israel's Modi Griffin who sits in the studio does a ... a morning show or\nA developed or the character of his mouth which of and he's a really positive and you take care of all age groups you know from little babies and and the senior citizens or what is your feeling about huge PV vaccine for both boys and girls\nSo the H. P. V. vaccine is probably the only vaccine that we have at this time that actually can prevent cancer and it has\nShown to prevent cancer um in in women cervical cancer and it has actually shown to prevent cancer so um vocal cord cancer oral cancer in both men and women\nAnd I am a big a proponent of this vaccine um there are some minimal side effects that can happen from this vaccine that scare people off a bit\nThere's been associated I'm a a fainting at the time of getting the vaccine and so on us at the site but other than that there is nothing a worrisome about this vaccine so you know I think it's I think it's an excellent vaccine and you can start giving it as as early as nine and all the way up to twenty six\nOkay for boys and girls go to our of Oso launch an a repellent forest hills Helen your first caller give of course\nYes uh this friend of mine got this senior flu vaccine a couple of years ago and she claimed she had a reaction to it\nAnd what she told her doctor the doctor said well sometimes that happens but you're better off getting it because it protects you against more germs and viruses so she said she's been getting it I guess she's got it three years in a row now and well the one year\nShe said I'm whether if she got sick from the vaccine or not I don't know that she she still gets a senior vaccine and I wondered is there more things in that senior vaccine that protects you other than the regular vaccine flit for the flu\nI think sometimes they also called a double dose [laughter] oh yeah ... ... what about the view of advise your in your patients to get that a double\nDose of vaccine ... absolutely everybody over the age of sixty five should receive the high dose vaccine and it actually has four times the amount of the vaccine\nWhat they found is as we tend to age our immune systems aren't as robust as they are when we're a lot younger so it just takes that little extra push of the extra to help get\nOur immune systems primed and you know label to fight the flu\nBut I think last year there was a more of a scarcity of the four do lose hope it does have a high to hide those and uh they ... they ran out of it actually of early on\nWe also like to use the high to some people that have um\nOf medical conditions that make them at much higher risk of having complications of the flu\nAnd those are people that have cardiac disease respiratory disease COPD asthma or possibly a diabetes or if you have and I mean a logic problem that allows you to receive vaccine we allow we like people to have 'em to be able to get those vaccines as\nWell OK well hell of a problem with the answer your question and they're recommending how does pretty well over sixty ...\nAnother calm at my grandfather died of flu in Nineteen Eighteen or Nineteen Nineteen he went to work that day and they brought him home from work he got sick at work and have died that night that's how fast it killed\nA U.S food that was a terrible terrible strain and uh we're so fortunate that we have the vaccine now and and and even if you do get the flu we of that or medical care now and we'll have to be admitted or you know but it still it still last year killed a fair number of people in other states\nThank you so much for the call Helen and a good good luck to you and those folks over sixty five or which are qualified for all going to get the double

move for cancer\nSo first of all you really need to involve your oncologist the person who's actually prescribing the chemotherapy there are probably some times when your immunity will be\nA better than other times and those would be the times that you would and you should get the vaccine but it's really about the cycle of the chemo and where your immunity or you're white blood cell count is based on um how that chemo as being given to you\nAutomatically recommending it but it's a it's a discussion that you need to have with your oncologist because if there's going to be a time period that your bone marrow as receptive and your immune system as receptive to being able to take the vaccine in and use it properly and and uh make a adequate response to the vaccine then yes it is something that you should\nGet okay what about [noise] is there any medication that somebody could be all were recalled ... book she\nWas nuts\nLisa they're not that I'm aware of okay\nSo ah no matter

gives a lot of faulty information and unfortunately what that does is it creates almost um you know some some fear\nAnd some panic and then people don't vaccinate but what people need to realize is
