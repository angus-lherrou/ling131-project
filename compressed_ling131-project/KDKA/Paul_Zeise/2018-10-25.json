Obama former secretary of state and presidential candidate Hillary Clinton setting off in the men's investigation on Wednesday and do whether figures vilified by the rights were being targeted from Washington to New York to Florida where Congress woman who is the former chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee has\nHer office or the authorities intercepted a wave of crudely built devices that were contained in manila envelopes\nIn the center of Manhattan the time Warner center and elegant elegant office and shopping complex was evacuated because of a pipe bomb sent to CNN\nWhich has its new your officers there it was addressed to John Brennan a critic of President Trump who served as Mr Obama's CIA director none of the devices harmed anyone it was not immediately clear whether any of them could have one law enforcement official said investigators we're examining the possibility that they were hoax devices constructed to look\nLike bombs the FBI says the devices were similar to one found Monday at the home of George Soros the billionaire philanthropist and liberal donor in a New York city suburb\nBecoming less than two weeks before the midterm elections the discovery of the pipe bombs reverberated across a country already on edge during a new question\nAbout questions rather about whether political discourse as grown to vitriolic Mrs Clinton Mr Obama Mr Soros and CNN have all figured prominently in right wing political attacks many of them have been led by Trump is often referred to major news organizations as the enemy of the people and has shown contempt\nFor CNN Mr Trump called them despicable act speaking from the White House quote in this time in these times we have to unify Mr Trump said we have to come together and send one clear strong I mistaken message that acts or threats of political violence of any kind of no place in the United states of America joining us live on the disc Institute of Pittsburgh\nExplosive devices Melba Melba several

Waters and Debbie Wasserman Schultz them also reportedly been targeted I'm\nHeather joins us again on the line and also joining us Joanne from point breeze Hi Joanne\nHave I'll go ahead\nYou know the thing that really gets me let's not sugarcoat this at all it's it's called the U L T\nA following that Mr Trump I don't even want to call him president anymore because he has stirred up so much this gusting\nJust awful things in this country\nUntil it it's just the call a following any time somebody can't find anything wrong with someone no matter how negative it is something is absolutely wrong and this man I guess is the president\nI don't know what to say he knew people voted for him\nAnd this is what you're getting how dare they send to the Democrats how dare they they will send it to anybody this is Mr Trump or presidents from cult following that you're doing is thank you so I don't I don't people don't try to sugarcoat it 'cause he's responsible thank you\nAre joined thanks so as you and I already said Heather uh there is an argument that he is responsible for creating an atmosphere or in which the things like this could occur although you know a lot more I suppose before we draw any definitive conclusions or what do you think\nWell I you know I just think it's an extreme position of of Joanne because she doesn't have any fact she's assuming all of that so you know ... we don't know who the person\nIs he wants people to knock out\nA report or is it help pay for their legal defense it it's not only is it obviously on President presidential but it certainly is encouraging an element to be more bold I I I Know the weekend after he was elected I happen to be going through the turnstiles at a Steelers game\nAnd there are people saying things that I haven't heard in my adult life\nUm that I felt were correlates of of a new a feeling that people were emboldened to say thanks\nHow are you talking about you are reluctant to spell it out but it you mean racist things or sex or saying yeah OK yeah\nYes and um you know I'm ... I I Do feel I don't have any scientific evidence but I feel that people believe now that because he speaks in these\nAggressive manner tones that people feel that they can do that now and get away with it and it's not\nIt's not that he has done away with political correctness which is not good for anyone and I'm against political correctness but we can't have incivility we can't have people I'm disparaging other's weak and when he does it as the president I Believe that he encourages others to do that\nI'm ... and it's it's horrible for the country\nOr Jeff Zucker president have CNN issued a statement that said there is a total and complete lack of understanding at the White House about the seriousness of their continued attacks on the media the president and especially the White House press secretary should understand their words matter that's far they've shown no comprehension of that [noise] uh what do you think of that\n[noise] well I think I don't think it's that far out of bounds I I'm not sure it's it's completely correct but it's\n... ... they're setting dangerous precedent yes\nAnd also haven't mentioned that a fifth devised was sent to Mr Obama's attorney general Eric Holder also with the uh Wasserman Schultz return address um\nWhich really I you know the the the objects of these um bombs really don't make any sense I mean you know really what does Obama doing me I get out campaigning\nRight except that they're all ... you know sworn enemy so to speak of uh the President Trump\nReally I mean it seems as other enemies more important than than those people [noise]\nUm well but he's still derives President Trump or he's always derided the and attorney general holder might run for president in anybody who might run for president he's busy or yeah these yeah\nOnce again I mean I I cannot I don't in good conscience can I say that that these pipe bombs are correlated with President Trump there's no evidence of that\nWell no I agree I I think ... at least when I'm implying is it's a possibility exists that whoever was was inspired by President Trump another President Trump actually directed this or is happy out so but\nBut I don't even know we ... we that's just that's just pure speculation\nIs we have to we we need to wait until we find out who did this\nUm well you may need to wait I don't know I'm not going to lose weight by ... I hear what you're saying you're absolutely right that it's almost like election that's that was the fact that especially here is Sean and turns them Hi Sean\nHey John you as a libertarian right I don't have a horse in this race either way right\nBut I Am just dumbfounded\nPeople still can only point a finger at the other side\nRight but I Am just dumbfounded that people still can only point a finger at the other side and not here and see what's being reported on the news and realized that it's coming from both sides\nWill these pipe bombs aren't necessarily coming from both sides\nWell no I'm Talking about the rhetoric that led up to it I mean [noise] I mean we could we could stand here and point back and forth back and forth about you know a costing people restaurants or town hall meetings and\nI don't know that all the little and see a ... people in restaurants versus sending them a pipe bomb I Would say the letters are much more it saying okay\nSo what's the point of them this way so that the president makes a gesture at about something and the leadership on the other side says to go out and to do this\nI mean Maxine Waters had to do something I don't know that she's technically in the leadership\nBoth parties are the blame here\nYeah I hear what you're saying I don't agree I\nThink they're both they blame for what eight and\nUm I watch all the news what does that matter\nThen you're only hearing what you want to hear nope\nI'm not living in the bottle thanks so much for your call Sean I Can't go along with the false equivalency that harassing somebody in a restaurant is sending is the same thing is sending them a pipe bomb\nUm just stated is as it is speculation on my part that Trump may have created the atmosphere for this is also speculation on your part that both sides are to blame both sides of the blame for creating an atmosphere of instability but let's wait and see which side if if the the you know unless unless as you point out how to read just a mentally deranged nuts\n[laughter] right\nWho's not particularly I Would think you would have to be to send pipe bomb\nRight I I Can't argue with that so\nI'm more or do we know if he even it's an American national oh no\nWe absolutely right we don't know I haven't seen any reports indicate anybody knows anything yet other than these pipe bombs were sent\nYeah the yeah the wildly speculating okay for a wildly speculating the Russians interfered with the election um you know if someone else trying to interfere this is two weeks before the election\nAs it is someone trying to you know to to send messages and and and get people to believe this is a Trump supporter I I don't know I we don't have any we don't have the information\nAre true enough or I guess it's just\nIt's hard not to at least consider the conclusion and then there's unprecedented spewing of hatred and accusations and statements in favor of violence against reporters ... statement in favors statements in favor of violence against people being put in a police car who've been arrested but not convicted yet you don't have to\nLower their head just go ahead and hit him in the head I mean I don't think I've ever heard of ... ...\n... yeah exactly all of that we know and that should be in that yeah you know what are you ... what he says well he says he's less he says I didn't say it like that they Access Hollywood tape when his voice was on the take\nA mic says on the debate gets an access I guess it never occurred to Joanne and the other Dick Tracy is that it might be\nComing from the left ever since uh especially since none of the bombs went off all that's just part isn't a nonsense at a\n... former Republican congressman said today if you believe that that it was a dirty trick by the left you know we're willing double think than uh\nNonsense at a David Jolly former Republican congressman said today if you believe that that it was a dirty trick by the left you know are willing double think

about that you can obviously you could do damage if you abuse anything but I'm a I'm hoping that people will stop drinking so much if they smoke a little more but that's not always the case I just seen as a less harmful drug but then again who knows\nBut in Colorado experiencing it at like I'd market increasing automobile accident\nSince I see I don't know how much propaganda that is most of the poor to hear good occasionally hear the one like you just said that bad things are happening as a result but\nIt sounds like they're few and far between at least from what I've heard read thus far above back to the um\nExplosive packages eight six six thirty nine when ten twenty we have callers who want to talk about that including Steven Duquesne Hi Steve\nHello Hi Heather how John enjoying the conversation well let me say right off the containing my fury a\nThere is no equivalence between the performance of the Republicans Trump in particular and the Democrats there is not if you have evidence brand get paid too much attention to the news and have for decades we are led by a demagogue\nI'm sure both of you know what a demagogue is anyone that's out there that does a police look it up if you've watched any of the Trump rallies and by the way Heather and Sean I listen to the news got exactly the same person you did\nConcerning what Trump had to say tonight that wasn't a contemporary extent Bahraini us that was being read someone wrote that for him\nI agree but you know\nThe situation requires seem like going out yeah getting off the cuff but at least he\nKnew that much I'm thankful for that if nothing else save\nCertainly so so again Trump is a demagogue he takes advantage of ignores me motion the place to the crowd Scaramucci was it was a visit Scaramucci's up the gentleman's name it was a communique yeah\nYeah it was fired yes he was\nInterviewed a couple of days ago and was asked by a by the interviewer of the comments on the fact\nThat if Trump knows that he's lying when he speaks to the crowd why does he continue to do it in Scaramucci's answer was because it keeps them rouse adopt it keeps them interested and it keeps them anxious to support him in support of the Republicans that I think the way he does\nThe second dimension this is in this is an codes that the director of national intelligence of the VP in charge of ads for Facebook a number of of a highly regarded or publications over the last year or so gets all was stabbed was the fact that the Russians\nHave have infiltrated to a large degree or social media and are using psi ops if that's the right word to stir up American people\nTo to to be against one another and that may sound a little far fetched but again I've read too many sources and again Dan Coats I mean anybody going to anybody controversy what he's going to say whatever he comes out and says it I mean he's the guy who has all the hotel right his fingertips\nOr Steve thanks thanks so much for your call 'em before I go on to a needed in the case for do you have any for their thoughts Heather and I just keep it in the phones\nI Would just say that I remember when I was on air and uh I I Am an interviewer said to me so do you think the Russians interfered with our election and this was in twenty early twenties\nIt's on air and uh I I Am an interviewer said to me so do you think the Russians interfered with our election and this was in twenty early twenties sixteen hour that they couldn't interfered I'm like wow\nNow because I was crazy and and now we find out you know that they clearly interfered and they have they have tons of employees doing this and it's a state sponsored activities so Dan Coats said that's what they're doing I I Believe that now\nUh yeah and I can understand your initial skepticism because it did sound crazy but I agree also that it seems like the evidence is port incense here's a Anita in the case for it high Nita\nOh hello I'm packages where they can deliver for where they um than there are U.S Postal service ...\nIt was my impression that it was U.S Postal service but I should verify that beyond them set up and down if you heard anything about that other one way or the other\nI I think it was through the mail because they have a port that you just played said they had the stamps in there you go to link\nRight so apparently the u._s. mail Anita\nFor I don't know I thought that's supposed to be X. rayed and and you know they take pictures and\nI don't know I guess here and now apparently they don't X ray everything I guess well\nBut I think what the report was saying is it that that the person that constructed them now what the U.S postal service would pick up and what they what ... and they constructed them so they would defy detection\nGotcha or anything else in either no okay thanks them [laughter] are allergic to the north held Hi Alex\nHey John how is that what you're going to I'm sure that it's pretty obvious [noise] the the president\nWho is

CBS News\nComing up right after news with rows so we are going to talk about to what extent the president may be on to something when he says the media holds some of the blame when it comes to\nThe heightened state of things in this country he put the tweet earlier today not laying all of the blame there but saying that some of it does belong with them and that they need to get their act together didn't bother using the term to\nMainstream media must clean up its act\nFast interesting\nLet's talk about this idea Andrew county is joining us he's a director for needy innovation at point park university joining us on the disc Institute of Pittsburgh new Zion Andrew welcome back to Katie gay thank you very much for ... give me some time\nThings around mount\n... let's talk about this issue if we could do for among because I asked a question earlier on my Facebook page as well to\nWhat extent as a percentage basis do you give the responsibility to the president to the parties and to the media in your estimation\nIs the media playing any role at all in the current climate that we're experiencing in politics today\nI think before we talk about the media before the president calls out the media you have to hold themselves accountable for the president goes around calling the enemy to call in the media the enemy of the people\nCelebrating the the ... of journalists to by the Republican Senate candidate in ... in Montana ... calling out fake news get me out his own fake news awards in fighting all these people up into anger and then getting surprised when it comes back and incomes around\nIf you talk about what the media's responsibility as a question there is what do you consider to be the media right is it a good journalists are out there doing the stories every day we're digging for the truth or trying to figure out what's really going on\nThey burn your responsibility for that those people are just doing accountability journalism they're holding the freedoms that all of us hold dear it's the whole we just had a a conference at Duquesne University this week about the first amendment was all about what journalists are doing to maintain those freedoms in America\nBut if you're talking about the talking heads and the people who are whipping things up the folks at Fox News or the folks at MSNBC who are out there purposely whipping things up there they find certain things to talk about in the computer with them up and lift him up and they get people excited about it\nYou could say they bear some responsibility as well\nIs it fair to say that when it comes to the cable news outlets Fox CNN MSNBC [noise] that the aspect of what's actually news that's delivered on those channels is rather minimal as compared to the editorializing in the commentary [noise]\nSo I think you have to separate out first Fox them as MSNBC or they're really coming out of from the logical perspectives where their\nCurry favor with a certain segment of the population where you know Fox is really going for a conservative leaning view or an image if she's going really for a liberal left leaning viewer or even to the point where you know they're\nThey're skewing information that way and then when they do tell the news and they come back around and talked to who come back around and get people whipped up on it uh CNN I see them much more of the middle of it are although your to your point they\nStart out with a little bit of news at the beginning of the hour but then it's talking heads the rest of the way and that's when you see people going back and forth and have these arguments avenue subscriptions and you can see the American people are just getting ripped up by all of that\nWhy do you think that line seems to be more blurred there than say in radio as an example like ... ... classic case of just regular plain old talk shows you have Mardi Gras than from nine to noon and then you have the midday show that\nLike ... ... classic case of just regular plain old talk shows have Mardi Gras than from nine to noon and then you have the midday show that ... been hosting now a from noon to three we know that there is clear commentary there there may be some people who make news as they are talking\nBut it's all it's about opinion and then we clearly know that when Paul does the news in the morning or rose does the news in the afternoon at the top and bottom we can differentiate into why do you think it's so difficult to find those clear lines when it comes to cable\nSo I think what's on the the example of radio you've given example of people who are covering local issues local concerns people who are interested in telling stories of of what's really happening and you talk about the work that Marty during our Alice is joining they're actually doing real reporting and they're talking with real people\nUm but you know a lot of the root of what we're looking at today starting conservative talk radio right with the Rush Limbaugh laws and queen in the morning and ... and those folks who are out there from a very\nBombastic prospective getting people excited about it so to that extent I don't think there's much differentiation between you know the biased\nInformation might find them some TV cable channels versus a you know the radio talk shows that are designed to where people up and get them excited\nDo you see a difference between the Web content of outlets as compared to what may be on the air like for a Fox or and MSNBC or for CNN since those seem to be the ones that the president is talking about a whole lot more than a local stations that's for sure\nYet so it's interesting I I have some I I have a a good close friend who works at Fox News and you know there are other great reporters there at Fox News and you see they're going out and they're doing the story's\nPretty straight down the middle but then when it comes back and it's on some of the talk shows where it gets bandied about um that's where it gets it's you and him and the perspective or out of out of whack but yeah\nIf you look at their online information or you look they're strict news information it's often you know right on the money it's their their tried to go after the fact they're trying to go after the truth but then as you mentioned before\nThen for the rest of the hour after the vote a little bit of news that comes out then it's all about perspective on that news and that's where the lines get blurred between what's really use and what's really opinion and what's really a reporter and what's really a a columnist or or somebody who's a opinionated\n... number one last question for you are you concerned at all the money is such a driver and the profitability for news that it has had a negative impact\nYeah for sure absolutely I mean on on both sides there are\nPeople trying to make money by saying outrageous things right to more outrageous things you can say or to curry favor with a certain population that you're going to make more money people are going to listen to you and on the other side we seen of money get drained out of hard news reporting just straight down the middle reporting\nNot a lot of money and that there was tons of cutbacks are far fewer journalists out asking tough questions these days there are far fewer outlets that are running that work either\nAndrew
