is right down there are a very strong and I'll tell you what this man as you say it's been a bottom feeder he's been on the take\nIs the biggest liar about his whole life his whole career how he got all his money\nAbout his girl friends talk about people that don't recall things seems to me went through the whole thing was Stormy Daniels then all of a sudden we find out he was right on the phone with his attorney making illegal deals but that's not what I Want to talk about tonight but first of all mentioned the other night on entertainment tonight\nThey went down and they found a home with is PJ was one of the the boys that were at this party it was July first it's in Mr\nMr Kavanaugh's diary where they went there for ... which is Bruce\nThey went into that at home they they they just set of row houses the people in that particular house\nThat were owned by this PJ parents they couldn't get into so they went into one exactly like it and then there they had the narrowest their way up to their bedroom the bedroom right across from the bathroom\nI don't know what Mr Trump is saying but there were quote recalled quite a bit about how it happened when it happened in the summer it was most likely July wanted it was right there in Kavanaugh's in Kavanaugh's calendar another thing\nThey had a ... on the today today on TV they had\nBarge he signed a letter when he was making plans to go to the beach with his buddies and rent a beach often get loaded all week\nAnd that they talk about a morphing all over the place anyway\nHe signed that letter is born in his own handwriting\nOwn handwriting though that that book about bart overcrowding off with the judge wrote it's all about Mr Brett Kavanaugh and all the shenanigans with women and with breaking et cetera\nThe man I lied under oath repeatedly about things\nHe didn't know definitions of of the devil's triangle and and he said that was a a a drinking game a lot of this was really ridiculous ally directly and I'll tell you why they didn't put him in with the FBI it's because the lies to the FBI that's a felony so that's why they did an interview him\nBut another thing that that\nI thought was very interesting and this whole matter has to do with with um um him and and and some of the other reported things that went on\nWith a I think that's missed Ramirez and and the\nAnd even the the the other witness that the ... and you know the Trump made a made fun of the of the of the other attorney there but it's funny I'll just about everything that guy said was true when it came to the whole Stormy Daniels affair\nAbsolutely gym or want to get some other calls but I appreciate your ah informed commentary here's Dana Point reside Joanne\nHigh there's two things I Do want to say this ah alert this this is like heat and Pierre so many countries in so many people\nHe put this alert because we have no idea what might be coming our way from from anywhere and everywhere or the other thing this whole thing with this Kavanaugh it reminds me of Clarence Thomas Anita Hill\nAnd also a ex President Clinton who said I did not have sex with that woman he don't remember he didn't do it\nAnd I'm telling you if these Republican congressmen and senators put this man in on the Eighteenth ... for the voting in November I'm telling you people come out because it's a big thing against women\nSo I don't care if you like him or what's going on you need to come out and vote and and so we can have checks and balances that we need\nTo and thank you very much on the dollar bank instant access\nTim from butler I noted Trump supporters says at least is big fat lie or has done more good for the country than the bigger liar who replaced should America agrees\nUh well we're going to start finding out whether America agrees in the midterms are Tim and I think the big blue waves coming and we're going to find out that most of America doesn't agree actually even when he was elected most of America didn't agree the press the president should be president because he was he lost the popular vote as you know by three million votes\nUm [noise]\nLet us go back to the phones and here's Dale in Washington ideal\nEvening sir evening hey listen we're so much we don't know what to believe number one number two talking about making up for the people\nIt's no coincidence that this woman it's coming forward at the time that you're trying to be appointed for a lifetime job thank you very much\nYou're welcome yeah there is no coincidence she looked up and she said hey that's the guy who sexually assaulted me in high school you know what I don't think he should be on the Supreme Court it's totally not a coincidence it's a matter of conscience\nShe may be ignored his career when he was a a rather obscure federal judge but a lifetime appointment with the opportunity to have major effect on things that were allowed to do and that we are not allowed to do\nAnd the law in general for the rest of his life and he's a relatively young men yeah it is no coincidence\nIf somebody had evidence that Brett Kavanaugh had murdered somebody and buried 'em in the back yard but they didn't come\nCome forward until right before he was a a right after he was nominated ... do you think we want to hear from that person and maybe prevent the guy from corn on the Supreme Court it's it's okay to find out stuff at the last minute and here's another thing we're finding out at the last minute Brett Kavanaugh as a liar\n[noise] um\nAnd it only matters because what else is the lying about they asked him what the devil's triangle was a which he had written about in his year book that is when two men have sex with a woman he claimed it was about\nA drinking game that's ludicrous it's absurd nobody's ever heard of a drinking nobody's ever heard of a drinking game called the devil's triangle because it doesn't exist\nAnd so he lied about that they asked him what ... have you heard of that and as your book uh that uh pardon the expression is about anal sex he said it was about flatulence\nSo don't get me wrong I don't care if he is talking about sex with three people or a sex at a particular a style\nBut don't lie about it because you're under oath and you're testifying and tried to get on the Supreme Court if you drank a little bit too much from time to time in high school and college I can do that I'm sure I did the same thing\nAnd millions of Americans have but he says he didn't he said he was a tea totaling although he did admit that he liked beer and he did say that a number of times and then end up itself was just odd\n[noise] um so the point is if he's lying about little things he said he hadn't\nHeard about other allegations against him until they appeared in the news media\nBut he had already been texting his friends to deny these other allegations which proves he lied about that he did already know prior to the story going public about other allegations accusing him of sexual\nMisconduct but my point to to start the show and I'll play it again after the bottom of our news is that what do you like having a or not Donald Trump's\nBehavior in publicly shaming ridiculing and mocking Christine Blasey Ford who millions believe is telling the absolute truth that she was sexually assaulted that's unprecedented horrible inexcusable inexcusable unconscionable behavior by a president of the United states\n\nAnd Sarah Huckleberry Sanders had the nerve today to deny he was mocking her because these people have absolutely positively no relationship with

of sexual abuse be they young old yes step child predators represents all they do they don't they don't lend themselves to chill W ... or children nobody\nI now however we're dealing with the Catholic Church brown you also understand that the statute of limitations in Pennsylvania is all encompassing as well that would be any sexual abuse of the child in Pennsylvania it's not just regard to the church and that's one of the church is\nYou know issues is that they're saying it's directly targeting the church and it's not\n[noise] has there been an update 'em in terms of whether or not or you can persuade enough lawmakers to change the laws regarding the statute of limitation though\nIn the last three weeks I've met a quite a few um we have some people on the ground\nWe have some people on

cautiously are cautiously optimistic you know these kinds of things usually come down to the last eleventh hour um I Know that both sides to this issue on to see some kind of a reform\nAnd there is talk a but both sides have still some ways to come together in terms of you know agreement\nOr we've also been talking about um a allegations of sexual assault or in the uh\nAttempted confirmation of judge Kevin on the allegations of Christine Blasey Ford says we get more callers and emails\nWe may be mixing our topics even though there is somewhat similar problem here is a blaring doorman Hi

incident or was there another girl that house or with her ... anywhere around that area that says oh yeah I remembered that answers as any woman come forward today or\nIn the last couple of weeks that said oh yeah I remember her talking about that anybody\nI'm take I'm assuming you don't believe are [noise]\nAh I I had somebody has enough evidence to really you know\nI'm just looking at it from pure pure others I mean has anybody come forward that she went to school what was our friend or anybody that's a female that she knew that said oh yeah I remember her talking about that her telling me about that I I don't know I I've been following it but I I haven't heard of anybody coming forward has there been any body\nThe only one of the room according to her other than Brett Kavanaugh was mark judge the FBI interviewed him apparently that report will be released\nOr at least discussed tomorrow in the United States Senate\nRight but what I'm saying is has any other female from hers from you know from that time come forward that knew her but said yeah I remember her met she had to me or saying\nSomething about or you know she did mention it to a therapist or ... years ago and attend the therapist knock it out\nThat was that was the second question um she said that she recanted or Rick how did this story under psychotherapy or or some sort of\nThing that made her remember this this event\n... no no no he was telling your therapist you know what happened to me this happened to be a long time ago and then I'm Still affected by it\nYes a cycle of is just basically talk therapy I have I have a question for you what does it take you to believe her\nUm I'm not saying what I Believe or not I'm I'm just saying I'm I'm I'm asking is or anybody else that she was or anybody else at that at a house that that night you know ...\n... ... I don't know uh we'll see what the FBI report says are clearly you don't believe or I Know you may not be saying whether you believe it or not but you clearly did not\nJim your thoughts you know it's\nFirst survivor to come forward let alone in the national news um there has to be some credibility there now that's why we have laws that's why we have courts um and needs to be all the evidence needs to be laid out you know when we're watching this in the news and the sensationalized um\nOh I was um you know both sides are going to say well there's not enough of this and there's not enough of that ah you played a little clip their of our our a president and I am a Republican all the way I vote both sides based on the\nOther candidate and I'm appalled at the ... the remarks from the statements he made 'cause he's basically\nScaring people into coming forward and that's exactly what I'm all about\nYeah let's um [noise] I hate to be so redundant but these remarks are so horrible I think they bear repeating\n[noise] right [noise]\nWell do you think it was it was one day I'll do it how\nDid you get home I don't remember how did you get there I don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years ago was that I don't know [noise]\nBy the way he's missed characterizing her remarks she said it was the summer of Nineteen eighty two he later says uh was it upstairs downstairs I don't know she said it was upstairs she she did not fail to remember everything and he is lying as he often does about about what you said\n[noise]\nActually it was it and I don't know where [noise] where was I don't know if that's the only thing are in [noise]\n\nAnd a man a man shot a\nMan's life isn't Saturday So going to be a federal judge that's another thing I found objectionable about the testimony before the Senate Judiciary committee he's like my life has destroyed my family is\nJust dried I thought what did they spontaneously can bust their at home they're not destroyed damn they're embarrassed go I mean I understand uh\nI have my own private tutoring and life coach business and I can tell you for the last Fifteen Years I Will not meet with a student loan it only takes one person to come forward or to say one thing\nCertainly and I'm not suggesting that there aren't false accusations of course there are\nRight and you know that's why\nYou know this person this shouldn't be being a debated in the news nobody has enough information to be able to make a an accurate judgment and when the president in the United states with the power and the voice and the office behind them makes remarks like that I think we should all be ashamed and it doesn't matter if you're a Republican or Democrat\nI Would agree let's see if we can squeeze Susie from Ohio and before the break Hi Suzy\n[noise] um I Don how are you good and yourself [noise] ah\nWell I've been looking at you know what everyone else has been looking into water the cat and first of all there were more than one person at at come forward with the FBI and and the deal that does that happen more than one woman\nAnd everything and people have to convince her that there are like happening this shit I've got a boat and that's like your show about when they have ... you're just like Trump is cut from the ... that in my opinion and I'm not wrong about that [noise]\nAll right Suzie thank you got to go to break soon but [noise] um we talk more about this um gym after the break but it is so difficult for people to come forward and this is why\nThis is exactly what John this there's no doubt that there's a there's a guilt there is a shame um and people wait a very long time\nAnd you're going to be attacked and even even if you're hardly credible yeah but\nHere's the other thing this woman came forward knowing she was going to be attacked you just don't do that unless you're being truthful\nYou know just dealing here with the church or in Pennsylvania obviously that's not just Pennsylvania it's all over the world the average age is fifty two years old\nYou know you're you're Eighteen you have two years back in my day now it's up to the I Believe it's thirty for a thirty for civil and fifty for criminal\nUm but people still don't come forward um there's too much shame and then you go on with your life a little bit you build a new life and you start to think to yourself well why not why come forward now why expose myself when I have no legal\nYou know ability to do anything about it you know the laws in this state and probably many many others and stop child predators and I are going to go from state to state working on these laws is not just going to be of Pennsylvania thing the laws in this state protect predators\nOver victims and I think you know we're hearing some attitudes here from people out there in the world and I don't put them down for their opinion\nBut they're basically saying you know he's not guilty she is guilty well she wanted it she didn't want her that she doesn't remember you know trust me I I was in a hotel room with a manned attacking me and I felt everything and I smell everything and I can still smell it\nBut after I spent um over the bed and he was climbing up off the floor\nAnd up off the floor I can tell you I don't remember a whole lot until we were driving home you know trauma is trauma and it affects everybody differently\nAnd a good for you and fortunate for you to you happen to be strong enough or that you could do that\nYou know not all victims are able to do that he uh he attempted\nTo wrestle for over two years when I was always this real easy you know push 'em off and he ... he quits on this particular occasion I felt like you had nine arms and I was so stunned with fear and\nUh uh I I couldn't even describe it to you but it felt like you had nine arms and I felt like I wasn't strong enough I felt weak in that moment and uh\nThere was a lot of this fear\nA Howard on developing it's

to be that angrier that vindictive and he said he thinks the reason is\nThat we remember when we're talking like you are like you and I are next to each other you know we remember that there are so many more values and and historical memories and whatnot that we share whether our differences are in age and sex in religion in whatever\nThose things tend to be forgotten when we get on social media

a look at the um [noise] a closer look at the vote in the three rust belt states Pennsylvania and Michigan or Wisconsin that were as you know the most crucial and\nUh looking at Pennsylvania um [noise] it um I I discovered the county in the different part of the state than you are north east part of the state was earn county\nAnd a Trump won on the strength of uh he's showing in the northeast part of the state and this one county was earn um\nThere's a traditionally democratic county hadn't voted for Republican since Nineteen eighty eight Bush senior and Obama had carried the county twice but its search on the other direction for Trump and twenty six\nAnd he won the county by twenty points and built up such a margin there that sixty percent of the victory margin\nOr in Pennsylvania so without this one county he wouldn't have won the state or perhaps the presidency to the extent that Pennsylvania's demographics are similar to Michigan Wisconsin so I I went down that was earn county and started talking to voters um and uh\nI think they're all different and I'm a I'm a particularly um was particularly moved by the tail of wine or an older woman named when that Delano ah she's\nSeventy two\nAnd she had an experience as a result of the election that that I think many families throughout the country did which was that this country this uh this election was so heated so contentious so divisive\nThat um it caused a splits in many families and she had a falling out with our grandson\nWhich she told me about gee he was a a a student at Tulane University finishing his senior year at the time and she told me that she texted him\nThe morning after the election and said how proud she was there have been happy that Trump won\nAnd he didn't hold back in his response she was very anti Trump thought that Trump's election was bad for the country and she shared these series of a tax with me and I I I I'm\nReproduce them verbatim in the book because I think they illustrated a perfectly the extent of the philosophical divide that we still have in this country\nI was able to read an excerpt of that exchange and at least one of the exchanges with her and her grandson\nAnd was shot that a grandson would speak so harshly to their own grandmother and I'm Wondering to what extent when you encounter the communications that go back and forth or are those who are the most\nAngry those who were anti Trump as compared to those who were pro Trump\n[noise] um well I mean maybe that's too difficult to turn go ahead\nNo maybe that's too difficult for you to to to assess based upon the number of people that you talked to\nWell he just didn't they did the election uh inspired such a strong reaction and still does to this to this day you know we're we're I think we were divided or to some extent before the\nElection but now I'm were even more divided and um [noise] Trump um\nBehaves most of the time as president of his base rather than president of the country um he's more of a divider than a unite or even though he pledged on election night to try and\nUm unite the country but he really hasn't he continues to go a whole these rallies is if the campaign never ended um with the with his base and they love him ... they love him\nWhy do you think or a county that was so strongly democratic decided to swing so hard Republican\nWell I mean that's what was so fascinating about uh about\nOr as one or you know a county that had gone for Obama twice and it's quite a leap when you think about it too of voted for a loop through about five dollars and fifty five hundred um Democrats changed their registration\nTo vote Republican in the in the Republican primary for Trump and um [noise] that's quite a leap that as one a state senator or their ... and John you to check told me [noise] um [noise]\nA full bomber had hope and change but Trump had knocked down the door and change and they were they were in a mood to um to you know turn over the tables\nAnd bought some try to write ... did pick a flyer on this guy ...\nA without being sure how it would all turn out\nTo me as makes anything related to them yeah tell me if there's any sense here in Pittsburgh that here\nIn Pittsburgh or their labor Democrats but social conservative people and\nIt seemed to me that the Democrats abandon with Hillary Clinton and her campaign the labor aspect of the Democratic party and then those individuals who felt as though they weren't being represented by their party for labor reasons one to what they had left which was the\nSocial conservative and then they were also persuaded enough by President Trump then candidate Trump that somehow the meals were coming back and the coal mines we're coming back your thoughts about that\nYeah I don't think the coal mines are coming back um I\nI think you know most people think to the coal industry is is is\nPretty well gone a you know Trump talks about clean coal to it to a certain extent but you know I think the jury's still out on that [noise] I I think it it rather than economic but I think the theme you just mentioned is important that the\nDemocrats felt that their party had left them mhm uh I think more culturally than economically uh they felt forgotten they felt that um uh\nThey felt isolated by a liberal culture that mock their faith and patriotism\nOr they were there were Mart marginalized by flat or falling wages\nUh and they thought the Trump heard them and yes and um heard them without judgment whereas Hillary made them feel ashamed\nBen Bradlee

and I wasn't listening to you on air on the over the Internet here\nWhen I can see the game unfolding based on your commentary that's that is the mark of a good broadcaster for me and uh [noise] again I Can't complement you enough um you do a great job\nThat incredibly high praise play thanks so much for that while you're you're you're certainly worthy of it um question though we we were finally put together a pretty decent pitching staff I think by all accounts or certainly the loss of a Santana and coal or hurts but\nUh as long as we can stop the bleeding there in terms of injuries I think going in the next season we're looking pretty good uh as we all know we we needed a plenty of often so uh this year to to do a better job and being contention and that's where really devote all bone up on moving into Nineteen [noise]\nA friend who had made the comment the other day on the fan that uh you know it's not all about money we need to bring in upgrade our personnel but to a point I mean it is about money you look at the the brewers last year going out and getting crushed and yell at you and\nWe'll entertain the car does more so as soon as we all know that the cubs do every year and the pirates in recent years they've they've tried to to make do with people like Casey muggy and then match Joyce and Michael Moore is just to name a few [noise] do you really see the pirates getting to the point this off season brownie where they they might\nUpgrade the budget a little bit to bring in the necessary a increase in next necessary improvement in ... and what we need a fence away and not asking them to spend with the Yankees and the Dodgers and the cubs but a payroll Ninety to a hundred million dollars in this day and age just is not going to cut it\nAnd I'm number to my other question doesn't others alone when the question but if I may with ah the young kids we saw on September ... was a small sample size I'm really a little bit concerned about a Kevin Newman in terms of if he's ever really going to hit he looks like he's going to field\nI have my doubts about him as a hitter I Do like ... ah what are your feelings are on a on the young kids\nThem and who has been a I think I'm thirty five year voice of the Indianapolis Indians um the last weekend of the season in Cincinnati he was in town and I wanted to get his take on Newman and uh I I said you'll often leads eventually what did you see of him and he said\nThat we the people that watched him in Indianapolis felt like he was ready for the major leagues a month and a half before he was promoted\nAnd I said what if he goes he's pressing he said I'm telling you I say these press and I do trust Howard's eyes you to be a really sharp baseball guy and that's kind of all we had heard but I like to hear from\nOther sources other than pirate personnel\nAnd um and so he said that that uh he felt like he was pressing offensively and he said believe me defensively he's got great range you if you know never had trouble with with throwing and I guess you could see that ... and the more plays he made the offensively ... the more he felt I felt\nA he was getting more comfortable and I could say the same thing off offensively his\nFirst week or so he was striking out a ton and that's usually when you see a guy really lost and pressing kind of like Kevin Cramer of the few at Vassar Kramer got a ... he he went through a real strike out right and uh so the ... that being said\nI still up on the pirates I Am not comfortable going into two thousand Nineteen with\nWho had no disrespect to Kevin Newman but I'm not comfortable going into two thousand Nineteen a season that is expected to be a contending season with him as my starting shortstop now maybe as the weeks go on\nA ... you know he evolves into that like Jody Mercer did when the pirates brought in Flint farm is that's why I feel so strongly about a guy like Mercer\nA kind of tutoring him a ... at at the major league level and learning remind them them share the shortstop is if not Mercer someone maybe a defensive minded guy my hunch is they bring someone and I don't know who or how\nThat's where I was verse early in the mail treated the hatch of area to the Yankees I saw him feeling that\nRole well yeah I mean and I think I think he's still a possibility I think you know he becomes a free agent as well and so there are a handful of guys out there either through free agency or trade and that that leads to the next point I I just don't see them spending a hundred and twenty million dollars or not yeah\nI'm as much as the pirates take grief are saying it had been there's outrage amongst fans there's a particular outrage amongst talk show hosts maybe not John Makin fire in particular\nUm I raised about everything ah I\nJust hear this idea that ... when when it's the subject is broached that the pirates need to and and and ... it's the chicken or the egg theory here and I understand that but we'll ... we'll use them in order to increase\nPayroll they have to find a way to increase revenues I'm much to the chagrin of everyone Bob nothing is not going to spend his own money as I've said so many times before\nAre ruining it does have spent his own money ... does not spend his own money it's just the way it is in sports these guys don't spend their own money or they just don't do it\nAnd I understand that but if you put a better product on the field it is that if you saw Thirteen through Fifteen hundred amounts at Grand park more merchandise purchased no doubt and how so how do you get to that point is is\nIt is the the quandary that they're in I don't know why do I and then when we started to do this they rebuilt the farm system to the point where it's it's it's very competitive it's it's been very productive now it hasn't turned out like Houston's farm system\nHouston's farm system has and I think the better your farm system than the less you have to invest in in veterans through trades and free agency but let's face it a great I mean Ninety two hundred million dollars in this day and age is virtually chump change unless you have a farm system like Houston turning out\nJose out today and and and Korea and some of the other kids that they've turned out you got to go out and supplement what you have been able to bring along you've got to go out and supplement that with with trades and free agency is what the boomers did with with Brunswick Canaan and Christian Church\nThe viruses are always worried that if they want to keep winning or they won't try to\nWin or not they're not that are up but what the brewers did was keep in mind as they they\nThey cut their payroll to the lowest in baseball two years ago so they went through this purge um because they had spent so much they finally got rid of all those guys Prince Fielder to a it was was one of a ... a five or six guys they brought their payroll that I think sixty two\nSixty five million dollars a year before last [noise] so then they when they spent as much as they did it looked like they had this gigantic increase and it was but\n... you know compared to where they were they were at the the the very bottom or in in in all of baseball and so that you know I I brought that subject up with with the Huntington I said well why not use the the brewers as a model and just get this thing down to sixty million dollars\n... until you feel like you're winning a you know close to winning and then you can add\nFree agents in trade like the brewers did and his point was well I did that when I came on board here we went through that we went through the the the mysteries of treating everybody and and that the great courage and uh and then having to build it back I said so we built the situation now you you pointed out the farm system it's\nIt's stable now and they've got some too and\nUm but they're still ... and and I know of any criticized again for it and I I was three weeks ago I said it and and there was outrage\nBoy if it now you don't live in the Pittsburgh area I assume you're listening to talk shows enough around here in Pittsburgh and and you you're and read what it is this\nI don't know what this is this vicious attack for some reason that sports talk show host some uh some bloggers some writers some ... they just want to ... ... it's such an easy target to rip nodding for being cheap\nAnd boy do ... thank you so much for your call brown if you can just hold on for a second got two other calls holding up against the break John academic our ozone with the boys the pirates were Browder buddy news radio ten twenty ...\nI'm ... and I invited you here to my hotel room to talk about your ...\nYour bowl beautiful ...\nGet your mind that at the gutter I'm Talking about ...\nYou know that each year twenty thousand Americans apply cancer are searching for their life saving narrow and that can you believe that\nI mean people need Merrill you guys and we had here is how we can help it's really really simple all you have to do this lobby or to ... and then go to the gift of life narrow registry\nIt's so easy anyone can do it\nAnd you're wondering if you're a notch donating a lot easier than you think so wherever you are\nSo you have a fifty fifty shot if you spend a hundred and well I Want to see sixty Seventy million dollars I think is the top five in the bombs\nThen you have a chance to to go to the post season that's a fifty fifty shot the pirates are in that market there not LA they're not Chicago and and the ... that's not going to happen and again I think it's an easy throwaway line just to say it's a cheap owner\nThat that that that that's not a good baseball debate a good baseball arguments the other things are\nA ... it's debatable of how the again the draft picks the uh the player development and so on but I'm just ... to ... and what happens is John Makin tired and everybody is that\n... over the winter so there was a guy who actually was a producer a ... for years I Know I mean a friend of mine um who had a Twitter it's a he's got it at a Twitter account\nAnd he's the so called a fan of the pirates will he talked about a um boycott\nOf pirate baseball going into last season now this is a guy that's got a few you know maybe a thousand dollars I don't know how many but\nBecause he threw this out there that I'm boycotting until nothing cells that scene he got a a local and some national attention so some local writers interviewed him it's a there's a story in the post ... sad about it this is my point\nThis guy all of a sudden now it's a narrative out there and people are following it in the going oh yeah oh but of boycott to gauge it it it's it's just it's sad\nIs he still about everybody know okay no but but the the ...\nBut the point is that it's just a guy who's a fan who wanted to to to get grab attention and so he does that and he throws this out there that I'm going to boycott the team until Ninety six and now he gets\nIt's validated when he gets quoted in the paper and and then other people see this and then he gets more followers and more people jump on it\nAnd and and my frustration and and I can't imagine how difficult it might be to try and and market and sell the team because you're you you can't fight back I Wish the pirates had an army of people that would every time I heard something on the air or read something that they would fire back and defend themselves that's\nWhat they need to how many miles showed up for these free beers on Greg brown everybody\nI I'd probably a couple of dozen\nAnd was one of the nation cabin on you you get really drunk and like argue of noxious lately\nI don't recall their all their name you know might have we we had a couple

I got ya yeah very very funny\nNow that was a ... that was forty years ago and I didn't ask him what he did in grade school\nI thought you were to go when you said I don't recall [laughter] no no I\nSaw was out in the sense that that was not intentional up but ah no I Know I did ask him what he did when he was in his crib as a child so I thought that was you know time has passed\nBut anyway my point about this this uh this great debate about you know a ... is spending the money now living too I I brought this point up to a talk show host a couple of years ago\nI'm off the air but he he rips the pirates any chance he gets constantly ripping them and a nice guy may have known him for a while and I talked to him about it and he goes I just wish nothing would spend more money I said\nHow much more money do you want him to spend just out to you and your listeners telling me what it is what's the magic number to us all I don't know I ... I said no no no don't but I'm not gonna let you go\nYou tell me what that number is is it\n'cause right at that time they had spent a hundred and ten million dollars I think on their payroll this is maybe three years ago and I said so is it a hundred and ten is it a hundred and Fifteen is a hundred and twenty and he kept like him why I said no stayed with me on this\nOne thirty one forty one fifty to the point is it won't matter\nBecause if if you believe that Bob money for some reason the Forbes magazine I guess ... a a printed out something or a story came out a few years ago that bomb nothing so one of the top richest\nSports owners in all sports and he's worth billions of dollars which I I you know I don't know how they get these numbers now they get these figures I don't believe in them because they they have no inside information more more than you do it more than I Do and and so but if you believe\nThat there's no amount of money he spends will be enough to satisfy people I hear you mean because if he's if he's a ... one of the richest donors and he should be spending four hundred million dollars\nI Know you want a team of a pirate ah folks to respond but I think you should have a team of uh I'm buying the beer like you did I think that's the model and you'll please everybody knew him out or is that\nThey ... the the the ... of all that was I didn't want anyone at the pirates and though I was doing I I didn't want\nAnyone to realize that it it because I I've heard this idea that well he's paid by the pirates so he's nothing's mouthpiece no that's not the point so I I didn't want anyone to know and I was held almost like underground\nAnd that's why you're hanging on my show because you figure there's now now I can I just did it\nLast year and we yeah we had the ... yeah but but and and and the people that were there realize my sincerity now eat or they they they they kind of question that when we first arrived\nBut by the end of night to go at you you know ... we debated I don't know that I changed any minds but um the the point was I was in fear about it and I don't say it justice if if I didn't believe it I Would say nothing I wouldn't go on the talk shows I wouldn't go by beers I Would just keep quiet\nBut I Believe in it strongly that it's unfair to it again I I I Wish you could meet you don't think I Wish that that Bob\nNothing will go out and spend two hundred million dollar or Korea I Do now but I Know the reality is that the owners of sports franchises don't spend their own money\nNot a penny marital lemieux a ... aren't really they don't spend their own money they won't spend their own money\nI don't doubt that there are the always incredibly passionate Greg brown everybody Dale and Paul if you hold on I promise you that it will
