O. P. P. E. L. stop all mhm which is a fun way of I guess the Italians say stop you stop all it is a legal doctrine that says even if you do have a case\nIf you will ... not to go forward and argue your breach you accepted that\nAnd that's the argument they're going to make you have accepted the fact that they're not going to\nPay you a bunch now uh can you go back you're not gonna go back nine years I guarantee you that uh can you go back uh maybe but they're going to keep on arguing I Would saying hey you know what yeah we had a deal but we weren't dealing with it and he's obviously he's OK with

sports ESPN wants to live for and on the show roaming\nWith the the original and the entire thirties or\n... dot com and then the use of a nice yard radio station [noise]\nSure well we're bombarded as you know by all kinds of information and all kinds of media sources or\nA you know people ranting and raving on the radio and television and newspapers and magazines law that stuff is competitive and people are very wary about it you know they they're they're biased detectors are always working uh you know even even when I listen to their their favorite\nCommentator they're still kind of you know it's the see the human hand\nYou know and everyone knows humans or ... or an adult when people are you yeah\nOf course but when people are using it turns out my research shows other research show when people are using something like a Google Search engine\nThey turn off the bias detectors they automatically become very trusting 'cause they think this is an algorithm not that they know what an algorithm is but this is an algorithm I can trust ticket and subjective an impartial so that when Google Answers your question about anything\nAh what what tends to happen is if people trust what's higher up in the list they think that the algorithm has very carefully and objectively selected and it must be true so if you favor one candidate\nOr one cause or one company or whatever it may be one product in search results\nUh people tend to believe whatsoever closest to the top and what I showed him in a series of randomized controlled experiments of it and that we've now done with for national elections involving no\nMore than ten thousand people a I've shown over and over and over and over again that by favoring one candidate you can shift in a country like ours millions of votes which no one having the slightest idea that\nAre being manipulated and without leaving a paper trail for authorities to track you know that is scary\nIt is you um you leave this out in the in the um creepy line\nI'm about how Google has really stripped itself of all ads and everything else so it it looks totally clean and neutral and without an agenda [noise] um and then\nUh how they have ... you know that when you first did it I think one of the tests you did you did it where\nYou you were clear with an agenda then you added one that might go in the other direction and then you added to search results of that would go in the other direction and you got it to a point to where Google is to where you don't have any idea you're being manipulated\nCorrect absolutely no idea of someone we we did this in a national study in the U.S almost no one was aware\nThat they were seeing biased or in a search result search for those that favor one candidate that this really creepy saying there was that the very very few people who could spot the bias they shifted even farther in the direction of the bias so you know being able to spot the bias does not protect you\nUh we did a a big national study in India right in the middle of their election they're two thousand fourteen Ninety nine point five percent of people in the study a casino biased whatsoever they couldn't see the favoritism\nUh and and and yet we're still getting these big chefs\nAre in their voting preferences so you know this is this is unprecedented in human history this is this is just this is an ability to shift people's thinking and behavior\nWorldwide it's not just in the U. S. because Google is is you know use a ... you know Ninety percent of all searches conducted throughout the world uh\nYou know and and and it was they have the ability to shift people's thinking behavior votes purchases attitudes beliefs or around the world they are doing so twenty four seven with out people knowing and\nWithout leaving a paper trail because when you're showing something someone search results I felt like a news story that just stays there for people to look at it generated just for you on the fly at that moment disappears gone forever stored now where\n\nWould you is it an overstatement to say whether it's um you know we'll send in Bernays a in World War one or or uh you know ... ... World War two that\nThis is the\nThis is the system that they would have dreamt of\nFor propaganda [laughter] [noise]\nOh and this goes beyond their wildest dreams or because it's not just the search results I just published a big article a called a can of ways big tech\nCan shift millions of both in the November elections without anyone knowing now what the one we're talking about which is called the search engine manipulation of factors seem FEMA that's just one of ten ways\nAre that I've identified over the years in that I've been studying I'm studying seven of them at the moment\nAh that these big tech companies have to shift votes and that are unprecedented in human history they've never existed before\nUh and they they they're I mean some of these the effects that that that I've discovered are among the biggest ever discovered in the behavioral sciences\nAnd they're ... years and there is no doubt in your mind that Google is engaging in this\n[noise] well in two thousand sixteen early two thousand sixteen uh working in secret\nUh I developed a system for actually monitoring what people were seeing while they were using the Google bang and Yahoo search engines that was election related so it's as if we were looking over people's shoulders it's called the monitoring system itself was that first ever created\nAnd so we actually monitor for more than five months before the election in November two thousand sixteen [noise]\nUh and we found a systematic bias in search results favoring Hillary Clinton whom I favored by the way as you mention\nA in all can search positions on the first page of search results now that's that's pretty late and that's\nPretty extreme wow or sees leaks these leaks that\nWe've seen recently from Google or you know they're they're they tell us you know that yeah people at Google will have a very strong political preferences and that they act on them\nAnd uh I don't think we should be surprised\nUh that we found that and of course now I'm working with with business partners and academic colleagues on three continents to try to scale up monitoring systems like that so for the first time will actually\nBe able to see what these companies are showing people all throughout the U.S and ultimately throughout the world and will will I think be able to make these companies accountable to the public at some point\nUh you know our issue we well I Wish we could be fully up and running and time for the midterms and uh at this point I'd say that's not going to happen but\nWe will definitely be there for for twenty twenty and beyond and and we're looking at more than elections because it's there there are lots of ways in which these companies are playing with us\nOr that people are just completely unaware of and speaking of which\nGlen ... [laughter] you know but I Am I in trouble [laughter] what\nKind of yeah it's kind of um I have a good news and bad news\nFor you okay I'm ... [laughter] All right\nLet's let's say that are a very good the good the good news I mean the the good news is that um\nThat Glenn Beck dot com right yeah and your email service that you use a ... is is you are not sharing information you're sharing your emails with Google Now\nInteresting lapse in New York Times the times of London the economist wired magazine slate I could go on and on and on base share all of their\nEmails all the time with the Google and other sensitive documents too and so reporter is when they're doing\nYou know very sensitive investigations on something they're sharing everything constantly with Google and I wrote a piece about that and it was in the Daily Caller a couple of months ago good news is you don't do that\nYou're okay let's end it there for ... [laughter] this is this has been asking that for a second it will come back with the bad news plus\nThe the I think he's in different ways that Google is influencing us and not just Google but these big tech companies and\nSome of the other things that uh he has found how they are monitoring our children and it is remarkable and we are running out of time and uh before Google is the dominant than just can be stopped [noise]\n\nClaim that\nIt's a new morning lined up on the blaze joined pat gray the new time seven AM either we have to follow the law in the constitution then\nGlenn Beck at nine you give them power and they will kill people who disagree with them and new to the blaze is this the Daily Show and knew this could very well be every bit as much about the fact Lindsey Graham is pitch the Senate decorum as being violated fat\n[laughter] no no no no no no everyone said Einstein no one's\nEver seen [laughter] oh yeah okay so [laughter] [noise] excuse me oh so you were just about to give me more good news\nWell the other good news is again you you you do not share your emails with Google a lot of major news organizations like the New York times and the Boston Globe they do but it's bad news is that\nA Glenn Beck dot com uses Google Google Analytics and so what that means ... everyone who has ever visited your website is tracked every single thing they do on your website is tracked by Google\nSo here's a here's the problem is a business owner Google Analytics or the best\nNow do you how do you how do you do business without Google at times that's that's always the thing that gets you in the\nYeah well sure but you know they you know this is this convenience thing over and over and and the products are so good so but you don't realize that these are real products they're just surveillance platforms that's the only reason they run them every single service they provide as just another surveillance platform [noise]\nUh I Do have a little bit more good news though which is that film that you mentioned the creepy lie has\nA when ... when you had a my ... one of my new very good friends Peter Schweitzer and your your show recently though is uh uh he's the one who would who really got that film running\nA it sure wasn't available but now as of right now it is available both on Amazon and on I tense for for rental or sale and it's it and it really is a fabulous film\nAnd builds Google it just goes to the freebie lying dot com when you came out about some of this stuff and again you were a Hillary supporter when you came out about this ... were you you were blocked by Google for a time where you are not\nWell when I when my research\nA first hit the news and the Washington Post a you know I found that starting the next day I couldn't access any Google products I couldn't even access to Google dot com so [laughter] I have these amazing screen shots that\nThey're just shocking to people because you can't even imagine not being able to access Google yeah but I have three and shot showing getting these time out saying no no you can't get their sorry\nAmazing okay um ... let's go through some of the uh ... some of the uh affects that you are monitoring we have about about a minute here so why don't you just take one of them on you say there was the last\nSeven ten or ten of these that you're\nFollowing ten altogether okay\nOut an altogether okay so let's take on one real quick\nBegin very good when okay here we go this is called bath as the er the search suggestion effect when you start to type a search term into the Google Search bar you are being manipulated from the very first character that you typed\nSo if you type a depending on your history and other things chances are you'll get Amazon\nRight away they'll start slashing suggestions at you and Amazon it turns out is Google's biggest advertiser paying them three hundred million dollars a year and Google sends more traffic to Amazon than any other single source but beyond that we've learned through our experiments\nThat Google can use search suggestions that their flashing asked you\nTo turn a fifty fifty votes among\nA fifty fifty split among undecided voters into in Ninety\nTen split will buy one having any idea they're being manipulated\nOh my gosh oh my gosh okay we're gonna come back and uh and go through the others if we have time he'll\nTalk about some of the other things Google is doing and what we're supposed to do about it you need to know about it you can see it in the creepy line it's a new documentary the freebie line dot com the freebie line dot com [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] it's one of the most important midterm elections in recent memory was so much as they\nElections do have consequences and whether it's the red wings vote Republican\nDemocrat to have a shot take that back\nTrust the demographics of the midterm election anything we need to get out there in\nTo talk about it I just don't trust the laughter\nStimulating talk\nIf the climate probably\nDr Robert ... he's a senior research psychologist American Institute for behavioral research and technology he is I'm In a new documentary called the creepy line we talked about a guy saw again it is indeed very creepy it is um\nIt's it's is it too much to say it's we're on the ... were apps mind control or the threshold of mind control doctor\n[noise] [noise] ah well we've been here for a long time so there's a you know uh there's no question about it there's they're literally right now more than two point five billion people soon to be over four billion\nA whose whose thoughts and purchases and beliefs and attitudes and voting preferences are are affected\nAre dramatically uh every single day by a some manipulations that big tech companies are perpetrating on them and that's happening now so that's that's already going full steam or it's just getting worse every day\nSo I I just I I Want to reset that you did a study during the last presidential election\nYou are a Hillary Clinton supporter but you're a truth teller and you were doing a a a a study on Google Search results and found that they were\nTrying to manipulate it in favor of Hillary Clinton now you say that's only one way we then have the search suggestion effect now target messaging affect\nWhat is the targeting charts the\nShura targeted messaging T Emmy we call that is a these are all things that we study and that where you were you know were quantifying and you know very precisely a targeted messing effect is really scary ah this this means that if a company that's primarily be Facebook but other companies to\nBut if a company like Facebook on election day so let's go back to November two thousand sixteen is is that morning mark sucker bird\nHad chosen to just you know hit the anarchy and send out go out and vote reminders\nUh mainly just supporters of Hillary Clinton\nOr exclusively either way first of all no one would know that that was even occurring no one would know it was going to some people and not others\nBut if it went justice supporters of Hillary Clinton that would have given her that day an additional four hundred and fifty thousand votes now gosh I I don't I\nI don't think he did that because you know he was very overconfident a you know as as we're Democrats or I'm not a Democrat or not\nI'm I'm a ... a moderate and independent but at the point is everyone thought Hillary was going to win so I'm pretty sure he didn't do that uh but the point is we know from Facebook own published data that that just sending out that kind of reminders selectively\nDramatically dramatically shifts votes\nAnd think about it no one knows if it's something like that is happening in fact if it's happening every single day there there were targeted messages going out to some people but not others\nAnd of course isn't what targeted advertising is all about but you see targeted advertising though it's competitive but I'm Talking about what happens if the platform itself does something that's not competitive as completely invisible and it's not competitive\nSo can I mean this is so dangerous um\nAnd it is I mean it's everything that aside by you know a writer has envision forever\nUh and I mean can can\nEspecially when we get two artificial intelligence couldn't a system like Google be used to identify unstable individuals and wind them up\n[noise] [noise] Oh yes they can they in fact they know who's an unstable they know who's undecided they know who is Republican and who is gay and you name it they know far more about it\nI mean on ... I mean on the table mentally\nYeah yeah yeah oh no you're you're absolutely right they have literally unprecedented power\nOr to ... ... is shifts to people yes shift to unstable people's shift anybody uh and and they know they have this power\nUh one of the leaks from Google was a a a ... a little internal film their eight minute film called the selfish ledger you want to get cranked out [laughter] botched that film that's an internal film there were there they're talking about their power to reshape humankind\nLast summer when bitcoin was down forty\nPercent and trading was about two thousand dollars a call ... ... from the Palm Beach let her go to expert on everything crypto wrote that bitcoin would hit ten thousand dollars by the end of the year people thought he was nuts we were in the middle of a horrific a bear market but it was right\nIt hit twenty thousand dollars will now seek it saying bitcoin could be up ten times or more by the end of this year that means it could hit forty thousand dollars by Christmas I Am a skeptic pot you need to\nUnderstand what bitcoin is what crypto currency is and what are the triggers because this is game changing technology and life changing investment\nEven if you put a hundred dollars in bitcoin but you have\nTo educate yourself first do that by getting my exclusive Glenn Beck crypto course from Chico right now it's smart crypto course dot com smart crypto course dot com or coal eight seven seven ... back that's eight seven seven ... back\nYou're concerned about your heart health or know someone who it then you can consider cardio mobile the FDA cleared personal EKG device for Ninety nine dollars guardian mobile delivers a medical greedy Katie right to your smartphone\nAnd it fits in your pocket so you can take any Katie anytime anywhere to order basic guardian dot com venue K.

County Georgia in ... about twenty five miles north east of Atlanta the officers were responding to a suspicious car near school as they approached shots were fired from inside the vehicle sergeant Jake Smith says police are looking for the suspects\nHey uh to publish open access journals that has apparently fairly low are very low um review standards and so it didn't prove what we wanted to prove or didn't even really offer good evidence for what we're looking at\nBut it was we learned or mentally fun fun right hum that innocence\nDon't exist but they called all of our problems anyway\nRight out of that um but yeah so we learned our lesson we we took the criticism we got from that to heart ...\nIt was fun but it didn't work people criticized up I think fairly pointed out where we were weak by using these journals and instead we\nCommitted to a few things going into this new project one is that we would not use paid published journals in any sense a secondly and by the way they don't charge like a hundred dollar they charge\nLike a couple of thousand ... ... it's really kind of a financial racket going on there are some big problem and I hope people\nContinue to address a secondly we decided that um we would use the highest ranks journals within the disciplines that we're examining that we could get into so we would start at the best turn away could find for what we were doing and then work our way down at that one didn't take it would go to the next one\nAnd then thirdly we committed to being transparent about our results no matter what happened so if our if we had gone crash and burn complete failure then um [noise]\nThat would have would have been what we report it I don't think it would have gotten much attention but we would have come out and it made it that we were wrong but it's it's not what happened um and uh\nEarly on in the process not just to keep us honest because I think we would have kept our promise\nBut early on in the process we ended up in contact with a documentary filmmaker who is interested in this stuff already but he's been recording us for a year and things like ... ... and he's been recording us I mean clearly what ever happened is going to come out so there it is\nOK so before we take a break a and get into what you actually got published I'm telling you about the work behind it just took a year to do what kind of time or are you looking at\nWell easiest kind of look at what this is I had exactly five social outings between Thanksgiving and when uh the project was came out of the public eye took\nMay be that many days off including weekends I work probably eighty to Ninety hours a week almost every week\nUm my two collaborators worked\nAlso very very hard I'm Peter put in at least a fulltime job Helen did most of the same and I talked to hell and the other day yeah\nAh so this was in ... in the men's amount of work it required learning these field very quickly writing academic papers a typical academic all published a couple a year maybe if they're working hard\nAnd we wrote twenty\nA holy cow yeah it's a lot of work\nThere was an insane amount of work and these are all fields we have no expertise and know Helen has a little bit of background in some of this but this was primarily\nHaving to learn this material on the fly with no education with no teachers instructing author only feedback was how our papers fared and the peer review process and then reading what was out there to try to emulate it\nAnd so what does what does having something published in one of the the magazines mean what does it mean to the author and to the educational community\nSo for the author it is the absolute pinnacle of what an academic is trying to do in the research died of their career is to get papers published in well established journals\nAre for example hype Asia is one of the journals we got a paper in and I ... is the feminist philosophy journal was probably the highest standing so it would carry a lot of weight\nLooking at the academic community that that scholars imbedded in so they could take that to their university and say hey I got this many papers published\nIf people are being considered her tenure there is a research component to that depends on how the the school wants to do their tenure in protest but typically seven papers spanning seven to ten years is considered the ... the basic research requirement to be qualified for tenure\nUm our paper spanned\nThe ones we wrote spend Fifteen sub disciplines of thought the ones that got accepted spanned seven and so we've got big journals we've got seven disciplines papers got into we probably would have had more how do we not been a short\nSo there's you know un un twelve in the pipeline that looked like they would be published and then this came out and so you you pulled those but you might have had as many as twelve\nI think honestly we had fourteen that weren't dead yet and I can say with some confidence I think twelve would have gotten in and possibly possibly Thirteen so I Would guess was pretty good confidence is somewhere between eleven Thirteen would have gotten in in the end or do we not gotten old\nOkay so when we come back we will go into and remember we're on we're on public airwaves so [laughter] so are as careful as we can to to discuss what was in each of these papers\nA and credible

because uh we actually had a real scholar who let us use his identity or who wrote that who claimed that paper and you actually as a professional body builder or Mr northern hemisphere in Nineteen Seventy eight or something I mean this guy's Seventy years old and just stack and the picture in my mind to this guy being the author of this\nPaper for fat body building was just kind of all areas\n[laughter] because that's another thing to a lot of these papers you had a completely fake organizations you had completely fake scholars coming from colleges that I think didn't exist in some cases I mean it some of this would have been easily just provide basic checking would it would it wouldn't have\nI think so I mean those kind of a this is a tricky point and I don't want to get too far into the into the weeds here but honestly\nScholarship to stand or fall on merit not on who did it and so a lot of people are are making that point and we deliberately chose the name that would be

Twitter he is one of the ... if not the mastermind behind a the\nA papers a of record that were were being written\nA for for a feminist studies and we're studies were published in some of the the leading journals a and a and critique but\nI'm not really critiqued in a way that most people would um just quickly go through some of them are going in through the back door which is not something we are going to discuss here that's really great rubbing one out\nOf the violence of objective vacation through non consensual masturbation uh then we get to some really disturbing ones um the progressive\nStack James tell us about the progressive stack\nYeah the progressive stacks of pretty horrifying piece of work and in fact it's evil ah fortunately it did not get accepted the journal is inviting us to re submitted and um give it another go\nIt says this is just start says it's a solid essay that with revision will make a strong contribution to the growing literature of addressing injustice in the classroom\nYeah so what did argues for is that we take students in college classrooms and we have them go through some kind of a inventory that determines how privileged they are at recommends a thing called the step forward step back game as a possibility\nOnce that are turning out privileges they are the students are ranked according to their privilege um then the more privileged few are the worst you get treated in class so the most privileged white and male students are invited to listen and learn throughout the semester which means face\nAren't allowed to speak or ask questions in class they're invited to sit in the floor in chains to experience reparations and a level the the knowing field to be in very privileged classroom learning environment\nAnd the problem that the reviewers seemed to have with this set of suggestions was that we thought there's no way this will get in we have a temporary thing we have to be compassionate to these students as we put them in the foreign and\nAnd they used to watch it with compassion that re centers the needs of the privileged over the oppressed and\nThere's this idea out there called the pedagogy of discomfort which means that you learn to overcome your privilege by being\nMade uncomfortable and left to fit in that without being converted and so they actually wanted to make a terrible scary idea properly evil and that's\nThe worst part is is it's only a small step from what already exist in a great deal of the a feminist than race based education literature\nSo this was not really terrified this was not accepted because it didn't it wasn't bad enough\n[noise] ah at first yeah and then later they were concerned with the death of a scholarship and and the kind of routine thing that\nYou would expect out of a scholarly paper they claim for example that we grew on too many concept and it would be confusing for the reader and to try to narrow it down to something a bit tighter and so on\nBut um but the idea that they're giving students experiential reparations and asking them not to be able to speak in class or to be spoken over\nInterrupted to teach them what that feels like\nNone of that was questioned\nWhat if this were published and they were real if this were published ... what what would that\nMean to the university system would would what does that mean\nSo all events is a really complicated I'm\nThere will be people who try to take this out in fact we got the idea from a news article about somebody at University of Pennsylvania who was employing a similar but less extreme version of this in her classroom they got in trouble for it a late last year\nSo that if I didn't come to us out of the vacuum this was actually something that people are attempting in classrooms and so there would have been some some are educators primarily working in social justice\nSide field topics courses I get that the best way to say that but also probably into some of the general and stuff\nTake up some degree of the suggestions as you know experimental but but legitimate to use in the classroom and this was being submitted to the gold standard journal this wasn't some fringe of journal in education this was the gold entered feminist philosophy journal ... that we were working with here\nThe way on this grievance stuff which clearly the academic left is I think we see a lot of it coming out of the right wing media here as well from my perspective I think as long as we're focusing on that we can't have productive conversations we can't\n... remember you know you're an American I'm an American your person I'm a person we have ... most of the things that we think\nIn common even though we have some probably pretty serious political differences but I think we also have in common that we want to have better conversation we want to move society and a direction that benefits us all and it's just a matter of working out the details and I really hope that

uh it seems to be this I mean the idea that we in two thousand ten and eleven were being called racist for suggesting what they wanted was single payer and now here they are\n... the entire field is endorsing single payer health care\nI think credible you know we were scare mongers and races for saying it yeah so I I just want to go through there's there's three stores will go through this tomorrow but I ... I\nWent to ... um Cortez was out of this weekend we have to eliminate the electoral college\nHey no that is a fundamental um a a a fundamental aspect of what brought the states together in the first place\nThe state said we don't want the big states telling us what we can do and if the big states can control everything\nThen ...\nWhat do we have it can't be that way so we had the electoral college\nWe are one stayed away from losing the electoral college anyway you lose Texas and you have New York California and Texas the rest of the country doesn't matter it will be those three states you lock those three states up and it doesn't matter anymore\nThat pretty frightening pretty frightening\nSo now we're talking about taking apart the electoral college which would make\nAll of the red states really pretty much in consequential\n\nYeah I mean it certainly would change the way the founders thought about\nThe idea of people being elected right I'm only have to do is just just appeal to the big cities and by the way this is a this was an idea that um and it's not just democratic support for getting rid of the electoral college I Know Trump sports at for example throwing um I I you know I'm not a big fan of the national popular vote or certainly not what our founders had in mind but\nUh there is a there's some contingency on both sides of the aisle that actually believe\nThis is the right way to go which I mean you get you just basically a country run by cities\nI mean as you know it'd be which meant that like as a Republican is certainly don't understand why you'd want it but ... again like it shouldn't be that way\n... says you should run themselves in the cities can run whatever they want and the rural or you can do what they want\nWhy do we all have to live under somebody else's thumb I don't want to live under a farmer's thumb no farmers should make that although I'd feel better with this than the other way around no farmers should be telling what somebody in the city has to do and how to live\nThey don't understand taking any of my farmer friends to Manhattan their heads would explode within twenty five minutes\nThey would not want to live there they wouldn't understand it so why should we have the people in farms and farmland trying to dictate rules that are good for them but I also have to be applied to the city it's ridiculous right and it's ... by the house and Senate both exist\nTo give a balance to that so that ... not not one side can tell the head out right\nAnd it you know no it's actually it's it's it's goes further than this if you would have if you could have raised the mistake of the uh of the progressive under Wilson where they changed the meaning of the Senate\nThe way they got elected yeah it it used to be that the house was the place where the people could move and move quickly so things can be passed because there was a disaster and things can be passed\nQuickly then the next the the first check\nOn the balance of power the first check on that power was to go through another body that was a lot slower the Senate people are always like parents too slow it was designed to be that way so you go through another body that was much lower but it wasn't just that it was lower\nIt was also supposed to be men or women that were selected by their state legislature\nNow what would that do\nThat would make sure that those guys are beholden to their state not to the rest of the country not figures in national politics for Iraq I shouldn't chair or what uh what's his face in New York is says shouldn't care when Hillary Clinton was senator bronco bottle is center I\nShouldn't care about that\nBecause they would be focused on their state and they would be making sure that the federal government would not be eating into the power\nOf their state then it goes to the president and the president\nIs only supposed to veto thing if he finds it unconstitutional now they'll say I think this is unconstitutional but I'll sign it\nWas way no that's the opposite opposite way you're supposed to veto it not if you don't like it if you find it unconstitutional\nIt's unconstitutional then it would go to the Supreme Court\nWe've screwed up the balance of power so much and that's why you have this story today the United States Senate is a failed institution you also have this one from Fox the
