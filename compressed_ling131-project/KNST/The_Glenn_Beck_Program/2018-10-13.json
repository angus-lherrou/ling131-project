Turkey he's going to get married and so he's like I Need my divorce papers from the embassy and so he goes over to the Saudi embassy he tells his fiance weight in the car I'll be right back she waits right in front of the embassy\nHours and hours and hours are going by she's calling his phone no answer on his phone he's not coming out\nShe calls the embassy and they say oh no he left he left just the boat he came here and we gave him the papers and he went and she's like I've been sitting outside\nI'm not sure if he went out I'm Bill did he go out the front door yes so I feel and the other guy

Saudis um the Saudi prince lands the gulfstream his Gulf Stream it at the airport there I'm\nIn Turkey about an hour or so after the guy goes into the into the embassy\nThese guys get off the plane with what appeared to be a lot of empty suitcases they piled up in the back of the vans they're driving to the embassy they decide for some reason or another they need more empty suitcases they buy some more empty suitcases they also stop just a real quick you know I don't know maybe the chef needed at the embassy but they needed a bones\nSaw by boat saw well thank you so much now we can have soup and uh so they get the ball and saw\nGod only knows what they do in the embassy but they're seen leaving about an hour later with really heavy suitcases they throw them into the back of the van they\nThrow them on the jet and the jet takes off\nMeantime United States says we do have a we do have a an encrypted a messages showing that the Saudi prince was trying to in trapping more tried to trap and get him into the embassy or get him back to Saudi Arabia\nA and today and I don't know if I Believe this because it's turkey but turkey says that they have either given to the United states or shown the United states this video and audio they say they have surveillance in the embassy of him being questioned\nAnd then tortured and then murdered\nWe don't know if that is true but that's

I put the media in at eight percent directors\nHey let me just tell you a quick story okay alright so\nThis week I've been doing a lot of a promotion for killing the ss which came out on Tuesday and in that promotion I'm basically saying that we in America are seeing a rise of hate and evil\nAnd I tie it in a number of ways one of the ways that I tied it in was that George Soros at his crew have bought up about twenty packs political action committees and they sent they send them out on missions\nAnd one of those missions was Senator Flake in the elevator with the CNN camera right behind a woman's screaming at him\nA because she was a victim of something and he was an idiot for not the siding with her who's the woman the woman is an activist and the Soros pack making a hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars a year All right so I tell that story which is a tire early accurate a hundred percent correct and immediate matters\nWithin a half an hour shows that I compared the woman to the third Reich\n[laughter] okay\nNow that's what's going on here that that's what's in play so the eight percent progressive zealots fanatics couldn't never\nHaving pose any thing on this country without the media taking up their cause and actually doing the dirty work\nI put the media in that eight percent it's the it is the reason why it has swept the country it is you're right because of the media but they are part of that eight percent\nLook what happened and Kanye West my favorite guy of all time [laughter]\nOkay yeah so Kanye West\nWho I I I didn't really made him I was an elevator with him at Madison Square garden went around me I'd short pants on any of his brooding right okay so he goes on Saturday Night live which has staked out territory to destroy Donald Trump because it's good for Saturday Night lives ratings that's why they do it\nAll right so ... goes gets invited to go anywhere is to make America great again hat and and no one likes him and he ... he's he's brooding again 'cause he's being bullied by Saturday Night live okay fine um then\nBecause of that Trump invites them to the oval office work ... walks in with the hat and and ... with the president or whatever they\nDid mhm okay now why isn't anyone care [laughter]\nThank you for sale CNN on his whole day yeah I Know he's talking about what he wants the\nHigh Kanye West right now Taylor Swift she comes out against Trump All right and she's told everybody in Tennessee to get them so Taylor Swift and Kanye West do I care what they think about geopolitics in any regard\nBack the answer is no I don't and no one else does either this is a tremendous example of political correctness that tiny tiny it was just going against the PC so he must be a villa five\nSo I Want to go I Want I Want to come back because you I Need to you maybe you should get a cup of coffee in or something I Need you to get a little a little more animated here ... uh uh but when we when we come back I Want to ask you about cars you follow ratings\nThe ratings are falling apart let's look at the numbers of you know from like Beto uh and and others that are running in the Senate the numbers seem to be falling apart I think that there is a change a foot and the Democrats don't see it\nAnd when they get their head handed to them or by the people I think they're going to double down yet again we'll get Bill O'Reilly's\nComment on that coming up and just a second Bill O'Reilly from Bill O'Reilly dot com his new book is out it is a killing the ss\nAnd it is really good it's worth or read a pick it up and uh and read it it's really really good [noise] alright zipper critter\nZipper critter is smart technology and um it is it's really brilliant what they've done they have a really brilliant CEO\nA and he's a high tech guy and it's you know when when separate could it first came out it was a way for you to not have to have an HR department or you could you could post a job on all of the different websites well since that point\nThe separate critter has become the number one website so now they not only post everything there but they have all of this internal data\nAnd they really listen to the smart technology really tries to find out exactly what you're what you're looking for so if if you have you know a big job open up and you know PR director or whatever it is\nYou don't mind finding you know seeing the right person if they're in California and you're in New York but if you're you know a Starbucks and you're looking for a brief that you don't care that you know you're in New York in somebody's in Santa Monica you need the person right across the street\nSo they don't just dump everybody a onto your onto your plate\nThe smart technology goes through and really look for it also they look for the people that are not necessarily out there a scene you know your ad or reading your post they go out and then invite\nAnd guys like you and I unfortunately we have to fight against us and then that puts us in the kill zone but to get back to the politics I Do think there's going to be a backlash I'm not sure about the house of representatives but the Senate I Believe will be even more Republican than it is now\nSo let me let me ask you this if\nIf they do have they they lose the Senate where just a few weeks ago\nThe the person who is in the best position to win for the Republicans was Ted Cruz and he was only one or two points ahead of of Beto\nSo he was in the best position now it looks like they could if I mean if it's a good day they could end up with the majority of fifty four fifty five yeah that's significant\nIf especially with you know Donald Trump is president do the most hated man of all time if if\nThey do lose do you think they will say okay wait a minute this democratic socialism this anger or\nKnow that never got to do that they're going to go they're going to go murder don't you think\n... of course I mean these people are really really arranged and and there are some on that on the right like that as well yes but not nearly\nA the numbers on the left of course of media promotes that um but if they win the Democrats win the house then you're ... that's why are you going to hear your in your area about ... yes I'm an house\nYou know that's a little shaky because as everybody knows uh the first term in Clinton first ran Obama um they lost\nYou'll um and and the opposition party you only have one of the house right and if you're the way Americans do usually vote\nYeah so bill how do you feel about the use of the N

stuff tell me about the press and the numbers\n[noise] okay so what's happening is not just in cable news but it's in all kinds of TV watching is that the machines are now overwhelmed the American public your device so whatever you call it the church and started it they don't watch television anymore um my kids used to they don't want any more\nAnd NOW News consumption is following\nIn that regard so people are getting used to the fact that Bill O'Reilly dot com is there the blazes there they can get whenever they want twenty four seven\nI'm so why do I have to sit there and wait for

let's let's talk about um you know I Know why you wrote this book to two parallel and show the parallels of evil and how that\nCan happen um but I'm I'm\nI'm fascinated by the stories that that you tell in this\n[noise] let me tell you to know so your listeners will understand what we're doing here and there was a concentration camp name ravens broke\nIt was for women just women and it was north of Berlin and nobody ever heard of it\nOf course the concentration camps were kept away from the German people they weren't spotlight it it was known a news report Taj and the third Reich you did what they said or they put a bullet in your head or you went to the concentration camp so anyway at this concentration camp it was a young woman now named ... H. U. T. H.\nAnd she had a German Shepherd dog as most of the ... did and she terrorized women\nAre and participated in heinous crimes against it before the war she was a seamstress\nAnd went to work and came home and had a ... or whatever you do in Germany okay and then all of a sudden she's in a black uniform I'm killing and maiming and torturing other people are free off after the war ends of

years later they get to\nThe state department finally tracked her down censored back to Germany where she's still alive Beck and every month gets to the United states Social Security check ... quite a story huh\nI'll add one more to that I lost my faith that day to go and um I had gone to church five days a week during the week and every Sunday\nUh September eighth of twenty Seventeen was the last night I went to church um\nEarly in the day and it's been so long for writing from Fox they said the amicably separating bowling and Fox are amicably separating\nUm and I looked at it on that day as a\nAs a new beginning and goes separating\nUm and I looked at it on that day\nAs a as a new beginning and go start and go find another job somewhere and life is going to be\nGreat and you're going to sue\nI didn't know what it was going to do when I I Will tell you that I ate whatever was written about me was false patently false ... who is a lie it never happened in it and no one has ever ever come forward there was all anonymous sourcing\nBig long story short my lawyer said it's probably time to just cut ties with Fox and move on to go find another job is could this could go on forever and ... like there was going to be my family is going to be dragged through the mud for a long time so I decided that that was the thing to do we cut ties around three o'clock in the afternoon it was a friday before long weekend\nFor Labor Day\nUh I took my wife out to dinner that night and we didn't celebrate the owner of the restaurant came over and say hey you know congratulations new start and then I drink on the way home [noise] we got the call or we're driving home and uh\nThe the my phone rang it was a young man on the other side of the phone saying Mr boy and call\nHer son call Eric right away so what's wrong is just ... right away I called over there and I'm a girl answered and her name was Kayla he had been seeing her on and off she was crying and for some reason I just went right to them is he alive\n[noise] [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nShe said no [noise]\nAh [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] that\nThat was a that was a rough day the next state went to Colorado\n[noise] and the president called me\nAs anything we can do for you I said no thank you [noise] but at that day and realized that he cared and I'm so for the next few months I made it my mission to create awareness around a opioids\nAmerican or bought his antics on campus\nAnd waste with ... ... so yeah so that was that day a\n... and so now we are a year and two days after\nThat and it's been Roscoe\nYou we can stop at any time if you don't want to talk about anything so um I think it's just important story to tell 'em when you said is he alive why\nWe're there indications or was it just a bad feelings that feeling of who gets called ten thirty at night and was told to call your son right away without explaining why I had a hunch and sure enough knowledge turned out to be true so um\nTurns out he was a he bought his antics on campus that was laced with that no it wasn't a prescriptive antics he didn't know he passed it was an accidental overdose\nUm so the question you asked me was I going to sue Fox I ... at that moment I had no flight need to do anything [noise] so um we spent my wife and I just got very close and we spent the better part of the next year just talking to other parents talking or any opportunity we could um do you get the word out that\nIt's an epidemic excuse me and\nAnd uh people parents need to know that that their children are at risk

think you know we have a slightly different way of doing things uh than what you were probably typically here in conservative talk radio a wine is we're mindful of the things we're actually trying to conserve is kind of nowadays conservative means I'm not a communist\n[laughter] are you just moving in with pat when you say the second best one hears you to have had it he's number one and in space by our space butter space by your number\nTwo [laughter] to help move in that I can understand why this is why he is a genius [laughter] do\nYou know we actually talked about the things we're trying to conserve the values and virtues that made America exceptional and where they came from in the first place it we we like to start arguments even more than we like to win them\nBecause we think that one of the big problems in our country there's this idea that we're really divided in were arguing all the time has run that argument at all\nWhat we're doing is we're grabbing Seventeen burner

own native sweat lodge convinced for right about absolutely everything over lobbing verbal bombs that our neighbor over there and we never talk to and we're calling that in arguments okay\nI I actually think we need some real arguments we actually need to have both sides come out\nAh you know I kind of I I think the truth is its own reward and the truth is our friend ... and I'm perfectly fine having a truthful conversation with people on the other side\nSo can you have good because I've I've started having them myself I'm a doctor or a Denver so ah in Studio this weekend or this last week\nUm we had Dave Ruben who else a stew here recently Michael reckon walled that Michael record all this guy who used to write for the communist newsletter and we don't agree on everything\nMhm but I'm looking for the people who you can't have a conversation with somebody who is who's goal it is to say rights apply to certain people right and not to others is there isn't there a there is a line of who you can have a Congress serious\nAnd you know we try to equip our audience to see some of those lines and I think we need to understand to distinctions in our culture today gentleman we need to understand that distinction between an opponent and enemy\nIn a liberal and a leftist an opponent is someone who disagrees with you maybe even Vietnam and will do whatever they can within the boundaries of the of you know what's acceptable in terms of cultural warfare to defeat your ideas and the arena of ideas in enemy is somebody who wants to end you\nIn any somebody has no interest in sharing a neighborhood with you sharing a school with the little league game with you or an office building with you uh and then you look at what's the difference between a liberal and the left is that you know a liberal is somebody that wants the government to permit you to do things God says are immoral and dumb\nPolarized anymore I think we're ... we get the reference dynamic in here\nSo okay let's let's pick it up there\nHow do we um how do we come come back and ah how do we start reaching out to the people who actually do have much more in common with us because they do believe in

where she logged Arizona senator meth lab of democracy videos at my age ... dot com and\nSo I talked about this a little bit on the news and why it matters last night uh\nAnd I and I asked the group it was a turning\nPoint for the Democratic party the leadership\nI think it was there was a spiritual turning point and it was when they didn't hide God three times and their platform I mean I just I find it incredible that they actually did it three times I mean it's just so biblical mhm\nAnd you are you are seeing\nA in you're seeing the things that I talked about in my in my novel the eye of ... people don't know that they are repeating rituals they don't know what's really going on but there we are repeating Old Testament stuff from the Democrats really are\n\nProgressive as him and I think this is why the churches on the defensive collectively in the culture it's because\nIt is it it's looked at the clown show that we often see on right wing cable news of\nGuys who pretend to be ministers but really they're just ministers of the church or wherever the GOP guy that gives them on the table at the moment is\nOr a Democrat or the Democrat on the other side you're right but I mean in terms of people have a discerning spirituality which would tend to lean more conservative ... and so there's a lot of a discerning people in our poll bits that had decided they don't want to be the next Ralph Reed clown show on cable news basically and so they're just going to vacate the public sphere altogether which is kind of a false choice really yeah\nAnd it's because they don't understand that progressive ism isn't a political ideology it's a religion\nIt is it's the it's the and I see this on our show all the time Glenn it's the it's the area is Marcy on ... you know great heritage throughout the course of the history of the church that's what this is a this era it has its own Herman nuke\nIt has its own creation myth dosing Darwinism it has its own in ... where the state essentially replaces the church and government is the becomes God like chest hurts and said when the government removes the God the government will become the God and that's what you're dealing with here the same reaction you're getting from leftist when you trigger them on their on their state isn't\nIs the same reaction that you would get with your beliefs if you walk down the walk down the streets of Amman, Jordan a quote unquote moderate Arab nation\nWalk down the streets of Amman, Jordan where they're queen is a Seventy five on a scale of one to ten and the king seems to be a modern her mind in his right walk down the street from Amman, Jordan and say this okay say I'm Christians and Muslims worship the same God makes year where in ... and find out first that they have a Second Amendment in ... in Amman, Jordan because your life will be in danger\nAnd that's what you're witnessing here this is religious fervor\nYou're you're attacking their idol this was not mere political disagreement this isn't even just fundamental existential philosophical disagreement this religious fervor you're dealing with the loose it sanity that coach predicts\nI just want to say the first part of that uh the dissertation idling understood about ten\nPercent [laughter] they couldn't short will they so they can\nTranslate that into human language\nUh I I I\nThink we see that with global warming with a with their reaction to abortion was loose Robie weight thing that means absolutely everything they worship at the altar of these things ... it it really is a religious fervor\nYou know that you see with them and and this is kind of the the point of the ... ... ... is\nThis is well this is his\nYeah they they don't necessarily know or they don't know it but that doesn't change the fact that what they're doing it was the worship of the environment and the sacrifice of your children ... he wanted your children to be sacrificed on an idle\nYou would have permit skewer sex at a celebration of bail you could do anything in the woods in the groves in the groves and then when you got pregnant he would call you back and they would slaughter the newborn baby right I I mean it is exactly the worship of bail\nNothing new under the sun you know when when St Paul is looking back on the time period whom himself a Jew so he grew up in the Jewish schools he knows this history very well when he's looking back at that time period is when he writes forward thinking in a New Testament world and Romans one\nWhere he's when he's when he talks about the wrath of God revealed on the world and he but he I used to think when I was a baby believer that if if cultures did bad stuff it would cause God to act\nThe more you study Romans one I think it's actually the other way around I I think we do bad stuff\nBecause we deny that God is acting meaning it's a it's a self reinforcing mechanism the natural law uh it it kind of been forces itself and so you're dealing with people that
