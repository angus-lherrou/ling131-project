painfully obvious that they are not fans of Donald Trump on many occasions the attacks that are that they have\nA have been the hitting him with and then silently retracting are false but also the media has been under attack by the White House for very long time\nIt's not an issue with just the current administration and stop making it one President Obama was historically a nightmare for the free press and you refuse to say anything about it\nThe crazy thing is today\nThe craziest thing is is that the media gleefully gave Obama a pass even though he was weaponized sing the FBI and the de OJ against the press\nDonald Trump has gone so far as just calling them fake news and they got their feelings hurt\nForget about the oil I don't know threatening to throw us all in jail\nThis president is calling us fake news\nYeah well he kind of has a point just if you even look at how President Obama treated the press compared\nTo you know President Obama was putting new people in jail he was what\n... the government against you and you failed to stand up and say anything\nOh\nAs a media was gearing up for its outrage over being called fake the New York times was publishing an article\nOn the very same day these pipe bomb packages were delivered now I Want you to remember this is largely there's just just put this in your pipe and smoke it for a little bit\n\nThere being called fake news they're being called liars they're saying\nNo no no no we're not we don't publish fake news we don't have anything against the president it's not a vendetta\nAnd while this is happening the New York times is printing ... an article titled five novelist imagine Trump's next chapter five\nNovelists imagine Trump's next chapter the main image\nAt the top of this story shows

mock me you mock me\nEvery single one that's going to come to surprise\nThey found five fiction writers are going to do it but every single one wrote a short story depicting a scenario where the president was found guilty every single one isn't that amazing they couldn't find one fiction writer to write something where Trump was not guilty it's crazy\nOne story had Trump's signing the twenty Fifth Amendment or and another even had him uh being assassinated by a Russian agent with the help of Secret Service\nYeah\nWe can write about the president being assassinated were advocating violence I don't know what ... what are you are you kidding me know that it was about the Russians that wasn't about a coup yes yes okay Secret Service was involved but that's not about a cool\n\nIs the New

neutral\nI thought that was the idea let's be neutral\nNow I understand that everybody has an opinion but five writers and no one can come up with anything other than the guy is guilty and maybe he's going to be killed by the secret\nService this is unbelievable how is it the two hundred\nJournalists can sign a letter claiming that everything is the president's fault when the flagship of the

the public square\nThey have no inclination to actually at even attempt to find the truth even attempt to understand\n\nYes there is a little righteous indignation and me it's not anger is it is

random topic of the\nOnly other part of that ... yeah and he's a black face right like that you don't believe that they're getting\nCut again at the end the Jimmy Fallon one more because Jimmy Fallon has not a political enemies Kimball has put himself in as a political commentator so it's really agree just for him but Fallon who is I think there is no ill intent by Jimmy Fallon doing that but he's friends with Chris Rock writing\nBut the issue here is it on the freaking NBC yeah you can spirit us ally early for mentioning it but you know let Jimmy you're going to give Jimmy Fallon the top but place in your network so what she said was\nWeight but if you are if you are holding somebody up if you're if you're making fun of them okay but\nIf you're holding somebody up like this woman who you
