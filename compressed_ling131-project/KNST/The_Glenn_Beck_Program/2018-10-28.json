{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KNST", "content": "High mark\nYes I entered into a a settlement contract with a large insurance company and they were supposed to uh give me a two good faith check up front\nFor a total of a two hundred and one thousand dollars and then payments for the next seven years I took the checks down to the bank and a crater new account specifically\nFor those are the one check for forty five thousand dollars one through and then it was notified by the bank and set in the mail a return on a stop payment on the second check\nOkay did you did you call them up and just ask why\nI asked why and everybody is walking around with their head gone G we've never heard of this ever happening before\nYou may have to hire a well I wouldn't even hire a lawyer yet a now comes a a letter saying you're clearly in breach of the contract\nAnd send him a letter out senator and breach of a\nCar they're ignoring you\nSend it to all the different ...\nAnd how long ago how long ago did you send that letter how many weeks ago or days or weeks ago All right well ... couple of weeks ago is not enough time\nFor all that they've had sixty days to respond\nI Know but they do and I just I ...\nI just had one of those where it was a settlement that do we entered into my company entered into where we're going to get paid 'cause we dealt with people that didn't do such a good job who had insurance so we settled at\nAnd they have to pay within thirty days the insurance company ... they ended up paying within Seventy five days is how long it took us to get paid\nOkay and to the point where our lawyer had to get in that's a lawyer who arranged the settlement had to come in and start screaming at the insurance companies we\nActually had to file a lawsuit for breach before they paid\nOkay so mark just get really aggressive or if they ... you probably fell through the cracks mark a if you're dealing with a major insurance company you weren't going to get paid more there's no question and then I Would turn around and see how much interest you're paying ... small claims court for the interest you lost\nThrough OK well you'll get paid more guy it's ... it's that's world of insurance they're they grab you you're you're a second and a half late on your auto insurance for your health insurance ear canceled\nSeventy five days late on a payment that was supposed to be made within thirty days just like Mark and that's typically what the payment or the timeline normally is\nGo figure huh oh hey Gary welcome to handle on law\n[noise] hey I'm I have a question for you my wife and I own a house in Ventura and it's a smaller track about uh thirty nine lot thirty nine homes ah we when we bought the house um where was given a a excuse me a fancy and are that are\nLimited what we could do a lot of what we could do with our own and one of the stipulations of the the the at our said that\nEach of the homes has to be built on a single a lot and um that each home had to be at least Seventy five feet wide there are other stipulation\nBut what happened was a developer God for the city of Ventura uh the city approved the flooding of the law and now the developer is building two homes\nThat are in violation of the CBC in are in a number of different ways\nOkay so I wanted to know what our record\nThe record on who you are you what you do is you get the homeowners you get the H away\nAnd immediately file a lawsuit against him just because of the city allows\nA certain type of building or the or the community that is the actual weight also can control and they can say no one more than one lied or one home per ... now\nI then it becomes an interesting situation where the developer now comes back and saying you're violating liability\nOr to build housing of which ah I'm allowed to do based on the city but I think the winner here in my opinion would be the H away but you you it's time to get a lawyer you need a land use attorney Gary like right now\nIs that a real estate attorney\nOr it is a real estate attorney but it's a real estate attorney that specializes in land use and there are a attorneys out there than in fact represent nothing but H always\nOkay so you get to go just go on the uh go on the Internet and got check them out because that is I Know developers going to roll over on this one uh there's no way in hell especially if you're building additional homes that's big money for them\nAll right max Hi good morning coffee ... inch is quite a horse [laughter] okay well yes you have trouble with an insurance company yeah sure never heard that one before ever an accident much of that yeah\nWell we're asking anyway anyway they shorted me based on the estimate based with Mitt they shorted me eight hundred dollars\nA call him a couple of times the fish when they told me to go do that that is anyway anyway what I did I filed in small claims court treat other Ninety seven dollars and they came with a check for five hundred\nPanda verbiage on the check to check that negates\nClaims right now I'm Wondering if I can check because I Know in ... in court if I take I checked us at ... yeah\nYeah because that's part of the agreement the agreement is if you would say is jak then I Will not go after you I waive all my rights absolutely so the only way you can go and kick their body is to say no thank you to the check and go ahead and file in small claims court and kick their butts\nOkay that's that's where I'm going to go good luck\nAnd here's the good news whenever you go in front of a judge small claims judge against an insurance company I don't know how that works normally they would take it right up the superior court and so you're really not going to be in front of the uh a judge I Will be small claims judge which are usually not judges odd and\nDaddy is and this happens all the time with the companies they immediately make a a motion to kick it up and then you have to go out and hire a lawyer ostensibly however there isn't a judge in this world that has not been screwed by an insurance company\nSo you're coming in with an advantage\nBy dry cleaners never even go to small claims court ever because they know they're gonna lose walking in the door they just write checks now the good news is they write checks for the amount of replacing a\nDress and I've had\nA pair of pants they know I shop at Costco so it wasn't even more cash the check [noise]\nThis is handling the [noise]\n\nThis is Michael men than here with my ... from health markets helping folks find the

the best right help markets offers a free service with access to thousands of Medicare plans nationwide to help folks maximize their benefits and say honey\nWhat is it people need to keep in mind\nEnrollment in the right plan is not automatic with so many Medicare options that can be confusing my advice don't go at it won't get unbiased help to find a plan that may cost less and cover more with lower copayments more choices like dental and vision and the freedom to choose your doctors\nWith the enrollment deadline only weeks away it's important to act now our health markets

who are really interesting the election only forty nine percent of Democrats Democrats got smoked\nUm you said the same thing two thousand fourteen remember Democrats got smoked again they're Republicans fifty nine percent or said they were really interested only forty eight percent of Democrats said that um and what's interesting is leading up to I Would say Brett Kavanaugh\nYou had the same type of thing playing out\nAgain in this time in favor of the Democrats started to look a lot like two thousand six so up until ... you had sixty three percent of Democrats\nHighest levels of interest in the election Republicans was only fifty three percent so that is a you know a big it's the type of gap that leads you to lose the than any ... and lose the house or at least makes it possible ...\nSince ... that has changed Democrats have gone up from sixty three to Seventy two percent holy cow Seventy two is the highest number for any party and all of these elections\nHowever Republicans have jumped a a higher percentage point basis from fifty three to sixty eight\nSo now we have a basically a balance a very close within the margin of error separation and both of those numbers sixty eight\nWould be the second highest level of interest of all of these elections so the Democrats are Seventy two Republicans are sixty eight both of those numbers are the highest of any of these elections going back to two thousand six mid ... two dozen six midterms\nI'm and I'm which is which is crazy\nIt is a a a ... there's a level here that we don't know what's gonna happen if we this is like you know this was territory that has not been seen before\nAnd ... you know while you can look at the polls and you can see the polls as we've talked about over the past couple of weeks relatively\nAre relatively pointing towards a Republican or a ... victory in the Senate where they maybe pick up a couple of seats and Republican loss in the house where they would lose a couple of decades um there is a you know if you wanna look at the kind of be optimistic way of looking at the house right now\nTo show you how close is if Republicans were just sweep the races they are favored in okay that's not it's not going to happen it never happens but just kind of generally for understanding if there would be able to sweep all of the races there favored in\n... and they revealed a when all of the races that date trailed by one point so all of these races are\nEither victories are toss ups right I mean they could go either way but if they were to sweep all of those Republicans still hold the house at two twenty two Fifteen now the problem is the idea that they're going to sweep all those races is\nWe know that's not going to happen it never happens the other thing is they will win some races where they're underdogs by more than one point they will win some places you know whenever the down by five in the polls don't want him winning some of those races\nSo the split is going to be important here but just that gets them only to two twenty two Fifteen which is a I think they lose that's been losing ten seats from where they are now\nUm but also a very narrow majority to the point where some conservative things could be derailed by just you know your generic moderate house member that you've never heard their name before um when they decide they're going to vote against the president\nIt's an interesting a way of looking at it\nAnd it shows that this really could go either way I mean when they say that there's about a twenty percent chance the Republicans lose the Senate and about a twenty percent chance that the Republicans when the house\nThat's the way that these models are all kind of looking at it twenty percent is one in five right um so it is very possible that one of these things could happen but right now it looks like those are going to wind up getting split and then of course still has ... even though you're not gonna be able to pass\nDemocratic bills because they would either give each other on the train in the house you're still going to have investigative power to have subpoena power are going to have the\nPoster nightmare it's a nightmare if if they get the house it's a nightmare okay so here's here's what I found interesting in um in watching the news and watching just the flow of it\nHave you noticed that you know places like the Atlantic and the times and the post are now starting to publish stories about\nYou know it's an uphill battle to win some of these races in the house it's an uphill battle they have changed their tone from\nUm you know an absolute positive well we're on a blue wave to now almost laying the foundation of yeah we we lost but it was you know it was really kind of a long shot anyway\nYeah I mean that's how badly I think the cap and I'll sing a has backfired on them I mean it's made the Senate basically I mean again it's just that it's one of the five chance but I mean they had they had a better chance of this uh two months ago I mean they had\nA legitimate path to victory when Cruz was only up by three points all of these races that looked like leaning Republican we're all toss up or in some of them looked like they might be leading Democrat they had a chance to win the Senate before the Kavanaugh facing now I mean I think it's a real a real it's going to\nCome to the independents how are the independence feeling\nAt the ... they're in an interesting group because they are not as passionate as you would expect in this environment so independence in two thousand six and two thousand ten were fifty percent\nIndependents are almost always going to be lower and high interest and then partisans because partisans engage more like chipping away I'm the type of course a blanket robots typical um and she doesn't fourteen it was down to forty percent and she doesn't eat uh Eighteen up until Kavanaugh was forty two percent\nAnd then uh the jump now to forty six percent so still that's not as high as some of the earlier elections among independents and that may just be because\nThey're overwhelmed with him and they don't they don't like either side and they just want it makes them want to withdraw from\nPalo yeah but I Wonder 'cause I Would consider myself an independent yeah and there's no way you're going to keep me away from the polls\nAnd so I'm Wondering you know would that four percent jump was it a four percent effort to preserve four percent jump I'm I Wonder how much of that or people like me who are going to vote for the Republican just because the left has gone in\nPain right and there's a lot of independents that I ... I mean I certainly would fall into this category as well right I Am not registered member of any party nor will I ever write her like life was that being said uh you know I vote Republican\nI mean I you know don't vote for Democrats [laughter] so I mean for Republicans independents and libertarians libertarians say don't vote for Democrats like yeah I mean so that's never going to happen so the fact that I'm an independent you can't look at that line as\nThese are people who could go either way at any time between these two parties that's not what that is right people who identify that way it's a group that that is growing and has been growing for quite some time yes people are bailing out of the parties um but the parties themselves are becoming a more rigid in and more\nOf this one could come down to the independents mhm this one could come down to because you can understand the Republicans going up you can understand if you're on the Democratic side Kavanaugh driving all those people but what's driving the independent\n... yeah I mean I Would think they are discussed\nWith what's going on right [laughter] if anything they don't like the overall system there's one other interesting than here Glenn if we could yeah as we're talking about the caravan\nOf of uh immigrants coming migrants whatever ... which will will be illegal immigrants if they if they get all the way up by the way who who said that was coming uh\nOh yeah this this burger yeah definitely we talked about them a lot about this Huh Interesting to see the numbers among Latino voters so ah in two thousand six were coming off of the attempt at comprehensive immigration reform that fails ... Republicans very upset about that Democrats win that election relatively easily um\nA Latino at sixty two percent high interest in the election\nThat number in mid term elections has been dismal since ... in two thousand ten was only forty eight percent two dozen fourteen it was forty one percent very low or in two thousand uh Eighteen up until very recently or was it was at forty seven percent that number has now jumped\nIn October of two dozen Eighteen Seventy one percent from forty seven Seventy one this year so this is a whatever the reason why oh why not as high as in two thousand six for Latino voters wow a and again that was a wave election for Democrats it's the I mean the\nOnly thing I can think of is the Guatemalan refugees what else has happened I mean you did have\nAlso a fairly recently the uh uh unaccompanied minors situation where they're being quote unquote held in cages you know that was in July or August yeah but still ... relatively recently a I'm a you know the the two thousand each in polls were taken January to September\nSo some of those polls were for that some after okay um all the October ones obviously after ... men include the migrant a caravan situation and that might explain the jump but it's it's high everywhere I mean it would be the only places low\nUm and it's not low relative to normal which is our younger voters Eighteen and thirty four there at fifty one percent which is the lowest number on most of these democratic ... demographic groups that you can find however it's also a lot higher than any other time and all of these elections the highest they had been before that was thirty nine for going into ...\nSays you know it is our whole lives that this is going to be interesting it is like it's like\nOh hold on just a second sense when his reporting of fact since when is quoting him a conspiracy\nAnd make it seems like the accusation is if you're trying to say that he's ever done anything that's questionable in his life you're making excuses for his murder which of course it's not\nThat it's not no no it's different that's different that's that's the people who are tweeting and saying oh oh so he deserved today no no no no this is a horrible crime committed by a horrible state who is not our ally\nPerhaps we need them I don't know I don't like getting into these situations I Wish we weren't there at all but this was a crime and it was despicable disgusting brutal\nI mean unbelievable to people in the west but it happened and I have no doubt that the prince was behind it\nOkay that has no bearing on who he was\nWe can say that this was a despicable horrible crime done by the Saudis and their horrible people for X Y Z\nAnd we can say ... did not deserve to die this way nobody deserves to die that that way however he's not the guy that everybody in the press is making him out to be he's not some freedom loving guy\nHe's a member of the Muslim Brotherhood\n... the Muslim Brotherhood that he was pushing for was an Islamic\nState\nHe wants an Islamic state in his own writing in the Washington Post\nSays yeah we have to have a an Islamic assist rule\nIf you dismiss as Islam assist rule under surreal law then you'll never have peace in the middle east well wait a minute I'm not against Islam I Am against Islamic rule sharia law tell me where it's working out show to me\nWhere is that working out where is it protecting human rights no thank you I mean\nIslamic rule just by none other group of Islam is is what you have in Saudi Arabia\nNo thank you I'm going to give some of the facts of of this guy and it's not a conspiracy there was a conspiracy to commit murder to hide it and\nWe have found that now America needs some adults in the room to say okay that's a separate issue but let's not paint ... into some freedom loving prince because\nProbably um shadow Stevens I'm here to talk about the um T shirt go Murray tooth diseases see empty attacks the nerves of the arms and legs leading to muscle and movement loss it affects one and twenty five hundred Americans but nobody's ever heard of it which is why this September is the empty awareness month\nIt's your chance to learn about the empty and white treatments could be just years away visit we are the C.

the people like anti ... who are doing this to hope for viral collapse I think part of what healthy Americans should do as a nor them [noise]\nSo what he is are\nAre we I mean I've spent\nThe last two years and the things that I can I continually come back to every single time\nIs the bill of rights it's why people came here because they were protected they knew that they had the right to dream and create and be left alone yeah yeah is that our our even our own them\nSo yes ... or ... them out of the many one right we don't have a whole bunch of one right now we don't have a shared sense of what you've just said the first amendment is the beating heart of the American experiment freedom of religion freedom of the press freedom of assembly freedom of speech right of protest\nAll of those things flow from the fundamental assumption about the dignity of three hundred and twenty million Americans which is we believe a modern day we believe that our citizens are created in the image of God with the turtles souls and with dignity\nThat way bigger than their policy preferences and so what's unique in our mall but I think the grand tension that we as a people are not really wrestling through that is so far upstream from politics is this tension between rudeness and ruthlessness\nAlmost all of the happiness literature a few well out there it's confirming stuff that wise people people who've had grandparents have known for millennia\nWhich is that happiness is actually a relatively simple equation the nuclear family do you have a couple of deep friendships\nOr do you have a local worshipping community do you have a theological framework to make sense to death and suffering and forests and statistically the number one driver of happiness is do you have a meaningful vocation do you have shared work do you have co workers do you think when you leave home on Monday morning\nWhen you go to do something not to make a lot of money or do you have a lot of status but is there some neighbor who benefits from what I Do\nIf those four things are true or even if three of the four true you're pretty likely to be happy and that those things are all tied to rudeness but we're living through a technological revolution that's tempting to believe that we can be ruthless we can be place less\nAnd so a lot of what's happening as the undermining of local community and the undermining of thick relationships and the undermining of vocation or long work\nEnds up in a world where a lot of people are using political tribalism to fill a void of the loneliness that's actually happening in their local community I think we need to reflect more deeply on that challenge of our time\nAll right so I'm going to take a quick break and I want to come back and talk about um the press talk about uh the new press if you will Facebook and\nWhat you write about what's deep fakes um you seem to be one of the very few in Washington that really get to this\nAh and you're looking

working that's why people listen to me when I should talk I talk about ways of making people better I I focus on something which will sound crazy I focus on happiness\nBecause our nation was built on life liberty pursuit of happiness and no one talks about this I Do all the time everything I'm Talking about is to try to make people more happy or to at least allow them to pursue happiness\nSorry so tell me about that let's start there sure um we talk I talk about for example there there are many controversies that I talk about uh education I I have a complete revamp the education system and people just want to keep funding the same system I'm making hemp and the candidates legal hang of\nIt before it sure some have started with me I should go into education absolutely\nI'm the one talking about getting rid of all centralized testing prior to high school I Know in talking about doing that because ... testing is it unfair way of bringing teachers\nIt's an unfair way of rewarding schools\nAnd it makes kids what ten eleven twelve years old feel stupid because they can't test well and there's no indication of success and what are we finding we're finding literally kids we we have a thirty percent rise in suicide across his entire nation to include children\nOne of those reasons as family court how broken that is another reason is there pressure to take tests and feel stupid and to be some come successful at ten eleven twelve years old\nWhy satellites testing is very good when you're in high school and joined where you should go where you have a clip of these are not a bad idea but ten years old why is to keep control of what's happening in the schools I'm not okay with that\nNow you have a bit of gray hair as I Do know that means you are in school prior to Nineteen eighty and it was I\nProudly Nineteen eighty there really was a department of education I mean it existed but it was basically a repository for information and he was ... you really do anything ... somehow everyone in in in the United states some help on how to read write\nSurvive in the world without at at a department education somehow that work somehow local school districts that a good job somehow that worked at the Internet you add a technology you think the odds are worse\nAnd they give you a quick rundown of every single time centralized control has made things better\nFinished [laughter] yeah right so that's not really what I Want I Want to I Want to make sure that we have some localized central and the only guy saying let teachers teach then I don't administrators because here's the problem with getting ready so nice testing you will lose about we will lose in New York state we will lose about four billion dollars in federal funding\nIt's a lot of money but isn't that much for us our budget is sixty billion so losing four billion not in the world however we can still fix that here's the issue here\nWhen we lose at four billion we also lose something else we lose all those strings attached that for a million and there's lots of strings which means administrators go away and then it shows were writing granted measures were checking boxes all those things we have massive teacher burn out in New York state massive why\nRegulations rules checking boxes I'm the only ones saying these things because I cross the entire state might say that's easy to counties I crossed all sixty two\nI'm going to fool sharply by the way for you though but I Want teachers to actually wants to teach we actually have districts that have more minutes raiders than teachers\nThe average teacher and that's a shame for by the way you have a teacher makes about eighty thousand dollars a year in New York state\nThe average diminish it makes over a hundred and fifty among you dump a couple of minutes raiders you hide my teachers you've given raises you bought computers all these things but I'm Still not done why in the world we have K. through twelve neat K through ten\nThe last two years of high school for too many kids is Jim study hall video games and probably smoking weed ... that's all they're doing how do we know this\nBecause the first year of college for most kids is thirteenth grade it's removed because not ready for it correct so now it takes at least six years the average kid to graduate college west terrible now got twenty four year old kid who's never had a job and we say I wonder why hasn't the work ethic\nWe've never had a job it is he's been he's been he's screwing around for eight years literally not people who were telling me literally Larry I Will hire anybody with a work ethic\nAnd one of ... told me he said Laurie my interview process is very simple I tell them to show up at eight o'clock I open the door if they're there they're hired\nAnd that's how bad it is will be will show up at the clock in the morning it is so that so we need to break that system that I Can't change parenting that I Can't do what kind of changes the the environment of course\nAt sixteen now instead kitchen that five choices they they take a test\nThey go to hospital plumber number one if colleges right for you that's amazing go to college the problem is we've been told a lie\nAnd the lie is the only way to have success in this country is to get a great high school diploma and then go to a great college and then sit behind a desk in for a new computer all day ... that's a way to success not even close to the only way to success\nLots of people are happy doing all types of things and we should embrace that so it's sixteen let's not make some decisions\nIf I think cause you write to me I go to a two year prep school to prep school is that a biology chemistry history whatever break off to college I go to years and I make sure it's working right so that time I get into college and ready and graduate in three or four years and take advantage of internships are incubator is life is good\nI don't like that no worries on the super smart kid the kid who you know loves doctor who I'm teasing my doctor who fan\nLove I'm a doctor who have failed at that time not sure about the new doctor do you know being a female but that's a different story\nDown okay yes [laughter] so um so that kid who's really smart that could take the SAT right away and goes off and get to the great why should they be bored in school and they should be born school\nNext you don't want any of those things now worries go to a two year trade school go to ... to become a plumber carpeting or whatever you want to be about mechanic an H fat guy in New York state particularly we need that desperately the average tracing the New York state is over fifty ... that's a problem I let my six year old I'm fifty a ... year old\nMy problem is they should not be the average they should not be doing\nToday [noise]\nThat's that's the sad part they don't they don't they don't realize that when a sinking ship mhm or maybe

is libertarian and uh is making waves in New York and he's a voice that you should hear because his his policies are different than the Republican and the Democrat and I believe they're very very workable in a\nIn an era when we are changing everything when technology has changed everything\nWhy we're still looking at a system uh you know that feels like the old Soviet site styles centralized system is beyond me but\nI'm Larry let me let me just run down a couple of things um\nYou are if you were governor of the state of New York you are dealing with the big banks ... uh and the big banks a Cuomo is pushing them around quite a bit especially when it comes to the second amendment\nA and trying to de platform or people if you do any business with with gun manufacturers or gun dealers\nTotally on ethical for a governor to impede business\nPeriod no ... no ... if I don't like industry or like something I never said if I Want to our freedom of speech but when it comes to being governor I should have the opposite I should be the facilitator and chief I should be the marketer and chief\nNot not his majesty emperor who decides these people are evil because I ... so that's the wrong answer that's what he's doing the reality of it is he's always not only\nDoing that she's also threatening another group of business people that you'll be in trouble with the state if you do business with these\nAbsolutely and winds up happening more than ... more than more than often as normal thing which is the small guy gets hurt here because big business will always find a way around as eating right they always they find a way around it but how about the guy who say for example just wants to insurance force firearm\nNow we can't get it there's no way that the individual and there are at least four million I'm gun owners in New York state if not more widely and insurance now\nWhen when when insurance companies won't do business in New York state anymore for any kind of firearm but that's the plan isn't it that's the problem yes and that's the unethical part that's the issue right and this is you're making New York state residents criminals overnight\nNot just that it's a gun violation in New York state it's by default a violent felony by default no matter what you do\nThat's how it works in New York state you're turning millions of New Yorkers into violent felons overnight\nAnd we wonder why we have a ... if you have a gun if you if you have a firearm that is not safe acts compliant say fact was passed in twenty Thirteen and the fact that that certain aspects of a firearm make it legal or illegal literally what he decided\nI think this piece of plastic is evil so this piece of plastic which is now he but which by the way you purchase the day before completely totally above board you are now a violent fell and\nIt was so bad that the cops said wait a minute now we're all violent felons to not joking is true story\nAnd then out revamp the law because all the cops were felons overnight yes all the cops were said to revamp the law because of that in other words but now if you're retired cop once you retire well now you're a felon again using them were not gritty cop\nThis this is where we are in New York state this is horribly bad the the the answer isn't always the same thing it is all about projecting how he is helping the little guy mhm constantly who project I care about the little guy but every single aspect he fails I'm a businessman\nIf I lost a hundred thousand customers every single year for eight years I should be fired mhm that's what he's done we've lost over ... million since he descendent thrown over a million ... problem leaving leaving New York state over a million over a hundred thousand every year for eight
