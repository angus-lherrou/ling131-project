Fox News President Trump considering ending a policy where children born in the last two parents who are illegal immigrants are automatically US citizen Democrats slamming a plant\nWhat what what do you call that\n[noise]\nYou know the reason why you have to stop this if it's coming the reason why you have to stop it is because if you don't stop this one there will be an invasion\nBecause America can control our own borders\nNearly eight thousand troops to match what four thousand strong caravan fourteen thousand if the second caravan linked up with the first swelling their numbers to seven thousand\nSo any media magician trying to spin what this caravan really is\nAnd I honestly don't know how you can describe a potential force of seven thousand people all approaching your border with the intent of getting through no matter what you say and carrying a foreign flag I don't know what you call it besides an invasion\n\nSo it was the department of defense justified well the news media will say no\nBut what does America say\nIt is classic mail is ... military style doctrine preparing now for an unconventional attack on the country that has not happened before\nBut I said I Want to be fair here unexpected in a regular tactics call for emergency action and I definitely feel safer knowing that men and women and green and blue or standing watch on the border\n\nI don't know what you can expect what should you do nothing\nNothing\nIf you had a group of people that were headed to your business or to your house and they said\nGoing to go into your house whether you like it or not\nAnd we've got two thousand people here and you're not going to be able to stop us because what's in your house we want we're just going to live there\nNow if you had a group of people that were marching saying that coming to your house\nWould you want the police to do nothing\nYou think that would you be happy if the police all of a sudden just said you know what they're not common for you know here they are they're on the road there on the road there they are there's the video there's the video them saying they're going to come into my\nAnd live in my house oh please\nI don't know about you but the next time there was a campaign I shouldn't be running for sheriff\n\nLocal law enforcement protect our streets the border patrol protects our borders the new standard cannot be the military on our borders a hundred percent of the time\nEmergency situations always give birth to emergency changes which always turn into permanent changes the federal income tax the Patriot act two examples of many\nI don't like emergency measures\nThat's why we should have a border policy that allows immigrants to come in that are qualified\nCome in through the front door\nAnd stops all of the side windows in the back door entries the country needs either serious policy on the border that will stop this or you need to build the damn wall\nBecause quite frankly the military on the border is not a good solution\nBut I'm Sorry CNN\nI don't know what you want to call it I mean after all you don't like to call you don't like to call and so far when they're throwing Molotov cocktails you don't even like to call them a mob but\n[noise] the Glenn Beck program direction by numbers\nLet's take a look at election by a numbers fellows do tell me what's happening so far well uh we're one week away and this is when we get to see what the chart a little bit because we have a had a lot of races in the middle and they sort of toss up category you have 'em because Poland's been close and now we start to\nTry to move them around a little bit more aggressively because we're only a week away or so here's what we have right now are done it only three tossup races or we have moved uh Missouri and Indiana er into a lean Republican position I Would say Missouri I'm pretty confident of Indiana\nThe polling is is a little surprising their Donnelly has been favored there for a long time\nUm but we're moving those to lean Republican that the lives there was a Ted Cruz's still lean Republican state ah and ah ah Mississippi and North Dakota there's going to get you to fifty\nOne if you if the Republican sweep their leaders right now fifty one Republican senators say there are three tossup races we have that I think are pure toss up still and we couldn't really moved them\nOr Arizona is in their Nevada is in there and we moved Tennessee back into their Tennessee had a couple of really good polls were Marsha Blackburn a couple of weeks ago\nWhere she was you know some of them showing her up fourteen points latest polling has a lot closer a really a tough race at this point holy cow yeah so those three are are in the tossup category and we've moved a couple of towards the Democrats as well uh we moved to Florida to a lean democratic\nState uh again this is a tough race cars you've got the governor versus the incumbent senator it's been really tight the entire time but honestly looking at it we've seen a movement towards towards a Nelson in Florida\nAnd we now have that one is a lean democratic state um we've moved Minnesota as well from faith Democrat to leaning Democrat polling there [noise]\nYou know I still think that's going to the Democrats but at the polling is closer then I think most people expect there's two races in Minnesota one of them to blow up the other one isn't and so we're keeping that one of the leading Democrat category for now Montana we've moved to lean Democrat as well\nOr was a tossup races where most of the time it looks like tester has enough of a lead there to consider this one to be leaning Democrat at this point ah and let's see we've got a New Jersey and Wisconsin leaning Democrat as well so if it's all leaders you've got forty one forty three\nFive for Democrats so I mean it's pretty it's\nI don't think the Democrats are going to win the Senate that is a lot of starting to look shaky it's moving in the wrong direction it is moving in the wrong direction over the past few days the polling has not been good I mean Florida was discouraging I think for Republicans to the past few days Montana's not turning around\nYou know we've seen no signs of real movement I I don't think in West Virginia as well which was a big culprit pick up again this was a state that voted for Trump by thirty points and Joe Manchin I think he you know I think he's solidified his seat there with his pro Kavanaugh's low yeah\nUm but in the opposite with North Dakota and hide camp I think she's done um but as of\nRight now I think you can say pretty solidly that there's that the majority right now is going to stay with\nA Republican but I mean again Missouri in Indiana are slight leaders were moving these days I Would normally keep those in the tops of category but for a week away and we got to pick at some point\nAnd we also are I mean we're in the election right now yeah I mean people are voting all across the country right now uh it's no longer a one day event okay I'm going to take a quick break then come back and give us some of those results on the house term\nElection by numbers\nOn the Glenn Beck program\nOr want to tell you about our response to this half hour it's filtered by a filter by is a great service really truly a great service\nI I'm going to be honest with you I I I've I'm I'm fifty\nThree fifty four year old ban love of beat I've never gone and bought a filter to change the filter no matter I've owned house after has never changed it you've never changed it in your life never I just did adjusted\nFor ... because the filter by yes unfiltered by is just a way to its way to like skipped the responsibilities of being a man he had a veil just do they just send it\nTo you so you don't have to remember ... and I know with you you just had your wife do it no I actually went well\nWell well I mean is there I was there okay well I ... I took the filter I took it from the front porch and I said honey where the hell are the ... where do we change the filters and she said\nI think it's upstairs and so she went to one direction I went the other direction some might say\nI knew it wasn't in the closet mhm um and ah interesting and so then she ... she found it and she pulled the other one out and I'm like oh great well here's the new one and she put that ... you know ... does well so you were there I was there well\nShe had nothing to say he was crazy on he was I mean as rock solid has he has been as under control as even know crazy tweet none of it he didn't play any of those games like you said the election and that's when he closed the entire gap was down by\nEight in the polls are so ah when after the the tape came out and closed it to a much ... you know tighter margin and wound up winning obviously you know it's funny that seems to be going the other way with right now I mean like he's talking obviously about a lot about the they're talking about a potential\nUh executive order to uh and birthright citizenship he's talking about\nUm he's been more aggressive right and that that may be good it may not be good we're going to see right now\nI don't think it is I think you know look you've already made your mind up with Donald Trump and then there there's a point to where he like I don't want any more information I don't want any new information or I Know what I mean I'm I'm I'm happy with the way things are going but I'm not thrilled with Kevin continue just\nHelp me as a citizen I just feel like everything is normal you know what I mean ... and he reminds people in a normal and right before an election that's not necessarily what you need\nThat makes sense ah yeah I think that's probably true because he made his strong stand with Kavanaugh he made that strong stand we know where he stands on the border mhm there's no reason to to get continued a dog pile\nAnd and quite honestly I I Wish he would stop the presses our enemy I understand what he means and I'm going to be doing some stuff on the press today a that is a a I mean it they're out of control\nBut that enemy the you know there is the enemy of the people it's just bad phrase allergy that makes me feel uncomfortable\nI think we have to also back up and say that this is not just adjusted Trump election right offices election for individuals in individual districts and there's a lot of storylines particularly in the Senate where you know there's a lot of storylines that could decide it I think the issue a overall however uh there's a\nThe momentum the is not in favor of of Republicans right now particularly in the house and you're seeing more movement or that's dangerous to the Democratic side right now but I mean they know who knows I mean this doesn't mean that that's the way it's going to turn out\nUm it's just it's not you'd hoped to be having a nice run right now where you're going to the ... like for example the lead up to the presidential election was a positive run for\nTrump in Denver and Republicans remember they you know a month before but I'm an eight or nine point they close that gap\nAll the way almost would pose a so it was not a the momentum clearly showed it was behind a Trump leading up to that election and obviously one\nHere it's a little bit it's not I would say it's dramatically to the left but it does seem to be leaning that would get out and vote do not sit this election out get out and vote\nAgree or disagree it doesn't matter as long as you think Glenn banks on gay and sta him seven Ninety two sons most stimulating tall\nAre you facing foreclosure\nCome do commend you on TALK shows we're moving to trust people keep [noise]\nNo no I'm ...

I Hope that there's a way to challenge it more than just\nBecause I constitutionally I think no the president can take issue an executive order that goes against the constitution but I Would like more than that I Would like them to rule on what the fourteenth amendment actually means\nIt seems to be a disagreement among even original is with the constitution as to what it actually means or whether that's included and it'll be entirely there is yeah I see that would be interesting to see like how that shakes out because you know one of the things we've praised Trump about relatively endlessly is I have been hit the job he's done with the courts so he needs to the judges he's put in\nWould now rule on this and with there being some level of debate even among original is whether this would be allowed or not if it's gonna be fascinating to edit does happen imagine Chuck Schumer and uh and Nancy Pelosi writing up\nThat brief as a friend of the court's come in and say no no judge Kavanaugh we we really believe\nIt is that guy has got to be a Superman to not eat them to not at least think oh really I mean\nYou can usually come with a Pittsburgh shooter and we have to say no really he did it he is really really bad you know we need to incarcerate him not even though we need to incarcerate him and he was you know there's got to be a part of it but just goes oh that's what you want [laughter]\nSpeaking of which is interesting to see a everybody bending over backwards in the mainstream media and a lot of the Democrat leadership trying to pin the Pittsburgh shooting on Trump the most pro Israel pro Jewish presidents we've ever had in the history of this country and he's responsible for this it's pretty amazing\nIt is ... ... you know what can we play we play just a couple of things [noise] listen listen to this this so far they have gone so far they've got here's here's Joe Scarborough and what he had to say listen to this\nMay go um [noise]\nYou know in a week people get to make a decision is this the America they want to live in\nBecause right now the only constitutional check against this sort of important to have your ... and I really a guy who was sending a message by time and time again tweeting about face forward talking about his bad hair day there that was done intentionally to send a message\nTo white nationalist says about me that much\nBut I'm I'm going to launch a baseball game I'm going to tweet about baseball World Series\nAnd just not that I'm I'm not going to let it occupy my day\nThis is how twisted have become you know so twisted they well and that's from a hard core conservative yeah chilled our daughter oh nobody's more conservative than Joe no you know not\nI mean not at least not at that desk send a good friend\nAnd he laid out all the reasons why it's about to take off yeah\nIt doesn't it yeah right yeah not again it's just a matter of timing I'm All right so\nHere's what I Want you to do I want you to take the smart crypto course because I think everybody should have at least a hundred dollars in in crypto currency it's just this game changing stuff and between a bitcoin crypto currency and block chain\nThat is the future and you need to understand it take this Glenn Beck exclusive\nCourse right now smart crypto course dot com smart crypto course dot com or call eight seven seven P.

Fox News President Trump considering doing away with birth rightly can automatically get citizenship to children born in the last even if the parents came here illegally white\nWhen we said Brock Obama is surrounded by socialist look at look at look at the cover of what was it a Newsweek Magazine said we're all socialist now and as soon as we said we're going for socialism or they immediately said were racist\nNow when you point out uh George Soros this week the media is trying to say anybody who disagrees with George Soros is an anti Semite\nThat's kind of the same thing that you found in Hollywood with your case is about\nI did I did and they basically taken the position that\nAnybody that is a Republican or conservative is racist is anti Semite is\nIs a homo phobic and it's just their their way of kind of of the ring us I mean I'm an American of Mexican descent and so and my wife is Mexican she's a first generation or you know a a Mexican American ... it's ... they\nUse this identity politics to other us and then they completely ostracized and it just isn't that hack mode and it's something that it it it goes into understanding why Hollywood is so ubiquitous late last waning\nAnd you know you see why all these stories that come out of Hollywood that are so one sided that only tell one side of the story\nSo you know that is when I saw this I said you know what we need to start telling our side of the story and we need to use storytelling as a as a way to do that\nSo that's what I ... it was it was astonishing kind of moment to to call out a man that is getting in bed with other people's kids and to actually have the entire community turn on it purely because we were conservatives it was an astonishing moment to go through\nWhat is it that the what is it that they have about conservatives more than pedophilia\n[noise] you know it I think it is a fear Hollywood is such a small community and it's run by so few people\nAnd it was just such a fear for losing work and one way and then on top of that it's like the game of Thrones where\nThey're it it's very competitive to ah to to get that work so the first the first way to take somebody out is the state of the conservative um and then anybody that anybody that is even near that person that gets us think that among conservative that they're conservative they run from that person so there's\nA lot of it is the loudest voices basically first kind of ... you out like the invasion of the body Snatchers that this guy is a conservative and then you have the the second tier which are just people that are fearful for their for getting work and those people run as well so it's just kind of this kind of\nA very unhealthy community that get set up and then you know and then you start to see what happens to the Hollywood box office they started slowly over the last Fifteen Years start to decline because they aren't making a content for the other half of the country\nSo um you know ... and I think that conservatives have really locked in on this and said you know what a ... of this we're not taking his anymore you see the ratings start to go down but now it's our time and now there's this new frontier service is where we need to start creating content for ourselves\nAnd we need to start entertaining ourselves because they're never going to do um and that's what we're trying to do with red old America that's on the heart radio a pod cast cheating on her radio arm shooting I heart radio at we're talking\nInto a Patrick grilled cheese and um let me ask you\nI'm Patrick I'm\nI have this theory about what happened with Megan Kelly that the that the business people looked at Megan Kelly and thought while she's a great get she's she's very credible she's great an interview you know we have our own\nKind of sixty minutes [noise] kind of person I'm very very smart yadda yadda yadda they hire and that's when the social justice warriors all around them\nRemind her remind them she's a conservative she was or at least she was a conservative on a conservative network she was part of Fox um and no you can't play nice and you have to destroy her\nAnd so they hired her for business reasons and then as soon as they realized that the social justice warriors were against it\nThey did what everybody else does and they just immediately changed their tune and set out to destroy do you think there's any ... validity to that\nOh one hundred percent I mean she didn't have an audience when she went there she was walking into a completely different environment that she was used to I also do think that\nOr a ... going after the network for their coverage of the Harvey wind speed and then in the entire me too movement had a big part of that that a lot of people aren't catching on um ... it basically she was you know create brave in doing that um I think you know I'm a career wise it might have been not the smartest moved to do\nIt yet and here's a woman in the me too moment exposing the corporation for covering and they don't like that and we're all the social justice warriors on that one\nExactly and that's where you kind of see how the me too movement has become just a political weapon because it was not it it it's not um being used in the way that it was a\nGod given birth to a ... I think that that is is one of the main reasons why and it didn't help that she was a conservative and it was easy to get rid of it because of that um so yeah I think that's what happened in egg and\nPatrick ... we're we're talking to the host of red pills America you can hear it on the ah I hurt radio out really good story teller I Know you're going to be taking on a few issues and I want to kind of go through\nA a couple of them um first of all uh\nThe caravan that is that is coming up uh there's today they're they're the media and looting ... Smith or say there's nothing to worry about this isn't an invasion\nWhat what are your thoughts on the care of them\n[noise] you know I think that is something that [noise] for whatever reason the last ten years the left is completely changed their tune on 'em in regards to our borders are open borders I I I feel like it is a we actually do an episode\nA that's coming up that looks at this kind of story of you know is there actually jobs Americans won't do and we follow to construction workers\nThat um I I don't want to give the you know the end away but they've completely this prove that ah that that argument and I think at the end of the day there is a lot of people that in America that we've forgotten about\nThat have lost their jobs to to a much cheaper labor that comes across the border and\nI think that we're seeing this here I think that this caravan it is not for political refugee status is people are looking for its economic and it's going to hurt the most vulnerable people in the United states well I think it's\nWhat's causing the homeless crisis in in Los Angeles is that fueled by any of this\nYou know that's a funny thing that you you asked that that it does um one hundred percent feels that because a lot of these kinds of\nA labor type jobs have been taken away um but another thing that is causing the homeless crisis in ... in Los Angeles is is that there is is the drug authentic there are there's a thing called patient\nAnd we actually have a story coming out on that\nI'm patient brokering where people are using Obamacare to fly to fly people out to Los Angeles to rehab centers and then when they end up using then using the the health insurance or\nThey end up getting stuck here in Los Angeles and there's been this huge surge of of ... basically a rehab tourism\nHere in the in the Southern California area that has been a that is it being attributed to the homeless church of of course last you know basically follows the passing of Obamacare and I've spoken to parents that have basically been through this and they went directly to\nObamacare as being part of the reason why uh their kids have gotten out here in Los Angeles and they ended up getting stuck out here\n[noise] um you're covering also another story I went to a cover with you why does the black community vote almost unanimously for Democrats\n[noise] you know we are that

eighties and what we're told is is that they've been condition their entire life to vote that way\nAnd um they use the tool of racism and and and the Andy the claim of racism to kind of scare people

players fifty seven percent of independents say yes thirty nine percent say no\nHowever there's also this question support the actions of kneeling NFL players thirty nine percent say yes and fifty five percent say no\nSo people support their right to do it but don't agree with what they're doing exactly right now that is not the way the media is portraying dope 'em and I think it's the way most conservatives feel right like yeah they just they can do it but it's not that I mean that's just not the right way I don't support what they're saying and what their what their actions are correct\nOr support single payer healthcare fifty six percent say yes thirty seven percent say no\nAnd that if you're wondering why you're getting so many people jumping on that bandwagon it's polls like that that's why the Democrats are doing it\nDo you want Congress to check Trump\nFifty three percent say yes thirty eight percent\nSay no also by the way the founders said yes to that one yet and I said it
