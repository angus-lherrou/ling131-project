things I'm inclined to tell you\nThat the most pervasive form of bias in the media is so many so many and they give you a little something here somewhat related investors business daily headline Trump's approval rating is better than you\nIt was an actor Trump has been enjoying a rare string of good news the economy is humming and the jobless rate just did a forty nine year low\nTrump won an intense battle over Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court he's scared a replacement for NAFTA his poll numbers are edging up and Republican prospects in the mid term elections appear to have improved\nBut according to the Gallup poll Trump's approval rating adds up his six hundred and thirty second day in office was forty four percent as a matter of fact Trump's approval rating is now a higher they end or tied with\nThree of the past six presidents at this point in their first terms oh by the way right something you probably hadn't heard before\nHe's currently tied with Obama at forty four percent and above both Clinton at forty one percent and Reagan forty two percent at this same stretch and the presidency did you know that\nHigher approval rating at this point than both Clinton and Reagan\nTied with Obama but here's what's more this is not in the investors business daily article every Friday I go through all of the polling information that's been a credited for the past week I put together some information try to see what's really going on out there\nAmong likely voters you average out likely voters Donald Trump's approval rating right now is for\nPoints higher among likely voters then brought Hussein Obama at the same point in his presidency by the way\nWas pervasive for ... and the media is omitted oh and and ah ICU there's got to take this call Tennessee values we got a who got Taylor Swift Tennessee values Caroline in Nashville Caroline go\nI'm actually from Carter bill but that's quite All right [laughter] okay\nI'm right outside of Memphis, Tennessee and I just wanted to say that I kind of the value in\nKids as the kids say nowadays than\nIn October nicotine ... going that\nProgram and we need to have a pow about Elizabeth Warren to now shall we need to make that a oatmeal do that she made in Palau found don't know I think we should try that I Hope\nThat somebody smoking peace pipe on this whole thing because this is this is just outrageous\nDon't you think yeah she released this big uh basically I Would say presidential audition video yesterday and show everyone that she was for Native American yeah super duper\nNATO she was a she's Cherokee she's Cherokee and Delaware yes a which is a is something that does not\nSeem to be backed up by the facts now they first came out and said well the DNA test shows her to be one thirty second uh Cherokee\nAnd then they revise that you won ... ... the media revise they can they actually looked at the report and says one thirty second two one five hundred and twelve and ... then they realized loops deep sea we made a a math there this is a serious correction they didn't say what you do see in the corruption but they pay they should have\nA cause that always makes everything better sure but it was between one uh one\nSixty fourth in one one thousand twenty fourth I Believe it was yeah one one thousand twenty fourth now that of course in and of itself so he got the human body up to what one thousand twenty four pieces that one of them one of those pieces would have a little bit of Cherokee\nNow this theoretically right but at least give her a technical defense of her bull crap over the past fifty years right where she's lying and saying she's a you know she's a Native American and she's uh getting benefits for this and she's getting her stupid super recipes in Palau chat which is the goal of almost everybody\nHow how how how wild child and they want to talk about appropriating a culture powwow chow that's what I'm going all ... I'm going all full I I'm I'm just I'm going to I just\nBut let's all complain about the names of out ball teams but what's ... how ... from here on out our our audiences called our tribe and we mean it in the Native Americans since it's a tribe\nTo trial it does the I mean there are studies that show that the average person of European descent ... has more Native American blood in them than Elizabeth Warren is even showing in her study average person the average person because he I mean look this is not it it's\nA very DNA is a complicated matter and it doesn't exactly show what they try to make it out to show that they've chosen show\nAny DNA from an actual Native American yet what it shows we don't have any DNA DNA Native American tribes have said we're not participating in DNA studies we don't want any\nDNA studies so they've never given any DNA so we can't use actual Native Americans to test the DNA against we have to use\nPeople from Peru Mexico and Colombia Colombia yes well\nWay and there's the the theory is that they those the same people want to migrating further south so you can use them as a stand in right but it does not show that she is Native American blood\nIs not even what they tested or and even that is it's a weird thing DNA doesn't really do that right like if you if you were born like Ted Cruz right Ted Cruz was born in Canada as many people have noticed and like to point out over the years he would not show the his Canadian blood fight like that's\nNot the only way they did it oh well he was he was three miles over the border therefore\nHe was Canadian with DNA does is it shows that lineage against shows it it can be interesting in some ways show migration patterns since I Wonder if he would it would have his blood would show that he's\nA thousand times more Hispanic than a Robin\nFriends disorder or if it's true it probably would show that uh but so it's\nInteresting you know from that standpoint of her trying to put this issue behind her and falling\nFlat on her face first of all it does not even show the Native American thing second of all the other part which is interesting about this is they do have an idea of who they believe the Native American relative was um it was her great great great great grandmother I think a several generations back\nAnd um when she register who's in the Seventeen hundreds she registered as white\nNow the theory again as put forth by the the born a campaign and and and then this is true that\nShe would have had an incentive at this time to identify as white instead of Native American because there's a lot of violence against Native Americans at the time so if you get out of saying you know it's like if you're in Nazi Germany and you said you were not a Jew right ... and they were able to get away with that there'd be some serious incentives to do that\nNumber one obviously well that's true we don't know that it's true with this person right we don't know that it was true with hit her great great great great great great grandmother Titanic secondarily yeah but what have we learned from progressive we've learned that if you identify as something you are that thing this woman identified as white\nAnd now or denying her what she herself has identified as she said she was white and now we're going to tell her she's not\nThat was what I was not allowed to apply to any well we can't do that to her but Elizabeth Warren is identifying as Cherokee so we have to\nAccept that she is so we can't accept legit [laughter] what what are great great great grandmother identified I Know well it doesn't matter it doesn't matter doesn't matter I mean it really seriously this is so ridiculous this story is just so rich I don't really care I don't care either but I don't care that she's lighting and the people you know she's lying or let me just play\nLooking I Want a cigar store Indian with Elizabeth Warren's face\nMore than anybody else on the planet so don't get me are they selling those you have to get them you know we've got to start making them a [laughter] I Want one more than life itself okay so you know where I'm coming from\nHowever\nKnow we all have things I have a story in my family okay of ah one\nOf my great great great grandfather is now my my grandfather\nTook a horse of being a full size of course he was a he was kind of a that and he talked to him and he grabbed him underneath the chin he didn't have anything to put this horse down didn't have a gun or anything else it but and he took him and he punched him in the head\nKnock the horse out\nOkay so ... my family my on my mother's side they're big people uh [laughter] and they they they they had muscles in them that I don't have okay\nNow the legend in the family is that my great great great great grandfather ... or was this guy I don't know why they always involve horses but one of the neighbors horses kept\nA jumping over and getting into his garden or whatever I don't even know what this and he picked it up and threw it over\nThe fence I don't know if that's true I got to go out and say it's not my family you don't know so he could be truly might not be true oh who cares that's what I grew up hearing the same thing with her she might have grown up hearing yeah oh yeah this is what it was but it was it was it was not true how many advantages\nThrough your life did you get because you had people in your family who threw horses over over walls I was her I almost made it into WWE but how many times have you told a story you've been on the air for how many years never never I've never you you've you've\nYeah yeah yeah I get it again if she is ... trying to play identity politics and if you're going to play identity politics you'd better be right on these things and that's why it is I can give you that I got what it's about it I give you that you're not a huge story I mean ... you know we\nWell you know what is a huge part of the story is the Cherokee Nation came out yesterday and said quote\nA DNA test is useless to determine tribal citizenship current DNA tests do not even distinguish whether a person's ancestors were indigenous to North or South America\nSovereign tribal nations set their own legal requirements for citizenship and while DNA tests can be used to determine lint lineage such as return ally a to an individual is not evidence for tribal affiliation\nUsing a da and ... a test to claim any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation even vaguely is inappropriate and wrong\nIt makes a mockery out of DNA test and it's legitimate uses wildest honoring legitimate tribal governments and their citizens whose ancestors are well documented and who's heritage is proven Senator Warren is undermining tribal interest with her continued claims of tribal air at\nBecause he that's white twenty percent of the people who voted for Donald Trump and you'll never hear this from mainstream media because they don't they don't the Democrats don't want this known\nTwenty percent of the people who voted for Donald Trump voted for Barack Obama at least once many twice\nSo they came over from the Democratic side\nThey're sick of it they're sick of it\nNow they may not like his extreme tweets and everything else\nBut they definitely don't like the idea that yeah we are going to get rid of capitalism goes it's an old outdated idea yeah you know we think we should shut down free speech oh I hate those cops they're all murderers man boy man or trouble especially white man did you know that I'm Indian and that's really\nGreat I shouldn't have said India and it really should be Native American because India shut up nobody cares\nAll of this stuff that is going on in the world\nShut up the issue here is you\nDon't win that twenty twenty primary with twenty or thirty candidates in it without appealing to those activists who do believe all that craziness\nSo and they're they're so they're stop their hardcore incentivize right who when those people over early which is why they're all coming out and you know why the Spartacus moment happened is white Kamala Harris was so crazy during the Kavanaugh thing it's way ... on TV with you know with the crazy crazy stunts every day\nBut she does do how do you see what it used to happen is you'd have to you'd have to go over to the extreme and then you'd moderate you're not going to be able to moderate but those people how do you moderate how do you go\nOver to the side of ... and say hey I don't think anybody is wrong with that divide shout your abortion and then when you get the nomination\nCome back close enough to the center to where people are going oh she didn't really mean the shell the abortion thing oh she didn't really mean advise cars and so far in the show your abortion people are not going to let you get away with it\nYou're\nYou've been eaten you've been eaten\nBy the hard left and the Democrats are waking up to it they don't like what's happening on campuses they don't like what's happening in the news they may not like what's happening in the White House either but they're not out shouting

advisers that have given a interviews or saying things that he had later to\nA unauthorized them so uh it is possible that uh he will close down and keep a very closed government regarding the press for example he has been using social media as his basic communication tool\n... this is the kind of ... ... ... same thing that you a job is said when he was running the first time he said oh no it's

create a new constitution for Brazil and that would be submitted a to a vote for ah after it so and in a console to two people to a electors in general so it\nHe had to to take back this this proposal but it's not clear if he will uh bring it back once he takes office\nBecause the fact is that he's not going to debates he uh is\nGiving a just a few interviews and usually he controls the process has been speaking mainly through social media so he has no conversation\nFrom the press and this ah creates a of an unknown territory we don't know what's coming but a analyst most analysts don't expect something so drastic ah right at the time\n... including because uh in the legislative elections he got a a strong a performance in ... from his allies in Congress so we expect that he has some some
