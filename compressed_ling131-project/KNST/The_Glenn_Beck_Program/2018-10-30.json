has just been ranked\nThat's why the nation of Israel exist if people don't understand that is why no one ever wants them no one ever stands for them they're always the last in line\nAnd so\nThe world just cited let them have this scrap\nOf land and they say was there is because of the Bible let 'em have it it's uninhabitable it's it's just nothing but a desert there's no oil there's nothing there just give it to them\nAnd the Jews happily took it restored to their homeland as the only nation on earth to be wiped off the face of the map and then to be restored to two thousand years later exactly as foretold\n\nIsraeli exists because no one seems to want them Israeli exists because they have a right to live\n\nSo let me go back to Russia and our musical friend\nIn Nineteen eighty nine forty years after the battle of Stalingrad the Hebrew immigrant aid society was helping Jews get out of the Soviet Union and go to Israel and the United states and they provided lawyers money to find homes food even language classes to help them assimilate in their new country\nFor the first time ever Gregory and the rest\nOf the Jews that he had known that had survived both Hitler and Stalin could concentrate on something more than just surviving\n\nThey had a right to pursue their happiness they could practice their faith they could be proud\nOf who they were they could finally live\n\nThe group that saved him the Hebrew immigrant aid society it's the oldest refugee assistance organization in the world let me say that again it's the oldest refugee assistance organization in the world it was established in the Eighteen hundreds and they're responsible for assisting thousands and thousands of\nJews and a few years ago they open up their services not just to Jews but people of all faiths all faiths that are persecuted and need to be rescued\n\nTheir currency a CEO was asked recently why they decided to do it\nHis answer couldn't be more perfect\nWe no longer help refugees because they're Jewish\n\nWe help refugees because we are Jewish\n\nReason why I'm telling you the story is this is the organization that I'm mad man went into Philadelphia to try to stop this is the organization that was attacked on Saturday morning at the tree of life synagogue\nStory never seems to and eleven people were killed in the deadliest attack on Jews in our country's history\n\nStories like Gregory filled the synagogue that Saturday morning\nThe\nHorrors that collectively endured unimaginable to most people\nAnd yet here we are again the group of people who now have to concentrate just on one thing survive anti\nSemitism is evil anti Semitism is a disease anti Semitism is as\nOld as the world\nFrom the moment God said I Will make you might people there has been anti Semitism and it is on the rise as it always is in times of nationalism and socialism every time the Jew is the canary in the coal mine they\nAre always the first and\nIf the world doesn't pay attention at that point it's washed in blood\n\nIf the world decides they need to come for the Jews I proudly declare myself a Jew\n\nThe world makes promises all the time and they don't ever intend on keeping them\nBut I Do\nWe said never forget\nI've told you you are the audience that will envy and restore the republic save the republic and it's not going to be through violence the world is going to become more and more violent\n\nWe must be a unique and peculiar people because the vast majority of Americans know this is not who we are\n\nThis is not who we want to be\n\nAnd we will stand shoulder to shoulder with our Jewish brothers and sisters\n\nWe will stand shoulder to shoulder with her Christian Brothers and sisters in the middle east\nWe will stand shoulder to shoulder with a Muslim that is being rounded up by the Chinese\n\nThe cycle of hate\n\nHas been gone again and it's not Donald Trump and it's not Iraq Obama\n\nIt's a cycle that has been running since the beginning of time and the world always acts the same way because it always comes in a time of chaos\nIt always comes in a time of fear it always comes in a we cycle when the forget the individual it's what's best for all of society it's why our\nFounders came here in the first place it's why our founders defended the Jews\n\nWe're a different country we're a different people we're\n\nNot better than the rest of the world we just see things differently\n\nAnd if we don't shame on us\nOur pilgrims came here thinking that they were completing the journey from the red sea\nOur first gray seal of the United states was the pillar of fire and pharaohs horses and the party of the red sea\n\nI don't want to just survive I don't want to\nWell between two parties that are blaming each other for everything or blaming them you know why America is a little upset right now they're tired of being blamed they're out here in Boston there at\nTheir out here working every single day trying to raise their kids trying to figure out how to navigate and keep their children safe while in a prison system called school that is teaching\nAnd on doing everything that most parents believe they\nCome home they're tired they don't know how to solve it they're overwhelmed\nSociety is just pouring into their house with with the media and social media and then they have to sit and they have to watch people screaming at each other on TV\nAnd there's nobody actually answering questions there's nobody actually offering a solution none of these things anybody is talking about is the solution\nIs just blame the other side and most Americans are tired of it because they're the ones getting blamed they're the ones\nThat are racist they're the ones that are massage and ... they're the ones\nExcuse me\nWere just out here in Boston are asked trying to make a living well you freaks\nAre\nLimited high on the hog on our tax dollars\nI'm Sorry I'm Sorry but the the what's happening in our society is a

are you going good\nThat was a good how was your week at a it was it was not great ... why why why not\nIt was a you know a bad football games uh experiences everywhere I went\nAh what do you what did you experience and everywhere you know you're not having a hard time talking I'm speaking true you know\nThat would cause the easiest thing in the world right now sure sure it is sure it is\nThis uh this weekend a I had to really I really had a difficult time uh I mean I just did you guys watching the news all this weekend\nNo little as possible I write a little bit because of the shooting 'cause it's like I get the updates but yeah yeah\nSo only to get the updates and stuff I I don't know who's watching cable news anymore\nYeah I I never watch cable news never my the highlights I get the clips but I don't I don't actually sit there and watch Fox\nNews ... or the N n my heaven forbid and MSNBC or CNN jet why don't you don't want to because I don't know who's doing that they do I really don't know who's your\nFans was box you know 'cause it's a safe haven mostly unless you're watching Shepard Smith\nA bit of a always been that way but I don't know I'm just\nCNN I don't know who does 'cause that's\nIt's on ... it's the people who hate Trump right yeah I've done the only reason I ever turn any of that stuff on his show you know because we're supposed to be aware of it right and do you do that occasionally but I certainly I if I was not in the business I don't know why I Would bother with any of that oh I wouldn't I Would listen to them talk about early do down the synagogue thing is he's\nOh literally it's quite ... comedy questions that is until they can get to a question about why Trump's Trump's fault like that Joe Lieberman on this morning\nAnd Lieberman is like you know are sort of a bird dog job we've got a buddy who is like you know did he he didn't go there have you dealt with today is the first question was ah you know what about the what's going on you know give us your opinion and he's like you know look I Lived in a country\nAs a Jew where I was basically anti Semitism free my entire life I ran for president and senator\nI I was I was a winning center in a state with two percent Jewish population and uh I never felt some anti Semitism my entire life\nHe yeah he he's like you know we have to make sure that we don't we don't have that blah blah blah this is a terrible tragedy then they're like well\nWhat what what part of that do you think is is the climate of today and and and and Lieberman to his credit was like look first of all we need to make very clear that this\nShooter a outwardly heated Donald Trump\nYeah we do not like Donald Trump he was not a fan of Donald Trump or something you don't mind them too yeah but you do more broadly we do have this problem with with with discourse and I think that's true I mean I I think that's obviously true that the overall are just courses pretty terrible at the moment ... ... but ... again has nothing to do with this and all\nThese cable news networks are ... that were telling you that it does mhm they're obsessed with telling your wife well\nWe don't want us to blame it on a Donald Trump I'm just saying it's Donald Trump's fault\nRight [laughter] that's why he really is really that's what they're doing never said that about Bernie Sanders Bernie than ever the guy was working for Bernie Sanders' campaign and he went out and he shot all of the geo ... and another guy and tried to try these trained to kill thirty Republican seat\nThat's really tenth of the Republican you know I was working for Bernie Sanders yeah never said that was Bernie Sanders fault\nNo we never said that and neither did I ate and either do today yes of course not\nAll about it because they they had a very balanced view of that one re understood that individuals were responsible for their own actions that time that's where I understood that then they just don't understand it now because now which is not benefit them in and they always complain about discourse isn't that a great example of terrible discourse yes\nI we were considered on both of these things right when if a Republican and now the pipe bomb think thing thankfully didn't get anybody hurt\n'em but you know we did see that ah with with the Bernie Sanders situation\nBut both situations we said the individual is responsible the discourse is is is an interesting aside because overall it's not healthy for a country but it's got nothing to do with these individual shootings and I'm going to do with it and you do not eat ... discourse does not commit murder doesn't happen\nSo the reason why ... ... and this morning is because uh you know or he sees doing more on trivia and uh and pour a trivia is that is always a laugh and so we wanted to find out how it went on friday a pet uh\nYeah it's you know it's a chance to get away from the discourse for a little while for like an hour a week as and just be me and yeah and just be mean to\nBe [laughter] I Know that dumb they are a clinic and [laughter] and I thought I\nNo I'm not going to apologize to you know you know me you know me well enough to know and that one I'm never going to band on that one\nAnd in fact repeated a ... consistently just repeat it um it was fabulous and again it was you know I wanted to call for so many times and that just made me just pick up the phone and say hallelujah\nBattle thank you thank you so are you coming to the show in or Cleveland or what is it Saturday no it's on Sunday becoming no we're going to be out of town is going to be out of town really 'cause I have to be a free tickets but seriously\nOh now all of a sudden you're interested can change I I\n... you change your plans I've got free tickets for a if you want if you'd like them\nAre you serious I Am serious goes my that that would I change my plans\nOkay All right All right good thanks Suzie we'll see you are what ... Sunday\nA ... I think it's Sunday yes it's going back to accomplish tour by the way for the ticket and the details on we're going to be ... it's going to be fun there's a lot of election stuff to talk about ... ah ah stuff\nYou were given gift from the gods as far as the serial goes the the ... turned completely insane so it makes the comedy fairly easy\nSaid it does\nAnd Pittsburgh we've got something special for you there were going to have laughs and and comedy but uh also uh I Am taking all of the proceeds\nFrom the I'm from the event and um we're giving them to\nI'm not sure if we're going to give them to the synagogue or to or to the\nUh the refugee I'm now a\nGroup I'm not sure we're going to give them to yet but we're we're\nUh we're we're standing with uh Israel um and uh so the proceeds to your tickets or will be going um\nTo a a local Jewish um\nCenter perhaps the synagogue and I'm not sure they're not stems from an anti Semite like why would you do that when you hate Jews so much um I noticed he went back and forth a little issue with a reporter from GQ this weekend oh did I uh Julius something or other said\nThat she was a she's a little upset about this and basically blamed anyone who's ever can a criticized I think it was George Soros meadow\nOr and I remember and you came back to this is you know completely ridiculous like it's nothing to do with that like we you know\nAnd then she posted here's an example of ... supporting the Jewish people and posted a clip of one of your criticism of one Jewish person George Soros or as as an example of how much you hate the Jews\nNow I did respond ... I found an example of you are supporting the Jewish people as well when you want the defender of Israel aboard a that was I thought by national award one of the highest um ... most prestigious awards for someone defending the Jewish people cry but beyond that uh\nIt was just it was just presented by the the prime minister of Israel though\nWell that's it [laughter] okay that's not a big one that out of bed not a big one so it's just amazing you know 'cause this is not just\nThe criticism of you and it's not just this one dopey reporters all over the place and this idea that if you criticized George Soros\nThat you are an anti Semite is completely insane if you are a\n... a conservative\nAnd I ... the people in this audience I Would believe all would fall into this category many of them will criticized George source but they criticize him because he's a liberal as progressive policies he supports a policy that we disagree with so we're criticizing him if I wanted him to be dangerous all around the world around the world he has a very shady history\nOr around the world that but anti Semite hate George Soros to ... in some ways there are things in common there however they don't like him because he's a Jew at the same way they don't like been Shapiro\nBecause you're in front of a hero because importing policies you know like I don't understand racism I mean you can get to know people and hate them for valid reason [laughter] you know like Karl Marx\nI don't like Karl Marx he was Jewish I don't like him not because he was a Jew no but because he came up with the idea of communism\nI'm not a fan no not a fan of fat and the ... like you're in these liberals have never criticized Ben Shapiro before\nIs that because they're anti Semite which because they don't like within Shapiro said\nThey will love what ... they would love Ben Shapiro if he was a liberal\nAnd they don't like him because he's a conservative is this distinction difficult for people can you really not understand I mean we all know cannot do it and I it's not all under state it they're just trying to use this to make it look like conservatives they're anti Semite\nWe you're telling me the with the uh you know Sheldon Adelson right here's a guy who is one of the biggest finance here's the Republican Party have you ever seen a word of criticism for liberals about him of course you have does that make them anti Semitic\nOr what it does not it does not you can criticize just like when they criticize Clarence Thomas are they racist\nNo they don't like Clarence Thomas is legal opinion because they don't support what they believe\nIt's not about it it is trying to make these into cartoon arguments ... is such a\nA ... a Ken this is another example of horrible discourse yes they complain about how bad Donald Trump has made the discourse you're calling everyone who's criticizing the main liberal or progressive funder in America\nYou're calling everyone who does that an anti Semite how that possibly in the realm of positive discourse it's completely a disingenuous and they know it is they know it's not true and they go on television and they say anyway in this time in the middle of a tragedy they say\nIt anyway because they don't care\nThat is that that is exactly what they think big claim to be again and they do it every day wow I didn't hear a solution there too [noise]\nYeah I feel the heat battering I don't know what I happen to one and uh we're we're going to talk about one when we come back\nEar and brains getting quite a workout Glenn Beck San ... am seven Ninety two sons most stimulating talk\nSo let me talk to you a little bit about um [noise] buying or selling a home if you are if you're buying a home right now where you're thinking about it do it now get the low interest rate right now if you have to refinance your loan\nDo it right now do it now I'm\nEquity is at an all time high homeowners are starting to cash in and pay off high interest or that\nThere is a there is a way for you to do this with people who are are working for you they're not working for the banks so if you want to consolidate you want to re fi or you're looking to buy a new home\nGo to the people who work for you and that is American financing you could be looking at twelve thousand dollars\nAnd you'll savings right now and you could close and it's fast is ten days American financing eight hundred nine zero six twenty four forty or American financing dot net [noise]\nI've been there I Know what it feels like and that's what I decided to do something about it after lifting my home with some agents that just could not get the job done I decided to start a company that would find the best agents people you could trust people who had\nYour same values honesty hardworking carrying we started real estate agents I trust dot com it came from personal frustration and mine and now your frustration real estate agents I trust dot com our goal is to connect you with an agent\nWell I mean that's not the something The Simpsons signed on for yeah and I'm really sorry twice the\nLabel raised and this is a great lesson for everyone who tries to please say making Kelly I think the same type of thing right you can't you can't no matter what you say they're never going to be pleased the people who come after you for these these nonsensical PC issues\nWill never be pleased no matter what you give them no matter what apologies say no matter how sincere it is no matter ... they're not asking you to remove up who they're not asking you to change they're asking for something that you can't possibly give them any earlier you realize that the better\n\nLet me change the subject to enough is enough when America will enough be enough\nNew polls Americans fed up crave unity admitted violence\nNow this one should terrify you\nBecause fifty seven percent now say they want a third party they want unity that number is even higher\nBut I'm not sure people actually mean this\nI'm not sure what unity even means they say that we no longer really uh agree on the core values of our country which\nI think is actually true we don't agree on core values\nWhat are those core values\nAnybody know what\nAre the values that brought up what are the things that were actually arguing about now way things are going in the United states twenty five percent are satisfied fifty eight percent dissatisfied the state of politics nine percent satisfied Seventy seven percent dissatisfied Thirteen\nPercent or like a ... percentage that\nSay Americans are United in agreement about the most important values Fifteen Percent Fifteen Percent of us they were United on the most important values my question is\nWhat are those values sincerely what\nAre we fighting for our we are we fighting for lower taxes\nHere's what the the here's the surveys the shows where we divide on our quote the most important values\nPolitics in this country it's politics of value um moral ethics in our country\nIs that a value\nRace relations gap between rich and poor the state of the news media the way things are going in the U.S the environment the way things are going in your state\nRights for algae beat the status of religion homeland security\nWith an exception of a couple of those aren't values those are issues that is a political campaign and perhaps that's what we're missing\nSee I I firmly believe and I I I wrote this in the book addicted outrage we have a few things we have to decide we have to decide one so western world war it's saving is freedom as our founders saw it\nIs it worth saving yes or no and I don't want you just uh you know jump off and yeah absolutely why why why is it worth saving who can articulate this\nWhy is it worth saving how has it changed the world in specifics\nWho can make that case among us who's making that case to their kids at dinner at night in specifics\n\nIs America a good place or a bad place we have to decide because half of the country says it's a great place half of the country says and I don't even know if these numbers are accurate and half I doubt they are have but let's just say half\nThe country says it's a bad place half the country says it's a good place which\nAre way sincerely which are we we have to choose don't we because it's a binary choice is in it were good or bad right it's a binary choice you have to choose one\nNo no you don't it's not a binary choice the answers were both we're both\nWe've been both bad and good we've had really good intentions and the pathway to hail is paved in good intentions and we have great intentions now on both sides we have great intentions\nWhat are we gonna do with those intentions because you rarely live up to them have you heard anyone actually make the case for America\nAnd not just in red white and blue flag waving terms but why is America important\n\nWhy is the constitution worth fighting for because if we don't know let's just get on with it man let's just move on I I'm I\nWe cannot sit here and argue about our greatest issues of our time\nI Am we don't have our basic living rooms I Want to make sure I have this right\nOur our basic\nEssential values in line\nLike climate change\n\nYou can say one of our values is how do we treat each other and how do we treat the earth\nOkay that's a value that's not climate change\nClimate change comes off of that value in principle\n\nClimate change is okay is there a problem\nIs there a problem well I'm Sorry but the science is not settled\n\nThe climate is constantly changing it always has it's why we we had the ice age ... where were the SUVs for the ice age\nIt always changes now can we do things that can affect the climate I don't know some people say we can some people say we can't\nBe evidence is spotty at best and you can't trust the evidence that is there because we have too much evidence of collusion in ... in the scientific field\nYou give me clean cut studies okay\nBut that's not even what we're arguing about were arguing about what to do about it\nSee they keep making a about you know whether it's happening or not I'm willing to give you the benefit of the doubt I'm willing to say okay it's happening All right it's happening what do you want to do about it\n\nWell the solutions are insane the solutions don't work now that is a political discussion that is a political discussion you know where our values come in on that particular discussion when someone says the sciences settled is shut up\nThat's a violation of our values\nWhen people sit down at the

I Would watch the uh the heat\nAnd of course you know these campaigns like it because it gives them a chance because I'm so many chances to get people to go and get people to the polls and forced them to go early to get all the activists out and they can have them go and you know go pass out you know go take down Ted Cruz signs or whatever the heck they're they're they're a volunteers are doing on that particular day\nBut there's one interesting way of looking at this we talked to a lot about\nA district that have changed from Obama to Trump people who voted for Obama and then change to Trump\nAnd there's the other side of that and people who voted for Romney and changed Clinton\nAnd there's an interesting ... a breakdown ... there were a let's see if the Thirteen districts that voted for Mitt Romney in two thousand twelve\nAnd then voted for Hillary Clinton in two thousand or sixteen so two thousand twelve on an average of squirting five thirty eight had about an eight point advantage for Romney and two thousand sixteen it was a five point advantage for Democrats so what what are we closer to I think it's interesting to see where we are when it comes to the polling as of right now\nAre we have about a to point advantage for Democrats in those states so if you look at it kind of just summarize those kind of lost three points are well well the\nThree point Democrats have lost three points from two thousand six to ... less passionate into two dozen sixteen but a big big move from two thousand twelve done it so they're kind of in the middle but leaning towards the Democratic way they voted in two thousand correcting\nNow they were Twenty one district that voted for Iraq Obama\nAnd then voted for Donald Trump Twenty one\nOr so in two thousand twelve with Rocco bomb on they had about a six point advantage for Democrats for Obama or in two thousand sixteen that swung from all the way back to seven points Republican for Donald Trump so it's a huge swing there\nIs it you would think of these real swing districts so far polling you're showing that leaning to the Democratic side by five and a half\nPoints that's big the big change to it and that was that's almost equal to where they were voting roam around ... time so if you look at that the people who were\nVoted for a bomb and then switched to Trump are kind of back to the position where they were voting for rock Obama when Romney or the people who voted for Romney then went to Clinton they're in between those two positions but leaning towards Clinton\nThat's where these districts show up there is also five states where this is a where this occurred five states uh Florida Michigan Ohio Pennsylvania Wisconsin where they voted for a bronco Obama been changed to Trump in the\nObama election that had about five point advantage for Obama and those states\nIn the Trump election there is about\nTo point advantage for Trump right now those states are showing eight twelve point advantage for Democrats and it was you know now that part of that it it's a little bit different than what you would say in the house where they're broken up into little areas and there's so many candidates and their up all the time\nWe're this is some of these races are just there's popular Democrats already Pennsylvania's like an example of that where they have just a big lead\nOr not because I don't think that's necessarily solely because of some switch like soldiers\nSettled ... tell me what all this means from last week or the Democrats making is is the momentum start just lose starting to swing back\nTowards the Democrat I Would say it doesn't tell you much about the Senate but it's I think it does tell you something about the house which is there was an eye the hope that there'll be some movement in the house towards Republicans these numbers aren't showing that I mean it right now wait ... seems like the Democrats will take the house uh and the Republicans look pretty solid and the Senate right now\nWhen will we see any movement at all of due to the shooting in the\nBombing well the polling wouldn't even start probably in your real polling reaction that at least till today so you have three I mean you're probably not till later this week Thursday or friday the earlier case I Will look for this\nElection by numbers [noise]\nOn the Glenn Beck program
