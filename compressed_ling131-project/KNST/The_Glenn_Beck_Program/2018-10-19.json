I go ahead\nBen thanks for having me on my uh uh really enjoy your show\nGreat thank you had a quick question I'm trying to gain some a little bit of understanding and and I I mean I Know deep down what the answer is\nBut [noise] ... from a logical standpoint let us know few years ago Mr Obama\nFiled federal suit against the state of Arizona and Governor Brewer for trying to enforce immigration laws they successfully argued that immigration was the full proof purview of the federal government [noise]\nWell now we go back and at that time ... the state of California and a few other states joined with the federal government to win that argument\nThat Mr Trump is they're trying to actually enforce immigration was some of these things the church through infant oh wait we can do our own thing as well such as California with the sanctuary cities yet\nThe zoo it's ... it's because it's when they don't they ...\nPeople need to understand about liberals\nThey don't have a set of values they stick with its the values I think at that moment will help them the most that's the reason why they're willing to do whatever I mean there are millions you a liberal it's easier to be a Democrat in politics because no one will ever criticize you for for ...\nNo one will ever criticize you for doing one thing or saying one thing one day one day during the complete opposite\nThe next day me in\nThe ... the part where I'm confused as is it is with the court to sit there and argue the whole the whole notion of story to the system stuff like this yet they'll think courts are stepping back and in reality they're decisions don't stand [noise]\nWell you got to remember we're talking about ten years ago when Obama was talking about enforcing the border and that that issue Democrats thought was less popular to be anti border security now they're they have to go all in on it Rick because if they don't eventually I think they'll keep losing the Republicans like Donald Trump\nThey need new voters in here and they need to give out amnesty and they need to do a quick it and if you had to enter the I mean we could take cruises a perfect example where there's better ways if all the illegal immigrants in Texas could vote Ted Cruz will be done\nOh absolutely absolutely\nAnd and you could argue that there's virtually it's impossible to win a presidential election if you as a Republican don't win Texas for darn sure and really there's a very good chance every time for us to when you got to win Florida because you're never going to win California well if you can turn Texas to the Dems\nFlorida the Dems those three states\n... it's virtually impossible to do math that makes it were Republican what could win the White House so all you need to do to switch Texas over is just skip the illegal immigrants are there the ability to vote\nAnd then you got it the same way that you have it in California\nThe same exact way by the way we've got some very important breaking news Rosie O'Donnell you know she is very serious commentators she was just on MSNBC deadline White House\nAnd she had some very um insightful words and commentary and analysis about the two thousand mid term to make the midterms elections here is Rosie O'Donnell the liberal of the day with some great advice and analysis for this upcoming election listen to this\nHe's doing that to scare journalists care who he called me the people that we all know he's doing that right here's a guy who was tortured and killed a journalist who was speaking badly of cats and and\nHe doesn't respond why I'm sure that's what

here's a guy who is who was tortured and killed a journalist\nAnd this is Donald Trump's wet dream to scare all journalists the same way\nBetter than ... and I I don't know what I can do I'm done

and you start making decisions as an adult in my decision is I'm going to carry my bones all round and again\nAnd occasionally my footing is is isn't so severe SUNY system right right exactly yeah at least I'm and I'm going through the right steps of the cutting of it a little pieces and put 'em in the suitcases and I think that's your clean up after yourself that's all you can do is clean up the mess afterwards it's interesting\nToo that the media is making a big deal out of every single time they talk about this guy they talk about him as if he's an American because they always say Washington Post reporter I ... I think he just\nHe contributed to the Washington Post was he actually is he actually a staff member of the Washington Post columnist was any or he'd written it's relatively new yeah because he had left there was a lot of problems over there he realized he might be on the wrong side of whatever internal craziness was going on in Saudi Arabia so\nThat that's fairly new and you know critics of Saudi Arabia I think have a have a ... ... first of all places in the American media that is just right like I mean an important that we are able to air those things are but also you know there's a lot of opposition to them\nAnd people don't I mean you know remember Saudi Arabia was like the main uh accusation made by Michael Moore in Fahrenheit ... was it Fahrenheit nine eleven was the one he's made like he's tried to capitalize with that so many times I Can't remember which one it is now with her and I and I live in the first one was the biggest a political documentary of all time up\nIn that was just a giant conspiracy theory about how the bushes knew this guy like they've got to go all out there and they're working with this group is working with the Saudis and it was all about defending the Saudis and that's why you you know you don't know the truth about nine eleven um right so this is not a\nNew accusation and when it comes to Republicans working with Saudi Arabia but you know every president has worked with him for very long time and it's something that we've been critical about four they been our allies since\nNineteen thirty three I think uh so yeah a really long time and this goes back to the FDR administration so it's not just Trump who's been a\nFriendly I guess with Saudi Arabia certainly Bush was always always accused of that being too friendly with Saudi Arabia but Iraq Obama was plenty friendly with them to exactly I mean they've been allies for a long time and there was no way that Brock Obama would have done\nAnything a severe to Saudi Arabia by this point in there and it wouldn't have done anything about this a great\nPoint and it shows the problem with Ninety percent of the media coverage today the difference there is that they perceive\n... Obama as the intellectual deep thinker who is ... right and they were never good I'm bringing in Fahrenheit nine eleven again the big one of the other big criticisms of this was Bush was in school when\nHe found out about nine eleven and he sat there and you let the kids finished the book and then he he took the call and it took him like nine minutes before he ... he walked out of the room remember this accusation and they they showed a large chunk of it and it was a big deal at the time you know like\nBut they saw Bush as the bad guy who who was who's incompetent Brock Obama\nWait what was it Seventy eight days when he knew were were Osama bin Laden was before he did anything and it was universally praised for this decision it was the most difficult decision and five hundred years since the what are the way it was a decision you made since Charlotte Charlotte me to go get the worst criminal on earth\nAh what is is a tough decision in in the minds of people who want to praise to the zoo and\nBy the way we made a on about nine twelve two thousand one\nTo kill the guy right you know tens of thousands of military members signed up just to do that yeah they all knew I mean yes of course there was risk in the mission like that but these are this is ... ... talk to any military member especially people who are serving at that time and they'll tell you\nThat was basically the reason I got into it yeah I mean it you know a lot of people got in just to hopefully get the opportunity to take that shot\nSo it was not a difficult decision um but Brock Obama was an intellectual thinker he was a deep thinker that was just considering all these options and and weighing all these impossible choices and he finally came to the conclusion to go\nAnd and act on this the opposite is what they feel about Trump you know that the fact that Trump is going out there and saying wait a minute let's hold on a second let's get this evidence let's figure out exactly what's going on let's investigate this before we act irrationally ... Obama was doing that it would be seen as he's a deep thinker he's\nNot being reactionary with Trump that he doesn't care it's all about money and it's all about Saudi Arabia because Jared Kushner like Saudi Arabia or something it's just the you know\nThe the the overwhelming problem is that everybody seems to see everything through the lens of this one individual on our planet\nThey just are completely obsessed with Donald Trump yeah and and I just don't I Can't connect to that I think as as a person who's a a small government guy I don't want the president to have that much of a role in our lives\nAre just fundamentally whether it's bravo or Donald Trump but ... you know CNN I think they've made a decision and MSNBC certainly on this board and and pretty much every other media source is that this is this is our this is what we do\nAll we do is talk about every issue and how it relates to Donald Trump this is a man who was murdered\nA potentially cut up into little pieces maybe by mistake of falling with your ... something happened there ... and all we can talk about is what does why Donald Trump is acting the way he's acting well isn't there are more of a story here maybe that's the story run in three weeks when you're looking back at this incident but like is it the story now much more about the details\nOf the incidents are and what happened there were still in the age yeah should be\nUm breaking news now\nUm Chicago Tribune is reporting the United states just received a payment of a hundred million dollars from Saudi Arabia ah\nActually we got it on Tuesday the same day secretary of state Mike Pompeo arrived in Riyadh to discuss the disappearance of ... um Saudi Arabia publicly pledged the payment to support us stabilization efforts in northeastern Syria so I'm sure that this will be twisted into\nOh we're not doing anything to them 'cause they just paint us a hundred million dollars\nOf course there are always paying a hundred million dollars you know our relationship with them it is they send us a lot of money and we send them stuff that is kind of I mean look at it it's not completely in significant\nTo the relationship right I mean that there there are these considerations and that is why when you're making a decision of the president of the United states your decision is not solely based on you know what the media wants you to do\nLike it's about American interests and that should always be the primary choice if what the idea at the end of the day of American interests are harmed long term\nI'm by a decision you might make you have to take that into consideration it has to be your top priority for top priority is not a Jew ... murders in Turkey right like ...\nYou know I don't know if anybody knows this but we ... we a lot of countries that we're dealing with are murdering people all the time\nOr you know how often do we hear that we should talk to North Korea before when now that Trump is doing it no one wants them to touch the pre anymore so she studying like that's off the table now but this guy's been doing much worse things all over the world terrible terrible things are happening all the time the fact that this guy is a journalist or a columnist\nIs a big part of the reason why are you know I think the media care so much about it and they're prioritizing it over you know some slaughter in Africa or some terrible thing that's happened in Russia\nRight like this is you know this is a a journalist that they knew that was from a you know that wound up working for an American newspaper\nSo it is a big story and the and the details were auditor so crazy like such a twenty four storyline that I can understand why he captures the interest but it being patient and making sure you understand the actual facts of the situation before you act is not a negative and there's a lot at stake here a lot at stake\nI mean if you if you just start willy nilly throwing on sanctions on Saudi Arabia they're gonna retaliate\nAnd if it's going to cost a not us as much but the rest of the world is going to suffer in\nThe oil that's what they've already threatened or I go ahead and punish us and we'll cut off your oil supply while I think we get scant little from them but other people get a lot Europe gets a lot of oil from Saudi Arabia so yeah you want to make sure you got all your\nA cheese crossed in ... before you take any severe action I Would think\nYou know look as a global market anyway yeah so it it it all affects a each part of it affects the other parts and you know it's something to consider though I mean I think making a principled moral decision outweighs that a lot of times but American interests are have to be facts tuition we I think we've seen that\nHappening too infrequently or over the past few decades and it and and that should start again\nA AAA seven twenty seven back as the phone number are sponsored this half hour zip recruiter or if you go to these job sites a lot of times you know it's great to be able to post ... or you know to a bunch of job sites and you know you can get a lot of candidates but you can also get overwhelmed with tons and tons of candidates that are not good candidates they had the wrong resume the wrong experience\nThat we want to call them Bob I'm fine with that you would have I mean what's interesting Jamal Jamal Jamal was killed at the embassy we can all say it was ... and what does all know Jamal\n... or ... ... and then whatever the\nPronunciation is tomorrow but you're right we got to get together on that because that drives me out of my mind it probably is irritating\nYeah it is [noise] is I I I never understood that Osama Osama thing how did that happen why why did that happen\nBecause it's even less or a ... right here you have a situation where it's it's been name it's spelled the same but were pronouncing it different at least you can understand that\nOsama Osama they shouldn't be a letter [laughter] they just said no no no no it's a new it's a you know the guy went from like mid range pick in kick ball to left pick I [laughter] like ... when this happened ... the guy is dead and no one ever ...\nYou know no one ever said you know Osama's wrong it's it should be Usama ... why no well no it just started and if people just started using it\nVery strange but it is very strange uh and like some of it I I get to understand like for example a here we say the tiny little country that James Bond goes to the casinos Monaco right ... ... if you're over there they call it\n... ... everyone calls it Morocco I've never heard that I was ... here's another one here we say Martha for the car\n... if you listen uh as as as a Canadian sports celebrity I Do quite often to Toronto blue jays games on the radio

also noticed the jaguars are being called ... where you are all the commercial ...\nJak you are what [laughter] it's like they like if you come up with a name on your\nOwn maybe you can describe to us what how how it's pronounced\nBut what is a word we already know and when I say you were a hundred years yeah it stop it we it's an animal yes and they're not just a car it's an animal to write down what he ever says jak you are [laughter] the Jacksonville Jaguars or no I think that yeah I think that's jak you\nAre trying to seem refined right like this like um there's something nothing a little snooty about the way they pronounce mhm uh jaguars like at the ... that stupid animal over they're ripping up my dog and this is Jackie water [laughter]\nWould you be that gone [laughter] jaguar is over they're ripping up by a bitter and into my dog a terrible I've but luckily I felt with my own sauce on top of it\nThough everything's going to be okay [laughter] that happened you know ... three

finish any better than third but I don't I don't know I got a great chance of winning the ... you know do you have some very modest [laughter] so we'll see how that turns that will give you the updates when we get them\nOn we need to warn you about to something that's incredibly dangerous in our society and all too prevalent in that's a Disney Princess is um we're being worn by ah some Hollywood actresses that there is some danger there Karen nightly\nIs promoting a her upcoming movie which was produced by Disney by the way the nutcracker the four realms\nBut she told Ellen DeGeneres on Tuesday that she's not a fan of every movie the studios produced because Disney Princess is don't uphold her feminist values ... so she is forbidden her three year old daughter eighty from watching certain movies like Cinderella which is\nA been banned in her household because she waits around for a rich guy to rescue her\nAnd she says don't rescue yourself obviously and this is the one I'm\n... she's mad because Cinderella waits to be rescued and there's not really as a\nSelf yes she didn't pull herself out of that situation she's also quite annoyed by the Little Mermaid she's banned that as well she says the songs are great but they don't give but don't give your voice up for a man or a man\nYeah thank you ... there's a lot of women are doing that today the main message modeled on a on a really the entire movie is to give up all of your rights to men and wait for them to rescue a especially a rash of rich guy\nThat's the message you should be taking from those movies I'm\nChristian bell is also fearful that Disney princes are sending the wrong message to her children she's actually the voice of the Disney Princess uh Anna and frozen wasn't that done by Christian Bale yes\n[laughter] so she tells her daughter's Lincoln and delta that ah when she ... when she reads Snow White delta bell yes and Lincoln bell yes and when she read Snow White two inch closes up the book and she says every time we close no white I looked at my girls and ask\nDon't you think it's weird that Snow White didn't ask the old witch why she needed to eat the apple or where she got that apple I\nSay I would never take food from a stranger would you and my kids are like no\nAnd I'm like okay I'm doing something right yeah you've proved it a while you nailed that when they did wrists and then she'll also say and girls don't you think it's weird that the prince kisses Snow White without her permission\nWell no because she's in a coma mom [laughter] can't give her permission and she'll stay in a coma if he doesn't\nCancer right I mean she's advocating for the Gilman can continue right the kids what gangs are out of it right and bell says ah because you can't kill someone if they're sleeping on the how does that mean in St Louis circumstance [noise] that's true however this is a notable circumstance which is why it's a movie in a book\nRight the reason why you know about it is because it's different than everyday life right ... you know there there's a magical apple\nThere's a a prince or with a magical spell right on the princess yes and she's sleeping 'cause she can't wake up right unless the prince kisses her that's kind of the premise that\nYeah so it's a it's a unique circumstance that part of your lessons don't apply to [laughter] so silly so\nWeird I even get yourself so worked up about that I you know what I Hope happens every day is every day when she brings breakfast to them they ask her where did this\nFor money [laughter] they just torture her within the rest of her life [laughter] and you can I can understand this you know sometimes I think\nEven you know ... like conservatives get made fun of when they do these types of things are like when you watch uh you know there's a there's one cartoon because we're watching at one point that was and it was just it was just like a nonstop commercial for recycling\nAnd it was like I Know it was a captain planet or what ever do that that is an actual that one is actually a legitimate effort to change kids' minds about environmental is admitted they you know people who created it actually talked about that but I don't know what this one we might have been to have a pig or something it's usually type of pick I like to pick a lot\nA and a pet but it was talking about you know recycling or something I don't know how important it wasn't looking there recycling whatever like I don't have any passion for\nBecause of course you don't want no one wants anything bad to happen to their kids\nBut it's additional to that like you don't want to be the person who let your kid walked down some a street and were something terrible happened everyone's got to look at you and say what the hell are you doing allowing them to walk down that street why were you there yeah um so it's like a double whammy\nAnd I think that leads to a lot of that over parenting stuff and ... and I'm sure this is the boat she's in her ... right like she's trying to protect me look you're not going to ... you're not going to say anything to a four year old reading Cinderella that's going to protect them from rape culture it's not going to occur\nYou're never you're never going to be able to solve this problem you believe is so prevalent ... by a story you tell them after ... reading Cinderella\nOr watching it for the Little Mermaid um or any of these uh Disney movies because they're already going to be\nA messed up from\nSymbol of falling down and blowing the word sex drive to

they'll be still hate Clarence Thomas in the lowest eight Brett Kavanaugh\nBut I mean it never was about these allegations there was never a moment in which that story was about the allegations it was always about the the opportunity to stop Brett Kavanaugh from sitting on the court can they thought they had a chance of winning or the Senate and could block the block the next justice and maybe they wouldn't have to deal with another conservative on the court\nWould that was one hundred percent of of it for every for every single person involved with the possible exception of Dr Ford which you could at least say maybe she went through this and certainly she only brought it up now because of the Supreme Court so that it was certainly part of her calculus there [laughter] um but you know if she really did go through this you know that that's a different story we\nDon't know um but the other people in Cory Booker did not care a lot for one second about what happened to this one not at all not even for a second no he only cared about what happened to him so he could call themselves Spartacus a and eventually uh make himself into a twenty twenty candidate\nAnd the same thing with Kamala Harris and the same all of this all of these people they didn't care at all um any and it's and and look it's clear with things like Keith Ellison which is currently going on which actually had evidence behind it which is going on currently which actually gone to a the police and\nThen again if if if what we find out is that there is nothing to it you have to just like I Would with anybody else say that he you know is not guilty and should be able to do what he has to do but what are you judging by the standards that they're putting up\nIt's totally different ... let me put this and I I thought this was fascinating after\nI think of how recent this Brett Kavanaugh saying was an ... story back in your mind for a moment about what we were trying to find\nThat Dr Ford comes up and and testifies and says I Know these people are they were there none of those people\nSay that they remember this this incident uh she didn't tell anybody for a very long period of time there was no she couldn't remember where the house was she couldn't remember who's house it was you can remember how she got there she went back what had happened what mine of it it happened right none of it right [noise] um\nAnd we were basically the insinuation from the media was if let's say\nOne of the witnesses she named\nInstead came out and yeah I remember that party I remember hearing really shook up and she left in ... and and I remember being very strange and she was weird for the next three weeks she was just like\nYou know marry a distant and I I didn't know it was going on and now I Know if you would have had just that I think the media would have been in I mean they already were in full and conviction mode but I don't think Collins and flake would have held on or something like that just one person saying one thing not with as a witnessing the incident which is she heard about it in the general time period just one\nWe're looking for one who even knew that the party occurred none of the incident happened just that the party occurred\nListen to this this is from Nineteen Ninety nine from slate the hardcore right wing publication of late talking about the accusation of rape\nNot sexual assault not sexual harassment but rape against Bill Clinton brought her ex initial denials indicate only that she shunned publicity\nThat's why she never reported the rape rebuffed advances from Clinton's political enemies who in Nineteen Ninety two urged her to go public so they had asked Broderick about this in Nineteen Ninety two when he was running for president the first time and he said she said no I'm not going to tell my story\nSo she had an opportunity to take down this president did ... did not decide to do so she lied to Paula Jones lawyers about the incident to get out of talking about it she eventually told the FBI the truth uh Nineteen Ninety eight only because her son\nA lawyer advised her against lying\nFederal investigators so she didn't want to tell the story to tear down the president she told the story because she thought she was like perjury charges or something against or five people said ... five people said Broderick told them about the rape immediately after it occurred\nWow so now while for one person who was at the hotel or at the party in the cabinet case she had five people that she told about the rape immediately after\nIt occurred uh a friend and co worker named Norma Kelsey says Twenty one years ago she found a dazed Broderick with a bloody lip and torn pantyhose in their shared hotel room broader explained that Clinton had just raped her\nClinton is supposed to have bitten or on the ... right before raping her her current husband that her lover says Broderick told him about Broderick told him about the rape is well within a few days of the event Broderick did not remember the date of the rape and that's the one similarity here so\nShe did supply the name of the hotel\nThe ... and the reason she was visiting Little Rock a nursing home seminar she also says that Clinton pointed to a ramshackle prison outside the hotel room window before he raped her and said he planned to renovate it he's so Clinton in the middle of a bunch of cooked a rapist like by the way I'm going to renovate that was another door\nUm NBC News found a date and ... nursing home seminar was held at the Camelot hotel and record records show that Broderick attended\nNewspaper reports suggest that Clinton was in the area and had no official commitments in the early morning when the rape is supposed to have occurred\nThere was a prison outside the hotel window wow that is a thousand times the amount of even alleged evidence you know that occurred with ah with Dr Ford and\nBrett Kavanaugh and yet that was ignored for ... and ... until the very second the Clinton family became useless to the Democrats and now yeah you'll see occasional people saying yeah we should have handled that differently or I'm with you guys that that's a total me to moment that only happens now after\nThey never want to hear a either one of their uh stories ever again to them Hillary Clinton and the Clinton family is not guilty of this rape is not guilty of that they're guilty of blowing in election to Donald Trump and that's why they have no more used for them\nBut I mean Bill Clinton goes on is still makes big levels speeches oh yeah he's able to do all these things this is an ... a much\nMore credible accusation and Paula Jones had a lot of evidence to including corroborating witnesses of what happened there it's it's a situation with with a double standard that is so bizarre\nAnd the fact that they that that the media it actually thinks we should take their ... current stance seriously on this stuff is insane the stance is and always has been you should be taken seriously when your report a crime against somebody else that crime should be ... go go through the legal system\nWith actual standards and if they're held responsible for this crime then we can all understand what happened\nI mean that is what that is a system we have is the best in the world\nAnd the idea that we're supposed to go through these kangaroo courts and and even worse than that I mean even worse than the kangaroo court it's like oh well I don't know kind of seems like maybe he could have done it is now or standard that isn't sanity it's insanity\nAnd yet you have Hillary Clinton speaking out against Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd defending her husband and they they just asked her what the difference uh was between the two and she said well oh yeah they're completely different because um my husband's improprieties were looked into for a really long time this was looked into for a week\nWell there is some actual evidence as you just pointed out into all of the claims made by other women and Bill Clinton and the other differences she went after him try to destroy every single one of the accusers\nThat was that was a big difference nobody's trying to destroy Christine Blasey Ford nobody's tried to destroy even the others that are making outrageous allegations against him that are completely uncorroborated a reception\nOf Michael Evans ... which I think the Democrats are currently trying to destroy as they are so pissed off about that\nAnd they do not want him running for president and they do not want the circus there oh so they are they are today are very much trying to destroy him at this point but what a clown he is he is yeah I mean it's it's embarrassing you thought Michael Cohen was a bad lawyer and then Michael up and out of yeah introduced himself to you\nBut it's so bad that even Trevor Noah who's the ...

[noise] uh there's this\nThere's an interesting thing for the New York times today and it is they do this little pod cast in the morning called the daily and today's was about Lucy K. and whether Lucy case should be allowed back on stage ever ever\nUm well you did things in front of girls right after he asked him if he could yeah and that and they said yes an odd parts\nThe saga with him in particular is that there doesn't seem to be much of an alec ... much if any allegations of him and doing something that against the motives will write like he would ask they say yes\nOr or um there was one case where\nUm he\nAgain like this is the level of the accusation here he was accused of\nCalling up someone and while he\nWas on the phone with a woman the woman believed that he was pleasure ing himself while on the phone with her\nBecause I guess he was breathing heavy or something and ... couldn't hang up because of the power dynamics our dynamic absolutely yeah the power to make it makes you do all sorts of gay because\nAs a comedian he's in ... he wields incredible power in this country now incredibly let her have her fired at any job in the nation and giving any job you're\nA sarcasm is just reality and the situation like that they're kind of comical why and what they were saying they're saying they ... some of them\nPeople were other comedians and one at one point one of the accusations was he walked up to a another comedian er and they were talking and I guess he thought there was a vibe there or something invited her back to his trailer to do his thing in front of her which apparently was\nWho was the ... ... and and she said actually uh you know you have a wife and a child and you should think about that and he said I I Know I I'm Sorry you're right I have issues\nAnd that's the ... center the allegation that he didn't do it he didn't force or to do after that he didn't do it and then they had that conversation gosh you learn to do this thing which is unbelievable obviously icky right yeah but I mean again he asked her to do this thing she said no reminded him of his wife and child and so he said oh you're right I have I I have issues I'm Sorry\nBut that is is that sexual assault what I mean the accusation there are no I'm not sure why she was she answered a diet and he did not pursue it after that it's unbelievably there's you know so ... he admitted to being\nA dirt bag right man he admitted in such a general way that people kind of\nA make eat he well he admitted to these things and he did admit to I I've done a lot of things wrong I've tried to figure out a way to make that make them right and I think\nThat that would I just described you is obviously wrong yeah like I was a wrong thing for him to be doing how is it a crime is it a crime I think the idea that clearly is no and and they and the idea that you know Lucy K because he's a famous a comedian\nCan affect other people other comedians careers is theoretically possible but\nThat is that enough for a crime and the fact that he wants to have he wants to hook up with someone who theoretically he could hurt their career if they say no but there's not evidence\nThat he did this to anyone so it would even do it to anyone right I mean you know again just making a weird assumption there yeah and we just assumed the crime like this isn't sort of stuff that Minority Report was supposed to scares away from right you're not supposed to just a Seattle and people will commit crimes in the future\nSo he's not listen to this this is the guy who runs the comedy cellar and the comedy cellar is famous New York comedy club like it's a tiny it's like a hundred people can watch comedy there and they're the if you go there you'll see a lineup of comedians every day\nAnd and but it's famous for people random people that are incredibly famous just stopping by you go in there to see some comedian you never heard of they're probably pretty good but you got like a one in three chance maybe Chris Rock walks in it doesn't set or Jerry Seinfeld comes into office at our Lucy gay woman and it doesn't sit well apparently this is the first place he went\nAs he's tried to do this he bounced around to several clubs around New York since and they let them under the age so the New York times as an exhaustive report about trying to talk to the club owner but why you let him on stage\nThis is a clip about how he's trying to determine the decision\nListen all the people were just upset that he should ever work again the one guy but he's a comedian and like okay when do you think he could come work that he's like never mhm might never say never\nWell could you imagine any court of law handing down such a sentence never work again so I don't care

the idea is that we're all other because other people around and we're like well I think he ... he ... didn't blackout how the hell do you know not only he would know that\nRight uh you know and maybe he did I I don't see how that's all that ah there's no way to know that into the conversation but still there's no way to know what if the ridiculous thing to to complain about and I you know this is one of the most annoying parts about this\nIs the subtle\nAccusation that everyone who supported\nBrett Kavanaugh was a terrible person\nEven from people like you know there are people in the left but you know I'm sure a restaurant I certainly know them and they were against Kavanaugh because they believe ah you know Dr Ford mhm ... but the accusation there is similar to almost it's implicit essentially and everything that they are saying which is\nThey accuse us of believing\nForward\nIn a roundabout sort of way they're accusing us of saying we know she was assaulted and yet we still want him on the Supreme Court right and like no right well no thing is if we thought he was a sexual assault or we wouldn't want them on the Supreme Court we just don't believe he is\n... ... you have not provided any evidence to bring us over that line right and just because you happen to believe it with no evidence by the way you happen to believe her is your prerogative but you don't accuse me of of the ... of sinking her story was credible I didn't\nI didn't think her story was credible I think I don't think it happened\nYeah I don't either at the White House and I think it happened with somebody else\nMaybe believing that is is this is a I don't think it happened at all to be perfectly honest with you now of course I Can't prove that I wasn't there but the ... when when something like this happen and it's the same thing that happens with any big public official\nOr in this way if you have someone who doesn't report something it doesn't even tell their friends for multiple decades\nThen talks about a party that they couldn't rent or where it was and then they tell you but the people who were there and they can't remember the party like\nWhat are we in the person who's making the accusation has an overt uh dislike for the party of the person or that they're accusing there is a person who has been an activist is march that women's march rallies is is an obvious Democrat like\nYou have to take in that motivation forty years later into account\nI always started skepticism I had this idea that basically I think people almost it's like it's going to sound bizarre but I think it'd be almost like an innocent until proven guilty it's a weird way of saying about it yeah I Know I Know I I don't jump right to the guilt you do I leave the survivors\nNo no well you don't believe survivor but if you're a survivor that indicates that this at this event occurred\nCalling her a victim or a survivor indicate that you know the event occurred I Would ever called them victim I called them survivor but when I when they leave I\nEver survived this just solved by this man yeah but if they ... didn't happen they didn't survive it and [laughter] you know I guess we could all call ourselves survivors because we're all alive and we've technically survived everything that's happened to us so far life yeah like I don't know what her motivation was I don't know it's possible\nOr a ... a million things are possible what you said it's possible it's possible really happened and were misjudging the evidence while she make it up\nWhy would she lie about it that's a good question because I Love this one mhm\nPossibly could lose your motivation [laughter]\nNot that accurate should like this I don't know when I taught at school we\nTalk about uh yeah I Know we talk about the the ... women's right to choose it is just fainted as if it is the life of a baby not the ending of one\nI wouldn't defend my children's lives about as strongly as they would they defend their right to kill their children ... it is the most important thing in the universe to how many millions of Americans\nThe idea that you wouldn't do something to take out a guy who you think is going to overturn that right that you think is so vital\nIs insane we've seen forum crazier things happen we saw an accusation last week and we're five five accusers\nAccused the high school student of sexual assault because they as they later admitted like him didn't like him\nYeah we have we have a hoax allegations that have come through all the time people paint swastikas on their own garage they write I don't like your lifestyle on receipts because they're trying to blame people for being against being anti gay this happens all the time you know why\nPeople are horrible many of them are awful their women are awful men are awful they do terrible things that you can explain it happens all the time and the idea that they wouldn't do that with this on the line people are writing\nThe swastikas on their door for nothing you know to like say well I was a victim of of of anti Semitism or I was a victim of white supremacist\nNot one of the entire Supreme Court on the line of course you can find someone who's going to falsely accused which they do we know for a fact\nThe fifth accuser recounted allegations after he made them we know the ... the fourth accuser didn't even bother right any information on\nTheir letter including their name or where they lived or what had happened we know that the third accuser went to Michael ... and no one including Democrats believe them we know that false accusations we're littered all over the store\nThe only two they even seem ... seem credible to even Democrats\nWere the first to and and in the second one is is that there's a ... they're writing what date the person who made the allegation\nQuestion it's just fun it is I just want people ask why it's just too yeah I got no why\nI'm not even trying to frame anybody I like to do it like the way people look at it when it goes to drive when they think that I've been called a cracker and told to go back to Ireland and I came from time zone they throw in a small extra fry yes they feel bad for me I'm a victim [laughter]\nI'm a survivor [laughter] that I'm a survivor and I ... I Believe you\nStill do automatic interests to hold you I Believe it happened I Believe you can make you a AAA to [laughter] to have a twenty seven back is the phone number\nIn it let's just say you had a realistic looking air stopped gun ... that may be a lost it a little are you I assume they all have the orange thing on the ... ... let's just say that fell off or something or you can eat it at blackberry what'd you say\nHe's walking down the street or he's walking towards the school I can understand someone passing by me like a what the hell is going on and sharing the police yeah\nAnd what happens is they show up and they talk to them they owe generic ... I think I get the orange piece of people are gonna freak out and then you release them right let's say a max the maximum penalty but we will look we're going to take the gun will return it to you later\nInstead they found the soft gun in his truck and arrested him for disturbing the did they realize it was an air south yeah they knew what was in ... they said it was an air softer and they're they're still being congratulated\nFor their sweeps the accent [laughter] I Hope that I don't know\nI don't know what are you going to do with the ...
