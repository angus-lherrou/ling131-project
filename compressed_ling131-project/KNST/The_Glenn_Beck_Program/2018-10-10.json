[noise] um we can go\nTo the uh ever take care of the axis fed even married let that go on for months then when they disbanded that finally got the best of the police chief\nUm some of them moved\nTo

and said I'm a badge I said I was just shaking my head I mean he turned the red cross the street subject for me to hear it's always the white ones because they are shaking my head um\nWhat what are you talking about the ticket over city streets I see this video and there's cop standing by watching individuals to beat up on cars stopping city streets are better explain what's going on is\nThe

at a believe it's forcing pedophile pedophile being Harvey Milk they've decided to rename the street and um they've been there for two weeks now and it's time to let the city habits street back it's ridiculous\nHow is it possible that a few dozen antifa protesters can take over an intersection in the downtown area of the city for you're telling me weeks and the police do nothing about it\nBasically for the most part they let them go bell bell jar they're talking about and then they decided to grow up at the end of a workday I don't know what the what what what the motivation as

down or you just out in the street directing traffic\nBecause you feel it's your right well have you even look at what your rights mean where do your rights even come from\nToday I saw I think

or\n\nName calling of some sort\n\nHere's the question that we all have to answer is America a force for good or a force for bad\nThat requires real thought and discussion\nBecause it is neither in my opinion it is both it has been a force for bad and I warn you\nIf we leave the bill of rights we will become the darkest force ever on earth with our technology we will make the Nazis look like rookies make no mistake\nWe have been bad we have rounded up the Japanese we rounded up the Germans and the Italians we rounded up the blacks\nWe told people they couldn't vote including women\nBut we're also the people that freed the people we\nFreed blacks and we fought for it we fought and died\n\nWe fought to free the Japanese\n\nWe've brought to free the Germans and all of Europe and the

statement because that's all that is the declaration of independence is a mission statement period\nDo we still hold these truths to be self evident forget about the past let's talk about the future we have never ever reach the heights demanded by our mission statement\nBut\nHave we gotten better\nIs it's still worth striving for we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that means we're born equal we all have an equal chance\nDon't judge somebody by the color of their skin but by the content of their character\nDo you have do you have everything the baby lane next to you has when you were born\n\nAs far as human rights and dignity do you still believe that\nAnd I'm not talking about well it's not the way I Am asking you as an aspirational mission statement that is the mission statement of our country\nDo you want to live in a country that's thrives and falls short but picks itself back up again\nDo you want to live in a country that says all men are created equal and they are endowed by their creator why would you have to throw God into it too I don't care what you put there\nIt just must be bigger than man\nThe reason why the creator is important\nIs if you don't have something bigger than man then man we'll print and take away rights so if you want to sing from these turn of the ... the great cause most whatever\n\nBut he didn't doused each of us with certain on changeable rights and those rights are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness now there's a lot more and that's where the bill of rights comes in do we still

looking for\nIt's a failed system this one has been this one has failed us because it has been usurped\nThe constitution no longer a means anything the bill of rights no longer means anything why because it's not talk to anymore anybody who takes the oath of office in Washington Ninety percent of them are liars not even not even intentional liars\n\nThey don't know it they don't believe in it they will tell you they do as was told to me by a very powerful individual once look land we all believe in the constitution but you know you gotta do what you gotta do\nNo no\nYou do not to do what

they know if they are seeing their side being unreasonable violence if you see and to ah the way to answer and so far is not\nWith uh the militant people that will come out of the Nazis to come out and find them in the streets that is the moment before we lose our humanity that is the moment that Martin Luther king walks through and just is peaceful and gentle and you don't strike back\nIt works at this point but this point is\nGoing to slip away quickly as we lose our humanity as they did in Germany and you no longer a A R a Judeo Christian country with those kinds of peaceful values\nYou miss the moment and then it just becomes you know either communism or socialism what's really the difference oh well the leader says it's very different so I have to kill all of the other group\nYou have to act while they're still is a Judeo Christian value and we're losing it quickly\nSo to get to the far left will never do that we get to the people like you're talking about you have to develop

I know you don't necessarily agree with everything that you've said that we need at least that caught our station in about ... because of it\nAnd I you know I think we need to be careful about even\nI'm considering the I I think that there really isn't fair over a I to try to come in ... and ... that's ... yeah it's I think that they want to push ups are socialism\nI think the AI um well it will certainly changed everything obviously you know we've run into this in the past and all the other\nTechnical right on ... where ... you know the lights they were afraid that technology what's going to come and direct place their thoughts their problem correct and so\nUm I understand that hey I it's definitely I mean and that's going to change things but it's not going to take over everything all the jobs you know in addition obviously to the people that want to create a\nMachine that can keep the running you know there are certain things I just can't deal like I'm being a fixing up a leak in her plumbing in her house probably not going to do that um\nAs far as service obviously I think McDonald's is a great example where am I yeah I don't think many people are going to be upset if they go into ... tunnels and not have to deal with anyone that chick fillet isn't known for their service and I know that\nLet me ask you this let me ask you this first of all just a ... there's ... ... don't mean any offense or anything I just want to know um how up to speed you are on this um ... or ... what books are you reading on AI ... or ... or you just a generalist or have you dug in deep on this\nYeah I'm I'm more of a general that cannot than paperwork unless I'm sound coming this ... you know different perspectives are having then that that ... research that I Know that you have sure on that but\nYou know just my feeling like a a I is going to absolutely they will to diagnose cancer a quicker and more accurately than a doctor but are you going to want to sit in front of a robot and have the robots tell you that you have cancer and cleaner options\nSo have there are there is a ... and I can't remember the name of it on the uh on this particular subject but I Will look for it or there is a whole book based just on this uh nursing is probably one of the jobs that will be the last two go however\nThey are there are two companies right now that are doing studies on emotions the emotion of being able to detect it in someone and being able to reflected in face the reason why\nI'm a that that we don't connect with robots is because they cannot see\nOur emotions and read them and also reflect emotions in their eyes and in their face\nSo there are companies now that are specifically just working on cracking the code of emotional connection um it's going to take a while but it while is what ten years Fifteen Years in today's world\nAh and I think that's a long while I'm so there there are those are those the ideas are that are being worked on right now you have to understand that\nSilicon Valley is currently working on the utopian idea of one hundred percent unemployment that no one has to work\nThat everyone will be able to have plenty because robots and everything else will be able to manufacture\nThis is different than any other technological leap than we that we've ever made yes we are going to shed jobs and yes there will be other jobs that will be created\nThat is one theory the prevailing theory is there is nothing that a human can do that through a GI and especially a s I Will not be able to do much much better including breaking the news to people\nBecause the idea is that that system will be able to\nGo through every bit of information about the individual they're about to tell\nSo they will know everything that they've ever posted about let's say their mom just died they'll be able to ... see everything they've ever written to their mom every text message to their mom they will know the exact relationship and they will be able to temper the message\nMuch better and much more personal than anyone else\nThe bigger problem is on a high end doctors is this will happen quickly\nAlready had I Can't remember the name of the system but it is in New York and you'll have to excuse me I read about this about three four years ago\nThe uh New York board of medicine already has a computer on the board\nAnd what they're doing is they're feeding in all kinds of information\nAnd it it is not like a human doctor the best human doctor that is seen a lot done a lot really up on the latest research and all of the facts and studies and and history everything else this has perfect recollection of it\nAnd they have found that it can diagnose so much better it it's I think it's\nFifty percent for the doctors and it's Ninety eight percent for the computer way in advance\nAt what point do we say I don't want a human to do the diagnosis I don't want the best specialist I Want the IBM please\nSo you have to understand that there is a fundamental shift that the world has never ever seen before and we're about to experience that shift between twenty twenty and twenty thirty and the world will not be like it is today\nYou
