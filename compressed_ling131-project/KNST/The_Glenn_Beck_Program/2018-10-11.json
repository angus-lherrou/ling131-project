in the polls we should stand the true and steady we have to speak truth do not forget the things that we were all taught and we all know are true\nTo be civil and kind to one another but we were not

are you\nThank you thanks for having me and I think we both wrote books and outrage of a nice time to talk about outrage\nWe did and you have you found the ad that it's not necessarily an understood topic or a popular topic right now to try to do diffuse it or explain what it does to us\nYou know it's interesting I see the word used more than I've ever seen that before in my lifetime you know rage an outrageous in headlines of articles all the time but it's when you go a little deeper and in your case talking about his relationship to addiction or in my case\nTalking about Christians might engage the age of outrage when I I don't think I think there's a lot of references to it but not a lot of okay what do we do interact I think you\nKnow damn from Georgia who who are fascinating fascinating call and as you've got to walk through that with him he's clearly outraged his response would be very different than yours and I appreciate you responded\nAnd mine and I think ultimately part of the challenges is Dan's response is I mean that just said I'll just say it\nI'll just say it you know dance response is the way a lot of people feel like I Know you are there's a lot of built up outrage that is and it's it's you know you both on the conservative and liberal side\nAnd it's in many ways tearing our country ... from my concern as a Christian leader you know I'm here at the Billy Graham center a well my concern is is as Christians how are we going to engage in a world filled with outrage or and when sometimes we're the we're the cause of it sometimes where the targets of it it's it's a mix and I love your\nComments about religious liberty to I mean I I'm I'm deeply concerned about religious liberty or around the world like for you bringing that up bring in that case up even today but but but again I I see Christians who are outraged about Starbucks cups\nRather than about persecution around the world and I think so we got our own issues to deal with but also it's a culture as a whole\nSo tell me because [laughter] and I don't know if you heard last hour when I was talking about ...\nAnd that we have this closing window bond Hoffert did not succeed in what he tried to do he'll though he was in the end victorious um but he didn't he didn't change the people because the people had already abandoned their Judeo Christian values they were angry they were outraged and they were\nThey wanted political solutions not a spiritual solution uh and uh they they just went for it we have this this window or on our Judeo Christian culture\nAnd our and our underpinnings\nThey're being lost and if we don't get through that window and keep people's hearts\nOpened we're going to go really a rye ...\nAnd I think ultimately this is our moment to them you know not every we don't get to pick the moment we're born or that we live in two in every generation has face their challenges\nBut this is our moment and it ends in the book I sort of go through I have a chart and some stats up some new statistics in each chapter and I talk about how in many ways a that Judeo Christian a consensus has been lost and now\nThe views of uh you know Christians different groups maybe a better more on the conservative side are now outside in many ways of the mainstream of society where once they were the mainstream and that's kind of lead to an accelerated\nA outrage cycle it's led to everyone's turning up the volume two eleven and ultimately I don't think that's the path and I appreciate what you just said earlier when you're talking to talking to Dan is we've got to um we've got to choose a different way now one of the key things as Christians are consistently choosing a different way\nAnd you know we don't need to be disabled by our cable news network or we don't need to be a shape spiritually by her social media feed I think ultimately we need to be shaped as Christians by who Christ is and the Jesus was afraid to stand up I mean he was in the temple and he turned over tables\nBut he also showed this remarkable ability that we can model to to build bridges with people with whom he shouldn't even be around because American Woman at the
