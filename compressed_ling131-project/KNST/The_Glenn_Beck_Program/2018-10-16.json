last night um and I posted up on slate of Facebook but I I I I I Want to spend some time going over it with you you\nKnow the saying may you live in interesting times they always say oh that's a Chinese curse that it's really not that's not may you live in interesting times is not a Chinese in fact the first place that we can really find it being sad is in the Yorkshire Post that's in England in Nineteen thirty six\nA guy stood up in parliament his name was a sir Austin Chamberlain and he was um uh he was a meeting with union is\nAnd ah he spoke of the grave injury to collective security by Germany's violation of of the treaties so he said\nLook I'm not so long ago\nI spent some years of service in China and there there was this old Chinese fellow who told me of a curse may you live in interesting times and there is no doubt that this curses followed up on us\nSo it's not a Chinese it's this this guy is the only one is the only place we can really find this\nBut I've always liked that\nBecause I don't think it's a curse it's a it's a\nIt's just a saying and you decide if it's a blessing or a curse I personally think it's a blessing\nMy dad taught me when I was really young that no matter what happens to you there is no bad\nNow he taught me this when I was really young but it took it took me hitting rock bottom alcoholism divorce everything else my life completely falling apart before I really learned\nThat it took a dark chapter in my life that that taught me there is nothing that life can hand you that is in itself bad\nIt just depends on what you do with it\nIs this going to change you in destructive ways is it going to make you angry are you going to be filled with bitterness and despair are you going to be looking for vengeance blame\n\nOr will you allow whatever calamity has come your way to strengthen you\nThrough enlightenment through correction new understandings humility\nIt's up to you\nSo living in interesting times I think that's a blessing\nAnd we're going to learn this one way or another we can either learn this the easy way like with my dad telling me or we all learned the hard way like I actually had to take hit the end and learn through just total collapse\nBut one way or another humility will rain again because we have we have an unbelievable lack of humility\nIn DC in Hollywood of a story today to tell you about Michael ... who's now quitting the music industry\nHe says he's tired of the celebrity nonsense\nEverybody on the left and the right we all have an ego problem we're utterly convinced that our side is absolutely right and if you violate that if you violate one part of that you're a traitor you're a traitor to the race the party the cause whatever\nThey are wrong and we remain right now there are real true right and wrong but there is there is truth\nBut I don't think any of us are really looking forward at least a large section isn't looking for it we are indeed living in interesting times\n\nBut he is ... is our crisis is our problem of them problem because that's what the world is trying to sell us I personally think it's an ... problem\nAll of us both sides all of us\nAnd maybe we don't see it because we're so busy staging and filtering and enhancing the colors on our Facebook or Instagram pictures that we can really no longer recognize what what is true even about our own lives\nBecause everything that we print in post most of it is ally one way or another subtler bold its ally\nAnd why is that\nBecause we've been marketed to ever since we were born all of us if you were born after Nineteen fifty you are marketed to your whole life\nEspecially now it's just getting worse and worse and worse and worse you are not complete unless you wear consume you own your

stages where we ourselves are products companies like Google and Facebook and Amazon and YouTube\nWe're not a customer\nWe're now the commodity were the thing they're selling oh you want this group of people that want to buy these things here they are\nThe if you can't fill in the line\nI Am blank if you can't fill that in with an actual word in be it complete happy satisfied excited or I Am worthless\nIf you don't fill it in yourself somebody ... somebody else will and marketers are trying to fill that in for you you buy this product and you can say I am cool or I Am in style I Am rich I Am smart you by Democrat\nAnd you can say I am compassionate\nYou by the Democratic label I Am smarter than others I Am science minded than it does it even matter if you really are doesn't matter if

we all know we all see the same symptoms we all know that we as a nation or sick were really really sick\nAnd we have we have each of us have doctors and their each prescribing the opposite medicine and\nEach of us as patients are also desperate to cure or what is killing us killing our society\n\nThat we will follow these doctors directions because they know better they know better they know more than we do that they've got the answer and we become more and more vested in their cure as our friends and family said that's not the cure because we're taking this medicine and we believe we just become\nMore vested in our doctor are doctors write yours is wrong\nWith the same time the doctor is not good\nYou get more humble because the doctor will know he or she has everything to lose if his or her patients begin to seek another opinion another diagnosis another remedy it's in their best interest to keep patients busy looking at the other side\nSo they're not questioning what he's doing and while we're all fighting\nOver the cure none of us even if stop to ask if the diagnosis is even correct were\nJust too busy fighting what our doctor said\n\nNo I don't know about you but I Know you know we're sick I Know you know this society is sick we are sick and we are in pain and and when I Am sick or in pain I'm usually at my worst inner personally and usually I'm not good at making friends at that point\nAnd I don't think you are either we snap at each other we act as our lesser selves\nBecause when I'm sick I'm I hurt\nAnd I am full of despair or I'm fearful\nOr I just don't have the patience and every time I'm really sick or in real pain it usually is followed by a time where I have to begin conversations with I'm really so sorry I I was just in really bad pain or I was really sick I was having a really bad day\nAnd I know I'm not alone\nAnd judging by our society today we're having a really very bad most difficult day every day it seems and it gets worse every day\n\nI Want to those doctors to know I Want those\nI don't want those to know that actually do just want to watch the world to burn I Want you to know that it's true we know there are dangers in

going to one of these hey hey\nOr to publish open access journals that has apparently fairly low are very low um review standards and so it didn't prove what we wanted to prove or didn't even really offer good evidence for what we're looking at\nBut it was fun we learned a lot of it was definitely fun fun right um yeah he misses\nDon't exist but they called all of our problems anyway\nRight [laughter] that um but yeah so we learned our lesson we we took the criticisms we got from that to heart ... uh it was fun but it didn't work people criticized us I think fairly pointed out where we were weak by using these journals and instead\nWe committed to a few things going into this new project one is that we would not use paid published journals in any sense a secondly and by the way they don't\nCharge like a hundred dollars they charge like a couple of thousand ... ... it's really kind of a financial racket going on there it's its own big problem and I hope people continue to address it\nA secondly we decided that that um we would use the highest ranked\nJournals within the disciplines that we're examining that we could get into so we would start at the best rental we could find for what we were doing and then work our way down if that one didn't take it would go to the next one and then thirdly we committed to being transparent about our results no matter what happens so if our if we had gone crash and burn\nComplete failure then um [noise]\nThat would have would have been what we report it I don't think it would have gotten much attention but we would have come out and it made it that we were wrong but it does not what happened on and uh\nEarly on in the process not just to keep us honest because I think we would have kept our promise\nBut early on in the process we ended up in contact with a documentary filmmaker who is interested in this stuff already but he's been recording us for a year his name's Mike ... ... and it since he's been a recording us I mean clearly what ever happened is going to come out so there it is\nOK so before we take a break a and get into what you actually got published I'm telling you about the work behind it just took a year or to do what kind of time or are you looking at\nWell easiest kind of look at what this is I had exactly five social outings between Thanksgiving and when uh the project was came out in the public eye took\nMaybe that many days off including weekends I work probably eighty to Ninety hours a week almost every week\nUm my two collaborators worked\nAlso very very hard I'm Peter put in at least a fulltime job Helen did most of the same and I know you talk to hell in the other day yeah uh so I this was an\nAn immense amount of work required learning these fields very quickly writing academic papers a typical academic all published a couple a year maybe if they're working hard and we wrote twenty\nA holy cow yeah it's a lot of work it was an insane amount of work\nAnd these are all fields we have no expertise and know Helen has a little bit of background in some of this but this was primarily\nHaving to learn this material on the fly with no education with no teachers instructing us are only feedback was how our papers fared and the peer review process and then reading what was out there to try to emulate it\nAnd so what does what does having something published in one of these the magazines I mean what does it mean to the author and to the educational\nCommunity so for the author it is the absolute pinnacle of what an academic is trying to do in the research died of their career is to get papers published in well established journals\nAre for example hype Asia is one of the journals we got a paper and and I paid ... is a feminist philosophy journal was probably the highest standing so it would carry a lot of weight\nLooking at the academic community that that scholars embedded in so they could take that to their university and say hey I got this many papers published\nIf people are being considered for tenure there's a research component to that depends on how the the school wants to do their tenure in process but typically seven papers spanning seven to ten years is considered the ... the basic research requirement to be qualified for tenure\nUm our paper spanned the ones we wrote spend Fifteen some disciplines of thought the ones that got accepted spanned seven [noise] and so\nWe've got big journals we've got seven disciplines papers got into we probably would have had more how do we not been cut short\nSo there's you know you and who you had twelve in the pipeline that look like they would be published and then this came out and so you you pulled those but you might have had as many as twelve\nI think honestly we had fourteen that weren't dead yet and I can say with some confidence I think twelve would have gotten in and possibly possibly Thirteen so I Would guess was pretty good confidence that somewhere between eleven and Thirteen would have gotten in in the end\nAre we not gotten pulled\nOkay so when we come back we will go into and remember we're on we're on public airwaves so [laughter] so are we as careful as we can to to discuss what was in each of these papers\nA and an article where they got a little gold star for [noise] alright are a sponsor this half hour is zipper critter zipper critter is just as great\nCompany

you say quality candidate are qualified candidates not somebody um it it it meets all of your requirements it meets the requirements of you know I don't care if I'm Starbucks and there's a barista in

and\nWe're talking to Dr James Lindsey author of life in light of death\nOr he is a you can follow him at consensual a conceptual James a on a on Twitter he is one of the ... if not the mastermind behind a the a papers a of record that were were being written\nA for for a feminist studies and queer studies were published in some of the the leading journals a and a and critique to but\nI'm not really critiqued in a way that most people would I'm just quickly go through some of them are going in through the back door which is not something we're going to discuss here that's really great rubbing one out\nOf the violence of object to vacation through non consensual masturbation uh then we get to some really disturbing ones\nThe progressive stack James tell us about the progressive stack\nYeah the progressive stacks of pretty horrifying piece of work and in fact it's evil ah fortunately it did not get accepted the journal was inviting us to re submitted and um give it another go\nThey just it says this is this an act says it's a solid essay that with revision will make a strong contribution to the growing literature of addressing injustice in the classroom\nYeah so what did argues for is that we take students in college classrooms and we have them go through some kind of a inventory that determines how privileged they are it recommends a thing\nAnd called the step forward step back game as a possibility\nWants to determine how privileges they are the students are ranked according to their privilege um then the more privileged you are the worst you get treated in class so the most privileged white and male students are invited to listen and learn throughout the semester which means face\nAren't allowed to speak or ask questions in class they're invited to sit in the floor in chains to experience reparations and a level the the knowing field to the way in a very privileged classroom learning environment\nAnd the problem that the reviewers seemed to have with this set of suggestions was that we thought there's no way this will get in we have to temper it by saying we have to be compassionate to these students as we put them in the foreign themes\nAnd they said watch it with compassion that re centers the needs of the privileged over the oppressed and\nThere's this idea out there called the pedagogy of discomfort which means that you learn to overcome your privilege by being made uncomfortable and leftist fit in that without being comforted and so they actually wanted to make\nA terrible scary idea properly evil and that's\nThe worst part is is it's only a small step from what I already exist in a great deal of the a feminist and race based education literature\nSo this was not really terrified this was not accepted because it didn't it wasn't bad enough\n[noise] ah at first yeah and then later they were concerned with the death of a scholarship and and the kind of routine thing that\nYou would expect out of a scholarly paper they claim for example that we grew on too many concepts and it would be confusing for the reader and to try to narrow it down to something a bit tighter and so on\nBut um but the idea that that giving students experiential reparations and asking them not to be able to speak in class or to reach spoken over\nInterrupted to teach them what that feels like none of that was questioned\n\n... if this were published and they were real if this were published what what would that mean\nTo the university system would what's that mean\nSo all events is a really complicated I'm there will be people who try to take this out in fact we got the idea from a news article about somebody at the University of Pennsylvania who was employing a similar but less extreme version of this in her classroom and got in trouble for it a late last year\nSo this I didn't come to us\nOut of the vacuum this was actually something that people are attempting in classrooms and so there would have been some some uh educators primarily working and social justice side or the fields topics\nCourses I guess as the best way to say that but also probably into some of the general and stuff who would take up some degree of these suggestions as you know experimental but but legitimate to using the classroom and this was being submitted to\nBecause all it takes the grievances everywhere and it's certainly being used in the academic left as we were trying to demonstrate we called the stuffed grievance studies we see it everywhere right and I think this is why we're so divided\nA politically right now I was really happy to talk to you because I mean I Know I don't want to get in touch with you but you're real dude and that's why I wanted to talk to you thanks you know you had this whole ... about\nHow things were going where you are under Obama's time and I thought that was huge that was like you know this guy Glenn Beck is is is a bridge she's looking for reconciliation is on your on your Twitter bio we need to be talking to each other again\nSo our project was you know or people on the left were left liberals I'm not ashamed to say that I Know you consider yourself a classical liberal and conservative on the right\nThat's great I'm we're on the left needed a responsibility for our own lunatics and so our project was kind of that you\nKnow or left wing people who want the left to come back from the from the edge and we hope that you know the same things happening on the right and we can all START I think you know people\nIn general I get a lot of sense that people send me emails about this now all the time especially um\nWe're all kind of sick of all this nonsense all the fighting all the polarization and we can't get anything done I think we want to get back the production politics and as long as we're relying heavily on this grievance stuff which clearly the academic left is I think we see a lot of it coming out of the right wing media sphere as well from my perspective\nI think as long as we're focusing on that we can't have productive conversations we can't\nReally remember you know you are an American I'm an American your person I'm a person\nWe have ... most of the things that we think\nIncome and even though we have some probably pretty serious political differences but I think we also have in common that we want to have better conversation we want to move society and a direction that benefits us all and it's just a matter of working at the details and I really hope that you know that our project kinda reaches reaches that point does that make sense\nIt totally does I I I Am I I hate to say that too I'm Out of time could I invite you to come down and uh and do a pod cast with me you know when you spend an hour and a half uninterrupted

there in really good shape to control the Senate and a really bad shape to continue their control of the house\nI mean look at the X. dream\nPolicies that the left is looking to push in\nThrough the Democratic party\nSingle payer and I'm Sorry a single payer health care free health care free college I'm a repeal the taxes they are looking for in the even bigger a infrastructure package than what Donald Trump was even a asking for\nAnd you mentioned health care Medicare for all and twenty Thirteen Bernie Sanders proposed this and gotten zero cosponsors zero\nHe was the only one who publicly supported now the you look at the top ten CNN has a list of the top ten or ... democratic candidates which by the way it will not be enough to ... to cover the field there's going to be a lot more than ten I think uh but I mean everybody with the exception\nOf Joe Biden who I Will not be surprised at all if he comes out and\nIt does endorse Medicare for all\nAll the big names are for it already there are many of them were cosponsors of the bill uh it seems to be this I mean the idea that we in two thousand ten and eleven were being called racist for suggesting what they wanted was single payer and now here they are\n... the entire field is endorsing single payer health care I think credible\nYou know we were scare mongers in races for saying it yeah so I just want to go through there's there's three stores will go through this tomorrow but I just I just\nWant to throw these at ya I'm Cortez was out of this weekend we have to eliminate the electoral college hey no that is a fundamental\nUm a a a a fundamental aspect\nOf what brought the states together in the first place the state said we don't want the big states telling us what we can do and if the big states can a control everything\nWell then ...\nWhat do we have it can't be that way so we had the electoral college\nWe are one stayed away from losing the electoral college anyway you lose taxes and you have New York California and Texas the rest of the country doesn't matter\nIt will be those three states you lock those three states up and it doesn't matter anymore that's pretty frightening pretty frightening\nSo now we're talking about taking apart the electoral college which would make all of the red states really pretty much in consequential\nYeah I mean it certainly would change the way the founders thought about\nThe idea of people being elected right I might have to do is just just appeal to the big cities and by the way this is a this is an idea that um and it's not just democratic support for getting rid of the electoral college I Know Trump's sports at for example throwing um I I you know I'm not a big fan of the national popular vote or certainly not what our founders had in mind but\nThere is a there is some contingency on both sides of the aisle that actually believe this is the right way to go which I mean you that gets you just basically a country run by cities I mean as you know it'd be which it wants that like as a Republican or certainly don't understand why you'd want it but ... again like it shouldn't be that way right\nAt least should run themselves in the city is gonna run whatever they want and the rural or you can do what they want\nWhy do we all have to live under somebody else's thumb I don't want to live under a farmer's thumb no farmers should make that although I'd feel better with this than the other way around no farmers should be telling what somebody in the city has to do and how to live\nThey don't understand taking any of my farmer friends to Manhattan their heads would explode within twenty five minutes\nThey would not want to live there they wouldn't understand it so why should we have the people in farms and farmland trying to dictate rules that are good for them but I also have to be applied to the city it's ridiculous\nRight and it's why the house and Senate both exist to give a balance to that so that ... not not one side can tell the head out right\nAnd you know no it's actually it's it's it's goes further than this if you would have if you could er race the mistake of the\nUh of the progressive under Wilson where they changed the meaning of the Senate the way they got elected yeah it it used to be that the house was the place where the people could move and move quickly so things could be passed because there was a disaster and things can be passed quickly\nThen the next the the first check on the balance of power the first check on that power was to go through another body that was a lot slower the Senate people are always like parents too slow it was designed to be that way so you go through another body that was much lower but it wasn't just that it was lower\nIt was also supposed to be men or women that were selected by their state legislature\nNow what would that do\nThat would make sure that those guys are beholden to their state not to the rest of the country not figures in national politics for Iraq during I shouldn't chair or what uh what's his face in New York is says shouldn't care when Hillary Clinton was senator Brock Obama was center I\nShouldn't care about that\nBecause they would be focused on their state and they would be making sure that the federal government would not be eating into the power of their state\nThen it goes to the president and the president is only supposed to veto thing if he finds it unconstitutional now they'll say I think this is unconstitutional but I'll sign it\nWas way no that's the ... the the opposite way you're supposed to veto it not if you don't like it if you find it unconstitutional it's unconstitutional then it would go to the Supreme Court\nWe've screwed up the balance of power so much and that's why you have this story today the United States Senate is a failed institution\nSo I think he did by the way I think you're right would you would not speak to me right when you say for public consumption that is exactly what he's doing yes he has these opinion is oh jeez where we're damned if we do damned if we don't but in reality what he wants is a is much more on this side but yeah the ...\nMore on the outside and you
