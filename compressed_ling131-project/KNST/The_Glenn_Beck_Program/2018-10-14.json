{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KNST", "content": "Yeah and ... and ... and how many how many years ago it was a seven years ago you said correct yeah I mean in those days I don't think there was a bar violation but do you want to get back at him for a screw your wife at the time or you just basically want to blow it off\nWell you know I don't know if you're gonna make out of it\nYeah you're gonna make life miserable so\nI Do want to you certainly can I don't think much is going to\nCome of it or they're going to do a bar investigation is going to obviously you have to defend themselves probably hire a lawyer or an expert in representing a representing a you know it was representing their lawyers represent lawyers in front of the bar\nAnd um you know I was ah oh and I I once had a complaint against me that was quite had a couple of complaints against these crazy crazy complaints ... a basic based on the handling the law the advice I give because some people that took me seriously\nOh All right and a relied on that so anyway but I had to you know I brought in a lawyer\nOr who specialize in this the first time out uh when I was actually frightened nine now and bother so it's your call your call do I think anything's going to come to know why as I said because it wasn't a conflict it was the whites you were a notch\nUh being uh you were not a she was not being representative wasn't a divorce case where there was clearly a conflict so ah I just think the two of them got it on\nA daily rate\nThere your whole anyway yes\nUm um oh\nGod I hate these winds All right let's try it ah but starting young\nWe just lost you know there shouldn't be technology out there that overcomes this wouldn't you think by this day and age\nI mean we can send a guide to the moon that doesn't even work anymore in the last time there was a guy on the moon was in the seventies so that's kind of stupid so we're going to be able to we can send the guy to Mars right at some point as well because back he calls back All right\nOh hello Chris welcome to handle on the law Kris bill yeah there's\nA new tax law that allows me to a man that tax return from Eighteen years ago it could get a refund paid on military severance pay back then I was married to a someone that I cannot locate now are hiding from having to pay ... or\nSo I have no way of contacting her and I haven't heard from earn like sixteen years I don't know how to amend a tax return that we're going with only one signature\nAh there there has to be a way of doing that because if the law allows someone to file an amended return Twenty years later Eighteen years later\nThere's a a decent chance at the other partner and espouse a ... is not around\nEither can't be found a somewhere out there on remarried died whatever so I there there has to be a way within the rules the IRS because uh the Irish is pretty good about issuing five thousand new rules every other minute so the trick is to find an accountant straight out accountant who understands these rules\nAnd now when you file your tax returns you have an accounting\nRisk yeah yeah have you asked your accountant about this\nYes and he wasn't gr of any way to do it then you have and I happen to have an appointment with the Iraq on friday\nAnd that is that yeah that's the way\nI'm Glad you're asking me because of my vast expertise would not only this is tax law or this or tax returns and of course I you know when I have a complicated problem do you think I sit and researcher look it up now I go to my account and Chris\nJust like you did not what you did is you went a step beyond and that is what I Would tell you if your account and doesn't know or several accountants you make an appointment with the IRS and yet and you might occur\nDrafted that I actually find that my style and uh maybe no\nPicnic or just magically appear no no I I I don't know why I don't know if I Would do that I don't know if\nI Would do that what I Would say to the IRS is do I have to find her and uh then I Will then I'll go to extraordinary lengths to find her\nAnd that's when I go out that many grand behind the\nCounter right that's another issue and they made this and you and and you may be able to get the whole thing\nOkay based on the child support order so\nI the magical signature\nAh she's she's still entitled to half of that\nYeah now there could be a way where and this happens all the time with child support the IRS holds off I mean it'll grab people's money\nYeah arcade cars and that that stayed right now we're ... supposed to be surrender\nOkay so you're halfway there definitely time to talk to and IRS agent and and if the IRS agent doesn't know that rule specifically and it doesn't have any experience or ah doesn't really understand that you go to a supervisor and you ask for someone who understands what's going on because it's pretty obscure stuff\nAnd it's not as if a an Irish ... who doesn't understand this is incompetent in any way I mean if you ever look at the IRS code if you ever look at the Internal Revenue code these our phone books thick\nWith hundreds of thousands of rules\nAnd you're not normally for ... to amend after three years\nWell they've changed the law I Wonder if you want to ask\nMe I would've said no but if they passed\nA law that is a different than we are in great shape it's for military\nObviously we're All right so is there any of 'em out to get their return\nSo we're talking about a very narrow narrow description of a very narrow group of people\nAnd so you simply need someone who understands it and you're doing everything right man I'm there's nothing more I can give you other than you're doing everything right\n\nAlso let me tell you about life like here's something they do right and life locked protects your identity\nAnd of course another hack this was Facebook fifty million accounts of course why not there isn't a person in this country that they had information has already made just doesn't exist so\nUh I've been a customer of life walk and I'm suggesting you look at them to a customer for ten years and they saved me from identity theft a couple of times between me and my daughter\nAnd here's what they've done is they've added nor security to their program lifelike protect your identity nor is security protects your device is against a virus attacks\nAnd if you have a problem with either one or they will work to fix the problem now no one could stop every cyber threat or prevent all id theft or monitor every transaction

[laughter] and I mean these are falling and nobody's airing it and I'm In the middle of a city\nYeah many many hundreds of miles away I cannot hear the trees but yeah I I Try to remember I watched something that was so outrageous\nWas it and I thought to myself wow I'm really not outraged\nI don't care they just don't care\nIt's hard I mean there's a lot of stuff I mean they're you know the things that the people that are trying to cover this election and the you know the cabinet thing are actually saying I mean they're incredible it's as if they don't care what the words they're saying mean well well\nFor instance let's let's use this because we're changing definitions of words are here is um [noise]\nUh here's Brooke Baldwin on CNN they're talking about how we we we we've got to be careful because people are going to be hurt because we're we're we're seeing mobs start to form here it is\nI Believe it's the overreaction of a left when you see people like Ted Cruz getting chased out or restaurants by a mob oh you're not going to use the word out totally a mop it is without\nA doubt that there's no other way it's going to put a stop on the mob is what we saw in Charlottesville, Virginia to oh I think I Know I thought oh what what we saw chasing we've right what about the people\nWho were at the Supreme Court banging on the wall\nWhat do you call that civil protest or without a mob I think it's easily a mob yeah and if there was a party or as we call it a mob pressure come on I ... I mean because I saw lots of\nTea partiers going to the Supreme Court in banging on the on the walls and by the way I have plenty of Supreme Court decisions that make me want to bang on the walls of the Supreme Court right but we don't do those things because they're both were supposed to be in a civil society\nRight I Am I trying to remember I'm trying to remember all of the people to tea partiers uh chased down with their children\nYou know and the homemade signs how many people they chased down in restaurants and surrounded and not think of one exam in fact if you want an example of this what did dancey below sea do during the health care bill\nShe and a was a John Lewis marched out in to the crowded\nIn to the crowd trying to get them to do that and they wouldn't do you remember where\nThey tried to get them to be violent they said all kinds of crazy things throw gasoline all over them and then they linked arms in March bravely through that crowd when they didn't have to\nThey were trying to get the Tea Party to become of violent mob they didn't\nCan you imagine what would have happened if Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh would have linked arms and tried to walk through the crowd in Washington DC would not have been pretty it would not have been pretty\nAnd by the way I mean you know you can talk about some of these things I mean ... ... ... that's not a mob there like charging cities and they're taking over that's ... that's a riot\nThat is why it by a mob you know did you define mob police look it up in the dictionary find out let's let's make sure we know what we're talking about\nMob mob a large crowd of people especially one that is this orderly and intent on causing trouble for violence okay and and the quote is a mob of protesters that\nSay that their usage so is this not a disorderly\nCrowd of people that are trying to what the incandescent on causing truck in tents on causing trouble\nI mean I guess if you think well Brett Kavanaugh was a terrible person and stopping him is good so that's not tell us in trouble I mean if you go to go down that road I guess the other than that\nThat doesn't does it say there unless you're right just as intent on causing trouble or right it doesn't say you know ... with an exception of those who are absolutely right what what I'm saying though\nIs that the media does not see harassing conservatives that's causing trouble correct\nThat is the issue correct they see this as a crazy that says like the you know there it's basically you know charity we're at right I mean they're they're doing good for the\nPeople you're stopping these evil or old white people who have names like Cruz\nOr that you know [laughter] things better yeah [laughter] I mean but at night I buy the Irish guy or [laughter] let me tell you the white people they those white people do ya [laughter]\nReally bad oh really [laughter] okay\nSo let's listen to a couple of things first we have CNN we just played oh you're not going to call it a mob yes I'm going to call it a mob\nA now here's Maxine Waters trying to say we're trying to redefine protests this mob rule here it is\nProtests is guaranteed to a a democratic society we know that this is guaranteed to us about the constitution\nThat she's going to change the description of protests and call it a mob well no this president is the poster boy a thought what a mob a protest that looks like he is a matter of\nFact he's the one who has been violence in his speech he said why things like this I lacked punch him in the face Trump said that at one of his rallies he said knock the crap out of them are what you and seriously okay ... I mean okay alright okay we\nGot it now that's what she's saying she's saying that Donald Trump is the one who's violent and their speech a let's go to Jennifer ... adults are at us and she's the network president and co executive director at the center for popular democracy here's what she's saying to the crowds\nLawmakers leftist continue to push protests scared to sorry\nSorry [noise] [laughter] [noise] so\n\nTill they go and where the the [noise] now here's\nHere's the problem let's wretched things down just a bit and listen to somebody who says no I think there's real trouble on the way and has reason to say that here's Rand Paul\nWhen people like Cory Booker said get up in their face he he may think that that's okay but\nWhat do you have to realize is that for about every thousand person that might want to get up in your face\nWhat I'm going to be an stable enough to commit violence when I was at the ball field which basically was nearly killed the guy shooting up the ball field and shooting I think five or six people were were shot glee has almost killed he was yelling this is for healthcare hit a list in his pocket of conservative Republicans that he wanted to kill\nYou know what I was attacked in my yard and that's why ribs broken a pneumonia lung conclusion that these are people that are unstable we don't want to encourage them we have to somehow ratchet down and say we're not encouraging that volunteer ever OK\nEver reason for or I mean we're trying to think\nI feel that there's going to be in a fascination I really worried when it's going to be killed and ah that those who are ratcheting up the the the conversation ... getting their face we have to realize that they bear some responsibility of this extra power\nSo to whatever the time when people like Rick Wildwood in CNN were lecturing us that you couldn't say you're going to target a district\nBecause that of course led to violence couldn't target ... district remember the lectures of your words have power because you don't know who's listening to them and we said unless you're unless you're endorsing this we're calling for peaceful rallies and they were\nAnd they were\nThese are not peaceful how many people were arrested for the Tea Party\nRiots mobs\nHow many I don't remember any\nThere's four hundred just last weekend\nOn the left four hundred that's disorderly that's not a peaceful protest your words do have power because you do mean violence now how can Glenn Beck even see that well I'll back it up when we come back\nSocialism is taking root in America socialism\nYeah I mean people in the less they fascist every time someone does something they don't like right it's a no no no I Am a registered actually fascism it that is\nIt's socialism that is sweeping the nation remember the headline we're all social that's now\nThat's what sleeping is sweeping the nation are\nParallels between the two areas aren't perfect but the late Nineteen thirties I thought oh that\nIs an understatement of the year can use a lot about the parallels between the two hours are perfect they're not perfect but I did one way to describe you've just done yeah about three quarters of them are completely inaccurate but as an aide to a night late Nineteen thirties as today\nPolitical rancor social division and the threat posed by alien ideologies\nSparked widespread unease what is the alien ideology\nOf today\nOf the day or back then I mean the fact that one of the two major parties as a brace democratic socialism is very alien to me yes the the the fear back in the thirties was communism or the ... and the left said no it's fascism\nWell okay um\nI guess I mean it was Adolf Hitler and Mussolini that said that ah FDR is one of us he is a fascist so maybe it was bad but there's more hang on\nAmerican Dream [noise]\nI've never seen a ... or ...

Fox News during a campaign rally in Kentucky Saturday Night President Trump offered condolences the victims of hurricane Michael and also things first responders for their work\nAnd\nWe should fight back we should fight back in the polls we should stand the true and steady we have to speak truth do not forget the things that we were all taught and we all know are true\nTo be civil and kind to one another but we were not at a place where I think you grab a gun\nI won't\nChristians in the age of outrage how to bring our best when the world is at its worst heads that surge just wrote that book welcome to the program ed how are you\nThank you thanks for having me and I think we both wrote books on our rates of a nice time to talk about outrage\nWe did and you have you found the ad that it's not necessarily an understood topic or a popular topic right now to try to do diffuse it or explain what it does to us\nYou know it's interesting I see the word used more than I've ever seen that before in my lifetime you know rage an outrageous in headlines of articles all the time but it's when you go a little deeper and in your case talking about his relationship to addiction or in my case\nTalking about how Christians might engage the age of outrage when I I don't think I think there's a lot of references to it but not a lot of okay what do we do interact I think you\nKnow damn from Georgia who who are fascinating fascinating call and as you've got to walk through that with him he's clearly outraged his response would be very different than yours and I appreciate you responded\nAnd mine and I think ultimately part of the challenges is Dan's response is I mean they just said I'll just say it I'll just say it you know dance response is the way a lot of people feel like I Know they are there's a lot of built up outrage\nThat is and it's it's you know you both on the conservative and liberal side and it's in many ways tearing our country apart from my concern as a Christian leader you know I'm here at the Billy Graham center\nA well my concern is is as Christians how are we going to engage\nIn a world filled with outrage or and when sometimes we're the we're the cause of it sometimes where the targets of it it's it's a mix and I love your\nComments about religious liberty to I mean I I'm I'm deeply concerned about religious liberty or around the world like for you bringing that up bring in that case up and even today but but but again I I see Christians who are outraged about Starbucks cups rather than about persecution around the world\nAnd I think so we got our own issues to deal with but also it's the culture as a whole\nSo tell me because [laughter] and I don't know if you heard last hour when I was talking about ... and that we have this closing window bond Hoffert did not succeed in what he tried to do he'll do he was in the end victorious\nUm but he didn't he didn't change the people because the people had already abandoned their Judeo Christian values they were angry they were outraged and they were they wanted political solution not a spiritual solution uh and uh they they just went for it\nWe have this this window or on our Judeo Christian culture\nAnd our and our underpinnings\nThey're being lost and if we don't get through that window and keep people's hearts opened\nWe're going to go really a rye ...\nAnd I think ultimately this is our moment and you know not every day we don't get to pick the moment we're born or that where you live in two in every generation of space there are challenges\nBut this is our moment in in in the book I sort of go through I have a chart and some stats we have some new statistics in each chapter and I talk about how in many ways a that Judeo Christian a consensus has been lost and now\nThe views of uh you know Christians different groups maybe a better more on the conservative side are now outside in many ways of the mainstream of society where once they were the mainstream and that's kind of lead to an accelerated\nA outrage cycle it's led to everyone's turning up the volume two eleven and ultimately I don't think that's the path and I appreciate what you just said earlier when you're talking to talking to Dan is we've got to um we've got to choose a different way now one of the key things as Christians are consistently choosing a different way\nAnd you know we don't need to be disabled by our cable news network or we don't need to be a shape spiritually by her social media feed\nI think ultimately we need to be shaped as Christians by who Christ is and the Jesus was afraid to stand up I mean he was in the temple and he turned over tables but he also showed this remarkable ability that we can model to to build bridges with people with whom he\nShouldn't even be around they give us American Woman at the well and I think ultimately we need a better path that the answer is not to\nGet like the world the answer for Christians in this age of outrage is to really follow the way of Jesus in to the world and I'm not some you know we don't stand up for things don't I mean when you said\nYour fight but you fight or you know for example or you can't war at a people\nAnd reach people at the same time and so it's a question of how you approach that and we're just we're user title were addicted to outrage right now and I'm and I'm trying to say there's a better way for Christians to to to to do belt we even when they are the targets of the outrage and certainly\nTo not participate in creating photo and false crises and outrage\nWell here's what's interesting to me and I pointed it out last hour if you talk politically were winning I mean look at the Supreme Court ... Brett Kavanaugh I don't know of any president that would have set up for that look what happened with Israel in many ways\nBut you know we're winning it's not they're not forming mobs and going out and and you know ah trying to get into people's face and getting them to react out in anger because they're winning they're doing that because they're desperate\nWe're actually making progress and somehow or another\nWe're just being swept up in their drama\nWell I think people are ... it's kind of weird that appeals to us there's a part of us I think that's why\nA you know we'll find you know some some some crisis on social media\nThat Christians will be very attractive to and then we find out later that wasn't true and it kind of spread around and and you know and and and and I think that's part of the concern what is it in the U.S that draws us to outrage rather than to engage and I think there's a\nThere's a difference between the two and you know I'm some for example I'm someone who is deeply pro life\nAnd he says this I'll watch the pagan priest neglect the poor the hated galleons devote themselves to works of charity goes on and says these are biased galleons empire ... only feed their own poor but I was also welcome them into their adopt by the name of the\nIs the name of the book is Christians in the age of outrage pick it up meat is well worth the Reid\nI get these is on the rise of the thing is\nAnd the consequences can be deadly\nLearn how to keep your kids have come to find\nThree is seven three\nHundred trucks now dot com\nDiscover children's museum oral valley actually sites for kids hero to five years old [noise] children's museum oral valley gives our youngest there's the chance to explore and learning the comfortable still spend three minutes that help build time motor skills\n... reading and jump start their creativity imagination\nChildren's museum or a family in the ... on oracle round the an oral valley dot com for more information\nAnd the American advertising federation present an ad week DC an annual conference for area marketing advertising in communications professional\n[noise]\n\nESPN flush your college football\nOn this year's Avengers brands like Mars National Geographic envy ... box the color in CNN speakers for major\n[noise]\n[noise]\nThe use of mayors terrifying attraction one location designed gave\nTrial will be adamant in one way if you're a member of the marketing and advertising community there's no better place to further your education and\nPutting off a building that dream home\nNow the perfect time to talk with us about a mortgage loan\nMany options considered find you a loan them he writes for\nToday in orange\nTheir claim that come in\nThe lights were on late at night last night at mercury one our mercury one partners are are are are ready to provide aid relief\nTo those who have are going to be affected it is now coming onshore alligator point Florida it is a monster a category for ... I mean boy did this happen fast\nDangerous storm surge the wins the flooding all in the north eastern Gulf Coast a and a lot of people didn't even get out and evacuate because it happened so fast we do have our hurricane relief fund up now we need your help donations\nOr will go directly where they are needed most if you donate directly to the disaster relief fund one hundred percent of the money raised goes to that effort so you can go to mercury one dot org slash hurricane relief\nMercury one slash hurricane relief that mercury one dot org and please a help us so we can have everything that Florida might need there when it is time most likely later today All right pat gray is a joining us from pat gray unleashed\nAnd a pat welcome thank you good to be here yeah it is and what is on your mind today\nDid you ever see the ... the TV show continuing did you watch that yeah I loved it yeah it was a great show yeah it was all about corporations running the world in your twenties Seventy or something yeah\nAnd I you know what I thought it was kind of silly at the time I have mocked Blade Runner and everything yeah corporation ... come on you're all scared of corporations ... that's the one thing the left had right\nThey might yeah they might have had it right in the right way right I mean\nThey really yeah ... voice bad right out of the things that I said by the way I remember when they put the flag with all the corporate logos on it and everything else I always thought oh please give it a rest but it is I mean you could put Amazon Google Facebook on the flag and eh pretty accurate\nYeah we ... we had we now have and those are some that you mentioned we now have companies that are big enough to really fit fit that role I don't know that that they do no not yet but uh Amazon in particular is just getting\nEnormous and I'm In the book the for the hidden DNA of Amazon Apple Facebook and Google\nOr the author talks about just how massive\nAmazon is a for instance far fewer us households have a gun than Amazon Prime thirty percent of sixty four percent holding a more Americans have primed and voted in twenty sixteen only fifty five percent\nI'm more Americans have Amazon Prime then go to church\nA more have Amazon Prime than um than are in a monogamous relationship with us [laughter]\nYou should have said that about more Americans had NBC and CBS and ABC I mean maybe\nBut they're into so many other things to which you know you got to consider\nThat I'm a ... that they're they're into\nEverything else like I think it's fifty five percent of households now we're sixty five percent of households have a Alexa ... or ...\nAnd ... why do\nWe invited that surveillance indoor home if they want to use it that way and I don't know that they are what they are they are recording\nThey are recording the gas yeah recalling it'd be an entirely yeah because\nThey they it needs to a listen but it's also learning it's trying to learn how to communicate\nYes and they're ... they're reporting on our moods are taste all the things we like all the things we want the things we need and our fears and they just report all of that\nBack to a Amazon headquarters or they just gobbled up\nWhole foods right now and when they did kroger's stock when from thirty one dollars a shared a twenty two that's how big this company is wow they're going to be the largest clothing retailer by twenty twenty\nOr they already sell more books than anybody on earth they've driven how many uh book retailers out of business um and they're they're about to spend more on original programming than even Netflix\nOr they're going to be the biggest Hollywood producer [laughter] and just so many things is it time to I mean I don't know what you do about it do you favor as a capitalist breaking up a company that is what they did the Microsoft is what they did to or they try to to Microsoft that's what they did with mountain bell I'm\nYvette mountain bill was in with the government I mean that was that was protected by the government and part of a you know that was that was a protected property you couldn't you couldn't start anything against them right that's why yeah I mean", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "Tucson", "day": "14"}
