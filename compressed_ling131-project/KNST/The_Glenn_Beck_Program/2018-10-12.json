Robert Francis O'Rourke he's an Irishman\nYou mean you know bad oh yeah oh yeah they go oh Ashville most Irish people are called better so you point that out but Robert Francis O'Rourke is running against Ted Cruz some of the polls there's one poll that had him tied at one point\nUm ah ah several polls showed cruise only up by one or two\nNew York times doing something really really interesting in which\nYou know normally you kind of see the ... news well I didn't say that they're doing something interesting in that like normally see polls and you see it like if you think of it as a as a

economy with the tax cuts the deregulation that high unemployment I I'm Still I'm Still really high on the U.S economy I'm Still high on the stock market especially at these low low prices right\nNow so what happened yesterday what what what's the scoop did\nWork good question where I'll scratch your head wondering what it was I mean Donald Trump seems to think it was the fed and there's no question that the fed interest rate hike a and their announcement that they're going to continue to raise interest rates certainly move people out of stocks and bonds because when interest rates rise than\nBonds are more attractive relatively than stocks I'm usually those facts of of a\nFad changes are short term so\nI don't I don't think you're going to see a long term effect from that although I tend to\nAgree with that will Trump that here we've got this blooming economy we used our she real science of inflation although energy prices are rising but you know bother commodities are are pretty stable or or actually falling and price so I don't see a big inflation gain and ... I mean uh you know pick up and what Trump is saying and I think there's some truth to this is\nThe fed and and a ... journal drawn Powell why you take a punch bowl away from this already just when it's getting boring and I tend to I tend to think\nThat he's right about that you know look I don't want inflation but just because the economy is picking up doesn't mean you're going to have more inflation I don't think that that that job is to squash shows a stock market rally and pick up and unemployment is we've seen in record numbers\nYeah I Would I Would tell you Steve and you know I'm an inflation watcher and uh and hyperinflation of leave lesion watcher guy I was I was really concerned with all the repatriated money that was coming in and and the tax break and we haven't seen it\nWe're showing inflation I mean look I Would I ... I have to admit you know I I admit when I'm wrong I'm a I'm a conservative and that's when I'm wrong I'm not wrong all that often but\nI did predict we see higher inflation as a result of you know all the money creation by the fat and the truth is we haven't seen it up by the way one of the reasons for that as we are international trade we have um\nYou know we have like all sorts of technological change that makes goods and services cheaper overtime and that trade and technology are two things that really keep prices down and affordable and so I ... my only point is I just think the fed\nActed preemptively and prematurely and raising rates\nIn in a in a way that wasn't that sort I Am a little concerned by the way I go on about the increase in the price of oil it's gone up to eighty dollars a barrel that's that's like equivalent of four dollar a gallon\nGas by why that's why hasn't gone up like a tax on the economy why is it going to\n\nBe there soon soon are you there yeah maybe I didn't hear what you just said okay why I'm a why did why is oil going up\n[laughter] that's a good question too I it looks like because there's been disruptions in the um [noise] in the middle east with respect Iraq and so you're seeing a big um you know a big sell off as a result I mean a big rise in the price because people are really concerned about the um [noise] you know about the price\nUh in the global reduction in supply as a result\nOf having sex out back online bring Texans back to bring Texas back on line\nWell that's the point you know I look I think\nOil prices are going to fall I just was out in Midland, Texas in the middle of the Permian Basin I've never seen anything like it when I mean I don't know where you go all they're doing is drilling drilling drilling drilling and you know it's it's a anywhere you can stick a stick in the ground there drilling for oil and natural gas so I don't think I don't think we're going to see a continuation you know over the next\nYear or so of these higher prices in fact I think they're going to go back down again so [laughter] you know I think that the\nThe big problem right now it's just here you know that's the stock market is driven by fear in great [laughter] that's a choice for a hundred and fifty years and people are afraid right now that uh and then by the way there was a lot of profit taking I did this myself when the Dow hit twenty six thousand five hundred\nI said to my wife funny let's let's take some of these profits and and get out of the market and I think a lot of people that that\nSteven let me [noise] um let me ask you this I don't know if this is true or this is an old wives' tale but the last president that I heard really take on the fed [laughter]\nWas Ronald Reagan and uh we had Nineteen percent interest rates right shortly after that until you stop talking about the fed when her\nAnd the fed has a lot of control I mean and and you know a lot of people say it's it's it's a\nA you know somehow some kind of a violation for the president the question the fed and I wrote a column on this last week on why\nThe president as his chief executive officer of the country right he's the one who was supposed to help manage our economy if he doesn't think the fed is doing the right thing why shouldn't they speak out\nI'm not look I don't want to see of politicization of the fat correct but I I think there's a lot of one of the lessons we've learned ... new and I've talked about this over the years that these are not some kind of or a falls on high at the fed they act as if they're the temple with all of the knowledge and all of the intelligence\nBut they've made so many mistakes you mentioned I remember the seventies as you do when we had\nLiterally twenty percent mortgage interest rates that was all because of fed mistake in a you know I Would make the same case that the fact that you know what's the one that built up this bubble that led to the housing crisis in two thousand seven and eight I keep thinking these people are somehow like God like\nI don't know [laughter] I don't know let me ask you about the uh the NAFTA replacement\nIt's you know those kinds of things that
