one of the tests you did you did it where you you were clear with an agenda then you added one that might go in the other direction and then you added\nTo search results of that would go in the other direction and you got it to a point to where Google is to where you don't have any idea you're being manipulated\nCorrect absolutely no idea of someone we we did this in a national study in the U.S almost no one was aware\nThat they were seeing biased or a search result search for those that favor one candidate that this really creepy thing there was that the very very few people who could spot Tobias they shifted even farther in the direction of the bias\nSo you know being able to spot the bias does not protect you uh we did a a big national study in India right in the middle of their election there are two thousand fourteen\nNinety nine point five percent of people in the study or could see no bias whatsoever they couldn't see the favoritism\nUh and and and yet we're still getting these big chefs are in their voting preferences so you know this is this is unprecedented in human history this is this is just this is an ability\nTo shift people's thinking and behavior worldwide it's not just in the U.
