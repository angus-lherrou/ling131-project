I Do have the uh the temperament to be on the ... a team however all you know ... I can jump right into that role oh you're dead dogs have that\nThey spent Glen ... teen minutes on this bar fight on CNN this morning Fifteen minutes where they talked about how they look it's it's certainly on its own this is their fairness on its own it would not be disqualifying\nOh really a bar fight in which he's not charged or arrested with anything and his the accusation is he threw ice on someone wouldn't disqualify him forty years later for the Supreme Court said for all the wonderful a room you're giving him what leeway but here's the situation where they're just like\nWell what it what it does say when it does is that it plays into a larger picture up this man he was in his anger\nWhen he was drinking and this shows the he's capable of doing these things\nSo if I Know what I'm saying even reached further I Know if he would have come on and he would not have been angry\nI would've thought something was up\nBecause nobody does that to me my family nobody nobody is going to make those charges and smear my name without me at least responding forcefully and then if you don't\nLike the anger I Want you to hear me clearly\nI did not have sexual relations with that ... thing yeah he looked and they praised him for being angry about it they praised him for his forceful as\nYou can tell the president was angry he wants to get back to the business of the of the American people\nSo no matter what he did it would have been a problem\n[noise]\nThey keep moving the goalposts now here is here's my lead to Donald Trump\nFirst of all\nI don't believe any other president in my lifetime with an exception of Reagan and I'm not even sure Reagan would have done it\nNo other president in my lifetime would have stuck stuck with Kavanaugh all the way through those hearings there's no way they would have said the cost is too high they just wouldn't have done it so a points for\nDonald Trump for having a spine and go and this is garbage\n[noise] be\nWe're in this situation now and if there is nothing if there's ice fights\nDon't give up the ship do not move because if you move now they're going to do this every single time and you cannot cannot\nGive any ground with that being said and I don't think this is a chance at all if Ford\nIs those ... charges turned out to be right you noticed you notice the media is not furthering the Ford and testimony\nThey're no longer on that yeah nobody in my ... she's been abandoned already right she's done she's done she served her purpose she bought time they used her as a pivot to something new\nOkay so there there there's nothing new there there is nothing new or the press would be saying do you watch what's going to come out and this FBI they're not saying that they're not nobody has come out and said you know what I was so offended by how forceful he was\nAnd I wasn't going to say anything but I Know that that happened none of that is happening\nWhat is happening is people are saying you know I was for him and I wasn't going to say anything but in [laughter] you know as soon as he started to say he was he was an altar boy\n[noise] I remember him drinking so that's what's coming now and they're going to go after perjury\nYou watch that's by the end of the week that's what they'll be talking about\n\nIf Donald Trump please please Donald Trump the only chance you have and the only chance the Republicans have if this thing goes awry in any way\nYou have to have a plan and announce it in the same press conference that you say you know he\nHe you know quit or vote went down all went down in ... or an down whatever it is whatever it is whatever it is that press conference you must say and here's my next nominee and we're going to have it done before the\nElection now the old in my opinion the only one\nThat can stand that is likely because you don't need how long did they do take to do to the ... sessions ah ah\nAh I mean he was he brought in January ... he was inaugurated and then a February eighty was the ... went down so let it for weeks and three or four weeks we're not we're going to probably go to a fast rate other things going on\nGay so you have four weeks to do it that's what you have now for the election you have four weeks\nThe one who can get that the the one who doesn't need all the FBI checks and all of that is likely\nIt's already been done he's the only under get done quickly yeah he's the only one that can be done that quickly or another Senator Mike Lee is the guy and Michael is the only senator on the list\nShe so so you've got you've got Mike ... you could select Tim let's just say Brett Kavanaugh's hit by a plane tomorrow which\nCar wouldn't strange accident but it could happen and it happened in Indiana Jones a and and and ... one of them are the guy would they were fighting on the ... yeah I was trying to run it bad happens to Kevin well this one they won't be delivering the arc in that plane there'll be delivering or the New York times by plane but anyway so let's just say\nAnd it makes him and his opposite ...\nUh you need to announce that Mike Lee is the candidate we're going to have this done by the election there of course going to go crazy because Mike Lee is ... ... pro life uh and he would vote\nFor him in the bottom line is he cares about the constitution anything I mean you will vote he will vote the constitution and he will also vote for a ride of life he's not going to go in there with an agenda but he is a right to life guy so Kevin wasn't good enough here's

I did not everybody reads that fast so [laughter] so it's been out for a week now and if you've read it or let's talk about it on because there's a there's a ton a ton\nIn there I I think it explains so much about what we're seeing with the cabinet case right now I think it's\nI think it's absolutely in line with the cat was like well it's amazing because I think a lot of people if you're trying to look at it and you're in you're just playing team a lot of people would just be like the Democrats are the worst in there and saying but I mean I Know people who are are Democrats\nAnd they sound completely insane about this happened I think yeah completely off the rocker these are people that I Know people who I'm friendly with and\nThe extent that they'll go to here to try to take all male crime ... in in the last twenty five years and apply it to this one guy where there's no evidence that he committed any sort of crime\nAnd that sort of jump is not it's not just hey they want to stop this or hey they want to protect roe versus Wade there is a different part of this it's about throwing the\nEntire um the entire effort of logic off base it's based in post modernism huh it's explained in the book and and you'll see a lot of times I look at it sound like I don't understand what are they doing why are they saying these things just does it make any sense and it's easy political explanations for all that but it's not real\nThe real basics of it the foundation of why there why are they attacking this in this way is all in the book\nI mean that it's I Wish I could I Wish Kavanaugh would have happened while I was writing the book because I think it is the perfect example\nMaybe we should do that tomorrow maybe we should take the book the theories of the book and just show exactly why everything is happening point by point yeah uh you can find it in the book addicted outrage and the the most important part is it educates you and shows you how the other side is fighting\nAnd why you must not fight that way\nA and the reason why is because they are trying to create chaos and I don't mean your neighbor who's a Democrat I mean I mean the people who are at the university levels uh and the the upper echelons of politics they know what's going on they don't they do not believe\nWhat they're saying they're doing it because they have a goal and their goal is to disrupt the hierarchy and the patriarchy\nAnd to collapse the system that\nWe have yeah and you feel like you've ever had someone who has an addiction problem in her life ... you see them acting or radically and there's some reason and you don't understand why would they do this they blew their job why they did is they blew their marriage all those things why would the left act this way about this thing\nAnd it ... you know if you know why they're doing it and if you're not just dismissing it as typical politics\nYou can fight against it much more effectively and you know you spend a lot of time in the book going through not just how how and why this is going on but how to push back against that and how to defeat it yeah\nIt is not a a it's not a book about surrender it is a book about stand and fight just fight the right way\nJust know who your enemy is the tactics that they're using and fight the right way it's called addicted to outrage we'll talk about it on Thursday with

right now we have a background check Trump is just a okay the expansion of the FBI background check on Capitol yang\nI'm so we have that going for us uh and they were really I mean let's be honest it's important\nThat someone who is going to be wielding a lot of power especially where the law is concerned oh yeah we we look at every single accusation because the worst thing that could happen is you know he gets in and he's a judge and he is you know looking at some case before him\nAnd he himself was a serial\nRapist Oh thank you that's a very important it's so important is very important if you're abusive to women you should certainly not hold the role that really closely to law enforcement doesn't make any sense right right right like judge\nOr a or a or a\nGeneral general attorney general would be a good one yeah yeah that's a great point and I'm Glad you brought that up because there's cause for certain candidates or who's running for Minnesota attorney general really who's been a a credibly accused a by a woman a he was dating now there's an interesting there's a little bit of a separation and we should be fair\nAnd this ... there's a separation between the cabinet case in the aisles the case of the cabinet case happens uh thirty six years ago by the also the case was pretty much ongoing until very recently okay okay All right so there's a difference but that's the one difference ... a professor Ford she had a spotty memory\nIssued a very spotty memory now the uh the accuser um who we know now remember with Ford we have no even sense that there was a relationship of any sort of between ... and Kavanaugh right we do know that a long term girlfriend of Keith Ellison has accused him of sexual abuse\nOr ... violin okay oh okay that I got both of those so there are a little do you remember where they happen or you know she does remember when they happen okay does\nWhat did she ... she probably doesn't have notes from her doctor ... you know from the when she was talking to her doctor when the doctor gets it wrong of course\nWell yeah well in their words case they both have a notes from there do they do around those cases are the the forward case was something that was a Thirty years after the incident in which he referred to an attack by four people which is different than the story that she's telling now and never named Kavanaugh\nThe notes from ah the ah Alison teeth Alison I'm a former girlfriend a doctor do name Keith Ellison as the reason why she's getting medical attention for physical injuries huh um and that kind of a difference to you might you might notice a slight distinction between those two things\nOne has notes or the don't ask don't actually named the accuser and it was you know many many many many many many years before and this was I going to the doctor to get medical treatment because this guy you they'll\nUsually leading me yeah and so she and you know and and one one one case you have a woman who has photos\nOf the incident and has photos of bruising on her the other one of course does not um being forward she doesn't have that now there are there's a witness situation we need to deal with though of course I'm a Ford has name several people who were at the parties\nNone of them can remember it happening that people forward named\nCannot say that they were actually at the party some of them have said I was not there some of them said I don't remember any party like that so there's a wide wide berth there between two opinions but she has named witnesses just none of them have corroborated her story in any way\nOr the dolphins a girlfriend has also a named sources those people say the exact same thing and say they've seen evidence of the actual a crime going down um including things like tax um writings um the pictures and are those are things that\nShe showed two co workers in real time\nReal time and had several people she told about it at the moment and again we have no one that forward told about it at the moment in fact in any moment of until at least two thousand twelve where it does not appear she actually he had like who Kavanaugh said the name Kavanaugh even at that\nTime yeah but ... and I mean you I mean you don't have videotape well there was a videotape\nNow we haven't seen it yet though uh-huh now there is allegedly videotape that exist some one of these physical altercation we ... we have not seen it yet I'm of course there's no video of the calving off thing because you know that wouldn't be the thing that we have to take her word that there is video with the\nWith the ... and we don't have that evidence yeah I mean we have a a a ton of evidence and in fact\nI don't know hundreds of times more there's really no evidence in the forties so we I mean like we have them out more we have a preponderance of evidence in in the Ellison case do however", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "Tucson", "day": "03"}
