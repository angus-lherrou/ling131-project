anybody behind bars did he have did he ran out anybody that in the end of the government get anything\nThat's open to debate about the Boston Globe would tell you that yes yes he was a wonderful informing him that they broke the story but there's evidence to suggest that it was a it was a raider cover for just protecting Whitey because with the uh a\nFederal authorities trying to crack down on the mob or the Italian Mafia or any hit on the mafia would have to run through a ... winter hill gang and some people feel and claim and there was strong evidence to suggest that the informing part\nWas just the cover and really they were allowing Whitey the live so that the then head of the strike force in New England to bring down the Italian Mafia a guy named Jeremiah Tio cell of it\nI was looking for a little quid pro quo like hey Whitey we'll let you do your thing as long as you make sure the ... the mob doesn't you know\nKill me ah because there were incidence of lawyers and prosecutors are getting killed in retaliation for bringing down the mob so you know a lot of those allegations have not been proven but his real connection\nTo the information that he gave as being actually great invalid and information is is to me one of the myth of this case uh you know we we did much longer\nTime period to really discuss it but the documentary kinda delves into the how much free reign the guy was given and again if you're an informant for the government\nIt doesn't mean you can go and commit crimes that means you're working hand in hand with the government in exchange for some benefit like a ... like not being prosecuted or a lesser sense it doesn't mean oh\nPlease go out and Rob kills steel and maim people and there were there have been several civil suits brought against ah the department of justice that have not gone and the families a direction\nAnd so there's a lot of there's still a lot of bitter feelings amongst the people who were who were victims of Bulger's crimes some of them were you know criminals themselves but that doesn't that doesn't mean\nIt's still a man or the end doesn't justify the means arrive for this guy for a quarter century uh was allowed to just kill with impunity I mean he was tipped off in advance\nA about wiretaps he was tipped off in advance about potential rates are so it's really a complicated and in fact some people believe that\nThe sixteen years he was on the lam living in an apartment in Santa Monica with his girlfriend Catherine Greek uh there there are many including myself who believe that the government really wasn't looking very hard for him until a new\nRegime came in and then after sixteen years they decided to bring him to justice and and there was a trial in the summer of twenty Thirteen\nSo let's talk a little bit about the first myth you talked about that he was known as a you know a good guy in the neighborhood isn't that yeah I mean this is my impression and maybe I'm wrong in this isn't that kind of the thing with you know Al Capone tried to do\nThat and you know people like to think that I don't know these guys are just you know they're whacking just the bad guys there actually good family man you know and there was a day when you would kill a man and then you'd send his wife flowers\nYeah is that any of that through\nA ... that that seems to be the case that ah you know he also did some very good things as well you know for at times but for for some people um and also for example there was a big bussing crisis in South Boston you know a there was an attempt to a desegregate\nAnd there was a a bussing order issued and Whitey actually was very vociferous ... you know in campaigning against it and that kind of rallied south Boston residents a ... to him um\nHe was a good guy but because I mean that helped create cover for him and then he'll\nYeah exactly and his brother was a famous politician so there was a large\nUsing there as well you know with a ... you know build Bolger president of the University of Massachusetts in a prominent politician I'm so there was a lot of messy gray areas there with the balls\nAre so how did he was he involved was he just the guy saying yay whack him or was he involved in the killings\nOh he he took pleasure [laughter] and and being involved in the killings and you know his his signature because back then there was no DNA evidence his signature was removing teeth of his victims um you know uh\nSo that they couldn't be identified but no no he was a it was a willing and ruthless participant in some very grisly murders\nAnd there was a there was a there was a a\nNeighborhood house that they had called the haunting where a number of these victims were buried in the in the dirt basement of of the actual house that they used as a meeting place\nSo there's ... there's just sell a\n\nLot of grisly details with with this case but uh I mean the real for me the fascinating thing is after sixteen years\nOn the lam they finally caught him in Santa Monica living quiet you know living a a quiet a life a retirees life you know he had a ... almost nine hundred thousand dollars in cash and stuck in the walls and the coterie of a\nMachine guns and weapons but living a just a quiet life and when he's finally\nCaught and brought back to Boston for trial you know he offered to plead guilty in exchange for this is another\nI've been looking at some of the notices and these are some of the things that have been left out you know he offered to plead\nGuilty if they would take it easy on his girlfriend has you know who is living girlfriend Catherine Greek who joined him for the sixteen years of being on the run or on and off you know he ... he was willing to plead guilty if they would take it easy on her and give her some very light treatment a and the\nGovernment refused and you have to ask yourself why why did we go through a multimillion dollar\nTrial a four Whitey Bolger when the ... you know the the\nThe conclusion was foregone at the smarter than trial nobody thought\nHe would be found not guilty I mean the evidence was just overwhelming um and it probably would have saved the state uh quite a bit of money\nTo not try him but but ah they didn't take it easy on um um how they catch him up and how they catch him\nA there what is it you know they decided to focus on the girlfriend and they play some advertisements a and a woman you know noticed ah not Whitey but the girlfriend and called it in and got a nice reward for that\nSo we have slowly prosecuted the woman who turned him in\nA well no no no no not the woman who turned\nOh another okay another woman did not the girlfriend another woman current event okay okay okay now I'm he was killed yesterday I never I mean I besides Dr seuss I didn't know who would come up with a lock in a sock\nA buddy apparently was was killed by a guy they think is what are they I should say is there is a guy in prison who was a mob hit man\nWho they think killed him they know he was a mob hit man I'm who would was everybody against this guy was he marked for death as soon as they could kill him\nA well look I don't I don't have the details of yesterday and it's you know it's hard to say but you know he is responsible for helping\nOr you know bring down the Italian Mafia so you would imagine that uh there would be people who would be out for his his death or and you have to question you know the\nThe security and I you know it's still unclear to me I'm Still trying to get some information as to why he was being moved that why the multiple moves and why the lack of security\nOr you know some people are speculating that this was a purposeful move uh I I Can't say that but um you know a guy who's involved in multiple murders over decades and involved in bringing down the mafia or you know with ... with you know be a target\nWe're we're talking to a job earlier he is the director of why the United states of America versus James James Bulger who's the you know Whitey I'm and I'm I guess what was it that it ... due to the story why why did you make the film and what did you what attracted you to it and what did you take away from it\nYeah I mean I thought that ah you know Bolger finally bringing being brought to trial because there's there's such a myth about the guy there's such folklore [noise] you know in our society ... unfortunately we tend to glamorize Lake Erie\nGet ideas get involved and going and let's move down go\nLet's move that the only be a message from USDA ha just council\nFlorida burger chain thing

videos my town Tennessee not counting\n[noise] you're listening to ... [noise]\nWell next week is the election students got some election by the numbers coming up for us in just a minute but we want to do ah we wanted to introduce you to somebody in Mississippi that is I think a great state senator Chris McDaniel he is running for US Senate or however it is a different kind of system in Mississippi this is a\nThree way race or I don't know how many people are actually involved but the top two are are going to have to have a run off again so uh he just needs to make it into the top two and he could be the next Senate\nAh or senator for the United states out of Mississippi I'm as a state senator since two thousand eight he has written in sponsored a ton of legislation in Mississippi she has a fought for private property rights restrict the use of eminent domain\nThe student religious liberties act he authored and passed into law to protect the rights of students to pray in school\nHe introduced the firearms freedom Protection Act to protect against federal encroachment on Second Amendment rights fought against government paternal isn't by sponsoring legislation to allow citizens opt out requirements to provide personal private information in the use of a government a database he is now running for the Senate\nIn Mississippi his name is Chris McDaniel welcome to program Chris\nThank you glad I appreciate it's good to be here\nGood so so tell me what why people should vote for you in in Mississippi\nWell I'm the only lifetime Republican in this race the only conservative in this race my record demonstrates that I've been fighting these fights my entire life you might remember back its way fourteen we ran it gets that or if the cockpit and he was forty when your income but if we defeated in the first night with forty nine point seven percent of the vote\nA heat then recruits forty thousand Democrats to come back to a GOP primary and they beat us about one percent going down the stretch where it back in that said five this was the seat we feel like we rightfully one twenty four teams the establishment stole\nThis seat and now we walked the seat back on the conservative and I'm ready to fight Washington DC so\nWhat does it mean to be a conservative now Chris\nWell from my perspective that made the same thing that always says I'm a cow Jeffersonian a Reagan Goldwater conservative and what that basis whereas we demand limited government we demand individual responsibility we demand liberty we have to trend toward liberty and everything that we do\nAt some point along the way this country we advocated average ... government we gave it over to the federal government is counter week claim that uh forty so in everything that we do or empowering individual not the collective we're putting people on pedestals not politician that's what it means to conserve\nIt All right so tell me tell me is a few things where you stand what'd you think of um I'm Kevin uh [noise]\nI like that I feel like I used by the Democrats are probably should have been confirmed what sort of any what the evidence that I saw a what's not substantiate it was absolutely no proof that he committed any act if\nThat's the case or drive through
