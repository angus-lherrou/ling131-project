E. V. I. N. for Hillsdale dot com that's living for Hillsdale dot com [noise] alright\nClaudio Rockford, Illinois the great W are okay go\nThen to live and how are you okay thank you I'm a ... a lot of a lot of the topics\nAnd points that you make our our\nTypical ingredients of what\nTaking place in the destruction of Europe\nFortunately we in the U.S are just mere in that image and I I Believe that uh that what we're seeing happen in this country is just a um\n[noise] it just what they're seeing taking place in Europe as far as the the uh what they call them you know that they're there Mike when they're um uh people coming from the Syria ban and all these regions that are going through wars and\nUh we have a needed that is destroying everything and has their opinion and agenda down and they have in Europe that you which people that are wearing with but not appointed by anybody they're dictating what's going on\nAnd I find very interesting a fight and I like I can share on the air with you\nWhile let's not but the you make you make some interesting points there and um\nAnd you're probably not aware of this but you're quite right in this to this extent the progressive movement or reaches to its philosopher kings in your roof so and ... and marks and ... among others\nAnd also you know in in certain respects the signing of this nation reaches back into your\nUh to lock and monitor skew in Sydney and in others but also of course Harris bottle and says real but but the point is these are really two different ways of looking at humanity\nOne looks that humanity one individual at a time that's where we come from you on a one individual at a time individuals have merit individuals have value individuals have words their God given God given God created\nAnd then there's another view which is to look at the whole the community\nAnd if people are stepping out and they're not doing what they are expected to do for the better good\nWell then those people need to be addressed and dealt with\nAnd of course what happens here is a relative handful of individuals when compared to the overall population determine what is good for the community whether it's good for the community or not and this is where you get in trouble you get into these bears ideologies and theories and obstructions\nIn which I'm a a relative handful of individuals seek to impose their will on all of society\nAnd to destroy manage nature\nAnd so the individual is only as good as the individual is willing to surrender his or her individuality to the greater good of the state because conformity and uniformity our priorities their primary\nNow are viewed as and view it that way conformity in uniform me that's not the priority is much liberty for an individual as possible and in order to society and amoral ordered society that's our model\nAnd so you want in in addition to that an economic system that is competitive that his market oriented that is relatively voluntary and so forth and so on as opposed to this constant central is Asian the government\nPower uh but that is essentially seized by an elected individuals and they will that has imposed on you rather than exercising your own will you can see this now your point on the immigration from\nThe vast majority of Americans don't want what's\nTaking place on the southern border the vast majority of Americans do want the southern border security even those who are fairly liberal and the issue of immigration but\nYou have a political party and leadership and a political party that believes it must change the population it must change the electorate it must change the citizenry in order to have as close as possible a permanent hold on power\nAnd that's exactly what's taking place here that's what Merkel did in Germany that's what's taking place and the people don't have a right to come to the United states of America they don't have a right to come here at all they're not even covered by our constitution\nIt's the people in this country who have rights and have the right to make these determination\nAnd so uh I agree with you to that extent that\nWhat's happened here on the American left as they've taken the European left the progressive left both of which are ...\nOf haggling marks and angles and the and the Russo and others are and that's the that's the road they've taken as opposed to the road we've taken which is the light meant the embrace of western civilization and those sorts of things\nThat's my round about kind of process or your way of agreeing with you All right Claudio

Fox News [noise]\nFrom the region will studio your local area region will dot com is saying is the use of annoying and I are radio station [noise]\nMore devices town ... Fox News the total now seven the FBI confirming a second\nGender is in it started as free floating nebulous ... that that is completely divorced from biology\nBut it very much um linked to biology and anatomy and Ninety nine percent of that are biological that is our gender and of course that's not the case with everybody but the vast majority by that is the case and and I don't think there's anything wrong with thing that\nSo so wait a minute so so hang on but\nThe times article was saying is that gender happens and I am willing to go back to the you know a definition male born this way female born this way you want to say gender is male or female specific but I'm also willing to say OK gender is this\nThe traits but it is not to biological and we will they go that far however ... ... what what's happening here is um they're they're taking away sex and tying it to gender\nAnd so why would we have why would we have male and female sex if it's all gender if it means the same if it means the same thing it doesn't talk about parades\nThe other part is isn't that gender ... if it is all happening in your head then that's\nJust for you is it not\nA failure saying well I think now a days people tend to use the word gender across the board one because they don't want to use the word sex maybe that makes them uncomfortable but I think also from an ideological perspective it makes it easier for people to argue that you can identify it whatever you want because it's a little bit trickier\nI think most people still have that common sense to know that biological sex is immutable\nOh to argue for say something like transgender rights it becomes helpful for them to say well maybe it's not about ... biology it's about gender which is you know they say it's a social construct or whatever which isn't but it makes it a little bit easier to argue that okay someone to weigh someone's field may not necessarily be linked\nTo their biology so I'm not sure if that really speaks to the point you're making\nSo but it was can you explain what gender does for is\nRight so it's the feeling that someone feels more in alignment with the opposite sex than their purses sack someone with a born male but they will feel more as though they fit in the female role\nOkay how has gender just for a a been embraced is gender just for you a good thing or a bad thing\n...\nI I think it's seen as I don't think it should be seen are good as good or bad I think it's a medical condition and I think people who are suffering should be able to have access to care\nAnd I think adults should be allowed to transition if that's the team the best approach for them but I think nowadays it's kinda glamorize and seen as something that is really\nUm almost\nPrefer it and I would say preferred in society but it's almost like stand up positive thing especially among progressive people\nSo but he but here's my ears would point the isn't um isn't anorexia form a of of physical this more field but you see your body as fat even though you're sixty pounds is it that this for you\nRight true the thing that gender thus far it is it does have biological correlate so this is a thing I find very confusing about the whole transgender movement is that you know some people argue that biology has nothing to do with it other people argue that it is strongly biological I Would think that proponents of this movement would want to\nBe in alignment with the science that does showed a biological doesn't that adds some sort of\nSolidity I guess what they're saying because\nIt has to do with hormonal exposure in utero so I'm an example I can get that say girls who are exposed to a higher level of testosterone into ... so higher levels of exposure to testosterone is associated with more male typical interest\nAnd behaviors some girls who were exposed to higher levels of testosterone when they're born there more male typical in their behavior they're all the more likely to watch how the male gender identity\nSo it's based on the biological influence even though people want to say that gender is complete the devil is their first from that\nSo I I guess one of the things as I was reading the story a darker so is is that there is a it's almost like we're talking about two different things you know what we were\nIf what gender is he's a feeling\nThat is an interesting thing for people like you to to research on it and even even if it's a biological feeling that well yeah we sure\nUm but it's not necessarily of interest on a on a form you know that you're turning into the government right I mean like that but it's a it's a different I mean maybe in certain circumstances but why the government is asking for this information is not necessarily about someone's feelings\nOr it's about it's about a a physical characteristic that they hold\nSo I mean is it just it\nIs it just basically the gender doesn't mean what it used to mean are they are they using gender to say this is a feeling and therefore we should almost come up with a different word for what ... what I'm describing and what we've talked about this entire time has nothing to do with feeling it's male or female it's about yeah it's about physical characteristics what does the word for that\nAs to what you mean I think from the perspective of what the administration is trying to do I think they shouldn't be allowed to collect that information that information and those data\nWithout it being such a controversial issue on and you know with regards to protecting title nine and and women's rights I I don't know why people don't see it from that perspective that this is a positive thing because\nShouldn't that be seen as helping women right um and it kinda does boil down to this larger argument that's going on right now about\nPeople who are born female versus the rights of transgender women and our transgender women\nWomen full stop and so there is this argument going on\nI don't know if if he if you've been following this but with um it's been mostly radical feminist I wouldn't consider myself a radical feminist but you know this group of very progressive women who are saying transgender women are not as saying that people who are born female so it ... in this argument\nTransgender activists have been winning so far and we see that in terms of how this narrative has played out with the recent decision\nBut in terms of what you're saying I I I I see what you're saying and I guess I'm using\nDifferent words to kind of mean the same thing in that yes for people who are male or female\nThat gender is basically ... it is at the end the day the same thing but nowadays genders being used in a different way to kind of argue for more progressive idea that you can do whatever you want\nTo and I'm not a saint ... that's\n... that's not that I'm not completely insane in in the belief that gender used to me you know right like this or do I mean that would be making this word and making it mean feelings instead of what it used to mean which was biological gender and treats\nRight and that that's why in addition spread through this\nLarger idea that genders spectrum because if you feel a certain way on one day and you feel differently on another day that must mean that your gender must be something unrelated to a sex which is ...\nSo more and more follow up on this is just as the New York times says identity comes from the gender identity comes from the brain not the body that originates between your ears than not between your legs\nThe fed is accurate and then as a defense of the transgender argument right it's not it's not a criticism of it it's just it's a defense of it if that is true and it's in your brain and not between your legs why or their physical surgeries associated with being transgendered\nRight I mean that argument doesn't really make much sense and I I don't like the argument because it's not really accurate either because what's\nBetween your legs and what goes on your brain is linked show you can't really separate the two and treat them like they're completely different phenomena um but there I mean there's a lot of the of aspects of this argument at that don't make sense I mean transgender activists will also say that gender\nIs a social construct but if that's the case why do you then made hormonal\nIntervention is transition or just feel more in line that was\nThe the fact that you identify as so I guess my biggest gripes on this whole thing is that you know sex is\nAbout being male or female gender it's how you feel in relation to your sex but again as I said for the vast majority of us are biological logical sex does dictate our gender so I don't think the three of us are necessarily that you know the things that differently even though I'm using different terms to describe it\nBut if you really the difficulty in politically incorrect question um if if if\nThe ... for instance is we we say that it's bad to be anorexic because you were seeing your body and the way that is not reality and it's a dangerous it doesn't it's not a healthy the outlook\nUm we see the stats of people who have gender ...\nFelt feel felt the feelings are interesting you can cover them you can be interested in that we all\nLook at ... watch out for each other ... like we can try to guard them if we wish however it's completely separate than a scientific fact her feeling is a feeling it's not\nFact and that's fine\nThat's fine but you can't disengage from facts Mm\nAgree disagree it

happen in the mid term elections story from election night twenty sixteen and Trump impact on the Republican Party with a wall built and more of an interview with CBS up now at ... dot com [noise]\n[noise] you're on the Glenn Beck program it's been about three or four hours yesterday with Sean\nSpicer and it's a fascinating guy fascinating guy yeah certainly has an amazing life experience you have a couple of years yeah he's a guy who has a perspective not necessarily\nJust another opinion everybody's got opinions everybody has to arm pits too and I don't necessarily want to smell yours I'm a ... perspective really that matters a and he has a really interesting perspective from what he what he has gone through\nA and um\nI did a pod cast with what's come out a couple of weeks and then we we had him on the news and why it matters um and he was actually very positive or about this this upcoming election for the Republicans if people turn out to vote he was and uh\nYou know it there was an interesting thing that's been going on and we've seen some positive trends are Republicans baseball's a there's a theory out there which is\nA is a competing theory or as to what's going to happen with the election we're about two weeks away people are voting right now though I think up to seven million people nationwide ever voted at a as of yesterday I Believe is the number so voting I mean this is election day you're in the middle of it right now\nUh this is now we have two week long election base that's just the way the world is um and it's interesting the idea that's been floated by people who want to give the Democrats shot at the Senate a better shot at the house\nIs there ... there was evidence of a cabin up bump\nHowever that's not going to carry you to the election and we saw real improvement for the you know in the Senate for Republicans after Kavanaugh which of course is the exact opposite of white stuck right like I mean Democrats did this to hurt Republicans actually seemed to help them and that I think is pretty well established in the polling so far\nThe idea is and and there's some basis for this thing happening\nIs you get the bump from Kavanaugh but it's not too far away from the election and doesn't help you a good example of of this exact phenomenon playing itself out if this is true would be the Access Hollywood tape\nAccess Hollywood tape came out in early October ... um Trump's polls plummeted ... Hillary's went up that she opened up a very large lead and that lead\nTrickled down down down down down until the ... the very end they went from about eight or nine points right after that tape all the way down to about two two and a half points which is where the national polls ended up with Clinton up about two two and a half points about um so\nThe idea here is Kavanaugh gives them this nice Bob and then it fate before the election and the Democrats are able at the last second to cross the finish line ahead there you know some of the polling is is somewhat interesting on this if you look at a recent polling um that came out with the most recent poll\nFrom um the cruise O'Rourke\nA race now ... there's been a couple of polls taken over the past week or so that have put Cruz only up four or five\nOr there was holding their was seven and nine and ten and twelve point leads for cruise\nThe past few polls have been more like four and five point lead for starting to turn the other way which is the last thing you want if tightening up and that was one of the arguments are Sean Spicer was making ashtrays really gotta watch the trends which where these things are going now I think there was evidence\nYou know there is evidence I think that uh you know the pictures mix we don't know this is one race there was some polling data that showed in Florida as well a pretty decent pulling for Democrats in the Senate that came out yesterday with Nelson up by for\n... uh there was a you know but I'm the same plane though I mean Menendez of New Jersey\nNow again once again look vulnerable after it seemed like he had reopen up a lead and maybe he would cruise to the finish line he's now only up by three and a poll that just came out\nAnd you know you never you could fool yourself as a Republican thinking could win a lot of New Jersey racist but it does I'm Chris Christie was governor there for two terms it does occasionally happen\nOr imminent just it's a terrible candidate who you know quite quite likely was paying underage prostitutes for sex\nHe was able to convince over language ah ah well yeah you can judge whether you think that's a good or bad today but it seemed like it occurred ah so I didn't polling pretty mixed right now there was another\nFall by the way that you know um some polls are showing that Cruz over race even tighter so I don't know I mean it it was interesting to hear Sean Spicer talked about it because Spicer as you would know is you know it was the original spokesperson\nHi Jerry Lewis I talked to Larry Schweikert the best in the business of looking at voting results and you know what he sees possibly a red wave interviews ... dot com oh\n\nFrom\nOne winner in the uh in the lottery one winner at one point is it six or for one point one point six billion dollars six billion\nDollars that arise oh a lot of times it rises on the last minute but it was at least one billion ... the biggest lottery award in history going to one person in South Carolina\nSo you're getting probably nine hundred if you take it all in one lump yes ... you know it's nine hundred and something million nine Thirteen I think it is and how much do you get if you take it yearly believe it's twenty two point six million dollars for every year yeah\nA Thirty Years' so twenty forty five\nCan I tell you something I normally say take the money and run\nAnd I would take the money or if it were me I Would take the money and run because I don't know if anything's going to sit around for twenty more here has gone to jail because what could happen in Twenty years yeah I'm however twenty two million dollars\nA year you're live in white\nLarge and I will say to actually has a ... ah I'm noticing Thursday no to the top of this was his originally written for a previous story they've just updated it to hit so the twenty two point six million was on a seven hundred million dollar jackpot so we are talking more than double that you're probably about close to about fifty million per year ... who are ... you're ...\nYou're fine yeah take the ... it's funny hasn't the advice always been you\nYou're an idiot if you take the anybody yes I'm this article goes through a and analyzes it and talks about how the tax benefits are there for you to take the annuity\nUm you're going to get a return that you can't necessarily get into bank account from the anybody and that's pre tax and ... ... if you build your only built one ... right and you know they actually pointed out to ... this is actually pretty funny article of this leads us to the biggest advantage of the annuity protecting you from yourself\nAgain I don't know all about you but I Do know you buy lottery tickets so let's consider the possibility that you were not one of your generation decreed financial mine's um uh and it goes on to say the other thing is\nUh you will have an excuse to not give every single person who comes up to you money 'cause you don't get it all at once so instead of having a billion dollars in\nThe alien dollars a year is that tax free [noise] uh I have to pay taxes on the fifty million dollars to pay taxes on it [noise] well a cat only twenty five million right again and but I mean for you know\nThere is at least some limit right like I Am going to get more next year but I did just by a fancy house in a fancy car and this I gave money to this person and like you're gonna have\nTo wait twenty five million dollars a year after taxes you are living large yeah\nThat's that's a cross the line where you're you're basically doing anything you want but exception of by multiple private jets and like that super duper high end stuff you're not you know you're not going to get\nYou you probably could if you've got fifty\nMillion dollars a year income and you could certainly do it yeah but I mean you're not buying you can't pay for them in cash and you know but you wouldn't want to have you have a guaranteed Twenty years of fifty million dollars why paying cash\nYeah I mean it seems to any bank is going to give you the low\nIt just feels weird to pay someone interest on anything when you're in that financial position but yeah I guess you could certainly get it what do you care\nUh it's not going to be all that much I guess in the grand scheme of things about congratulations to uh whoever our South Carolina listener um who we of course made that incredible deal with to get a I remember a stable each of them when they win and it just running as a as a nice thank you ... for our you know\nDoing the show all these years

have said it to her and I said it to a lot of my ah those on on the other side and and they don't respond they just uh uh they just look at you I mean and and it's a shame and and the fact the matter is a a I guess they don't want to remember it but I Will tell you this or that that baseball\nOr incident I travel all over the country and of course as you said earlier news cycle goes quick but there's still people remember and come up to and Sam praying for you congressman I remember I was on that morning when I heard about it uh it it was a ... it was a moment that I don't think it's going to leave when the ... when it's a it's a moment that shows\nThough how low we've gone\nBut when you mentioned it to to Maxine you mentioned it to\nSome of the others they had no response\nAt all and uh they just moved on they just moved on we were just lucky or whatever and I'm a it's a it's a bad bad environment it's all generated I Believe from the dislike of this president Bangor Maine rent rather the president failed in the country six eight\n... what do you say to people who would say well he's engaging in the same kind of ...\nI mean I hear that too and and I guess I could say there's some things probably I don't agree with we all need to dial it down but\nAh I ah I I it's not right and and and and we just need to ... it's it's just the land it's hard to say everybody in their heart needs to look at what we're going through right now it's not getting any better it's not getting more civil aides who can do more to the other side\nAnd uh you know I I guess I Would say in my world it started at a baseball field and I know who started that and what it wasn't it wasn't that it wouldn't have a a conservative on Republican shot start\nYou know right before the civil war um some there was a beat and with a cane by a by a a\nA a congressman and the will of the Senate\nAnd uh he almost died nobody they didn't they didn't even arrest the congressmen nobody said anything about it uh and in fact they they made little they took the pieces of wood and made little Keynes\nAnd they wore them around their neck\nAs a as a badge of honor that you know don't mess with our party cars will beat you to death\nMhm uh I mean I I when I read that years ago I thought well we're a long way from civil war but I'm not sure we are that far from that kind of barbarism\nWell unfortunately instead of using canes we're using guns right now and uh you know I mean to go to a restaurant with your family and be yelled at to get on an airplane to go back to D.C her to come home
