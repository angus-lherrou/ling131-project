would be funny\nAgain there's no chance these bombs would go off\nSo maybe it's a kid maybe it's a guy who's so screwed up he just doesn't even know what he's doing\nThere's also the possibility someone knew exactly what they were doing and wanted to send a message one way or the other\n\nThis however is not stopping the left from jumping on this I mean you never let a crisis go to waste by noon yesterday we hadn't even found all the bombs by noon yesterday Paul Waldman of the Washington Post already had an article out blaming Donald Trump quote\nGiven what Trump has done and said this was absolutely predictable in fact it's all wonder that it took this long\nIt's not just that Trump advocates violence against his political opponents\nLow he does it's everything about his rhetoric that pushes his supporters in that direction\nYou know what this coming from the same guy that if it is ever found out that it is a left wing guy or just a crazy person they will never report that could I ask when the president has actually called for violence\n\nNow you could say in a some of his campaign rallies where he's like rough 'em up okay I'll give you that\n\nCalling the media fake news is not calling for violence I don't like it but that's not calling for violence encouraging your electric to the electorate to harass people in their homes their restaurants places of business

yesterday and it will continue until the midterms\nIs\nIs over or that's complete bull crap it will continue and continue and continue many of our friends and the left leaning mainstream media were just utterly shocked that this kind of attack occurred\nOne person or remarked how they'd never seen anything like this directed at just one side of the spectrum first of all that would\nForce one to deny that the latest pipe bomb was sent to Mike Pence\n\nBut I don't know how hard it is for the people in the news media I don't know how hard it is for you to go back so deep\nIn your memory bank

evidence on any saying everything is speculation and if I Would say Ari ... versus a left wing person trying to ramp everybody up\nWhat would that do that would choose the people listening\nAnd they'd say oh my gosh that's exactly right so why is it you feel so comfortable demonizing Donald Trump and all of his supporters\nBlaming this on Donald Trump and all of his supporters when you have nothing

how these were designed for mass murder and um I I was looking at it and I was like\nNo not really I mean it's a plot you were just talking about it's plastic which defeats the entire purpose of a pipe bomb the\nShrapnel is what's dangerous and the ... the explosives inside or just to make it like basically build pressure so usually it's a potassium nitrate I think charcoal okay we don't need [laughter] [laughter] right um but there's another ingredient that they actually talked about which is a again that goes towards the detonation of it\nUm that they said they did detect some of that in there but they didn't talk about the other ingredients so I again the everything is spec is is so speculative about it but everything points to a guy that really did not know what he was doing\nLower or somebody who didn't\nGo off yeah the sticker the ISIS me ... right either done that clearly marks that as somebody from the right why would you put that on\nThere and why did none of them go off

he's a bad guy or but we're going to find when it comes to people like Matt Lauer and Brokaw and how many more\nAt NBC it's been one of the biggest and not to mention ignoring the Harvey Weinstein thing for how long remembered they employed Ronan Farrow when he was writing the story and they gave it to the New Yorker\nI I you know all of that goes on and maybe Kelly happens to be one of the

that it is it is almost nothing it takes almost nothing to get you fired\n\nYou know should we should take Megan Kelly and we should take her down to the river and we should put a bunch of rocks around her and throw into the river if she floats we know she's a bigoted racist if she doesn't well we will will know that will know that she was in his and\nThis is so ridiculous how similar it is

or anything like that they're doing this to make a point on the other side we think their motivation is good so that's okay\nWhat she's saying here is if the motivation is good let's say a child for example who think\nThey want to dress up as a hero of there's a happens to be black and the only thing that guy's name mix right you want to be black and white they don't understand the dynamics of blackface they would think OK well you'd think the kids not racist their motivation is they're trying to look up to a hero and that's the only point you bring up it might not even be true we may say\nAs a society that we the black faces too far and we'd have to adjust some things but okay but the issue is her asking that question she's saying if it's a good motivation is not motivated by

you wrote to me last night and I'm not smart enough to understand it or you said there is a there is a procedure that you're pushing for 'em to hold these countries responsible and get them involved in stopping it can you explain\nWhat happened was that the Senate Judiciary committee chairman Chuck Grassley and I sent a letter to they had took a department of homeland security and the department of state suggesting that they work out an agreement with Mexico\nA whereby a Mexico would require people enter Mexico let's say from Honduras or from El Salvador or from or any of these other countries in Central America where a lot of these people were going from\nWhen the intent of claiming asylum they would have to claim asylum in Mexico rather than the United states\nWould be similar to an agreement that we already have in place with Canada and a rule imposed by the\nEU refugees arriving in Eu countries from Syria in other words when people were fleeing a a a country that dangerous to them that is particularly hostile towards them or some particular reason starts a ban on asylum claim\nThey ought to apply for asylum in the first country they reach that could be potentially save your that should be Mexico\nIsn't that\nNormally what happens I mean I thought that when you wanted asylum I thought I personally I think the United states government should be running ads do not come to America with your family because you will be turned away if you were in danger come to the closest to us embassy\nAnd apply for asylum\nI mean why are we die thought that was what we always do\nYeah it should be more like that and that's not really how it works and that ... ... ... these people end up applying\nFor asylum with Mexico or sort of throwing for the long ball they'll marry pass and try to make it all the way the United states but this jury is itself a dangerous journey that so\nI'm right with opportunities for people to be exploited\nAh it it's an exceptionally dangerous journey from it\nPeople especially for children\nAnd for young women many of whom are sexually assaulted during the ... and a lot of the\nPeople claiming asylum turn out not to be able to\nMake the case that they're even eligible for asylum but once they're in the United states it makes it much more difficult to get them back and we think that the asylum application that they're coming by land from Mexico ought to be made to Mexico as they enter Mexico\nI talked to a great guy but the other day and he said that he thought Mexico was working on something with the UN to put some sort of a camp there in Mexico for these refugees have you heard anything about that\nI have not but I\nDon't think that sounds like a a great idea I think that could become a another potential magnet agree for bringing people here\nUm if the idea is to facilitate that journey specifically the journey from somewhere else in Central America to the United states that could become more of a problem\nAgain you you you nailed it quite a few minutes ago and saying that the humanitarian crisis that we have to be focusing on here really is the crisis with the refugees themselves\nHaving to make this long dangerous journey\nAnd then knowing that when they get here the odds are pretty\nHigh that they're not going to be deemed eligible for asylum in any event and it just creates a whole lot of headaches for them in the process\nSo Mike I gotta I got an um an email in yesterday from a listener in Honduras Honduras resident and then a born and raised native ah in
