um of a\nRachel ... memo yeah I'm reading a little bit about it okay pretty amazing this is really amazing now she remember Rachel Mitchell is the Maricopa County sex crimes prosecutor she is the one who interviewed um Kavanaugh's accuser ah Christine afford\nShe was the she was the woman that ah was made fun of on Saturday Night live this weekend\nShe well she was a highly respected advocate for sexual abuse victims she's twenty five years experience she's not political at all in fact she was recognized by Barack Obama is head of homeland security as the a sexual assault prosecutor of the year\nLet me say that again the woman that the Republicans selected\nTo dig in and find out whether or not Dr Ford's claims were legitimate or not was ... rock Obama's head of homeland security sexual assault prosecutor of the year so she's not a democratic hack\nAnd also\nNot a defense attorney right she's a prosecutor yes she tries to prove these things true she goes in ... her expertise is\nOn old crimes to be able to go in and say All right how did this happen and be able to put it together to make sure that the prosecution can win All right before I continue and tell you what's in her memo let me just preface it\nWith this we're not going to see any it's CNN's not going to be leading with this New York times not going to have this on the front page but it should the reason why they won't is because it is devastating for Senate Democrats\nLeft wing activists the media this is absolutely devastating to you\nI Want you to know if you're easily triggered you might want to turn off the radio for just a minute here's what she wrote quote here's my bottom line\nA she said she said case is incredibly difficult to prove but this case is even weaker than that and quote\nSo I've been saying he said she said that that's pretty difficult she said the same thing that's not what she's saying this is an even he said she said case it's weaker than that\nDr Ford identified other witnesses to the event and those witnesses I'm Still quoting have either refuted her allegations or failed to cooperate them\nShe then adds I Do not think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the committee\nI don't think a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case not to the court\nNot for profit institution but before the committee nor do I believe that this evidence is sufficient to satisfy the preponderance of evidence standard and quote\nPretty significant do you think [laughter] again like she's being portrayed as this Republican hack to go after this uh this poor woman because she was a girl you mean ... yeah I ... as a homeland security prosecutor sex crimes of the year they picked someone who should have incredible amounts of credibility in with the left\nYes so she's saying that it's it's\nIt ... won't stand up in court wouldn't no prosecutor would even bring it and know prosecutors should even bring this to the committee this explains in my opinion\nWhy it was leaked in the final hour because every one who saw this knew exactly what it was\nNow she explains why\nShe says Ford has significantly changed her story several times\nIn recent months in ways that are shady have not been explained and defy common sense\nOkay wait a minute\nIt may look like she's credible are based on what she said not how she looked\n\nIf you're looking at what she said her story falls apart the most glaring issue with Dr Ford story is that she has given for different dates for when the attack occurred\nAnd we're not talking about the difference of a few days according to this this this is from her memo according to the Washington Post the twenty Thirteen notes from a therapy session list the attacks have having occurred when she was in her late teens\nFast forward five years July sixth of this year in a text message to the Washington Post reporter Ford said the attack happened\nIn the mid Nineteen eighties\nThis would be consistent with their therapists notes since Ford was born in late November sixty six and would have been in their late teens from Nineteen eighty four through Nineteen eighty six but then something changed three weeks later in July thirtieth\nLet her to Senator Dianne Feinstein is office the date of attacked change to the early eighties\nNow you might say what difference does it make well if you say you're in your late\nTeens sixteen Seventeen Eighteen Nineteen you're in high school so you're Seventeen or Eighteen late teens you've been saying mid eighties\nAnytime you've ever talked about this before it became political mid eighties late teens\nWhy did it change and how did it change within the span of three weeks she changes the date by a couple of years if\nIt gets better this is the again I'm quoting I'm quoting the um the report\nIt gets better one week later when she goes to take a polygraph test with their lawyers she was asked to write down a statement describing the events in that statement Ford wrote the alleged tack attack happened in the early Nineteen eighties\nBut then something strange happens if\nYou look at her written testimony for the lie detector test she scratches out the early\nNineteen eighties and leaves it the Nineteen eighties perhaps because she knew early Nineteen eighties was false\nAnd it was fresh in her mind and might set off the polygraph\nThen finally by mid September on her first on the record interview with the Washington Post Ford narrowed the date of the attack down to the summer of Nineteen eighty two\nSo let me recap Dr Ford provided for different dates over the span of a couple of weeks for what was supposedly one of the most traumatic important Nick at events of early light\nThan just the way we like it came

J. case again where OJ apparently all the evidence planted that he was guilty but he put like half the country thought he was guilty because the LAPD is allegedly races\nRight so you know Shankar low I just did a monologue on there's about a half hour ago\nThat the that African Americans rightfully\nFelt that the justice system had gone against the black men for so long\nHere is a black man fighting for his life and they they wanted him to beat the system I don't think at the time they actually believed he was a was innocent more than they wanted a black man to beat the system\nYou go back and you look at the polls then to the polls now in the African American community and they all know that he killed the un Nicole\nAnd they all know it so what they were doing was saying they were rebelling against a system that was geared against them and they wanted that social justice that's exactly what's happening here\nExactly yeah and and let me tell you I think a doctor's poured who testified she's a serious person she didn't as qualified as a witness as as as someone could possibly walk on on the witness stand right but when you actually start dissecting hurt her testimony ah I think as as you pointed out earlier it has tremendous flaws\nA just a it's a series of inconsistencies that would make it physically impossible for Brett Kavanaugh had done this or at least at the very least severely limits the ... the window of opportunity right\nSo the fact that the entire apparatus of the of the Democratic party which I understand how it works I I I used to work and communications ah in political communication so I understand how talking points are circulated and how people uh get on T. V. shows uh the fact that everything has been mobilized to support\nLook the evidence just isn't there right you don't crucified someone with zero evidence\nAnd then what you're doing now is that you're moving the goalposts right I I saw Laurence Tribe that this morning I like reading\nWas this guy's a respected harbored a scholar write a law professor who is talking about ah well you know he must have drank while he was in in college or whatever who cares but it's a completely irrelevant now I mean I I felt like reading at him hey Lawrence those goalpost seemed kind of heavy let me know if you need help\nMoving them [laughter]\nSo John Carlin we're talking to John Carlos elbow he is a Democrat\nOr who uh has not lost his footing ah with with reason um so the address people\nAddress people who are let's say a twenty something female that says you know but if there's a chance that this guy did this um you know I don't I don't want that guy on the Supreme Court\n\nYes and there's also a a a chance that he was db Cooper write me ... you have to go by the evidence and the case you have to evaluate a case it based on the ... you know the unique dynamics of that particular situation\nOr other people that are justice qualified why don't we just go I mean this guy why don't we just go to somebody else\nOr because he because\nWhen he he's essentially being accused right now he's essentially on on a summary public execution trial of a um the worst crime in the United states of America in in our legal system short of murder\nSo the question now is the economist is right and there's no evidence to ... to reach that conclusion in fact all of the evidence that has been presented is exculpatory right that the guys calendar\nClear is that right the testimony of his friends clear up\nThe absence of evidence also clear as him so you you have to pass that aside and then you want to oppose his nomination based on his judicial record that's absolutely find that's the debate I'm willing to have with people but what we cannot do is become a banana republic where we just start convicting people you know air quotes\nOn on near accusations that's not\nThe way this is in the court of law this is this is not a court of law you don't have to have that kind of evidence\nRight but you're you're you you are asked to write this would not meet ... any kind of legal standard but it doesn't even meet a standard of common sense\nBecause you have here is a series of of accusations that have been made with zero Robert of evidence zero independent evidence to back this up and then when you actually analyze the ... little evidence doesn't exist which is a form of testimony of of the alleged victim\nChurch testable she contradicts herself in ways that are significant she changed the timeline of when this happens four times so I think people need to cast aside or less the FBI find something new\nGlobal that guy that guy that that guy you know the friend a judge Mark Mark judge he sure seems like a bad guy why won't eat testify\nWell he is going to testify to the FBI but what we cannot do is play guilty by association ride mark judge\nI I've never met the man nobody nobody it Ninety nine percent of this country has never met this man right so we're just going off of here see right now\nAnd based on his own memoirs of somebody who was a very quotable person who had a serious drinking issues it's not bred cabinet but he we were not nominating mark judge for the Supreme Court is Brett Kavanaugh as the one who's who's being nominated\nAnd if people want to take issue with the judicial philosophy that's fine but well we can't do as destroy someone's life destroy his family that's like two young daughters he coaches basketball for crying out loud\nRight we we we cannot destroy somebody's life based on near allegations just because we disagree with them politically or ideologically\nThat insane that's what they do in in in ...

scheduled with him but I'm hoping that he has more time because I think you're going to be fascinated by his story and I want to start at the beginning with him let's go to Larry sharp now hello Larry how are you\nEh Glenn how you doing good morning It's MORNING or so I wanted to talk to you I'm really from the beginning if you have time to tell me the story of your life\nUm because you were you've had kind of a rough childhood your your dad was black your well your mom was white and they weren't married he was in the sixties\nThat's not a popular thing moms moms family she was afraid wouldn't accept you is that how it started that's true okay tell me the story from there\nSure um I was born in Manhattan I'm as you as you said biracial parents and my my biological mom didn't take the family would accept me so she put me up for adoption so uh my biological father was not in my life\nSo I don't know um what he was thinking but that he wasn't in my life so I was very lucky and I was adopted by a biracial couple um my mother was a ... who was my brother um was German and met my father who was black and the army in Germany they brought me to the south Bronx\nThat's where I was raised by ... stadium and you might know in the seventies and sixties when I was raised this was not the best neighborhood um so that's where I was raised a my father was a corrections officer at Rikers out in the jail here in New York City and my mother was a waitress and worked in a bank\nShe then I left and we all we live together we we rate got enough money so we actually are packed up it was ... when I was around eleven years old\nMy father finally made enough money and my mother we worked hard to get that we got out of that the bad neighborhood and got Long Island and when my ... my father died he died of cancer and when he passed away it was very hard for my mom\nBecause how old were you\nI was a twelve okay so when my father died um my mother's down there was in Europe and that basically abandoned her for leaving and my father's family I'm a band that has also so we were basically now I'm\nAt that point is very hard for myself and my mom of course as you could assume so by the time I was Seventeen I was ready to get out of here and I decided to get out and I thought you know what I'm gonna go off I'm going to join the army that's what I thought and I go join the army like my father would be like my dad and go join the army\nSo I go off to the recruiting station and and this case they're all for recruiters in the same building and I go to the army recruiter and he tells me\nSon is going to be great we're gonna make you a general and in the month and you're going to be you know probably in the world and beaten beautiful women and I'm Seventeen thinking my God this is

you I said what he said for ... years are you ready I said yes and I signed up\nAnd I look back at that and then I didn't know what I was doing I was just reacting but what I look back at that I Know I was desperately seek seeking positive male role models I didn't have and wrinkled gave me many of them and that was a great thing that the marine corps the military is not everybody and not much to

you don't know what's right for me in Queens either were even\nHow they'll let you be you you let me be me and we can all be free to gather\nA lot of times it was at work it has word that's our original idea we just haven't done it in a long time so so Larry tell me your day one you're governor of New York what do you do\nThere are several things that have to work and be and to be clear about this when I when this thing I can win this thing with about thirty percent or so the vote 'cause it's a five way race in New York state and we are a plurality state not a majority says we don't require fifty one percent there's a runoff go whoever has the most that's how New York state works\nSo I could actually win this thing with thirty percent so it's it's actually one of the race so assuming that I win this thing\nI'm going to happen at present but everything to vote for third party is a mandate that will shock everything to be for with you when this is the most important single\nElection in the entire nation not as a whole other things that were more boring as a whole but as one single election if I come in first it changes the entire nation overnight who does not just a Libertarian Party but for any third party\nYou know is is that the ... yeah this is this I think if people thought Donald Trump was ground breaking a libertarian winning in New York uh would would would be an earthquake I mean would you change the political system overnight\nAbsolutely it is that important even come in second would shock people but\nFirst would literally changed a nation of it would give every third party a better chance it would make better Democrats and Republicans because right now Republicans just have to talk about our protection the Democrats they don't have to worry about small business they don't have to about smaller government that will have to worry about lower taxes so unimportant is just I'll protect you from the evil left and\nAll at the same thing in return they don't have to get my civil liberties that's supposed to be but they don't they're supposed to go I'm gonna protect you from the evil right but when there's a third party that were the libertarians can point the finger and say Democrats what happened what happened in civil liberties Republicans what happened a smaller government\nNow they have the change they have to be better it will change how everything works so day one is I have to recover from the shock\n[laughter] there will be a massive a massive culture shock within within the uh the state\nOf the nation but something else I don't have a career to protect\nI don't have people to pay back I don't have that so I can actually just do what I Want which is amazing\nI'm assuming that I Will be in court my entire for years as my assumption and I'm fine with that but I have to focus on several things one a complete re board of education to a complete review of how we mandate every local county to pay\nFor things that the people don't want to pay for a thing called unfunded mandate\nThat's how the Albany which is our capital of New York state and Washington DC control every local county and take the power away from the government and that that the credit culture of transparency because the problem with the government now is they're enforcing the kings well so they are not transparent they are constantly being bullied\nAnd I don't want the government to be\nI'm the king and I in force my will I Want the state government to be I Will protect your rights of the individual against the local bully\nSounds like you've read the constitution or what does that I don't know I Know I Know it's I'm not sure it's an old dusty are due to document\nTheir ego yes Neal anyway I think we sort of the way while ago yeah [laughter] but yes that's my point I Want to make sure that look if we focus on the individual more we will have better individual families ... met or individual businesses that individual people who are trying to you know do their jobs\nGrowth locally you know I Want the local communities to provide more value\nTo each community we don't do that well in New York said it all we have things called regional economic economic development ... corporations which Albany which is the capital and decides where the money is spent and opened his eyes were taxpayer money spent within an individual county how buttons that the county's can start to budget to zero\nSo they can is that what they want how about we add new ideas of volunteerism how about the concept I'll give you to an interesting concept one instead\nOf me focusing on lowering taxes how 'bout I focused instead on raising money through ways other than taxation and through lowering spending here's one idea that those both of those we have a bridges right now in New York state\nAnd one of them is named the Mario Cuomo bridge we literally have an imperial Britain named after our well family that's embarrassing how 'bout instead that Britain's named the staples bridge or the the rise in Britain the apple bridge and making a lease naming rights of the bridge we retain the asset I got no business gotten that giving my ass it up I'm\nGoing to lease naming rights no hybrid model that fails Everytime\nStraight contractual that's all these companies that are paying billions of dollars right now every year on marketing they dropped twenty million dollars on a stadium name that's using the weekends I got a bridge you can name and that bridge gets mentioned hundreds of times on every single day during rush hour and a sixteen person ... uh sixteen million person metro area\nAnd hundreds of thousands of cars pass it every single day you will easily dropped the million dollars and that if not more\nOn that taxes hang on just a Texas New York populist the taxes you should listen to this guy this is a good idea [laughter]\nAbsolutely but here's the best part now we have them do maintenance\nWe own it so we still we still inspect it so damages do our responsibility their job is just repair it right\nThey begin to repair it what does that mean we're not spending money on the repairs lower spending not just that contracts don't come through Albany less corruption someone else's spending spending it so guess what lassie fix bridges bridges right now when you if they collapse we don't have enough money\nThese guys do will have to have safe or bridges less money and guess what we can start with holes\nIn New York and New York city some bridges costs Fifteen dollars you know I don't know if you're a truck driver I don't think a truck driver you pay by the axle you're dropping Seventy five two hundred bucks to cross the bridge\nLess money less corruption safer better service boom we raised billions of dollars this is just one idea and there are many of them no one else talks about them this is what we have to work on a New York state\nWe can do that so where you are you ... it's amazing to me how we are running\nHeadlong just willing to give up everything that we have already ... the freedoms that we have and embrace democratic socialism yes\nBut we won't embrace this very American idea how do you how do you get the common sense Democrat and Republican who has been raised in New York so their mentality is me this would sell in Texas\nHow do you get them in New York to see guys this this that it's already seller\nWhere the Republicans in New York have given up I mean they don't show up\nOr the Democrats I think I'm afraid so let's just vote Democrat the reality is again Seventy percent New Yorkers don't vote those who do vote vote because of fear we can't have fear be the reason why people vote it's simply that\nOr in America they are the best built\nA and it's just great
