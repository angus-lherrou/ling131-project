friends are going to his website smart to adventure travel\nThree weeks before an election it's almost like Donald Trump was like hey guys would you know creating a caravan and sending it this way and I what I Will do is that we'll talk about it and it will help us win this election and then afterwards you guys can go back home will\nPay for your boss I was reading about the makeup of the care of it too earlier um some of them are children with their parents\nMany of them are children unaccompanied by their parents so I Try to figure out All right out in that\nOccur at home did you did the parents just say hey you know what it's time for you to walk to the United states and I want you to walk in that group of people and here's a guy and paying seven thousand dollars to walk you know somewhere in the group with you and he'd get you across the border is that what you're doing or you just\nYou're in trusting your children to\nWho knows what and where is the personal responsibility of the parents here yeah I mean there's gotta be something\nThere is and I think their case would be or at least the case to left would make on their behalf would be a you know things are so vast so\nBad in Honduras Guatemala I mean they can get a lot worse you can be killed or on the way here you could be molested on the way here\nSomebody may not be there on the other side of the border you I mean there's so many things that could go wrong you talk about a helicopter parents I mean that's pretty much the opposite like\nThe same thing we talked about this yesterday I you know letting my kid walk who step and walking the uh the dog up the street not the whole street but part of the street yeah I mean you know hawking over him the entire time makes me as a parent freak out\nI told the story a few times I you know we live in a neighborhood at the at the end of our a block it there there there's a giant pond there in a green area is common to the everybody in the neighborhood and when my daughter was sixteen she said hey that I'm just I'm going to walk down to the pond\nLike alone [laughter] without your rather [laughter] no [laughter]\n[laughter] what do you stop and think about how you know\nPretty protective ... yeah exactly I I don't let them walk down to the end of the block let alone hey why don't you walk\nTo Honduras with a group of people that I don't know [laughter] ... outlook\nThere are situations you could argue right like if you were in a you know you're in North Korea right and you had a chance to get your kid out you'd probably pulled the trigger on that whether you ever see them again or not right there are certain level of this and and that's not to say that none of the people in these situations where like this\nOr is there probably are some but it it's just ... you try to it's the same thing with the dreamers right they they try to give you the picture of every one is a four year old who came across the border and in reality like most of them are teenagers most of them were sixteen and Seventeen years old\nThat this is a ... it's a different story or and\nYou just wonder first of all why you would do this because it's a gift to Donald Trump if you want to talk about a hardening the borders\nThis is an easy way to get people together to do that ... when people hear a story like this if it does not soften their hearts that makes people say whoa this it you know 'cause the ward invasion gets used with illegal immigration or sometimes from people who\nOppose it or you know in a hawkish manner ... right and you know like a thousand people are kind of qualified right like four dozen people coming across the border it whether you like it or not feels like an invasion\nRight it feels like waiting does there just top like they're ... they're taught the only way they can do anything hears over running but we have right look over running the security\nThat they're they're they're coming in or the right way or the overriding security\nAnd you see that Mexico does not want to deal with this but they know that they're they're not the end they're not the end location\nSo they can let them into Mexico and say well you guys to apply for a for asylum and in six months to come back for that for that hearing and of course they're just gonna keep walking north\nAnd it's interesting how other countries deal with this\nYet or the vitriol directed at us for trying to deal with it in just even a\nFairly reasonable way every time we do worry were hateful or were on carrying were racist whereas Mexico certainly protect their border or do you remember what Felipe Calderon said when he came to the United states and he was trying to influence our immigration policy of\nCourse if somebody's snakes them from Nicaragua or some other country in Central America through the southern border of Mexico they wind up in Mexico they can go get a job they're going to work\nIf somebody do that without permission with ... with them back\nThen they ... they send back them they send back to them if they do it without permissions they send back to them but we can't we're expected to just accept everybody we don't know who they are we don't know what they're doing and we don't know what they bring to U.S Mexico has a pretty stiff\nImmigration law they've got to streamline law that insurers foreign visitors and immigrants are in the country legally have the means to sustain themselves\nEconomically they're not destined to be burdens on society they are of economic and social benefit to society weight you're you expect your\nImmigrants to contribute ... there are good character no criminal background and their contributors to the general welfare and well being of the nation or they make sure that they don't have any\nSort of a criminal\nOccurred they make sure they do have visas they make sure they they ban foreign visitors from interfering in the country's internal politics\nAs I mean can you think of it I mean how many illegal immigrant protests have there been where they're waving the Mexican flags in our faces where they are demanding writes\nA that they think they have coming to them\nIn Mexico you can't even go can't interfere in their in internal politics plus if they think that you're going to throw off the balance of their demographics\nMay deport I mean that's a [noise]\nA blatantly racist right I mean like that is not yet there's not an argument there we would never know you can't do that you know you can't do that and nor should you you shouldn't be like well I Would\nLike this percentage of African Americans and the present we want to make sure we're still keep Seventy or eighty percent yeah I mean I think I Would you I Would I Can't I Can't think of one Trump supporter who would ... support a policy where we had to keep the exact same percentages of white people versus other races\nYou will you wonder if people who are productive who are here because they want to be here and be part of the society or going to add something to our community instead of taking things from it I mean right now that is what you want the hypocrisy is mind by that really is incredible lying to buy it really is it's ... ... security for me but not for me\nAnd that is not a a that is not a ... that's incredible I mean that's an incredible it is a line there that they draw it is a you know it's not it's not the right thing and and ... and it's\nPolitically wanting to look at the bottom line is we ... we have a lot of illegal immigrants here there will be more that are coming we need to tighten up that is a completely let the larger argument that needs to be addressed and we've been talking about it for years and years\nBut politically speaking you got three weeks to a mid term election there is no this is a complete gift\nTo the Republicans to people who care about the border yeah people who have any uh did Donald Trump and the people he's supporting the gift\nIt is and and he's telling Republican that yeah saying hey use their use it in the ... election campaign start talking about immigration because I haven't heard\nAny of them doing that are any other Republican candidates using immigration not that I've heard I mean maybe some warm someone somewhere is but it doesn't seem to be a general theme for the party\nI did hear at all talking about it in the debate and I don't think I don't know he mentioned the caravan per se but I mean he was talking a lot about border security I mean there's a really close race in Arizona a race or where I'm at ... has a I think a great chance of winning where people because her\nOpponent there is like if you took Michael Moore\nAnd put him in his brain into a female body of a congresswoman\nYou would have all of these tapes that they've been finding about her where she saying you know she's bashing Arizona oh yeah it's the meth lab of democracy she saying people are crazy in Arizona she's talking about how I mean she's on nine eleven truther shows I mean she is\nAs it's incredible but they decided to run her and just and thought that this stuff would not come out\nAnd and ... you know you're talking about a ... uh one of the first female pilots in history and the air the air force incredibly accomplished yeah that's a great chance of winning in in a tough environment or in Arizona adding on this situation where\nAre you know your he makes gives a coat pink worker a coat pink staffer is running for Senate in Arizona and\nIt was a huge mistake I think for her to be their number literally with code picker night that the rising her views I don't know exactly she she's been with a lot of these uh left wing extreme groups or some maize and nearly two thousands to the point where again like she co hosted a show with someone who is the nine eleven truther while\nFor a while that's like crazy bunkers over the line right and and the fact that you have a really solid candidate there in Arizona this border state the big deal there Texas is another one the cruise cruise has got to lead there but I mean he's always been talking about border security but yeah I get a look at the other side of that\nYet with that though he doesn't want no all he doesn't I don't know that even once a border frankly now it just doesn't seem like it and he's made a big deal out of it some of those ads are like let's protect the dreamers\nLet's let's protect the dreamers and you know what that means it means it means amnesty for everybody it doesn't stop with the dreamers and ... I think everybody who has watched this battle for the last Fifteen or Twenty years knows it doesn't stop with the dreamers there they're going to they want amnesty for all illegals here\nWe secured seven hundred billion dollars and then next year seven hundred and sixty billion dollars to fully rebuild our great American military [noise]\nAnd our military well very shortly be far stronger\nModern the best in the world and also it's jobs now when it comes to the military I don't care about the job so much I Want a strong military but as a secondary benefit every ounce of it is built in the United states and we make\nAnd the best chefs and the best rockets and missiles\nWe make the best though so it's a lot of jobs\nAnd we will soon have far and away the strongest military that we've ever had and hopefully you know what it will be so strong and so powerful that we won't have to use it okay\n[noise] it was\nIn power but we probably would have to use it that's the way life works at by direction the Pentagon is now working to create a branch of the American\nForces go ... scores [noise]\nI Would do the United states from the horrible one sided Iran nuclear deal\nIs [noise]\nAnd you remember a day before I came into office looked like Iran was just going to take over the middle\nEast there was no stopping them just what\nThey're struggling right now they're really struggling that big riots every weekend they are struggling right now\nThey are having a hard time\nAnd we recognize the capital of Israel and open the American\nEmbassy in Jerusalem\n[noise] together\nAnd we have made extraordinary from\nThe progress that we've made is I think on parallel certainly for the first two years and you know we're still quite a bit sure we have a ways to go January twenty or we have a ways to go but nobody has done more than we've done in the first two years and not even\n[noise] and we're just getting\nStarted [noise] have you got to elect a Republican House Republican Senate we will continue to cut your taxes cut your regulations and raise your income\nMedicare and Social Security [noise]\nAnd Democrats will destroy them both and you know\nWe will continue to get burned judges who are ... our constitution as written [noise]\nWe will secure the border we will pass case law [noise]\nWe will and sanctuary cities [noise] stop\nCatch and release visa lottery chain migration out [noise] and we will keep the criminals drug dealers or jurors the hell out of our country [noise]\nMillions of our citizens from welfare to work dependence independence and poverty to prosperity [noise]\nFor years you watch\nAs your leaders apologized for America\nRemember the bowing all the bad people forget about the bowing I remember\nI didn't like it all the bowing\nYeah I have a president a Jewish standing up for America\n[noise] we're standing up\nValue [noise] we're standing up for the people of Arizona [noise] we are proudly standing up\nOur great national anthem [noise]\nBut\nTo continue just incredible mentor\nTo defend your state and your country I Need you to get your friends get your family get your neighbors get your co workers and get out and vote\nFor ... mix Sally November\nCourageous fighter\nShe's the person you needed Washington you will be so proud of her she loves this state so much you will be seriously you will be so proud of her [noise]\nA boat thank you she's a proud of you to [noise] about\nThat's right people oh is that oh this is going to be an easy job nothing easy about invokes that's\nBut we love it you know why we love it they just asked me originally\nDo like it as hard as says only hard because I used to work twenty four hours a day\nI could make it [noise] I don't have to\nBut you know why I Love\nBecause we're accomplishing so much for greater than anybody ever thought including them and they give us strategy for they have and\nTo vote for a Republican Congress is a vote for more jobs more well\nAnd more products made right here in the usa [noise]\nIs\nThere a vote to respect our laws and respect the heroes of law enforcement [noise]\nI don't vote for Republicans is about to reject the demographic politics of hatred anger and division I just celebrate the greatness and the glory of being an American and it is just great\n[noise]\nLoyal citizens like you help build this country\nAnd together we are taking back our country returning power\nTo you the American people and that's happening\nFrom\nPhoenix blacks them\nFrom may ...\nTo the red rock sit down and [noise]\nThis great state was settled by some of the tough is men\nAnd jump is and most beautiful women ever to the face of the earth [noise]\nNow they're going to say tomorrow\nBecause women beautiful is in that time [noise] it'll be\nWomen beautiful beautiful you are beautiful\nYou own ways and you always will be [noise]\nThat is funny I'm thinking I just watching the ...

I Am just an angry conservative and oh I forgot to tell you I had my best friend and she stayed in Albert she goes to ... them but he never age and they bring them in ...\n... it's like ... and thank you for the call it just seemed like that there is a uh\nThere was an effort made when you when you prioritize identity politics over everything out\nThese things are sensible right like it's simple that Barry Obama was bronco Bob right in its sensible in that world it's sensible if you're Elizabeth Warren to claim you have Native American heritage and\nIn in your school and and submit a recipe the pouch out like that makes sense in that world because that's all you prioritize it's the only thing that matters\nRight if the only thing that matters is your identity as a victim\nThen classifying yourself a as associated with a victimized population of evil conservatives\nDoes a lot of good for you there's a real incentive and motivation to do it and we ... we seem to see it over and over and over again\nAnd you know look maybe she was called that it was a ... I don't know uh I it's possible I haven't seen a ton of evidence that it's accurate nor that it makes any sense but beyond that ... ... the idea that he is put on every single sign solely\nBefore letters B. E. T. oh\nThis is not like that might be a nickname and it might be that it's okay to call him ... but this is not he's not doing it because that's the uh the case he's doing it because he's trying to fool a bunch of people especially back you know when he was trying to get to this level at this point\nI don't know I think everybody knows but it helped him climb to this level\nAnd it's it's the name that appears on the ballot too which is interesting very strange very strange ... a lot of times if it's a nickname they'll put like Robert Francis and then in parentheses [noise] Beto\nTime AAA Seventy seven be easy K let's go to Jack in Pennsylvania a Jack you're on the Glenn Beck river I\nHey pat and Steve Love you guys [laughter] ah I I think you're missing a very important point and that is that over Rory identifies as Hispanic or there for you you must be bullied\nWow there's a great point here is again we're learning today yeah I forgot that was the standard how insensitive us mhm\nHow hateful and are down right now but that is that we haven't spoken about how we can do is identify yeah and it must\nBe a fan of ... ... it's interesting with that sort of talk it's like you know the the Elizabeth Warren is of essentially identifying as Native American without real evidence that she is she getting beat up I mean this has been one of the biggest political disasters of old time\nAre coming out and trying to say that she actually use Hispanic Native American shorter it's by going back ... generations trying to prove it one one thousand twenty four yeah that's amazing the left hates it through like this is this is playing into the worst of our\nUh beliefs about you know blood being the determining factor in these things and they they hate their\nThey have destroyed or over the she handled it terribly almost like one of those things I don't know maybe they should have leaked it through another source of the fact that she's associating herself with coming out and doing this is this amazing\nAh but the identifying thing there's two parts of that\nLike I said you know say that you know a libertarian side for me I don't care what people say they are right like it makes no difference to me if she says she's Native American or not I don't care\nBut beyond that there's an actual truth\nYou know if it was all what's to come out and say she's black or Sean King what's to come out and say he's black when they're not black it doesn't matter to me I don't care what they're doing their own I think they're lying right and they're doing this for a reason but that doesn't mean it affects me in any way however we have to\nBe able to stand up for the truth the truth is that Sean King is white that Rachel does all is white and the truth is the Beto O'Rourke as white as white\nAnd you know I that's okay you know people are supposed to be able to be you know we're not supposed to care so much about these identifying factors but we're in a world in which the left only embraces identity politics the stick world we need to curate\nAgree disagree you does it matter as long as you think ... bags on any given as the AM seven Ninety two sons most stimulating

are having some hard times losing a job or losing your home and we hear about how many have can move just to look for work [noise] terribly lose your home for many there are also losing a little a family member\nThese dogs you don't understand what's happening to the source\nBack to Nineteen Ninety eight here are are the percentages of democratic fund raising in Nineteen Ninety eight they had forty three percent of all fundraising okay uh in Nineteen Ninety eight in the house two thousand it was forty seven percent two thousand two forty seven percent two thousand four forty six percent\nYou've got to see a pattern and have their little bit and you know Republicans slightly out raising them they're kind of changes in two thousand six where it goes to fifty percent Democrat than fifty six percent Democrat in two thousand eight that's brought up on his first election\nUh it's been hanging around a fifty percent ever since two thousand ten was forty eight percent doesn't twelve forty four percent doesn't fourteen forty seven percent doesn't sixteen fifty percent so you get that there's a range there from about forty three to fifty six percent that is broken and I'm fifty six was outlier most of the time it's right between forty seven fifty fifty one\nSo far in ... in two thousand Eighteen Democrats have raised sixty five percent of the money going to the house wow again they've never been higher than fifty six sixty five percent a sixty five thirty five split against Republicans\nThey are out there was a congressman who came out the other day he raised eight hundred thousand dollars in his district thought he did a good job his opponent announced two point six million ... this is like it's unheard of when it comes to money and the disparity going on now\nNow we're ... the Democrats are favored to take the house I don't know how much it has to do with money but if they were to lose this race would be a with this sort of a climate it would be not complete destruction\nOf any argument that money can buy election I mean this is they're they're gonna complain I mean Beto O'Rourke was on stage complaining with Ted Cruz about money and how Ted Cruz's influenced by your raped me a hundred thousand dollar donation to him like I like this is a big a big deal in today's world um but I mean\nHe he's raised ... just doesn't even clue Beto he's thirty eight million dollars more than any Senate candidate himself is in history yeah for a quarter or which is incredible you said it was it compares to Brock Obama's racing and what's your what he wants\nMore in the in the ah if you compare quarter last quarter\nOf the campaign in two thousand eight he raised more than ... Obama during his presidential\nCats is that the presidential election emphasizing this is a Texan ... Senate race where he barely have any chance to win uh-huh now it's funny in the Senate race record he broke was the what was the ...\nRecord set by Rick lousy oh of course you remember senator lousy oh from New York running Hillary Hillary he did not win that race was not a close race even though Rick lousy wasn't a bad candidate it was kind of a close race\nIt was Hillary right in New York [noise] expect her to win but I mean again ear between Iran and fifty and almost every it's almost a fifty fifty split every year and this you're sixty five thirty five\nThat's a big she is um and the other thing that's kind of interesting on the in the bad side if you want to get scare mongering for awhile and why not cleanse out we haven't had enough scare mongering lately\nUm we haven't set it always ends with a bullet to the head all we all week on well now in the last two days and now now we just you know we have a\nGoing back in history looking at two hundred and thirty eight seats with a democratic incumbent only eight percent of them are getting knocked off when you have a democratic incumbent running\nFor Republicans the ... the rate is twice as high sixteen percent now is that a big difference I mean sixteen percent it's still not high but it does show that Republicans\nWind up losing these incumbency races a little bit more often if you're worried about the Senate it was a little bit of there was a little bit of something there to be worried about\nThink they're going to win the Senate I think you're gonna see a fifty three or fifty four seat majority I think they may pick up a couple of said oh I'm I'm I'm pretty bullish right now in Arizona\nI'm I'm pretty bullish right now in Texas are those who were in question ... I I think to winds up winning by maybe ten points or more\nI think it'll be a double digit I think there's a good chance of that um I wouldn't be surprised to see six to ten\n... you know um I wouldn't be surprised I think it'll be much closer they early comfortable yeah for I think that's where he stands right now yeah or Arizona is razor thin margin is right now but it's I think it's trending well for the Republican they're like Sally I think a you've got toss ups in states like Nevada\nAnd Missouri and Florida that in\nMind set Montana seems to be leaning a little bit to the Democrat but I wouldn't you put that on the top and something like well read yeah well I saw it's close but don't they pretty much a toss up race but\nThose are I mean Florida is a complete toss no reason for the Democrats to continually when in Montana I don't understand it I don't know how to do a rifle Ginia I mean I'm Talking about West Virginia here\nI think Joe mansion ah probably sealed his reelection with his cabinet vote which was for Kavanaugh the only Democrat who did that brand they're all bumped up up the system when I have to\nUm I don't believe it I mean you look at his voting record he's worse than every single Republican thing about this you complain about Mitch McConnell you complain about a Susan Collins you complain about a summer cold Lisa Murkowski\nJoe mansions voting record is much worse than all of that\nAll of them yeah it's not even close I mean Mitch McConnell is like the biggest conservative of all time I mean for a Democrat he's he's moderate he's the most moderate Democrat yeah but I mean that's not saying much because I'm a craft or now communist second the socialist in communist yeah I mean the most part you think about Jeff Flake\nHere's a guy who's getting ... ... ... so so much by the White House and by the conservative media that he is resigning and not even trying to fight for head for that seat that the seat and Mick Sally is running for\nA well he votes with the president and more often than Joe Manchin it's not even close yeah\nBut you know again a West Virginia is a state is probably the most pro Trump state in the union\nHe won in West Virginia by almost thirty ... thirty I think yeah and you know this is like it was czar they would go for I mean I imagine it's got a big name in West Virginia\nAgain if you want to pick a Democrat in the Senate or you know ... you probably mentioned would be the guy you'd be most optimistic for he voted even more I mean high capital almost certainly is going to lose now in North Dakota but I mean in in\nWest Virginia got mansion he got his cabinet vote you have a couple of but again this is a guy who voted for Obama carries he's uh he's he is a Democrat and this is not a\nHe's a moderate Democrat as compared to Alexandria Ocasio Cortez but is that what West Virginia actually once you wouldn't think so apparently cell though he seems to be leading in the polls is an interesting development there\nAre but I ... it is a winnable she'll be winnable seat in this environment uh right now mentions leading that won fairly comfortable but even without the mansion seat you're\nIn a year at a I think you can get to fifty three fifty four without going crazy and I think you can get two fifty to fifty one it would be a real surprise if they lost the Senate at this point I mean I think there's a good you know eighty percent chance that there are the most models that are showing about an eighty percent chance they hold it and I think that's I think that's safe assumption\nYeah interestingly I you know when you mentioned Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota she's gone by eight point seven now yeah the average is eight point seven points to the Republican Kevin ... so yeah that is looking pretty good yeah my\nPerceived there I think honestly you had two races decided by the Cabot I'll vote one was mansion ... high temp her vote against that sealed it I think I don't think she's ... I don't think she can win that race though\nI don't think she can win that race I think she's going to lose it and then she's going to lose a pretty big I would not be surprised as you said that double digits situation happens there yeah look again North Dakota as a conservative state ... are they are looking at high camp and\nYou know I think a lot of people like to say well we've got this one Democrat this is what we've got the one good Democrat I think people like to say that you know I think states in general like to say well we're not partisan we've got you know democratic governor we've got a democratic senator and there's something there's some level of pride there to say like we're not only voting one way\nWhen you vote against Brett Kavanaugh in those circumstances with the arguments she used this is not someone who is a borderline Democrat this is someone who is embracing the same sort of standards you're seeing from Cory Booker and Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi and all of these far left figures\nAnd good for North Dakota and for just seeing her as a a as a result of that it looks that way good yeah\nDemocrats can get to that [noise] so I mean ... look and if they get the house if ... if all the Democrats do is get the house they're going to be able to watch investigations like crazy right\nThey're going to it's going to be a nightmare most certainly in PJ well in Egypt right now we're going to be convicted no no the when I won't be no chance of a real ... unless something dramatic were to happen right\nUh because you have to get to the sixty seven seats the better than I Do in the seventies you know and they're not gonna get anywhere close to that even if they get the majority in the Senate they're not going to be able to do that but they will have a subpoena power they will they will bogged down the administration in constant investigations it'll look investigating something that's real is fine\nReally boring and that's true however it there are some interesting stuff in there they had thirty four page opinion and they shut down the hill use argument saying okay the Catholics were not trying to endorse or ... over to a to a religion they were just hoping\nSo that no surprise there the ACLU sues everybody over everything however buried in the middle of the this is from the federal ... buried in the middle\nOf the court's analysis
