scratched\nHer and you did an aids test\nWell how many people how many other ups crash but how do we\nRight okay so you did the AIDS test and of course came up negative\nYeah okay now what that's where I'm at and you know\nNo matter of fact there is not the good news is there's nothing there either in terms of the ...\nIt's already eight or ... yeah yeah no there's nothing there\nThere's there's I mean theoretically died she go to the doctor did she get stitches uh yeah the emotional ... there's not an an emotional issue when you get scratched\n[laughter] so no there's nothing there although you know it's always interesting is they're All right my knee and is there anything there in you know everybody default this is America where your default to how do I get money I said how do I get money\nAnd then we start talking about well what what happened in all okay so there's nothing there well emotionally distraught ah I'm Upset because odd I Want money and I can't get money and therefore can I sue because of my anticipation of getting money oh sure that's a great case\nOh why not miss I miss welcome to handle on the law and sure\nI got a problem I have a like a fake what can what less than half hour and they haven't had I didn't either I wanted to I mean right at family and\nFrom what I mean how much did you pay seven how do I do\nI Know but how much do you think you should pay did they fix it or not\nI have\nIt doesn't matter I don't care if they're fixing half an hour or did they give you a bit did they give you an estimate already did you pay did you pay for the glass door being fixed and when did they did they say it was going to cost eight hundred dollars or just after the ... they handed you a bill for eight hundred dollars\nNo no no not All right and just don't pay I\nGot a well then that's the problem you have Agnes because you paid it and now you say I paid too much\nSo it's a they're going to say you accepted our\nOur bill the bill basically use verbal says I Want a eight hundred dollars\nAnd so uh and then there's the issue of uh contractors over five hundred dollars you need a written contract but I don't think that's yeah that's going to be particularly important although it might be in a in the case of a a small claims spending on the judge so ah you wanna do it's worth something Agnes right does the work they did\nNot what do you think you should pay I mean I think\nMuch about it\nAnd that may be reasonable so you turn around soon for six hundred dollars and you take it to court and they're going to say you accept the deal and you're going to say it's too much money and I didn't know and then I found out that they just ... me off its predatory\nThat's not\nWhat do you mean you have now did you hand them eight hundred dollars in hundred dollar bills in cash\nNo no I didn't my credit card\nOkay so you have the proof that you paid them eight hundred dollars okay and you're saying is too much\nAnd you want your money back and the overtures you okay and you didn't know they overcharge you until after the fact and they were going to argue it doesn't matter what we charge we told her I was going to be eight hundred dollars she agreed they're going to lie about it at this and you're going to go to court and tell her to a judge okay that's that's all you can do\nThat before I go\nTo of course you you have to ask them first okay that's the law you have\nTo make a demand you went in writing say you over charge me I've checked around and by the way you\nDo have to check around you just can't arbitrarily say I I think it's only we're two hundred dollars 'cause what kind of expertise you have that and there's nobody cares what you think it's I've checked around and you do want to check\nAnd it's worth two hundred dollars you overcharge me I Want my six hundred dollars back you make that demand they're going to tell you to go pounds Sandra pound glass in this case and you are and they'd go to sue when they say no [noise] not that complicated [noise]\nThis is handle on the law [noise]\n\n[noise]\nMy answer this giant whose last name or the protein Maria ... mandates general Abdul Ghani ... average

harassment about the unequal way or the women and girls are created in this country at the same time there is as of now no contemporaneous corroborating evidence\nFor any of the charges as far as we know we haven't seen anybody emerging say yes I remember that and that is an important part of the story as well\nThat is not just an important part of the story that is the story\nThat is the story and I for one I for\nOne we'll not condemn Ford and I will not condemn a Brett Kavanaugh I wasn't there I'm not God there is no evidence\nThey need to vote to confirm\nAnd we need to stop the witch

why we should be talking about how do we make how do we strengthen this and spread this around the world\nRight now are dialogue\nIs America's sucks nothing is good everything is bad and that is absolutely not\nA crew in the middle chapter of the the book I I ask this question is this worth saving nobody is asking this we're talking about getting rid of capitalism changing our whole system changing everything about it it doesn't work no one is asking\nThe question that must be asked first is this worth saving is America and the west good or bad\nIt can be both because people are both but is it\nOn the on the whole has it helped to more people or hurt more people\nWere not having that conversation we are having an now Arthur Brooks is the president of the American Enterprise Institute he's the guy who grew up in Seattle I grew up in the Seattle area um he remembers the first time he saw poverty and I think\nIt's the first time I really saw poverty as well I think it was it was probably the Michael Jackson a\nThat fund raiser we are the world where we were trying to raise money for Ethiopia and we saw these kids with the bloated stomachs and the flies on their face we had never seen anything like that\nThat was a pivot point for Arthur Brooks in his life Arthur welcome to the program\nHey brother Glenn how are you very good viewing months how're you doing\nI'm I'm I Am great I'm great um I I wanted to get you on because we do not talk about\nWhat capitalism are and what this country has has done what the western way of life has done and we're just allowing it to be thrown out the window and you make compelling case because you didn't commit this with politics in mind\nYou know I don't you know and and a lot of the things that we're talking about today I was listening to the last segment of your grade show and and you you're talking about this big war this big cultural battle that we're having those countries or whether it's about the Kavanaugh hearings are about\nThe Trump Administration or about capitalism in general these are really kind of proxy cultural battles that we're having in in our country today it's a culture of outrage you've talked about this a lot\nUm you've done ... work on this important topic and it's important for all of us to remember we are so unbelievably blessed in this country we live in a peaceful society I mean if you're going to have social media if you dare you know if you if you can stomach it\nAnd listen to people saying the most violent ghastly things to each other but but let's remember there's going to be known knocking the night it was going to be no jak booted thug nobody's going to take off the president God Bless this country and we have to stop taking for granted the fact that we live in a democratic peaceful society\nAnd we have to stop trashing each other all the time and having the dome proxy wars that's completely unproductive\nSo ... right now I ... you know the big ideas are being trashed the ideas of\nFreedom of speech or because you know you have to have a safety the safety space all of these all this nonsense\nYeah but also capitalism itself when you saw the pictures back in the eighties of those starving Ethiopians it bothered you and you actually that that set your feet on the course of trying to find out what happened to them right\nIt did I mean the fact that I'm a political conservatives today has everything to do with the fact that I share the objectives of most of my [noise] my my left wing friends and family that I care about poverty in ... and I started to look for the way that you can wipe out poverty everybody listening to us clan believe [laughter]\nAnd and their their obligation infect their privilege to lift up their brothers and sisters at the margins of American society and and and society around the world what really matters is what works what system works full you sleep I became a proponent of American free enterprise system\nAs a gift to the world because I wanted to do more to help my brothers and sisters and I found that there was one system of pulled people up at the billions all around the world\nThese are big issues that we need to be talking about it in America today and how we can do this better\nThan you give me some of the stats Arthur I Know you I don't know if you have him off the top of your\nYou know absolutely so from Nineteen Seventy\nAnd killed today you know when when you and I were really little kid um that was when the world sort of open up and people started to see what was going on it was really in the seventies when people saw that Ethiopian famine I went to India for the first time when I was Nineteen years old in Nineteen eighty three is starving children [noise] and it was ghastly\nFrom Nineteen Seventy until today eighty percent of the world's poverty has been eradicated starvation level poverty has been eradicated no Seventy percent of Americans actually think that poverty is getting worse and the reason is because it's never\nBut front page and the New York times or any of the newspaper ... saved from poverty I mean that's not a news story you only see the things that are going wrong but the truth is that two billion of our brothers and sisters have been pulled out of starvation or poverty Glenn since you and our kids\nAnd there was one thing that did that and that was democratic capitalism and that is America's export to the world\nThere I don't think you would disagree with me Arthur um that we are not using the first task of wealth of nations moral sentiments we are we uh we have we think that capitalism is just going to be good no matter\nYou know who's wielding it and and it's just going to produce wonderful things no it as Adam Smith lines out it it can produce really bad things as well yeah capitalism depends on the people who are willing ... are wielding at but also uh depends on on what our goals are\nYeah slow and it's got wrapped now would you agree with that\nYeah that's well that's the problem is is not capitalism a lot of what we see today\nWired deals cronyism all the special stuff that's going on with powerful people in Washington D. C. and in every state Capitol around the country that's actually not competition that's trying to shut competition down on behalf of powerful people [laughter]\nSo so competition is good competition politics and economics and then the competition of ideas factor that\nYou know the ... the Glenn Beck show is part of the competition of ideas and a friend democratic nation is very very important [noise]\nAnybody wants to shut down and competition on behalf of powerful people\nIs not a competitor doesn't believe in capitalism doesn't believe in democracy and doesn't believe in the free exchange of ideas to compete means to do it better than the other guy barely peacefully and respectfully and to win over an audience and said that that's really what we ought to be doing and that's what we're moving away from\nOkay so Arthur I'm going to take a quick break and I want to come back with the question that I cannot find satisfactory answer on I Am a big believer in capitalism

talking about is this system even worth saving yesterday in politics it was a nightmare and people are just turned off by it and I think they just don't want anything to do with it on both sides of the aisle I think anybody who is\nIs a rational human being is like this is this is not good none of this is good\nUm yeah however ... ... we're not having any one stand up for the bill of rights the constitution that's why politics has got a ride because we've ... you know unpaid from that\nCapitalism is is got a horrible name you know have fifty percent of young voters\nSaying you know socialism is great I Want what they have over in Sweden but that's not what they have in Sweden isn't\nNo it isn't and and by the way there are some people standing in for the bill arise in the constitution guys like Glenn Beck you got a major megaphone and you're standing up for what's right and throwing good\nThe big problem is that there are too many people in media and politics and entertainment and aren't polls campuses on the right and the left ... dining out on the fact that we have a culture of contempt in this country contempt for each other\nI mean Glen you and I we both have and everybody listening to us we love people who disagree with us politically that's\nFine that's a good thing I mean we all should have friends and people that we were just really have to agree with them we should disagree strongly but we don't have to hate it when there are people that are making money and getting famous and getting powerful by trying to get us to hate each other even more we should be talking about these good things that you talk about\nThe things that really bring us together and then tried to disagree in a way that the competition can actually convince other people persuade other people of our ideas but\nThat's the big problem right now too many people are getting too rich by by getting us to hate our neighbors and that's not right\nSo Arthur let's have let's have the conversation I'm I'm somebody in college and I said capitalism is evil and you know there's nothing wrong with socialism socialism is graded works in the Netherlands\nYeah I Know so I hear I hear it all the time we saw him on college campuses all the time their way not to take that on is by trying to create liberal tears\nThat's the wrong way to do it is to attack somebody's motive and to say that their belief system is stupid that will you can never ever ever insult somebody into agreement and by the way it's an immoral thing to do because these are your brothers and sisters as well\nThe key thing to start off with an any argument is to acknowledge the objective the moral object to the people is to is to give voice to the fact that you you want these up social systems 'cause you want something more poor poor people have more equality where people have more opportunity right\nAnd get people to say yeah yeah yeah okay well let's figure out the best possible way to do it\nAnd then make a positive case for capitalism and democracy and free enterprise and entrepreneurship because it was lifted more people out of poverty in any system in human history it's created a system of of equal opportunity that nobody has ever thought of in the history of humanity and say [noise]\nAnd now the problem is not that this is an equal but ... we haven't actually tried to make it as equal as possible and push it all the way out to the periphery of society let's do that together\nCan you give the arguments 'cause most I think even most conservatives are sold on the the Netherlands or

certain candidate who's running for Minnesota attorney general really who's been a a credibly accused\nOr by a woman a he was dating now there is an interesting there's a little bit of a separation and we should be fair on this mhm there's a separation between the cabinet case in the aisles a case\nOf the cabinet case happens uh thirty six years ago the also the case was pretty much ongoing until very recently okay okay All right so there's a difference but that's the one difference ... a professor Ford she had a body memory\nIssued a very spotty memory now the uh the accuser um who we do not remember with Ford we have no even fence that there was a relationship of any sort between ... ...\nHaving a right we do know that a long term girlfriend of Keith Ellison has accused him of sexual abuse are intrinsically violin okay oh okay that really got both of those so the little do you remember where they happened uh you know she does remember when they happen okay and so does\nWhat did she ... she probably doesn't have notes from her doctor ... you know from the when she was talking to her doctor when the doctor gets it wrong of\nCourse well yeah well in their words case they both have a notes from there do they do get around those cases are the ... the forward case was something that was a Thirty years after the incident in which she referred to an attack by four people which is different than the story that she's telling now or never named Kavanaugh\nThe notes from ah the ah Alison Keith Ellison I'm a former girlfriend a doctor do name Keith Ellison as the reason why she's getting medical attention for physical injuries huh um and that's kind of a difference to you might you might notice a slight distinction\nBetween those two things one has notes or the don't ask don't actually named the accuser and it was you know many many many many many many years before and this is I'm going to the doctor to get medical treatment because this guy you they'll using meeting me\nYeah and so she and you know and and one one one case you have a woman who has photos\nOf the incident ... and has photos of bruising ... on her the other one of course does not um being forward she doesn't have that now there are there's a witness situation we need to deal with though of course I'm a Ford has name several people who were at the parties\nNone of them can remember it happening the people Ford named\nCannot say that they were actually at the party some of them have said I was not there some of them that I don't remember any party like that so there's a wide wide berth there between two opinions but she has named witnesses just none of them have corroborated her story in any way\nA key those in a girlfriend has also a named sources those people say the exact same thing and say they've seen evidence of the actual a crime going down um\nIncluding things like tax I'm writing um pictures and those are things that she showed two co workers\nIn real time in real time and had several people she told about it at the moment and again we have no one that forward told about it at the moment in fact in any moment of until at least two thousand twelve where it does not appear she actually he had like Kavanaugh said the name Kavanaugh even at that\nTime but but but lives and I mean you\nI mean you don't have videotape well there was a videotape now we haven't seen it yet though are now there is allegedly videotape that exist some one of these physical altercation we ... we have not seen it yet I'm of course there's no video of the calving off thing

creepy line and that is exactly the right name for it [laughter]\nIt is and it actually the creepy line comes from a speech that erupts Mitt Schmidt the CEO of Google gay but it was an interview in fact where he was asked how do you make these ethical judgments about how far you're going to go\nAnd then the interviewer actually asked Schmidt are you going to win plant things in our brain and Eric Schmidt's response was well we like to go right up to the creepy line but not cross it he said we're not going to implant anything in your brain at least not yet those are actually erupt Schmitz word and\nHe and his he's up to I find him incredibly Frank yes he he just he says it like it is yeah it's\nI I've interviewed him a couple of times and it is fascinating yes because he's just telling you he\nHe doesn't sugarcoat it and ah and I think it's his background as an engineer a and and he's sort of very direct I mean one of the other things we caught him when the film is saying is that Google or has and takes very seriously its responsibility to change the values\nOf American people uh you know Google's Monterey has always been they are more than just a company to make money or they have a certain ... certain world view and part of the reason that they structure of the company the way they did\nIn which the founders always have controlling shares is that that sense of social mission is part of it\nAnd Schmidt has been always very direct about saying it yes part of our mission as a company has been to try to shape and change the values of the United states and that sort of one of the premises of this film that it's not just about privacy it's not that they're taking all this information\nGlenn they're using that information against us to try to nudge us or to move us in directions there that we wouldn't ordinarily want to go\nOkay so um so let's continue tied this all to Kavanaugh and what we've seen with the Kavanaugh case and how for instance you know there's there's um\nA\n... there is this overwhelming uh understanding from half the country that he is absolutely guilty and she is a victim right and\nThere's a lot of information on the other side in fact more information on the other side but you're not really seen that\nRight yeah it's it's very hard because this is happening in real time right now to sort of monitor what's a Google doing but we can look at the past uh in fact one of the things we feature in the film is a study done by a Robert ... Stein a ... a very interesting guy he's a Harvard PHD in psychology studied under BF Skinner\nOr was the former editor in chief of Psychology Today magazine and by the way and this is very relevant was a Hillary Clinton supporter and twenty sixteen\n... one of the things he did and the twenty sixteen election was he had two thousand people around the country doing Google searches are and they monitored the results that people were getting this is a very ah you know a clear academic study and and this research was peer reviewed as his other work was\nAnd what came back was that Google was systematically skewing search results in favor of Hillary Clinton they were in other words they were us suppressing negative stories about Hillary in the algorithm and they were pushing them in favor of Donald Trump\nAnd ... point was I actually supported Hillary Clinton thought she was more qualified but the bottom line is a company should not be doing this and it secret you don't know that it's going on nobody is monitoring the results are getting their assuming the results in the list that they are getting is representative of some objective standard\nGoogle is a Google is a verb now that I'm not a noun verb auto Google it yes well I'm from Google it and the end the algorithm is giving you the answer that is viewed\nRight that's like going to a dictionary that will always changed the definitions of things but as it applies to whatever's happening in the world yes sacks real problem\nNo you're you're exactly right and so in the in the context of cabin on me and I don't know exactly well because it's occurring right real time but the bottom line is there is a history here of Google doing this it was it was leaked um uh a couple of weeks ago Tucker Carlson talked about a ...\nA about these internal emails where you actually had Google engineers saying hey you know what we don't light you know Trump's policy on immigration so we want to sort of us suppress certain stories\nUm this is a thing and Google does it end and here's the the the point that we try to make Glenn in this film and in general\nThe whole conversation that Google wants to have is about fake news and this debate about fake news here's here's the bottom line fake news is competitive\nIf you and I are having a disagreement about something I put up my fake news story and you say oh yeah I'm going to put my fake news story the pointed it out in the open you have combat and by the way the news doesn't really convince anybody you know if you like Hillary Clinton that fake news add that the Russians ran of Jesus\nAnd and and Hillary arm wrestling [laughter] probably not going to convince you voted a different way that wasn't that wasn't a real armor [laughter] but you know the point is is that that's not going to convince anybody because a confirmation\nBias you know people tend to look for information they want what Google is doing is different because we don't know what we don't know\nQuestion that we should be asking people the Google and Facebook is why will you not make your elders\nThe news you want to know Kavanaugh has gone to the age of fifty one the nose forty nine at the motion is agreed to\nBuckle your seatbelt should be confirmed them all\nDay in the know deep am seven Ninety two sides most stimulating\nTalk ...
