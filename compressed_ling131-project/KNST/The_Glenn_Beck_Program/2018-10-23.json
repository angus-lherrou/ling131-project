radio station\nA percentage of people who are really interesting the election only forty nine percent of Democrats Democrats got smoked um you said the same thing she thousand fourteen remember Democrats got smoked again they're Republicans fifty nine percent said they were really interested only forty eight percent of Democrats said that\nUm and what's interesting is leading up to I Would say Brett Kavanaugh\nYou had the same type of thing playing out\nAgain in this time in favor of the Democrats started to look a lot like two thousand six so up until ... you had sixty three percent of Democrats\nHighest levels of interest in the election Republicans was only fifty three percent so that is a you know a big it's the type of gap that leads you to lose the Senate ... ... and lose the house or at least makes it possible ...\nSince Kavanaugh that has changed Democrats have gone up from sixty three to Seventy two percent holy cow Seventy two is the highest number for any party and all of these elections\nHowever Republicans have jumped a higher percentage point basis from fifty three to sixty eight so now\nWe have a basically a balance a very close within the margin of error separation and both of those numbers sixty eight\nBe the second highest level of interest of all of these elections so the Democrats are Seventy two Republicans are sixty eight both of those numbers are the highest of any of these elections going back to two thousand six ... two thousand six midterms\nUm and I mean which is which is crazy\nIt is a a a week and there's a level here that we don't know what's gonna happen if we this is like you know this is territory that has not been seen before\nAnd ... you know while you can look at the polls and you can see the polls as we've talked about over the past couple of weeks relatively\nAre relatively pointing towards a Republican or a ... victory in the Senate where they maybe pick up a couple of seats and Republican loss in the house where they would lose a couple of seats um there is a you know what to look at kind of be optimistic way of looking at the house right now\nTo show you how close is if Republicans were just sweep the races they are favored in okay that that it's not going to happen it never happens but just kind of generally for understanding if they were able to sweep all of the races there favored in\n... and they revealed a when all of the races that they trailed by one point so all of these races are either\nVictories are toss ups right I mean they could go either way but if they were to sweep all of those Republicans still hold the house at two twenty two Fifteen now the problem is the idea that they're going to sweep all those races is\nWe know that's not going to happen it never happens the other thing is they will win some races where they're underdogs by more than one point they will win some place where the down by five in the polls winning some of those races\nSo the split it's going to be important here but just that gets them only to two twenty two Fifteen which is a I think they lose that than losing tens seats from where they are now\nUm but also a very narrow majority to the point where some conservative things could be derailed by just you know your generic moderate house member that you've never heard their name before um when they decide they're going to vote against the president so it's an interesting a way of looking at it\nAnd it shows that this really could go either way I mean when they say that there's about a twenty percent chance the Republicans lose the Senate and about a twenty percent chance that the Republicans when the house\nThat's the way they these models are all kind of looking at it twenty percent is one in five right um so it is very possible that one of these things can happen\nBut right now it looks like those are gonna wind up getting split and then of course still has ... even though you're not gonna be able to pass democratic bills because they would either give each other on the train in the house you're still gonna have investigative power to have subpoena power are going to have imposed\nA nightmare it's a nightmare and if if they get the house it's a nightmare okay so here's here's what I found interesting in um in watching the news and watching just the flow of it have you noticed that you\nKnow places like the Atlantic and the times and the post are now starting to publish stories about\nYou know it's an uphill battle to win some of these races in the house it's an uphill battle they have changed their tone from um you know an absolute positive well we're on a blue wave\nTo now almost laying the foundation of [noise] [noise] yeah well we lost but it was you know it was really kind of a long shot anyway\nYeah I mean I that's how badly I think the Kavanaugh saying a has backfired on them I mean it's made the Senate basically I mean again I just said it's one of the five chance but I mean they had they had a better chance at this uh two months ago\nI mean they had a legitimate path to victory when Cruz was only up by three points all of these races that looked like leaning Republican we're all toss up or in some of them looked like they might be leaning Democrats\nThey had a chance to win the Senate before the cabin I'll thing now I mean I think it's real I ... going to come to the independents how are the independence feeling at the ... in an interesting group because they're not as\nPassionate as you would expect in this environment so independence in two thousand six and two thousand ten were fifty percent\nIndependents are almost always going to be lower in a high interest in partisans because partisans engage more like typically I'm the type of course a blanket rule but it's typical I'm into doesn't fourteen it was down to forty percent and she doesn't eat uh Eighteen up until Kavanaugh was forty two percent\nAnd then uh the jump now to forty six percent so still that's not as high as some of the earlier elections among independents and that may just be because\nThey're overwhelmed with it and they don't they don't like either side and they just want it makes them want to withdraw from Palo yeah but I Wonder because I Would consider myself an independent yeah\nAnd there's no way you're going to keep me away from the polls\nAnd so I'm Wondering you know with that four percent jump was it a four percent yup or to present four percent jump I'm I Wonder how much of that or people like me who are going to vote for the Republican just because the left has gone insane\nRight and there's a lot of independents that I ... I mean I certainly would fall into this category as well right I Am not registered member of any party nor will I ever being right higher likelihood that being said uh you know I vote Republican I mean I you know don't vote for Democrats [laughter]\nSo I mean for Republicans independents\nAnd libertarians libertarians they don't vote for Democrats but yeah I mean so that's never going to happen so the fact that I'm an independent you can't look at that line as\nThese are people who could go either way at any time between these two parties that's not what that is right people who identify that way it's a group that that's growing and has been growing for quite some time yes people are bailing out of the parties [laughter] um but the parties themselves are becoming a more rigid in and more\nOf this one could come down\nTo the independence mhm this one could come down to because you can understand the Republicans going up you can understand if you're on the Democratic side Kavanaugh driving all those people but what's driving the independent\n... yeah ... ... that I mean\nWould think they discussed with what's going on right [laughter] if anything they don't like the overall system there's one other interesting it was sad to hear Glenn if we could yeah I'm as we're talking about the caravan\nOf of uh immigrants coming migrants whatever ... which will will be illegal immigrants if they if they get it all the way up by the way who who said that was coming uh\nOh yeah there's this burger yeah definitely we talked a lot about a lot about this uh interesting to see the numbers among Latino voters so ah in two thousand six were coming off of the attempt at comprehensive immigration reform that fails ... Republicans very upset about that Democrats win that election\nI'm going to give some of the facts of of this guy and it's not a conspiracy there was a conspiracy to commit murder to hide it and\nWe have found that now America needs some adults in the room to say okay that's a separate issue but let's not paint\n... into some freedom loving prince because that's\n... bacon bore your brain and Glenn Beck San ... am seven Ninety two sons most stimulating talk\n[noise]\nBring you the latest news and even ever have a fair and open process I think we have the votes they need to think that it will wrap let's say what you think about it or not the way\nWe can we live out here is up to you\nReally really had had this year is radio for thinking people radio show is a conduit for thinking people a better way to know what's going on in the bay and seven\nNinety two sides most stimulating toss\nEither Gerald Lewis Mr Han does making happy hour rate again no matter what it is especially Thursday if he needs the motivation to dollar beers from five to six only three dollars after that sushi place starting in just four dollars and happy hour extended until eight PM\nWell some of the delicious steak and lobster options at the ... which is the perfect way to celebrate any occasion and don't forget every Thursday is Han as the Senate happy hour's Mr on this are on board\nWho to fill it Mr on Tucson dot com\nHides Garrett Lewis said mad at me homes it's your home your way and now for a limited time when you buy a new Miami home get fifty percent off of design options and upgrades with savings up to Fifteen thousand dollars\nFor the ... homes built by you sales have been from creating your dream kitchen with beautiful granite countertops just selecting the perfect flooring the choice is yours making your madam you home perfect in every way to look at all of the communities in models got mad at me homes dot com slash Tucson\nWhose retirement or you investing for yours for your brokers it may seem like a silly question but it's worth addressing did you know many brokers sell products such as variable annuities are mutual funds with high internal charges off in his highest three percent or more per year\nIf you're not happy with your performance it maybe because of all the hidden fees with these like this you may be doing a better job paying your broker\nVenue herself my name is Jeff junior president of the region wealth if you have a four O. one K.

want to rule\nUh with jihad and they also want to rule with surreal law\nWe don't we don't want any either of those\nSo now let's put this into perspective Saudi Arabia horrible place horrible horrible horrible horrible place they execute kids\nAs long as you've shown any kind of signs of puberty you're tried as an adult they execute through beheading ... there was a woman who was raped gang raped by seven men not sure if one of them was Supreme Court justice Kavanaugh yet\nUh but uh Saudi were woman was gang raped by seven men\nThey each got you know between two and nine years in

I'm Out of the many one right we don't have a whole bunch of one right now we don't have a shared sense of what you've just said the first amendment is the beating heart of the American experiment freedom of religion freedom of the press freedom of assembly freedom of speech right of protest\nAll of those things flow from a fundamental assumption about the dignity of three hundred and twenty million Americans which is\nWe believe Margot day we believe that our citizens are created in the image of God with eternal souls and with dignity\nThat way bigger than their policy preferences and so what's unique in our mall but I think the grand tension that we as a people are not really wrestling through that is so far upstream from politics is this tension between rudeness and ruthlessness almost\nAll of the happiness literature a few well out there it's confirming stuff that wise people people who've had grandparents have known for millennia\nWhich is that happiness is actually a relatively simple equation do you have a nuclear family do you have a couple of deep friendships or do you have a local worshipping community you have a theological framework to make sense of death and suffering and forest and statistically the number one driver of happiness\nIs do you have meaningful vocation do you have shared work do you have co workers do you think when you leave home on Monday morning when you go to do something not to make a lot of money or do you have a lot of status but\nIs there some neighbor who benefits from what I Do if\nThose four things are true or even if three of the four true\nYou're pretty likely to be happy and that those things are all tied to rudeness but we're living through a technological revolution that's tempting us to believe that we can be ruthless we can be place less and so a lot of what's happening is the undermining of local community and the undermining of stick relationships and the undermining of vocation or long work\nUm ends up in a world where a lot of people are using political tribalism to fill a void of the loneliness that's actually happening in their local community I think we need to reflect more deeply on that

happiness\nBecause our nation was built on life\nLiberty pursuit of happiness and no one talks about that I Do all the time everything I'm Talking about is to try to make people more happy or to at least allow them to pursue happiness sorry so tell me about that let's start there sure um we talk I talk about for example there there are many controversies that I talk about uh education\nI I have a complete revamp the education system and people just want to keep funding the same system I'm making hemp and the candidates legal I hang up before it surely slips let's start with me I should go into education absolutely I'm the one talking about getting rid of all standardized testing prior to high school\nI Know and talking about doing that because they're nice testing is it unfair way of getting teachers\nIt's an unfair way of rewarding schools and it makes kids who are ten eleven twelve years old feel stupid because they can't test well ... and there's no indication of success and what are we finding the funding literally kids we we have a thirty percent rise in suicide across the entire nation to include children\nOne of those reasons is family court how broken that is but another reason is there pressure to take tests and feel stupid and to be some become successful at ten eleven twelve years old\nWhy so nice testing is very good when you're in high school and joined way you should go where your book liberties are not a bad idea but ten years old why is to keep control of what's happening in the schools\nI'm not okay with that now you have a bit of gray hair as I Do know that means you are in school prior to Nineteen eighty and it was I\nProudly Nineteen eighty there really was a department of education I mean it existed but it was basically a repository for information about what he was really do anything ... somehow everyone in in in the United states somehow learn how to read write\nSurvive in the world without and at a department of education somehow that work somehow local school district did a good job somehow that worked out of the Internet you add a technology you think the odds are worse\nLet me give you a quick rundown of every single time centralized control has made things better\nFinished [laughter] yeah right so that's not really what I Want I Want to I Want to make sure that we have some localized central and the only guy saying let teachers teach then I don't administrators because here's the problem with getting ready so nice testing you will lose about ... we will lose in New York state we will lose about four billion dollars in federal funding\nIt's a lot of money but isn't that much for us our budget is sixty billion\nSo losing four billion not into the world however we can still fixed that here's the issue here when we lose at four billion we also lose something else we lose all those strings attached that for a million and there's lots of strings\nWhich means administrators go away and then it shows while riding granted but it shows you a check and boxes all those things we have massive teacher burn out in New York state massive why\nRegulations rules checking boxes I'm the only one saying these things because I crossed the entire state and I think that's easy to counties across all city to\nGet the full sharply by the way for you though but I Want teachers to actually want to teach we actually have districts that have more minutes raiders then teachers\nThe average teacher and that's a shame for by the way you have a teacher makes about eighty thousand dollars a year in New York state and the average diminish makes over a hundred and fifty among you dump a couple of minutes raiders you've had more teachers you've given raises you bought computers all these things but I'm Still not done\nWhy in the world we have K. through twelve neat K through ten\nThe last two years of high school for too many kids is Jim study hall video games and probably smoking weed ... that's all they're doing how do we know this\nBecause the first year of college for most kids is their teeth grade it's removed because not ready for it correct so now it takes at least six years the average kid to graduate college was terrible now got twenty four year old kid who's never had a job and we say and wonder why hasn't the work ethic\nWe've got a job it is he's been he's been he's been screwing around for eight years literally now I have people who tell me literally Larry I Will hire anybody with a work ethic\nAnd one ... told me he said Laurie my interview process is a very simple I tell them to show up at eight o'clock I open the door if they're there they're hired\nAnd that's how bad it is people show up at the clock in the morning it is so that so we need to break that system now I Can't change parenting that I Can't do what kind of changes or the environment of course at sixteen now instead kitchen that five choices they they take a test\nThey get a ... a plumber number one if colleges right for you that's amazing go to college the problem is we've been told ally\nAnd the lie is the only way to have success in this country is to get a great high school diploma and then go to a great college and then sit behind a desk in front and the computer all day ... that's a way to success not even close to the only way to success lots of people are happy doing all types of things and we should embrace that so it's sixteen let's not make some decisions\nIf I think called you right for me I go to a two year prep school to prep schools is that a biology chemistry history whatever break off to college I go two years and I make sure it's working right so that time I get into college and ready I graduate in three or four years and take advantage of internships are incubator life is good\nI don't like that no worries on the super smart kid the kid who you know loves doctor I'm teasing my doctor who fan\nI'm a doctor who then we go back to the gate sure about the new doctor do you know being a female but that's a different story\nDown okay yeah I'm so that kid who's really smart that can take the SAT right away and goes off and get to a degree why should they be bored in school and they should be born school\nNext you don't want any of those things now worries go to a two year trade school\nGo to trace could become a plumber a carpenter whatever you want to be about mechanic an H fat guy in New York state particularly we need that desperately\nThe average tradesmen in New York state is over fifty ... that's a problem I Love my six year old I'm fifty a ... year old my problem is that they should not be the average they should not be doing all the work they should be tried in the youngsters and you can't find enough and Yossi to doing it's a problem\nSo do that you don't like that will get a job\nWhy not go learn ... work ethic now at sixteen I worked at sixteen I Know lots of people in my generation if they can go work learn what it means to have a boss\nLearned means when your boss says show up at eight that doesn't mean nine thirty that actually mean seven forty five learn that now is sixteen Seventeen Eighteen get some experience loudly sounds great how do you pay for\nNew York state constitution tells me I have to pay for grades one through twelve right I'll pay for the last two years to I still pay for him here so I Do it I'm a marine when I got a Marine Corps I had a GI Bill they gave me X dollars and why years to use the same thing here you're sixteen you got twenty thousand dollars seven years to use good luck his on his wife ... going to happen\nA bunch of cool prep schools will pop up a bunch of great trade schools will pop up yes how much they'll costs for two years yeah twenty thousand dollars ... well I don't know they'll pop up because it's guaranteed government money what banks love most guaranteed government money yes they do so they will absolute give loans to many schools pop up it'll be amazing\nThere's the best part when he schools pop up now spending ten thousand dollars per kid per year these last two years the ... state spends twenty two thousand dollars per year per kid so we're saving twelve thousand dollars each\nTwelve thousand times the four hundred thousand eleven twelfth graders is more than four billion dollars\nWe've said all of the federal funds we've removed tons of administrators we've given teachers or a ... a better chance to actually teach we've given teachers freedom to do what they feel it's appropriate we've got rid of Common Core ah we've made teenagers who are unhappy happier and this goes to the next level which is school safety\nIf you look at all the school shootings we've had while they are murders added at their core that public suicide they're unhappy kids ... ethnic or the unhappy kids ... now thinking about this a lemon twelfth grade you're in eleventh twelfth grader you're in a class with everyone who wants to be there\nTo build their kid isn't there the bully kids in something else the kids a bully because he doesn't want to be there that's why he's a bully but now he go someplace else you a teacher lemons fourth grade this one problems almost go away why\nAll the kids want to be there they've taught was killing children isn't guns was getting our children is lack of community lack of purpose and loneliness that's coming on

changing everything when technology has changed everything\nWhy we're still looking at a system ah you know that feels like the old Soviet size styles centralized system is beyond me but I'm Larry let me let me just run down a couple of things um you are if you were governor of the state of New York you are dealing with\nThe big banks mhm uh and the big banks a\nCuomo is pushing them around quite a bit especially when it comes to the second amendment a and trying to de platform ah people if you do any business with with gun manufacturers or gun dealers\nTotally on ethical for governor to impede business period\nIfs ands or buts if I don't like in the industry or like something I never said if I Want to our freedom of speech but when it comes to being governor I should have the opposite I should be the facilitator and chief I should be the marketer and chief\nNot not his majesty emperor who decides these people are evil because I deem it so that's the wrong answer that's what he's doing the reality of it is he's always not only\nDoing that she's also threatening another group of business people that you'll be in trouble with the state if you do business with these\nYes absolutely and and what winds up happening more than ... more than more than often it's normal thing which is the small guy gets hurt here because big business will always find a way around his edicts right they always they find a way around it but how about the guy who say for example just wants to insurance force firearm now we can't get it\nThere's no way that the individuals and there are at least for me and I'm gun owners in New York state if not more well how do they need insurance now\nWhen when when insurance companies won't do business in New York state anymore for any kind a firearm but that's the plan isn't it that's the problem yeah and that's the unethical part that's the issue right and this is you're making New York state residents criminals\nNot just that if it's a gun violation in New York state it's by default a violent felony by the fault no matter what you do that's how it works in New York state you're turning millions of New Yorkers into violent felons

of a firearm make it legal or illegal ... literally ... what he decided\nI think this piece of plastic is evil so this piece of plastic which is now he but which by the way you purchase the day before a complete legally totally above board you are now a violent felon\nWas so bad that the cops said wait a minute now we're all violent felons to not joking is true story they had an out revamp the law because all the cops were felons overnight yes all the cops worth ... revamped or because of that in other words but it now if you are retired cop went you retire well now you're a felon again because you know I could have come up\nThis is this is where we are in New York state this is horribly bad the the the answer isn't always the same thing it is all about projecting how he is helping the
