start to say wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute you starting to see people back the Republican Party you're seeing people start to back this entire process as being a sham\nBecause we allowed

here on ...\n[noise] you're listening to the Glenn Beck program [noise] go to Brian in Colorado hello Brian how are you\nGood how are you doing very good thanks for calling in what's on your mind\nYes so quick question just kind of going off of your book now with the whole cabinet and going on all the attention seems to have turned away from Trump 'cause there's no outrage there all the outrage is a cabinet I'm just kind of wondering how you do the interplay between that\n[noise] um because Kavanaugh is an easier target because Donald Trump has not responded in the fashion that they probably expected him to respond and the reason why\nI Would imagine is because you know he doesn't have a you know a good record on speaking about you know moral issues\nAnd so somebody has said how shop and\nHe has that has that has given him real power because\nAll the Trump is a is involved on this is is he going to keep standing and because he has a ... fine yeah he's standing and that's what the president needs to do at this point and it is also allowed for the very first time\nIt's given a spine to the Republicans\nSo they had to go after cabinet what what else are they going to do he's the he's the target but Kavanaugh also has remained cool um until it was really appropriate had he come out and made crazy you know angry statements prior to\nKnow but his his timing of being angry is not a sign that he has a reckless temperament it was appropriate for the time if you were thinking human being and you'd you are looking at things\nFor you're looking at the facts level you completely connected with Kavanaugh's opening statement where he said this is ridiculous you have destroyed me you've destroyed my family he made a statement that was full of facts refuting the things that she had said it was totally appropriate\nWhat's the result the result is I think Kavanaugh is going to a win the nomination\nIf he does and it will be ... be because a Republican or maybe a couple of Republicans lose their spine because there is there are no facts\nOn this so they lose their spine\nThey do it they will be losers in this\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnybody who had any recollection of this and in fact the woman who even brought it forwards said she couldn't remember who it was she couldn't remember it was Brett Kavanaugh she just remembered it a couple of weeks ago that it was

say they don't have anyone who was there it was people who said they heard about it at the time so it was one person comes and says I have a witness I Know this person they they'll do about it at the time listen to this quote from the story is is incredible\nThe the the person who was in the story says he initially asked to remain anonymous because you hope to make contact first with a classmate who did the best of his recollection told him about the party and was an eyewitness the incident so the source of this person coming to the New Yorker he I Want to talk to that person to confirm it\nHe said that he had not been able to get any response from that person despite multiple attempts to do so okay really shady why would you put that in ... listen to this extent it's remember this article was printed\nThe New Yorker did reach the classmate and he said he had no memory of the ...\nOh my gosh I mean they ... they are so desperate to get this guy off the Supreme Court that they will do anything\nRonan Farrow is Burt is lighting his career out of fire right now so you got to stop the here is the best thing\nDonald Trump has done during this whole thing he has allowed to the

family in our country and a David it's great book and everybody should everybody should read it again it's a\nA book that is talking about the steps that you take right now and what I Love about this David is\nA let's just start on the millennial step ... um I have seen this work you know it's kind of my book is a ... I put it into action myself in my own life and I've seen it work\nYou've done the same thing and you've seen this work with millennials talk about the millennials\nMillennials right now are one of the reasons we have a curious or dangerous moment because we have two hundred and forty two years of being an American nation under the declaration three ... two hundred and thirty one on the constitution donations ever survive that long and so we just kind of think will always be here\nAnd yet at the same time you have fifty five hundred years of recorded history and there's never been a socialist nation that's increased ... freedom or increase prosperity and yet right now Seventy five percent of students in college support socialism bubble forms of government we cannot survive if that becomes the believe when they become leaders\nAre and and the same way for out of five millennials believe there is no absolute moral truth\nMan if we can agree that things like rape and murder or wrong you get no chance for having a nation in the future you got fifty three percent of millennials who believe that free speech should be limited Nineteen percent who believe that violence is a riot response to ... to free speech you don't like you you can't survive as a nation so that's why we call it a bit curious moment but when you look at millennials\nThey are really um easy to change relational angry they are hungry if you if you create a relation and one on one relationship but they really don't care about your age they don't care about how you look at the care about whether you're sincere\nAnd if you are sincere and say and what we found works so well there's just asking questions because they really have had a low dumped on them by their professors and by the culture and they've not thought it through and when you start asking them questions and ...\nTrying to win that's where I'm not trying to win just just like I just I just ... that's an interesting thing let me ask you a question how does whatever villain the blank they start to engage and and they I find that they actually\nThey actually um\nBegin to move toward you faster\nAnd not not just blindly accepting things but because you are engaging them and asking them to think as long as you're not trying to win and try nobody does that that's where in college they're being told what to think join in\nChance to this and and if you have any other thoughts so when you challenge them\nThey actually like that it's the first time anyone has done it\nThey they really do respond to thinking well and watch it gets going there killer weather ... really\nI'm Sorry that's an old school or you know I'm Sorry I was right I I Can't say that running that it that out yeah that's right but they really are and they're the most of all groups in polling for the hundred years have been no point they're the most relational group\nIn American history was I mean they they respond more to relationship for example there are the only group in polling that wants to spend more time with her boss\nEverybody else wants to spend time with the ... and get away from boss or whatever they want time they want to be ... I mean they they they have a desire to spend one on one time with people who can influence them and help them and thanked them now that's not necessarily their motivation but what is interesting is they respond really really well to that\nAnd and she said she wrote a report and he said you are either a liar and you're going to get an F\nOr this is the best paper see me in my office that's right and she he said okay I Want to talk to you about your sources and she had him nailed down and so she had never here's a professor ... didn't know this stuff\nAnd economics professor and he found out that founding father John Witherspoon had the greatest impact of any person in American history and American economics and he didn't know that and she showed him that and then shut them the documentation and he said okay I I Want more because I clearly did not\nBut that's the thing of asking questions with relationships and we take these these guys\nThat come in hostile or otherwise\nAnd just because of relationships and as we tell them we have a lot of fun with them I'm quite frankly we tell them that sarcasm I Love language if we don't make fun of you it's because we don't like you know there's so so you know we we we kid and joke and they have a great great time\nBut they come out transform and there are some of the most mature individuals and these these guys are all\nIt's in their mind to become leaders and I tell you they are so so good and it's just amazing\nWe were at a meeting in February and we I don't think I've notes this formally uh may I may go for it um we are going to do black history month a museum here at our studios in February if you don't think that's a little controversial\nBut we have worked on this and we're working on it with the Lincoln museum and uh it's going to be a little mind blowing and really really eye opening to a lot of people on both sides\nUh and it's black history but you know not all the black history that everybody knows let's tell the black history that really nobody knows\nUh and that's going to be here at our studios in the month of February and yesterday we decided that because they're they're gonna we're gonna have do since we're gonna have people that are going to tell these individual stories about these people in here on stage Nineteen as you come through\nAnd they're all going to be I said yesterday let's get some of the kids that we met there even Fifteen Years old that just we'll learn it and really know it it's really quite exciting just seen millennials what happens when they're on least and told them through ...\nHere and brains getting quite a workout Glenn Beck San ... am seven Ninety two sons most stimulating talk\n[noise] I've never seen a ... or ... some people never shut up [laughter] and\nThat's just the way we like it came down and have a conversation continues twenty four seven\nSo much to say it loud enough time to\nGain empty I Am Seventy [laughter]\nThursday October boring what's new today on the free our radio a radio\nFor decorating gorgeous setting\nSpicy platelets has joke tracks with labor is fine with no after day\nSwing mystery ... whether you're at home or the stadium knew why our radio brief awfully only collection that come out no\nGuarantees are based on the clean spending ability of the issue an insurance company if you have money sitting in the bank doing nothing or you're concerned about the recent market volatility listen up as I Am one of the highest guarantees with an annuity I have seen in my lifetime my name is Jeff junior with trading wealth\nAnd you could receive up to a Fifteen Percent bonus and ten percent per year guaranteed income growth\nThat's right up to a Fifteen Percent bonus and ten percent per year for up to ten years for income these high guarantees won't last long so now is the time to act\nReceive up to a Fifteen Percent bonus just for opening an account and up to ten percent per year guaranteed income growth how fast is life come out you\nDon't procrastinate get up to a Fifteen Percent bonus and ten percent guaranteed income growth immediately these are some of the highest guarantees I have ever seen and they won't last long call today three two one forty one hundred\nThree two one forty one hundred or is it true raging wealth dot com\nIs looking pretty good for Brett Kavanaugh right now so you know there's going to be mass\nHysteria from the other side I'll get you caught up on all the latest tomorrow morning starting it six ten right here on ...

Alexander Hamilton was when he came from West End these ... another and these guys said and ... I made the debates are great they said look when we got here\nIf we had voted we would have voted the way that we were thinking from the west indies and Ireland and elsewhere in Paris butler said you should not be allowed to vote until fourteen years here because you need to learn to think like in America\nOh my gosh with the Texas needs to do that with Californians always oh you're right ... ... ...\nYou were going to lose Texas because of the Californians they are just going to vote the way they voted out and we are not the same place that's what\nWe're not the same play it on and they think like California is right hey so wild so Alexander Hamilton said five years and that's what they went with was five years but you could not vote in America until you've been here five years otherwise you would turn this place into wherever you just left\nNo anchor babies citizen goes citizenship goes from parents to child not to chai not child's parent\nWow security risk can be deported and permanently banned from the United states the government must protect the borders during times of war states will have a definite role in immigration so that is what they that's what they original immigration law okay ... I found it fascinating\nIn the book that we have\nArgued as if these things were not settled long ago and we have argued a common language how dare you insist as if this was just some idea that a bunch of racist had\nYeah Ben Franklin is a great example because Ben Franklin talked about how so many Germans are moving in Pennsylvania and they were\nAnd he said the problem is they're speaking their own language there started to create signs in German their truck started to create documents in German you can't have a nation if you don't speak the same language so Franklin was one of the first ones out that Thomas Jefferson the same thing\nHe said we have immigrants coming in which is great and by the way they were so pro immigration than in the declaration of independence one of the twenty seven grievances was were separating from Great Britain because he's trying to stop immigration we won't immigration it's just we wanted a simulation with immigration they were huge pro immigration\nMy patriots supply is the ... are the people that if they helped me with my food storage and I remember being overwhelmed by it I don't even know how to start seizing they'll help you\nEveryone in your household should have a four week emergency food to it there's a special on 'em right now you'll save a hundred dollars when you go to my special website prepare ...

revisionist history a and this season he did one on memory and as we are all talking about the memories that you know everybody had in high school I'm not being at a ...\nI don't want to put Malcolm in this situation where I'm asking him to say who do you believe maybe he'll say it I don't know but I'm not going to ask him ah I just want to go over the evidence of how bad memory is for every\nOne that he has he did extensive work on it and\nIt is shocking\nHow ... I don't even know if my parents were my parents [laughter] it's really amazing how our memories can change and how most of our memories do change overtime Malcolm Gladwell on the program next

blaze I we've seen a huge change here from people who have taken really factor it's been a huge made a huge difference for people all around the office people who have been dealing with pain for a really long time\nOr Glenn of course among them a concert taken really factor I don't know maybe a year ago and you know about a year ago right around Christmas Time okay and you were a big skeptic of it and decided to buy your white I don't mean to you and\nYou know et cetera herbal remedy shut up all its vitamins whatever [laughter] do you tell where health but yeah ... um but it's a hundred per cent drug free it's created by Dr for king greetings to help your body a fight against inflammation\nIs where the pain comes from most of our pain comes from information and if you can keep the information down you you really will dramatically affect your pain I took it for three weeks I'm Still taking it today\nThese are not citizens of character these are these are just facts of human memory and recently so often want to make someone's faulty memory into a test that there\nAre of their character and I think that's a mistake that's a you know there are people who deliberately lie absolutely but a lot of what we think might be deliberate lying is just a manifestation of the um the frailty of human memory\nSo I really don't want to get into politics on this but I I Do want to ask you this question to see if the way I'm\nWhen I when I finished with the hearings last week I felt okay I think she believes that and it may have happened that way I don't know\nAnd I failed Brett Kavanaugh I Believe he believes that they both could be telling the absolute truth correct\nYeah yeah yes they both I don't think either of them are deliberately line I think means that the uh the thing about memory is that we ... honestly believe that this is what happened even though it is and you know my best friend Bruce\nI honestly believe I met him on the first day of first grade\nI can picture in my mind he honestly believe that we met in the principal's office at the end of first grade and we didn't we didn't even meet throughout entire that dire you're right this is what are the most important events in my life my best friend\n... and we're off by eight months and he thinks we bet because we had got into a fight and I think he came up to introduce themselves or we're best friends you know from the beginning like I you know I Am I I'm not lie about it it's what I remember it but one of us completely made up at Emory from ...\nIn fact when you were talking about the nine eleven study there were people who came back ten years later they rode out the who you know within a few days if I'm not mistaken was it a few days or was it a year or after nine eleven\nThe original writing well the original time they they went to the next day\nOkay so the next day they asked them to write out exactly where they were what happened ten years later some of them said I don't know why I even wrote that this is a lie this is not what happened and I I don't know why I was lying then and they were convinced\nSomehow or another they made something up that was different than what they knew to be true now\nYeah people ... ... what are the most important things that memory researches will tell you is you cannot confused confidence with accuracy in other words the fact that I Am absolutely certain that\nWhat happened that what happened happened is not a reliable guide to its accuracy um so you can't like so I Am convinced that my friend Bruce on the first day that should that does not mean it's more likely to be true that if I said\nYou know if I if I expressed it with more doubt I'm Sorry I think what it is a lot of what this the lesson of all this is is that we just need to approach\nOur memories are and not just our memories our entire lives with a lot more humility\nUm you can't\nWe're not ... our our brains are not Superman [laughter] they don't they're not we don't have a video recorder up they're taking on everything perfectly you know and we need to\nWhen I say I remember something one way I Need to be a need to check it and to talk to others I Need to be open to the possibility I might be wrong I Need to that's why we have\nLegal systems and investigators and right to to compensate for the fact that our memories are not what we would like them to be\nEveryone outs list take it outside of this political nightmare\nNotice me too movement I think has been very good on whole it's been very good but I Am concerned about the um the women need to be believed I don't care if it's a man or woman no they need to be heard and taken seriously\nBut we can't just believe what someone says\nFor a myriad of reasons ah and I fear it's dangerous this road that we're going down because you know we we need more than just your word and your memory because what you might believe that's true but it might not be\nYeah well it's funny I'm this is exactly the point that Ronan Farrow you know the the the journalist who has been a responsible more so than anyone else for breaking needs to be two stories I went to see him give that up a public interview and he was he was interviewing um\nThe actress who was the source I forgot her name of course 'cause my memory is ripe all taking them to the source of any of\nThe meat to allegation and they were talking about this very point and he very explicitly said my job as a journalist is not to believe that women\nIt is to listen to them and then trying ... corroborate too careful reporting those aspects of their story that our our carpet at their stories to care for reporting and if I Can't corroborate them that I Can't\nWrite the story right my job as a reporter is to compensate for the frailty of human memory and that is that is a beautiful um a way of expressing what the responsibility of media and investigators is in these cases is\nOkay someone has gone clearly believes they've gone through something very traumatic that's systematically trying to figure out I I did it happen that way and if it didn't happen that way that is not then judge the person and say there were a liar\nRight that's the crucial part\nWhen it's like it is we we can't lose our humanity over this we have to say wait to see if we do an investigation and it's not the way that person says we have two very respectful they say um you have you and like all of us have a memory that isn't perfect\nThat would be wonderful if we lived in that world\nBut the ... I Am I'm so concerned that and you set it now twice and it is it was what made me successful in the first place and I am so glad that I have discovered how dangerous it is certitude\nUm that we are a population that is certain about everything and it's good to have a core set of beliefs and principles\nBut you must be open to hear\nNew information and on other information that doesn't give you\nA ... ... ... ah what is a cognitive dissonance is good and it's good to have it that's a sign that something in you isn't isn't quite right don't shout he threw it stop backing the cubs step back and go okay\nWhich one of these two don't fit with the principal I Believe do I need to change\nThe principal or do I need to\nThrow out that that information that I'm that I'm now acting on right now but that's what people don't want to do that\nYeah I thought you know it's funny I had a conversation last night with a friend of mine who was a Mormon and who was talking about the tradition and the um among Mormons of keeping journals\nWhich I had not known about ... I'm ... years and years and years of journals and she was talking about what that means for when you have a contemporaneous account of\nOf your life your feelings your actions you or interpretations of what you've done you can go back and it it is obviously serves a function far greater than simply checking your memory yeah but it's a way of keeping yourself on is\nThat what I loved about that was that that notion of if we live in such a kind of difficult and flawed world than we have to take responsibility for our own stories\nAnd that to me what is what the\nUm what what that tradition of keeping a journal is about it says it's\nThis has been interesting about the cabinet thing is because those on the left here and you know the prominent ones in the left have been so\nI mean I Want to use the technical term bonkers [laughter] on the story so over the top so ridiculous in so many ways\nUm it has taken it has increased you know enthusiasm for Republicans which will be something you'd expect but it's also taking people who are already planning to vote and changing their minds towards Kavanaugh\nAnd that is something just because it I don't even know if it's because of details of these stories it's because one side looks unhinged and the other one doesn't is what you talked about an hour once a day\nHe is the point of addicted to outrage and this Kavanaugh the hearing and the way the Republicans and Donald Trump of played it is perfect is perfect\nIt is the plan in addicted to outrage Rand works on\nDriving while board is way too dangerous Glenn Beck's on gay and as the AM seven Ninety two sons most stimulating talk\nOr you were facing foreclosure\nDum dum tremendously I'm calling because we're more to try and reach people keep [noise]\nNo no I'm Cuba [laughter]\nOr talk to the right people speak it had to print having cancer free of charge at eight eight eight nine Ninety five hope ... by neighbor works in America and the ad council\nWhose retirement or you investing for yours for your brokers it may seem like a silly question but it's worth addressing did you know many broker sell products such as variable annuities are mutual funds with high internal charges often as high as three percent or more per year\nIf you're not happy with your performance it maybe because of all the hidden fees with these like this you may be doing a better job paying your broker venue herself\nMy name is Jeff junior president of the region wealth if you have a four O. one K.
