like to say is you know I keep hearing about that the media lying and that's all we get is there information they you know they're dominating the news surface all live well why don't we get more

I check those seven or eight and I feel\nFairly well informed to start my day and then throughout the day I check those websites for information I Can't pay attention to the so called mainstream media it's too much for me I Can't watch it drives me nuts but but I think there's a formation out there but you have to be a little more proactive and finding it\nAnd if you watch the our TV dot com and you and your own Newsmax Daily Caller Daley wire Drudge Report I think you're good to go\nI agree except without referring to is that mainstream media where people don't have the intelligence and meet they don't go to that effort because they're they're on the fence they don't wanna ever conservatism is we need to get out there it'd be a competing like the local news and the mainstream media we need to get in there\nYou know Chris I I tell you what would happen money controls everything if CBS or ABC said\nFrom top to bottom from the top of the tree through the root system we're gonna have conservative viewpoint on all of our ah channels can you imagine the ratings skyrocketing say at CBS News if\nThey determine they're gonna do television much like one of America's network or Newsmax or see our TV\nIf CBS would say we're going to cover news objectively moderate\nTo the right side of things wouldn't they make billions of dollars because you can't NBC ABC and CBS it's the same news casts every night at six thirty if one of them would go against the fracas and reflect the values the once and the whims and the wishes\nOf the majority of the American people wouldn't we be better off and when they make a lot of money\nYeah well where are the people that are being proactive enough to do that to get into the mainstream these radio shows on TV because they're taking to the choir we need to change minds like kind of starting to go out and go on these mainstream media I think we can tell if you've got to go there\nYes and and it's okay to come and be all with me it's okay to do Fox or do my friend Sean Hannity\nNow mark ... may get them on on a Sunday night on Fox on the radio but but\nHe needs to go out and this guy is wonderful the sixty minutes interview he took was least all apart on Sunday I thought it was fabulous and he's he's his own but the guy's amazing in his presence he looks to be fifty and not Seventy in his presence\nYou know it's like it's like being with Elvis and Nineteen sixty eight in a while it's like the Beatles on the Ed Sullivan show it's like Beyonce metlife stadium this is a superstar when you get in the presence\nOf Trump it's like the messiah it's it's unbelievable and I've never seen this in politics I wasn't old enough during the Kennedy era Ronald Reagan yes\nThough we have Bill O'Reilly coming up in about an hour I'm going to be gone for the next couple of days and and the bill is going to come in and give us a rundown of the week so far and we have a lot to discuss one of them is Saudi Arabia this story is just getting more and more bizarre\nLet me bring you up to speed in case you don't know\nThe story started a couple of weeks ago with this idea that this Washington Post reporter is suddenly missing well he's not a Washington Post ... a reporter only\nHis name is ... and uh he is a Saudi Arabian citizen he is also a member of the Muslim Brotherhood\nHis beef with Saudi Arabia in his own what he called self imposed exile is all about the Saudis\nNot to be friending and not I'm not excusing the behavior of the Muslim Brotherhood the\nSaudis are very clear that the Muslim Brotherhood is a terrorist organization and not a friend\nTo Saudi Arabia or really any one in the world so he went into self imposed exile a and he came here to the United states the there are claims that he is he he was\nStill a Muslim Brotherhood operative there are also\nClaims that he was feeding us information or a a a against the Muslim Brotherhood I'm not sure which to believe at this point\nSo he's overseas he's in Turkey and he is going to get married but he's been divorced to his wife in Saudi Arabia for him to be able to get remarried he has to have a a divorced certificate from Saudi Arabia\nThe Saudi Arabia and say well you're going to have to come into the embassy to get it now he is not a friend\nTo the Saudi Arabian prince the one who is banned this big reformer and he's going to you know take Saudi Arabia end of the future and he is good for women and he is good for human rights and everything else\nIs shaggy is not popular with that prince and that prince has not been popular with ... they he had been trying to get Chicago is a a shaggy to come back to Saudi Arabia but ... I knew I Would probably be a death sentence to me\nHe takes his fiance they get into a car and they uh drive up to the embassy the Saudi embassy in his ...\nHe says I'm going to go in I'm going to get the paperwork they're expecting me I'll be right back out wait for me so she did ours pass she starts to call the embassy she calls his phone no answer nothing\nIs it turns out a Saudi Arabia first denied that any of this happened um but uh we now know that they are about to admit we don't know to what extent\nUm but it looks as though he was interrogated tortured and killed he was then hacked into pieces and thrown onto a Saudi plane in suitcases and what happened from there we don't know\nNow there's an additional update today we have our secretary of state over in Saudi Arabia meeting with the king and the crown prince who are now saying privately that yes this was just somebody who went rogue\nMm but it's kind of hard to believe\n\n[noise] the new information today you know is is coming from turkey so we don't know if this is true or not\nThere were two stories or one of the United states came out pretty quickly or last week when this story broke and said we have evidence that this was ordered by Saudi Arabia and he is dead\nUm but they never released where that came from they just released that this was a U.S intelligence sources say\nThat was the first Nick then the Turks came out and said that they had audio and video tape of this man's interrogation torture and killing\n\nI don't know if they do there is a possibility that they have microwave technology that could listen if\nThe Saudi embassy was not a prepared to deal with that kind of surveillance you can get that kind of audio from inside of a building\nBut there's also another story that this actually audio arrived first with his fiance because he had an apple watch\nAnd when he went in he turned it on and it recorded and when it finished recording it just uploaded to the cloud\nAnd downloaded to her phone I Hope to God that's not true for her sake I Can't imagine\nEspecially since we now are getting the story that this audio that we don't know yet if it's if it exists includes his interrogation\nAh and then uh the the execution ers come in and the a head of the embassy said you can't kill him you can't kill him in here or I'm going to get into trouble and the what's described as the path all adjust\nOr from Saudi Arabia the guy who was in charge of killing and disposing of the body apparently said to the head of the embassy or if you want to live you'd need to get outta here right now otherwise your next\nThey knocked ... on conscious and he was unconscious for a while then you hear them apparently starting to\nGet all of the tools and everything ready in the room ready to uh start to chop him up he is still alive when they are ... him and apparently it is a gruesome gruesome tape\nWe again don't know if that is true\n\nThis may be an Archduke Ferdinand moment down the road this may be the thing that's\nThat's the world on fire that doesn't seem like the thing that could set the world on fire\nBut Saudi Arabia is our ally we are currently fighting the war on terror with Saudi Arabia where currently fighting a proxy war with Saudi Arabia in Yemen\nUm we are getting ready to sell billions of dollars worth of warm machinery to Saudi Arabia\nSaudi Arabia is quietly supportive of\nOf ah Israel now in the middle east and are taking strong stands to support Israel they are also a an ally with us against Iran they are a balance of power\nThere's no reason to feel pressure to not go through and intelligence you know full look at this before you start making public proclamation and you better take this tape seriously because\nIf I were holding the tape I Would hold it until I see exactly how the United states and Saudi Arabia kinda finagle around and talk to everybody down\nAnd then what everybody says okay this is over and they're not such bad guys and this was a mistake that's what I read the tape if they don't do what you want them to do if you're a turkey that's when you do you do the tape because it's that that destroys\nThe what credibility Saudi Arabia has ever had and with me they've had very little they're not friends of ours\nThey are not friends of ours they are selling us crap that quite honestly I live in Texas we don't need it\nWe don't need it open up the fields here in Texas start pumping again and bring the price of oil down and let's get off of Saudi Arabia we don't need it\nBut we'll watch this closely a it's a ticking time bomb ...\nYear and brains getting quite a workout Glenn Beck San ... am seven Ninety two sons most stimulating talk ...\nEarning twenty four hours may contain diverging opinion\nFarfetched you say I'm Sorry I only have to argue if listeners are saying is it vice I actually asked you argue is my first lady and I and also encourage we have a ...

rape her depression never in a million years is going to give that allegation any exposure at all not it's not going to happen so you can talk about it I could talk about whatever\nShe had much more I mean she was credible she was okay it's\nJust not gonna happen than not going to get back into it um and they didn't report it when it happened\nArgue why are they then getting into the Monica Lewinsky thing\nBecause they have to at least acknowledge that Hillary Clinton beyond all rationality\nIs that is putting herself out there in these positions where she has to re litigate this stuff now the reason she's doing it is she wants to remain relevant so she can run again for president\n[laughter] no I'm Serious come on come on back I'm I'm really you\nYou know that I'm the most brilliant political analysts in the country now I don't I Am telling you that she wants to run again for president and\nTo know I Know she wants to run do you really think she will\nIt depends depends a lot on Biden\nIt depends a lot on um whether she feels that the field against terror is weak which it is absolutely week but the bigger picture is that the Democratic party doesn't know what to do with Bill and Hillary Clinton they don't know what the deal with them All right so\nBill Clinton and Hillary going on a road in there and and talk to their\nDevoted supporters this isn't an accident and this is a is a trial I mean to see how many people show up how enthusiastic they are a below say look when I was president we did all this and Hillary was a grade a first lady and she did all this and then she was a great senator and she was great secretary of state that's what this is\nIs it ... it up across the country to see\nHow it's going to fly but if you think Hillary Clinton is just going to go away quietly into the night she's not she wants to be president and she realizes that the Democratic field as it stands now is extremely weak who's going to vote for Elizabeth Warren I mean that\nA non American Idol [laughter] no that rushed her yeah it's horrible\nCrushed to the Boston Globe thought it was doing a favor by saying oh yeah we're uh if you got a little bit ah blood on average and then the Cherokee Nation the Cherokees themselves give us a knock it off where she's not Cherokee um this is a total Rosen fraud knock it off\nThe Cherokee Indians themselves\nCrazy OK and war and use that ruse as I say and my message of the day I'm Bill O'Reilly dot com today [noise] used the ruse to advance their current in academia\nSo\nAnd this is a woman who think she's going to win an election she's not only in Massachusetts that may be at Oregon you know these states that she could get into the Senate but as a national viable candidate in a way\nBelow as in the ... the number one political strategist a do you ... how could she come out with this whole thing was with Warren without having someone on record from the Cherokee Nation to support or I mean I see how she got the ...\nShe has her grandmother who once told her when she was three [laughter]\nAnd she had high cheekbones and that's because way way way way back um uh she was a chair\nOr as a mother or\nYou know was a source of all of this but look I'm getting back to to backs a Hillary Clinton scenario um Hillary Clinton is a woman who is a ... oh yeah\nAll right John shut didn't fit in to the me too movement obviously she doesn't fit in there because she has her husband um and she doesn't fit in to the far left even though she pander to them all the time because\nShe didn't receive Scully she's\nYeah she's a system a Paul would they call in New York you know Paul so\nBut she she and her husband and I spent um I was at the Yankee game and I talked to Bill Clinton about twenty minutes or so I mentioned to you last time I was on um she and her husband say you know what they may not like us they being the Democratic voters but we're so much better than what\nIt was up there now I mean Michael Bloomberg\nIs going to run for president of the Democratic ticket and you know outside of New York nobody knows for Bloomberg are very smart guy by the way stream Lee intelligent All right but he doesn't really have much of a chance but he's got a lot to do that a lot of money and he'll be in there\nBut other than that you tell me if Biden doesn't go and buy it and I think it's going to be Ninety eight years old next year\nI'm On an ... an older senior citizen\nI I Will tell you this bill you know who I think is positioning for a run and I don't think in twenty twenty ... twenty four I don't think it's going to be Hillary Clinton there will be the first first lady that becomes president I think it could be Michelle Obama\n[noise] maybe I I'm not sure whether\nMichelle Obama has the drive but\nCertainly she would be formidable and then there's ... and it's the it's the reverse you know ... they're they don't have the resume I mean the Obama is if you even if you don't like 'em I mean NATO conducted themselves pretty well\nPraying near the you know I'm not sure you need the ah the resume I mean I heard I heard the rock say you know if I'm going to seriously do this I I you know I've got a I've got actually runs something or can't just be in movies and I I thought to myself I'm not sure that matters really doesn't matter anymore\n... smashed that but it's certainly a plus for Michelle Obama because she doesn't have any little attachments and and so that you know that's not going to be a diversion\nSo you might be right there I mean I I don't know that well I met her a few times um I Know she was very powerful in the White House\n... extremely powerful and that was kept very quiet and and I think you're right\nYou might you know this is in her time the next time around and you don't want to go up against Trump a certainly doesn't want to do that but into twenty four absolutely she could uh if she wanted it\nI think the Democratic party would rally around her\nYeah All right when we come back I Want to talk to you about um ... and what is going on in the streets of Portland more with Bill O'Reilly from Bill O'Reilly dot com and don't forget his new book is out killing the ss which\nIs fantastic uh pick it up and grab my book at the same time by him as a U.S and again I think that's what Amazon is recommending people who bought this brought this

you said in a minute ago you know rise up and and fight this how do you do that and not make things worse\n[noise] well I Do a peacefully number one and I think that uh various ah people have to say you know let's get a little group together and um maybe we'd go out and and stand in the park with some signs saying whatever\nOr maybe we write a letter to the editor of our local newspaper\nA with five hundred signatures are attached to it so the Oregonian for example a very left wing newspaper you know you say okay we'd like to have um some space for not bad we have a community group and this is the way we feel about it there are things you can do to be visible in your local community it doesn't have to be a big national thing 'cause that's almost ...\nPossible but I'm trying to get people to understand the evil it's growing in America which is you know what killing the ss has really essentially about and and a lot of people still want to look away at it\nThey they don't want to engage\nAnd um if we continue down this road with the press being as you just pointed out solidly aligned with the most progressive\nThe most and art elements in our society the pressure sympathizes with all of them\nThey sympathize with open borders they sympathize with legalized narcotics they sympathize with not prosecuting violent crimes there's the press and mass is is is an agency now that advances socialism and progressive causes\nSo so that's a big difference we didn't have that what was left wing press we didn't have an activist left wing press and that's why we have now\nLet me let me ask you this um\nUh I beg to differ with you on the on the activists press if you look at you know I'm the Nineteen sixties or some of them we don't have it we did we've never had it like this but we we have had it in the in the past\nIf if somebody stood up let's say a a you know some group with standing in the community\nUh stood up and they did a non violent you know protest a non violent march ... for justice and non violence or whatever um and they followed the king I'm a rules where you just never swing back\nA that group most likely is going to be beaten up for doing it by anti ... but in the Nineteen sixties\nThe press played that coverage I don't think the press plays that coverage this time you know somebody\nElse will take a cell phone video and throw it out which is what happened is that an over the weekend is that in the group\nDoing that without the higher security\nHave to hire people to protect them um you can do this it just takes\nIt takes leadership it takes

basically dismissing Saudi Arabia All right well they want\nTo not trade with them they want to crush that nation because of the nation is quote unquote bad okay I'm not going to stick up for Saudi Arabia is bad\nBut Saudi Arabia is the bulwark against Iran and the middle east mhm which the leader of Jordan and Egypt in that movement to blunt Iran is terrorism\nAnd destruction of Israel Saudi Arabia is leading the charge so why on earth is the American left wanna destroy that nation\nWhen in history we outlawed ourself with style and it was killing millions of people while we were allied with him because we had to defeat Hitler\nAll right and you can just give a thousand other examples\nOf countries that we had to do business with that were bad countries for the greater good but\nThe left wing press now says the Trump you're in the idiot because you are not destroying Saudi Arabia you should destroy that and then not trade with them the sanction them boycott them all of that and they turn around and go the unintended consequence of that is\nStick around because we have some really good things are coming your way and a an announcement while I was supposed to make it this week

and they were done they\nWanted to leave they wanted to get out of there because as the news was tightening around the neck of ISIS you know supplies and food and water we're becoming more and more scarce and so ISIS was stealing all that from the civilians and so\nLiving behind the ISIS wall um in Mosul was absolutely health of these people so they tried to break free and run away and so\nWhen these people ran away as as a large group ISIS massacre I think that day there was more than a hundred and fifty people just slaughtered in the street because they went right by ISIS\nHounded um ... the ISIS people I've heard that they've kind of gone back and they've they've just kind of morphed back into a lot of society is that true [noise]\nWe we did it come across a lot of guys trying to blend in with society and and kind of get out of there um and that has happened so ISIS is definitely having a bit of a resurgence in in Iraq right now so they went underground\nYou know and and it it was neighbors and just people who who've all live together right so these guys blend in there from the city of Mosul ISIS that's where these guys are from\nAnd so they were able to blend back into society a lot of them and so now we're seeing a bit of a resurgence however the guys that\nWe were seeing toward the end of the fight in ... a lot of these guys were actually white European guys a lot of a lot of Chechens and things like that ... and the reason for that is because they they have no choice but to fight and die\nThey can't assimilate back into society they can't run away because they you know they look like me they're white guys read ... and they can't they can't get away so those guys\nHad to fight it out all the way to the end and they know they're going to die and they they
