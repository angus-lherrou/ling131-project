that\nI listen to every weekend so I actually watch\nWell good way to either [laughter] so ah so how can I help you today\nWell I should've minding my own business but you didn't\nI didn't have an acquaintance chew recently ah reconnected with a a daughter he had it in a marriage when he was in the military in Europe okay ah and that was a well Nineteen Ninety eight she was born and they recently reconnected and the\nPeople and his family are pretty concerned ah so I thought I did that old easy button and just do a background search on her and she would I could buy a no avail us failed miserably\nOh hey man so you're going to wait whoa wait so so you put so she's what Nineteen she's Twenty years old okay All right so she's Twenty years old and that's right because you said Nineteen Ninety eight um\nYou couldn't really buy anything about her leg on Instagram or Facebook or anything like\nThat oh I did I did I found a a a Facebook account that looked like it had the origin or January twenty Eighteen oh but that's not very much of a social media no not in Iraq\nAnd so so you are trying to do a background check on this young woman so that this way you\nCan tell your friend more about her or you afraid that she's not really the daughter or that she's going to scam ham or whatever all\nAll of the above okay uh she does uh for for money or they're not rich by any means uh uh the the family just do the ... but a lot of concerns over this and it's causing trouble in the family so\nI'm sure and then all of a sudden you have kids coming out of the blue right and you're like okay I I'm just a bystander and all the [noise] [noise]\nWell here are good friend I mean you're worried about right and you want to make sure\nI was I was concerned in a ... at least

with nothing\nYou know there's also family tree now\nWhere okay\nYou might be able to find something in your family tree now it's supposed to be like where you put your family tree together but it really there's a lot of information there\nUh and of course much like any other site Jim you have to be careful especially when you look at people searching sites is that what appears to be an actual

[laughter] ... click and other places\nAre and then of course there's the uh the surge which is another place for you to check but I mean if you are really trying to to find information about this young woman is that\nYou know I'm surprised that that you know he can't friend her on social media or somebody that he knows could friend her on social media\nBecause that would be the easiest way you know especially if this is his daughter and so you know what how can and then you could then he can share his credentials with you if you want but he if he wants and then you can start snooping around and see if there's anything else out\nThere yeah I don't think he wants anybody ... think oh he doesn't want to know I don't think he wants to know oh why\nYou have a you have an uphill battle all around right what does your gut telling you\nA might get is telling me that she is his daughter and I don't\nThink she's got a very good background and I think she's just out to get which you can do it\nOkay well maybe you know you can do your background search you can see what you can find\nOnline and you know maybe you're just counting your friend on the warning signs things to look out for a\nYou know as far as you know first she's going to ask for ten dollars then it's going to be a hundred dollars you know whatever it may be you know as it goes on I and maybe you know he needs to text you every time that she asked for money so that this where you have a record of it because he's not going to want to remember or it sounds like he's probably not even gonna tally and now that I think about that\nWell we're we're not that close like I said I'm just a a a bystander and all this but there is a connection to uh uh other people uh that I'm associated with a ... and everybody's

the title was you want twenty percent for handing me a muffin the awkward advocate\nOf I had it and\nI don't know if you've noticed it but I certainly have that wherever you go where somebody choosing square and they're on their I pet or on their phone is that they want to get tips for just about anything out there have you noticed that Andrew\nI'm so glad that you found this dinner bringing this

you if you would like to tip the person that is just standing there at the register\nSo because of by Mira I developed the seven foot ... what's that if you have to go farther than seven feet I Will tip you but if you\nDon't [laughter] I Am probably not\nGoing to do that so if you're just taking my credit card right my apple pay my Samsung Pay\nA farmer's market I bought spinach pasta was twelve

square and to you know when you pay and so you don't go to the front desk for anything anymore and so I was talking to her and she had it set up that if after you get your hair done and you can tip ten percent Fifteen Percent or twenty percent\nSo I told her I said you know I said you've got this all rock and she's like what do you mean and I said you\nKnow research has shown that whatever you put it in the middle that's what people are going to tip and there'll be a certain percentage\nThat will that you can guilt them into going to you know the third call it which is the goal of all business who'd killed ... people out of more money so I thought I explained to her I said so\nYou know you're married you got a two and a half year old and a ten month old little pictures up there the kids you know and you know in the rye and they need new you know they're getting ready for college students showing their cheek bones we can really hungry or whatever it may be I said

hair done every six weeks right I'd go back six weeks later and I should so out of work out she goes oh my gosh everybody's tipping twenty five percent and some people are going like thirty percent\nBut she isn't that different though because that industry has a history of gratuity\nBut if the psychological aspect of the way that it gets presented on this great\nSo when you're up in

when you buy the smart lock is that a couple of ways you can do it uh I actually have on a a ... house that I Am\nIs that I Am I have a ... legs smart block okay\nAnd so when somebody books through ... I can go and I can put their name in and I can say this law is going to work on this Saturday from eleven AM to next Wednesday at Fort Pierre\nOkay and you put the person's name in there and then\nWhat's also interesting is that you have a full log of when they when they come and go or eggs actually when they come into the building so you'll know exactly who's coming in at what time at 'em and you can program this\nRemotely program this right on the Internet\nOr you can do it within an app I have found that the easiest way is to use the ... Gluck if not the best of luck it's an inexpensive lock if you're looking for them all the best of luck with more bells and whistles or something called the August pro Gen\nAnd the August ... is the best but\nWhen you start looking at locks that they have different system so you ... you can't just buy the lock and it goes on the Internet\nIs it you buy the log and then it connects to a hub okay so you have like a smart things hub or you have what what I have is the next year up okay\nAnd then within the next to a hub where the where things have you'll find that there are other things that you can do so like if you wanted certain lights to come on and the middle you know say from eleven PM to fix am when nobody's there so at least illuminates maybe it's less likely for somebody to break in\nIs that you can program the lives for that if you had certain cameras you could do that as well if you were worried about a water damage when nobody's actually there and it's snowing and the pipes are freezing you know what I'm saying\nIs that there are water detection sensors you could also put in there that you can get alerts so once you once you get the hub Charlie's what I'm saying is that once you get the hub you start thinking about OK", "show_name": "Kim Komando Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Tucson", "day": "21"}
