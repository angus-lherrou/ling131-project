P. N. app but when I'm using public why and I'm Wondering how important is that I researched telling blurry\nI dunno [laughter] and it's good his fat\nDifferently is any free ones out there what kind of like can you shed on me that that's\nAll right well let's start at the very basics okay is that when you're on a public why buy everything that you do is like traveling right through the airwaves okay\nSo if you are typing in your bank account and your password your Amazon dot com has whatever it may be\nIs that anybody can just pluck that earlier today and so the whole idea behind a VPN or what's called a virtual private network\nIsn't going to use all this sophisticated encryption so it's going to scramble it all up to us is traveling in the airwaves you won't be able to just pick it out okay and so the whole idea behind using the VP an app is that we're going to have this magical tunnel that you're going to use\nWhen you are scouting around in Europe where you guys going\nUm we're getting um London, France Amsterdam and Germany\nOh how fun yeah can't wait\nI'm so excited for you know London you're going to make sure that you get this app it's put out by the London museum oh and so when you're ... this was like the coolest thing you're going to totally love Esteban when you are like standing in a say in front of Buckingham Palace or pick who daily square or whatever it may be\nIs that you hold up your phone and his augmented reality\nSo you can see where you're standing what it looked like in say Eighteen sixty two oh my gosh oh it's so cool it's so cool and then the other thing are ... are you went to like military stuff\nAh my husband is\nOkay there's a museum and I made the mistake and I didn't mean to go to this museum which means like a lot of people don't mean to me the ... most people don't go there and say is that is the imperial museum\nIs also in London and then of course in France make sure you take like a a cooking class for chocolate and ah it's just an old had to pick like the right question songs and you know if you could do a food toward any of the city has to be great I went back to your VPN so when you're sitting there\nHaving your tea and Crumpet or your wine and the souffle or whatever it may be is that I Want to make sure that the hackers and the bad guys don't get you so uh so you're right there are all these different VPN those some of them I Can't say on there because it's like hide your\nWhatever uh then there's Nord VPN and then there's also freedom VPN which they were actually a sponsor of our show at the company by the name of F secure and it's a public company and this was the VPN that I use than it is free or like for example when I was in London last month\nAnd so it does slow things down\nA but if you want to be safe and secure and I'll put a link to this over I commanded a common that show picks buttons you can find it\nIs that is truly the best way to do and of course before you go tell your credit cards that you're going I mean you ... you know all the drill and then there's a there's another app that you need to get its called mobile\nPassport you heard me talk about that I'm now okay you need this app okay just if you don't do anything else cut out okay All right so you leave the United states you're on your way back okay there's four hundred and fifty people on the plane right right\nAnd they're all coming down this pipeline all go to go through homeland security\nThey do and here's personal cell phone number so tell us what's going on because you have a really cool contest

upset but they're showing\nA single parent community with triple digit membership at ... the community good are over forty thousand\nWell the reason why I the reason why I say that is Google said that they shut it down not only because they had were going to talk about this and the next hour but they had it open for three years but basically the heads of goals that nobody is using it anyway so it was shut it down so you do have different options there's one side\nOr that you didn't mention is that it's called the ds for\nAnd that's D.

politics not at all at all love him hate him whatever who cares but the Internet was reacting to Conyers phone\nFirst of all we learned calling us using a cell phone because he took out that phone and it's an iPhone and the unlocked it to show the price of the United states gifts okay when you're in luck that he was on camera\nSo everybody got his past ... correct okay can you guess what is ... let me give you a hint\nVery similar to yours well you know I have I saw that image them alert to you okay I saw that headline that they pass code was zero zero\nZero zero zero zero correct six zero which you know that used to be\n[laughter] until ... when did you change it this morning I saw that blind [laughter] and\nSo now it's it's a lot more difficult for you to break into one one one one one close seven Seventy seven seven seven seven that's far from zero to be the right much harder the other thing\nThat the Internet was criticizing calling us for tech wise was that he had his phone in a case yeah I was the big deal about that it's not cool it's no longer cool to have your smartphone in a case\nSo who's saying that it's not a cooler these people that are ... are they like trust fund kid that are being as those of us that have to shell out a few hundred thousand Fifteen hundred bucks on a phone I don't want it to shatter by dropping\nThe criticism is is that you can get tempered glass on the front and you no longer need the case on the back unless you have a multi that's going to charge it there's no reason to have a ... well that's what the Internet was attacked can get another stupid okay\nHere's the other reason why you need a case corners right well that's just that but you notice the color right they're pretty good mine's pink mine's black okay but the reason why it's pink is so that when I throw it into my black per se\nI can find well that's why if you got when like me I have a rose gold iPhone it'd be easy to find in my purse\nYou a guy with a rose gold phone and the\nOnly I for some of blows bad I brought a case on it anyway what does it matter\nSo we were talking about Conyers password yes zero zero zero zero zero zero there was a call for everyone to try and hack his social media accounts so they wanted to use\nEmail addresses and log in and then just tried to ... password password one two three because odds are that's what his passport it\nSo then came out the stories about horrible pass for us to have and I learned something which surprisingly I've been here between sixteen Seventeen years [laughter] I've never heard about password walking you never heard a password walking never\nThat's where you like you walk on the keys in order for you to enter and your\nPassword most popular walked password is one shoe to W. E. three four are getting back to the top row and the bottom row and you walk with your fingers across your\nGet you to go in and then some people they make it more difficult so instead of going down to ...\nHe's two rows they'll go down three right that's the actually the the third most popular is one Q A V. to W. S. X. cause you to row\nAnd let me tell you something if you were just look at that as a password you'd be like that's a darn good password exactly because it's not a word in the dictionary word at all and it's got like a couple of letters you know\nOr some some a haiku you know a gang symbol for most you know things like that and see and that's the deal but I think so many of us are getting tired of passwords dogs do don't\nI mean and then you know so let's say you don't know your password well then you have to go through the whole password reset ... what was your or second grade teacher his middle name\nUh [laughter] well that's the way\nTo to step verification is so great\nEspecially Yahoo I mean I don't know how many people are actually still using a Yahoo account but I Am for fantasy football and ... only use it for famous football so every single year obviously I forget my Yahoo password ... it's been six months and they used it but if I have an a Yahoo apple on my phone they send me a message through the up and I can get in\nYeah and that's really the off yeah the two factor authentication is easy I mean and it really is and we always get people who complain and go oh you know they're just discriminating against me because I don't have a smartphone [laughter] no they're not trying to set up security\nI'm gonna tell you something now my space in linked him yes they bowls since two thousand sixteen if I've huge security breach\nOr you know in their website ... can you guess in the category of brands one or two of the most popular passwords that were used in the morning and\nThis is really a tough one I don't know if these two stories are connected I think they might be and I buy the blonde\nHair [laughter] my space and linked him yeah just use it as their password but what that Mustang that's probably the these are brands of so Mustang Ferrari people like to use car names as their passwords playboy\nThat's a brand Skittles again but Brandt okay but you can use the passwords Skittles if you're not using it for your skills to count [laughter]\nHustle and then perhaps some quick and easy ways to make a buck and we're looking at sites like want alone bell hops indoor dash and others we speak to a a video editors actually thriving in the gig economy\nOr then our next command on demand that we put out this week is about the deceptive technologies that are being used to fool your senses and why businesses and celebrities like Sharon ... pep boys are banding Facebook\nAnd what you need to know about Facebook's controversial new posting guidelines for businesses and also for fake news and then of course we had the golden age radio some of the most popular programs from the thirties forties and fifties\nWe have a some history attacks some great pod Cass Tech news today tech news this week you can get all of our podcast on Apple's pod cash or on Google clay or get your podcasts or head over to our website over at pot net dot com once again that's ... net dot com and back to the phones we go with Tom\nIn Peoria, Illinois hello there\nThomas hello Hi welcome what's going on\nWell the question I have had to do with a if any if you could recommend a website or a resource that folks in something like Consumer Reports for applications [noise]\nAh so you are tired of downloading apps that promise and don't deliver is that what's happening\nYou that's part of it yeah or I I ended up using an app or using a program to to accomplish the task I get done and I go visit their an easier way to do that\nBy having an example okay we babysit our grandchildren for the summer on Tuesday and show I thought it would be cool to make a little book at the end of the summer that said here's what I Do to grandma's house on Tuesday perfect\nI ended up using Microsoft Word and importing a bunch of photos and putting in text it ended up being thirty five pages long about fifty to sixty photos but it was a short it was really hard isn't there a publishing program that maybe could help me do that better\nWell you know unfortunately with close to one and a half million apps right now\nThere it's really difficult to find any type of authentic reviews site\nA there are sites like ours that will do round up some say you know here at ten grapes photo apps but we would only hit ten out of maybe two thousand or five thousand that could be available\nOr icy if you're looking for a particular app you can always read the the reviews people are brutally honest about what they liked about it what they didn't like about it but Andrew a you used a particular site to put together a photo book did you not yes we're shuttle flight you shutter flies at\nAnd because you know important fortunately Tom says it was a thirty five page word document that a huge these but you know making photo books as a sense whether on Yahoo Photos Google Photos wherever it may be\nOne of the great things was I misspelled the word in the book no yes and we got it and cause I created a birth story of my son and I misspelled the word I called them up and they're like oh we'll just we'll just fix it and send you know one no charge\nAnd so you so before you look for a particular app\nThat only does one task is that you might want to look at okay uh what is it is John right out of work and work with photos maybe the photo sites will make a photo book because you're right putting it into Microsoft Word trying to form at those pages and getting that that\nThat's a complete nightmare but the other thing that might be kind of fun for you to do is Andrew what you did with the gentleman on fiber where you've created the animated book but that your kids really love\nYes and we I sent them real pictures they we communicated back and forth on fiber they ... I think it was in the end it was nine original illustrations based on photos and I mean I Know the websites called fire but it's still only ended up costing like a hundred and sixty dollars for someone to come to take months to make those animation\nAnd so so and so the next time you have a task foot in front of you Tom\nYes uh-huh call us\nAnd say okay [laughter] okay I mean that's why we're here and or drop me a note through the website and I know this sounds crazy\nAnd a lot of people don't believe me but I Do I read every single know that you send me through the website\nAnd I've got a system I've done it for many years and when you send me your questions things that you want to accomplish we will use that as content\nOr for a tip or a cool site or an app review or whatever it may be over a commander dot com or you could just call and give a call to the show and pure Kim's club member by the way you always get priority calling and you can join comes club right now\nOver and get Kim Dotcom stay right where you are big security alert I Need to tell you about with Web cams that's spreading like crazy across the United states you're on the ...\nWith more and more of our lives moving on line intrusions into our privacy can have devastating consequences one great way to secure your privacy so you can have their freedom to be anonymous and untraceable on line is to use what's called a VPN it stands for virtual private network\nWhen choosing a VPN you really need to trust the company running it\nAnd I recommend ed speak to our freedom VPN F secure as a publicly lifted company they had the thirty years' spotless track record of protecting its customer security and privacy\nIt's so easy to use and it's really easy to set up you'll be up and running in just a few minutes actually cure even let you try for free for five days no sign up no credit card details required\nYou can trust as the cure to protect your privacy and to keep you anonymous and untraceable online or to your freedom VPN now and get twenty percent off when you use discount code Kim visit F dash secure dot com slash camp that's F dash secure dot com slash camp\nSo now they have Arabic and Hindu a Bengali Punjabi that's four of the ten most spoken language in the world and ... ... ... the Nepal eat meal to ...

reputation management mhm that's my first thought to be like well with me the best ... that I can find full small medical office and also what I was looking at it those\nOld or a I'm a software that you ... and then the the F yelled at search engine optimization ethical would all fall ill\nAll right well let's talk a little bit too so what's going on with your business on line\nWell the problem than what some of it but it's obviously what most of us have as you know if you have as many good reviews that go on line to help you out a rise of the bed ridden with\nThey would balance it out but obviously it doesn't work that way you know are the people have the experience is usually doesn't go online and football's there there\nAre positive experiences have with you at your business so when I'm Out here it's mostly the negative responses that are starting to add up more than than the positive responses to what I Need to do is buy something for someone to neutralize the negative responses that happened to my business a lot\nOkay All right so here's the deal before I Would contract with any reputation\nType management farm okay is I Would encourage you to do this yourself because you are may be able to do it more effectively and\nDo exactly what they do ... and then you will further understand how this all works okay because as it as a small business owner and I'm a small business owner too\nIs that you know you it's one thing tell somebody do a job it's another thing tell somebody to do the job when you've already done the job right but\nAnd so what I Would do is it is are these on like Yelp or were\nWhere is it so I'm Glad for all the medical while it's like ... grade the car okay all leading the excel\nGay so OK you a couple of things you can do number one to mitigate the negative you have to accelerate the positive okay\nSo anybody who comes in they should be given a card from the gal the front desk that says we appreciate positive reviews so with their ... and on
