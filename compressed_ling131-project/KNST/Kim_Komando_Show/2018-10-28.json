I was reading something in\n... pardon me in on ranchers and stuff like\nThat here because there's an article in the wall Street Journal they were talking about how barn photos are just huge it's like wow\nAre they are never thought of that or the bigger on\nYou know so if you if you knowing that you know her pictures obviously are burned photos even look at buying Google Ads\nAnd we did we just set up a yeah that ... thing you know Facebook is you can buy as well ah\nShe's done that in the past but it doesn't always drive up you know the and did it out there like you would expect to for\nYou on the other thing that she can do is that if you have a mailing list you're you've ... you know where you're doing email marketing off of\nIs that you can tie that list into Facebook\nAnd so what that means is that because Facebook has everybody's email addresses that you can say you know here's my list of email address is find them on the site and then show them this ad for a discount coupon and then that would work so don't do the pilots to stick with a clever\nBoots marketing and I think you'll be better off thanks for your call come right back about wireless chargers you're on the can

almost time to get your shopping started for Christmas and let me tell you all the retailers are\nHopping into action Walmart is going to be trying to take you away from Amazon dot com is how they're going to do it [noise] they offer free to day shipping for millions more items and they do right now right [noise] and they say they're expanding it's free shipping offer for purchases thirty five dollars and above\nAnd you don't need to pay a membership speed and take advantage of it that's what Wal Mart kept saying because they want to remind you that Amazon Prime now costs a hundred Nineteen dollars a year\nAnd Walmart says we're also making returns a lot simpler you can either print to return label from your online Wal Mart account or go to the nearest store\nJust pack up the item bring it to the Wal Mart services desk and they're going to return it for you right there on the spot you don't need to uh put it in the mail anymore they're going to start rolling this out in November\nAnd speaking of Wal Mart or a friend of mine does this whenever he goes to Walmart when announcement comes on over the loudspeaker\nHe it gets into the fetal position he screams no no no it's those voices again [laughter] what's this cat [noise] uh\nI I I walked out when he did that I'm like I don't even know you I'm Sorry [noise]\nAnd then there's also target they're getting in the battle between November first and December twenty second they say hundreds of thousands of items are now eligible for free today shipping a target dot com or at a Wal Mart says we're going to give you a free to day shipping\nTarget says ... give you a free to day shipping on select items\nA target also has a few ... do you have to use your credit card and it's only on orders over thirty five bucks case so everybody say they'll wait maybe this is something we can do to compete against Amazon Prime target says we have another idea they have the drive up the surface okay shoppers can place their orders on line\nAnd then you have to drive to target and then a target greeter is going to put your online order into your car\nAnd it's going to be available at a thousand stores I never understood why that is even an option white somebody at target thought that would be a great marketing idea when whatever you're gonna buy a target\nIs still to drive to target and then you have to find somebody to actually go get shorter and put it in the car versus just going to prime now that Amazon dot com and having it delivered that day it\nSeems to be able to grocery stores a local grocery store chain here in Phoenix, Arizona allows you to buy your groceries and go pick 'em up who we have to say fries oh price okay you have to do it like fourteen hours in advance\nWhy bother you know I go to ... the prime
