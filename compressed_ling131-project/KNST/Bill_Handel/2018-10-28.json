it so the tire blew out and it was a recall tire\nAnd\nGot it okay and so are you of eight thousand dollar damage on what else\nAnd we were like\nWell ... ... with what\n\nI see as you are this happened during the course of an accident when a tire blowout\nGot it so there were a got a bodily damage bodily injury okay now what yeah\nCrushed and everything\nI thought of it or whatever the number ... okay I'm On Medicare and you know everything right All right\nI mean look at\nIt but my question should I get to me just let\nIt well it depends on how serious your medical issue with\nAlan\nConsider talking attorney steady okay\nThere's enough money there that you won at least talk to a personal injury attorney uh this is not one of those things where uh years of medical bills and here's another thousand dollars a first of all I think you're going to have a hard time even you know arguing the medical bills because he's going to come back\nAnd this is typically what happens with the ... and this is the insurance company of Michelin right this was not Michelin per se ... percent\nOh yeah you know I don't believe me you're you just started talking to them or if you're on your own\nA visual gonna go they're not going to I ... the guy that you're talking to it's not going to write you a check for medical what's going to go to their insurance company who is going to go to medical and figure out what was legitimate what wasn't and gee you didn't have to go there and you didn't have to do this kind of procedure oh Edie Edie\nWhat's going on or what the answer what they're making more money bring your own back like everybody else sides that's it yeah yeah it's a now I'm Sorry it was supposed to be unfair\nI understand but I think they can charge anything above that now you could be that they only charge ten cents\nA and uh that's the way it goes I don't know what the law reads I mean you can look up the law that's easy I just look at the statute where they changed it and just read the damn thing you know just go on the Internet and go you know ten cents a bad law mandatory bag payment whatever a search word you want\nBut I based on if there isn't a law that says the stores can only charge ten cents\nAnd they must charge ten cents then\nAll they can do is charged sense but my guess is that there is a ten cent charge in the stores can charge way beyond that\nWow\nYeah so it could be the answer you bring your own Dan bear hug you when you went to the store and I always bring their own recycle bags\nRight right yeah\nOkay there's your answer or what a big legal issue on that one isn't there oh hey can I sue them yes yes I'll give you some lawyers a good lawyer six hundred bucks an hour\nOr what is my lawyer charge a whenever I Need legal work to keep in mind or my expertise is [noise] is limited as most lawyers are limited in their expertise and mine is insanely limited to third party reproductive\nWise you know I I was my way of charging I just had an issue with a lawyer headed I needed some business documents are six and a quarter an hour\nSix hundred and twenty five dollars an hour and by the way that's not off base either for a good lawyers summer seven hundred appeals lawyers can be nine hundred thousand dollars and our senior ... senior partners in law firm you can run nine hundred thousand bucks an hour\nSo when you have to pay for a lawyer and a good lawyer you have to look at whether you have a good case or not\nAnd that's why I Love law it's the principal thing I Want to file a lawsuit okay go go for it you know you'll enjoy yourself and then the judge says you're absolutely right thank you the other side can't do it anymore and you're out Fifteen thousand dollars\nA Israel high Israel I Am here

alright Regina are Regina welcome\nMy question is do you know of an attorney that would take my case on contingency basis um my father died I got sixty three hundred my brothers they should have been over a hundred thousand and they're telling me the only way I'm\nWhy did you only get sixty three hundred because\nShe took the other night I guess\nOkay so you have to sue the she was a a trustee was it a trust her was and will it\nWill that I have All right and ah she was a I guess the executor\nShe was not appointed she disappointed herself\nSo how did she get access to the money\nI guess he corrupted her with the code or you're the all right well I I don't know\nI had to pass on Christie okay that's the problem is that she's going to argue that was my dad wanted me to have the money otherwise you wouldn't have put my name in their eye and when the will ... will specifically talking about the bank account\n[noise] yeah I'm On the phone rang and I have it to you know whatever it let in there was supposed to go to me\nAll right but that was ever left there and they ... and it was specifically mentioning that bank account\n[noise] you know what I was told because you know again I I wasn't raised with them [noise] my brother's everything but my brother almost dies you couldn't be in charge\nYou know I think you're going to have a hard time I mean you can easily go to the website handle on law dot com and we have trust in a state lawyers but it's a it's not going to be easy you know how long ago did this happen Regina\nMy father young how long ago how many how many years ago did this happen to know he just died okay so the money how do you know the money's been taken\nBecause the bank told me that the account has been close she closed in February that is when I got\nAnd how do you know it was over a hundred thousand dollars now to kill\nMy brother shot before he almost died he was in a bus accident and so\nMy alright well you it's going to be tough getting someone to do it on a contingency but ah you your brother said he saw it and how did she see it\nWith my father wanted him to be in charge he took him around the\nWheel with will specifically says the money goes to you\nYeah All right well he tried ... I talked to an attorney or because there was an affair and now the trick is over a hundred thousand dollars to get taken a contingency that one is a problem because if the money's all gone in and she doesn't have any money or where do you go see where's where where's where's your pate\nYeah so there has to me and she spent the money a regime or what do you do\nYeah if I were trying to get the money and try to maybe helped make somebody that you go to trial and they can make make myself I'm ... ...\n... I don't know that's not so easy to do but it doesn't matter what can happen is all the accounts are frozen once you file your score to freeze the account but it's certainly worth talking to a truck truck in a state where I go to the website to do that because there was a lot of pieces on this one for sure\nSunny hello sunny\n... probably more in a crowded grad school to let the LA itself okay with that I Do I Do\nIn Georgia well I here's the problem you're probably going to need a warrior in Georgia and there are\nA the law schools generally do have clinics where they do we help people who don't have any money or it's these pro bono odd organizations ah we're a law students get to work under a lawyer\nAnd get some a practice but you're going to need die you're gonna find out in Georgia sunny\n... better and better that's out of the dark\nHair yeah became in Georgia you don't have to call a lawyer in Georgia recalled the law schools in Georgia and find out if they have any clinics\nOkay called another\nYeah coal every law school you can get your hands on in Georgia and then you may also want to just find out all organizations that do pro bono work\nSunny or are you are you bro are you broke that helps All right what kind of civil case do you have\nTo go out there my mom and uh this Lauren Frayer in ... when he was he was a a low cost\nYou know it's our daughter is a way that I gave them they uh they they're very ... and I asked him what to do with it and pay\nA fine ... wrote for the death for that but to divert\nOkay I Know this makes sense to you can you can get the death certificate and two seconds that's that's a public record yeah\nYou're going to need a you're probably going to need some kind of a clinic no lawyer is going to take this on contingency and clearly you're not going to be able to pay hundreds of dollars an hour\nSo called the law schools you want to look under pro bono a legal help in Georgia right\nOkay All right All right\nAll right good luck or just occurred to me that some law schools do have quite a ...\nAnd actually the lawyers and oversee those clinics are generally pretty good those lawyers are ah what they do is they get paid about twenty eight thousand dollars a year to oversee the clinics and uh they couldn't ah probably\nSo pencils on a street corner if it weren't for ah those clinics nicely said in Germany at one or two calls and say come on bill really\nAnd I will say do you have any pencils for sale\n[laughter] All right Tom Europe welcome oh okay I'm gonna get right to it [laughter]\nOkay I worked for an employer\nAbout three years I left that implement about a year and a half ago and during the for years I worked for them I worked a considerable amount of overtime during last six months I worked in an average is eighty hours per\nWeek that's allied wire so if you left a year and a half ago Tom why are you calling now\nWe are because it's ... it has no force at all well first of all you have to say on me to keep it yeah first of all I can tell you I never said OK okay he's alive he's willing to throw you out if he's willing to say you have to this weekend to pop off and\nGet out of there than trust me he's going to lie about any verbal agreement any agreement you ever make its been writing he signs it\nOkay All right\nA verbal agreement you know the rules at this point verbal agreements mean zero and that goes back hundreds and hundreds of years to common law and common law incidentally\nThe law started not as human rights or contractual right at all it's a real estate property and the and it came out of that which is why in terms of common law that is ancient English law which a lot of our laws derived from\nA it says that in real property no verbal contracts everything has to be written this goes back five hundred six hundred eight hundred years\nOr Stevie hello Stevie okay\nI get you know yeah if you're on a ... if you're honest uh what do you call it phone speaker phone get off\n[laughter] All right I'm okay this is the bottom line I I'm going to just continue my insurance or with Kaiser\nOkay and what I wanted to find out let's say my own insurance or just me working out riding my bicycle staying healthy is the federal government and the same way I Do my taxes are they going to impose a penalty on\nMe sure because under Obamacare you have to have insurance and if you don't you uh there was a penalty why would you give up your health insurance typically Kaiser I'm a member of Kaiser why would you do that you'd be\nOkay so it's really ... the reason I'm going to do it is because\nI Kaiser so go to another so by BP oh uh yeah\nI mean I I don't understand why you know the first step is why would you give up health insurance because anybody who can afford it is out of his mind not the habit and second of all yes this at this point it is the law that you must either have an insurance plan or you pay a penalty questionable\nOkay that's simple and I heard the penalty is based on your income\nI have no idea okay you have no idea yeah I'm assuming it's now it's two hundred and five hundred then it goes up to a you know two thousand I have no idea if you can\nHave the penalty subsidize that would be hilarious that would be all areas or because they do subsidize your insurance if you don't have the money but do they subsidize a penalty if you don't have the money that probably not\nOkay yeah so so I'm right now though it's in legislation\nNo it's not in legislation there's nothing in legislation\nBut the Republicans are trying to appeal you\nKnow they're ... yeah but they have passed a law and there's not even been a law that you introduce right now\nUh so this could take this when we can take here\nI'm going to take years but a neighbor passed but get yourself insurance you know please\nHello Pam yes ma'am what can I Do for you\nOn a tight with apart had a partnership with the people that are for nine years we were down ... years ago\nWe had a recall it filed bankruptcy personal ... if you're paying for it so I Would label it file on it for us that my partner filed bankruptcy on her up for sale come back after\nA while it was kind of ... first of all was talking about the business was in a in a wealthy or corporation\nWith the get the park or a cat\nA and yes they can't come after you are as a one of the partners in since you've already filed for bankruptcy you can't you cannot go bankrupt on it has it been ah I think what seven years since you file for bankruptcy\nIt happened quite federal\nLearning well theoretically they could go but once that seven years is over you can re file I mean you're never going to have any credit again Pam that's a given but you can no re file and you can re file at any time\nSo it doesn't matter if they're showing you doesn't matter if they have a judgment it doesn't matter any ... anywhere in the process all the legal process or you can stop it cold once you file for personal bankruptcy it's over for anything that you would be responsible for what kind of business by the way we talk about him\nOn it was it was like I ... that went on that practical ...\nAnd why did he go under not another and then there weren't enough customers are wearing\nA robbery I got my check up or down after nine years\nYou're got robbed them neighborhood where are you in that was so crazy\nOr what parable Marino valley huh wow\nWhy it got really bad after nine years so we get that is set it down but I was going to be a critical that like my partner filed are there that that would have to take care of it\nNo because you have a partnership and go what happens is I you know I don't even if a partnership can file bankruptcy 'cause everybody's in your individually responsible for it right so effectively it's a it's the two of you know I don't even think it's a business it's a straight partnership where you're just personally liable\nWhy do why wouldn't you do an El Al see or a corporation\nOr low you know new idea where she said it you know I'm a Democrat so I didn't have to say although I'm going to repeat it Dorsey Hi Dorothy yes yes [noise]\nYeah for a long time ago me and my girlfriend and her mother we bought a house and we all fine and there's been a ... way past the stature imitation that ... that we're going to ...\nMy daughter during the day because we have recovered and she turned out you know go go down and make them when I went down to the courthouse money wouldn't even own a house so I was wondering uh any kind of way I could find out that I did sign on it oh\nWell okay it's a I don't quite understand that you sign on the house when you took a ownership of that house how did you get the house\nNow we are together throughout put money\nDown okay and then a Yahoo assuming than you are when I'm Alone\nI Know we didn't get along together we just put money\nOh so you're just by you bought your you outright just bought a house everybody putting an X number of dollars there was no mortgage on it right\nNow we didn't find it though but um I don't remember signing up for like maybe it was on dog they didn't really find that it's only for like maybe seven hundred dollar\nYou put seven hundred dollars down on the house yeah how do you own a house with seven hundred dollars down\nNo no no no no it is part of the down payment how much was the entire downpayment\nOh not that I don't remember what we find out Robert think we're all like twenty nine thousand doing it that was like five minutes\nA lot of fuss with courting disability and I'm expecting that large Thelma them throughout the report this to Social Security\n... you're on social ... are you going to be getting a large settlement a large civil settlement correct\nUm [noise] yeah\nOkay that and that's outside of Social Security disability is a based on you were injured at work\nUm for anxiety\nHow do you get a large settlement for anxiety\nNo no okay I'm among our security disability for anxiety and separately I'm expecting we got a federal now I'm a I'm a family member passed away\nOh in inheritance that's not a settlement that's called an inheritance\nUh and uh I don't know the answer to that but thank you so much for calling\nOh All right I'm Steven hello Steven sir Yes sir\nI have a question about being arrested I I'm a robo called a couple of days ago that told me that I Am ... my name and then return alert all the money for our local law enforcement wouldn't be around them\nYeah I'm actually I'm of course not uh although I like returning those phone calls or they're just they're just they're just fun to return\nNow normally a yeah of course it's a scam and no they can't do it and they are in violation of the law and here is uh the problem you call the authorities and whoever a is a uh whoever handles that that it would probably be the FCC I guess who is in charge of that\nAnd why they put in a complaint and then they put you on the list because they've got two hundred and thirty million of those to deal with\nAnd I don't think I'm exaggerating either now I returned phone calls I got one the other day uh it wasn't even a a robocall it was well robo call in the sense of the dialing but I got a live person\nWho ah said ah ah I'm with the IRS and do we have a A N and we ... a ... and do you have to pay and nice and you have to pay right now and I went really\nUh yes and we'll take a will take a check over the phone or will certainly take a credit card and my favorite one is we'll take a I tunes card or apple cart that's my absolute favorite because you know the government takes apple cards apple to or I ...\n[laughter] anyway [laughter] excuse me [noise] so what I did is I said really a IRS leaning it was absolutely a go once you give me the number of lean\nBecause what he's talking about I said there's no such thing as an I arrest document that you're holding onto that doesn't have the final number on it so why don't you give me the final number oh we're not allowed to do that really and so I just had a ball with\nThis guy and of course hung up on him and I hate the fact that he called me the bottom line whenever anybody ever makes that kind of a a a threat you just hang up on him I mean it's going to replace\nWide I appreciate your\nTime okay All right yeah it's just what robocalls would I just read that fully half of the calls that you weren't going to get are now going to be robo calls that are now out there it's gotten to that crazy in my case it will be virtually all of the calls because no one ever calls\nI just I don't get people to call me because I don't call them and it's this whole thing about how I hate people that have me and so it's virtually a hundred percent and they're getting so good I got a call the other day and I were talking about robocalls I I mean it was I was stunned 'cause I I\nYou know if you you can easily tell what a robocall is if you even begin to look at it and think in your in your mind because normally or you think is is this going is this a robocall once you even asked that question you understand that it is so I got a call and it was one of those I knew my name\n... Mr handle and this is a call Mr handle and no one was on the other\nEnd except some computer Amish are handled my name is whatever for a collection agency and then I hear a ... as you go and the woman says oh excuse me I just dropped my head piece sorry about that ah oh here we go I have my hippies back on again\n[laughter] it was a robocall they got me they got\nMe I did not know for the next ten Fifteen seconds until I said hello hello and they now have programs where they go she was me I didn't hear you\nAnd then I started screaming you stupid rich and I'm ... by the way that was the least sibling I was calling a and of course they don't have a program to answer that uh but it was great fun robocalls but no the bottom line is if you ... the IRS never makes the phone call\nCollections agencies will and you simply say you stop it you do we do this by mail you're done talking to me they'll call you again and you've heard me say a million times use the magic word harassment\nAlso you can say I've been a which I Love is I'm recording this phone call I just want to let you know you staying on the phone call you stay on the phone with me you're allowing me to record the phone call click\nUnless it is a legitimate collection agency where they're following all the rules say absolutely no problem no problem you're recording\nYou all the money [noise] and okay\nAh this is a handle on the wall\nAre you putting your retirement savings in a four O. one K.

was in fact\nDo the pedicure [noise] so we gave her medication antibiotics Faye Faye off your feet for the next couple of days so she she got to know could go to work\nThe next day it didn't it didn't it got worse so we had to go back to the emergency pay the or the other co payments\nAnd then they cut another part of her mail and they said go through your doctors told them that they see in her doctor the doctor said I Can't do it our need to send you to pressure so she was off work before they couldn't see the specialist over following week\nAgain she missed like six seven days by the time

don't know maybe a thousand dollars in the last two weeks\nShe works part time and make five hundred bucks a week All right that's good what does she do\nShe works for a school district\nOkay fair enough so she's not a thousand bucks so there's that and then the whatever the co pay is on your insurance there is that\nUh so you can try I can guarantee you that uh the nail salon I don't know what kind of insurance and has a probably\nIt only has liability insurance for the building if someone falls down I Am breaks a leg that kind of thing I don't think they have insurance so the other thing but yeah when I Would do is just go there and say hey you know I'm Out a couple of thousand dollars here and when you want to do you want me to sue you\nAnd see what they say I'm assuming that the owner is Vietnamese right you know what a shocker a Vietnamese nail salon especially here in Southern California I\nShouldn't they carry insurance\n[laughter] yeah I Would think so although I don't even know what kind of mean ... what kind of liability insurance you have for nails\nI'm not sure but so what assuming I'm willing to bet they don't Henry okay so you're I think your ideas as good as any\nShow up there and say I'm going to sue you maybe we'll give it to you in trade you got two thousand dollars worth of a pedicures there's a lot of pedicures you know that a lot of pedicures",
