{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KNST", "content": "A bill Yes sir well the question concerning the ability of a person to decline a portion of an urgent specifically my father has a timeshare if he leaves it to me can I say yes to the rest of the inheritance but noted that sure and what would I fish in the record\nI don't think so you know you don't get I mean there's nothing in the world I mean how can you be forced to accept property and in the case in a case of a A N good for you by the way of saying no in the case of a time share\nThat's not property that's a liability voucher that's what it is so no you can just simply say uh you know whoever the trustee is say please do not transfer the property to my name I have no interest in being an owner of this property do whatever the hell you want with it but uh I'm done\nAnd could go back again to the state somehow\nTheoretically they could but uh they're not going to they're not going to sue ... they're not going to sue the state uh it's they're going to walk away from it\nDr ... thank you very much okay yeah I mean I mean could they go after the state of course for breach of contract or do you stay does the money but then it gets interesting because I I guess theoretically the trust you would have to negotiate\nWith the time share company to pay it off and get a get rid of it because you've got the time share company could sue the estate because he's still owes the money dead or not and\nUh but that would stop or the estate from being distributed because there has to be enough money put into that\nTo cover the cost of a the time share I mean it becomes a mess so timeshare companies normally just walk away and that's it you try to get him to walk away anyway but I mean the bottom line is you're crazy to get into a timeshare\nThat's for starters especially now with type shares cause they're no longer you know on their own the property it used to be you'd say you at a time share you buy one week writer two weeks or you would own two parts of to let's say one fifty seconds\nOf the property there it is there is a deed you own property\nNow they just give you points you will nothing what your own is a contract in perpetuity\nWhere they have the right to raise maintenance fees every year every three years or whatever the contract says forever\n\nAnd inevitably does anybody actually use time shares once in awhile I run across someone that yeah loves the time share and yes I thought it was the greatest deal but that's one out of all\nFifty maybe alright Eddie Hi any going on over ... sure\nAre and um my wife and I broke our ... our landlord lived in um New York long story short ... hundred dollar of our carry the bond that\nBecause I'm an older when done one of my little regret decided to leave 'em mouthwash bottle\nOn the counter and uh apparently what they call a chemical burn a little room\nThe mouthwash bottle um um my my my argument is you know they're the ... on on the counter at the left or little room there you know how is that our that our fault\nYeah you were ... would you argue that's wear and tear effectively\nIt's wearing ... and under what an outside the use of the dollar account or would you pour the milk on no fair enough so what's your question my\nCourse he's keeping Fifteen hundred dollar kind of run down it All right what's your question um how do I get my cook your book that you are doing the right to\nIt yeah I think so based on what you said because if he's the one that put it in a counter that if ah it it's\nNot susceptible or it is susceptible to a ring around the counter are all based on mouthwash I mean you you're the one that just described it perfectly hey what do you expect there won't be a bottle of mouthwash\nOn the counter what ... what did you expect you're the one that put in the wrong material\nAnd are there are a ... yeah I don't know if you know this but if you go to one of these uh marvel yards these rock ... yards or counter a manufactures but encounters there is specifically a anti mouthwash counters that you know that\nI Know I did and there ended there weren't is anti mouthwash counters\nI just made that up so [laughter] uh\nSo it seems to me that the argument is normal wear and tear the tenant is never responsible for normal wear and tear and you're going to argue that what you did just put a bounce watch a bottle in their shots like everybody else does and that's\nYour problem and you're still in the small claims court for the Fifteen hundred dollars not that complicated and if I'm a judge I'm going to give it to you\nVery good aren't trying yeah\nNow do you think it'd be easier to go after him or to go after via the mouthwash company\nOh please ... you\nWant to go after Proctor and gamble okay do me a favor and said they were mouthwash is so acidic it goes through counters and see what their lawyers are going to say\nI really like a super that's out at\n... ... well you're

I I think it's too easy to argue you're a liar on this one mark because you don't have to have the proof not that you are\nOkay I'm not at all to saying you're a liar although you do sound like one a but it's just too is just too easy to uh attack you on this one so are you defeat you obviously you totally collection easy to go pounds ... pounds sand on this one tell them just to you and uh then you have to defend yourself it'll be a small claims to probably\nAnd then you have to worry about your credit being being ... even a disputed is your credit already been attacked right yeah\nIt

pay the other hand it was just negotiate with Sam Nick O'Shea say I'll give you half the money now\nI have and but there are things that I needed the money more than anybody I'd rather give them the money or\nCurrent well then you negotiate it on a payment you tell them to go pound sand or you look at your credit you got your choices none of them very good\nUnfortunately a not a good place to me sometimes and I often say this is a ... everybody looks to the law as an answer\nAnd quite often the laws very sloppy that it's not very clean ah for example what's what's clean about the law have you committed a crime yes or no\nRight it's very clean the jury determines yes or the judge determines here's the statute yes thirty five miles per hour is law went thirty six or thirty seven boom you violated she that's clean stuff\nI loaned you a thousand dollars you don't pay me there it is now dogs barking next door because they're too loud\nAnd I want a restraining order what does that mean\nWhat is too loud it's just a sloppy way of of dealing with things and this is one of those where the to answer this is just there's nothing clean about it there really isn't so all I can say is I'm Glad it's him and glad it's not me\nThere you go silver lining every moment\nOkay or Alexander Hi Alexander\nHarm here he is or what can I Do for you or\nI had a debt owed to a credit card company fifty nine hundred dollars or judgment was ... years later that judge back this up here at I received a cat's always end up that from\nThe IRS showing Nineteen thousand nine hundred\nOkay when I say I view oh hold on are you a cancellation of debt for Nineteen thousand nine hundred dollars correct so you're you're a single so you're dealing with the IRS that's you're not dealing with the original credit card company you're dealing with the IRS someone ten Ninety nine you for Nineteen thousand dollars is that correct\nYes okay so the IRS is now saying you will or you were forgiven this much\nDebt and die and they got a judgment against you correct no they didn't do they sue you or they just wrote it off\nMe a original credit card company I owe Fifteen\n... did they write it off or I don't know if they did ... were you ever sued\nOr no but there was a judgment so\nThat means you were that means you were sued okay All right\nAnd so uh you got a judgment against you and it ... it's a little complicated because ah they forgive me ...\nLet me tell you the whole story okay if you can follow it a little bit better be original that\nFifty nine hundred I received a judgment the Ira I mean the credit card company after giving up years later the IRS\nYeah no I understand sent the IRS a ten Ninety nine on your behalf because like with\nThe ... the amount that they said I owe you said Nineteen thousand dollars the original that fifty nine hundred I think our I cut the IRS a copy of my credit report showed fifty nine hotter\nIt doesn't matter I don't it doesn't matter I don't care that\nReduced the IRS then reduce their from my being power than nine hundred back the fifty nine hundred I paid the debt off so um where my question is Trent the credit card company and white at the debt from fifty nine and Ninety nine do I have a record\nBecause because no because you didn't pay the tax on the Ninety nine you ended up accepting the ten Ninety nine was for the fifty nine hundred dollars it was originally in default the point is there were no they they knew that there are no date but but\nReduced did he get no not the\nRight but that's the only thing you miss the IRS they already have a judgment they give it up there collecting on the judgment\nSo a credit card company has no records\nAnd that's why it's only been there done done\nEven though they are like nine hundred\nMatter they inflated the fifty nine hundred on the ten Ninety nine\nOr not on the judgment they issued a ten Ninety nine for Nineteen thousand you were due to the original fifty nine hundred dollar damage it\nThe question is that the credit card company and play that original 'em\nOut yesterday did sign over yes there is no records I guess only because you have not been damage\nIf you can you do for a hundred thousand dollars and then you end up paying the two thousand dollars I expect and I said well I've been damaged Ninety eight thousand dollars you haven't\nOh\nGod we went through a friend oh what do you do to twenty thousand dollars\nJust because of patience issue God ... yeah they do I get people take me for a complete moron you know let me explain how this works I got when
