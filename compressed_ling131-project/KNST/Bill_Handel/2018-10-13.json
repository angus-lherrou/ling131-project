Lewis thank you oh You're welcome All right we've got we've got a place for them a thank you some Trump stuff\nOr will do and we get back what the the comments that Trump made yesterday um\nWhat he said about trade with John Claude Juncker to you guys said 'cause again off our own lawmakers on both sides they all think Trump's an\nIdiot and he has no idea what he's doing yet again Europe linked right they blinked\nAnd they said fine you got us we'll cut our terrorists\nIt's awesome what happened and it's like it's kind of being downplayed in a way by the media because it was the one simple as that will continue with this can't sta and seven Ninety two sons most stimulating by the way this is this is hilarious before we continue with the uh the trade stuff right there's a story from the Associated Press\n\nYou know student loans right uh you know when I was on with that are that old hag at Fox News and the interview over the weekend she's an old I mean she's that guy's Trump's just joined on student loan prize yang man Obama destroyed it by taking out of the private sector the government being in charge and if you have a pulse you get a loan right\nAt some point you take it alone or with their responsibility as yours so I had to lower the price of college so it's more affordable well\nYou you don't give everybody a loan and the college like colleges raised tuition like crazy because everybody was getting a loan and they're like as long as you're getting money\nWill raise the price you're going to pay anyway so it's ridiculous it's too much and there are so many colleges that are just scams they have their way too bloated too many majors I make no sense if you're a women's studies major what are you going to do in life besides be annoying\n[noise] you can organize Regina marches what are you going to do go on Fox News yeah and and him and yellow over me yes\nThat [laughter]\nSo bad the ... the education secretary here's this here's the headline ready for this Associated Press Betsy\n... proposes rules that would cut student loan relief by an estimated Thirteen billion dollars\nYou're taking Thirteen billion away from students wait\nWait wait and how do they started students who are defrauded by their schools would have a harder time getting their federal loans are raised under new proposed rules by the Trump Administration Wednesday ready the proposal aims to replace a set of Obama era rules that were never implemented\nDrew applause for from the for profit industry sharp criticism from advocacy groups in that represent student borrowers really what's going on\nYou're ready for this under their proposal students would be eligible for a loan relief if they can improve their schools knowingly misled them with statements are actions that directly lead them to take out loans order all the school\nSo that would be a higher bar they right so one you have to prove you've been to ... you can't just say you are and get money back you have to prove it\nLifts so mean it says you're it'd\nBe a higher bar then the bar or a defense rules finalized under Obama twenty sixteen after the collapse of to for profit schools ITT Tech and Corinthian Colleges those rules allowed a relief in a wider range right you have a breach of contract now\nIt says here devoted Betsy ... says well students should be protected from fraud they also have an obligation to do research before picking schools oh crab this was just terrible right [noise] research [noise] the education department [noise] but a statement\nSaid post secondary students are adults who can be reasonably expected to make informed decisions if they have access to relevant and reliable data about program outcomes\nI mean that's why I said when are they one of the lawsuit is going to take place where the people that major in you know women's studies or whatever these stupid majors are and stuff like that they can't get a job are they going to sue universities they might as\nWell rights but they chose to do this stuff like I don't feel bad if people graduate with a ... billion dollars in debt in college and they have trouble paying it off because they choose things that don't pay a lot of money\nYou have to ask yourself is it worth it wouldn't have if I Want to be a social worker I Am I going to make that much money would it be better for me to do two years in community college to save money and then two years at a regular college after that probably like you have the power to make the choice I still have I have one year\nNext July is when I finally pay off my student loans I chose to do that\nI chose to leave a profitable a profitable job as a bartender I was paying cash for college\nRight I chose to leave and go into radio and take out loans because I knew if I were to make it in radio I had to get any early and work my way up I chose to I took the chance it's on me so I mean if it didn't work out it's still on me\nAs a worked out\nSo people have I mean there were ... she said they're adults you're adults you have the chance it's up to you as simple as that\nSo she said they were adults they can actually they should be able to make reasonable choices I mean this is this is going to make the snowflakes melts you expect me as an adult to make an actual choice how am I supposed to know if this is going to work or not going to work I Can't make that\nChoice from the breezes off duty oh you're a local area brings in Wyoming dot com is gay and I see them and I had high art radio station [noise]\nAnd I'll be obviously a having a U.S or we're in I I Would think All right ah it's a phone calls for sure uh marry we'll start with you Hi Mary welcome to handle on the law\nOh yes I Am I don't know we're like we're going to do a lot of the one year old lawyer who are working\nFor a while I I Would call it ... only ... oh no\nOh no a lot of people know who Don Quixote is a lot of people that uh that was the guy used to train horses in Finland I think and was one of the great horsemen a ball of Finland do I have that right okay how can I\nMost I there was All right but\nI I Know like it's hard to get a lawyer because I only have ... an hour okay by leaving ... who won the crap out\nSo you want a lawyer that will take equity in a house and the practices elder abuse ...\nAnd we had a phone and we had a phone call a ... that there was a sixty one year old man that had just passed the bar and was looking for cases and so you're trying to connect a sixty one year old with taking elder abuse case\nWon't know game um who will take and I assume on contingency or take a a lien against a household lie about an hour\nA hundred hundred an hour now does it matter as matter that a lawyer has absolutely no experience and doesn't even know how to spell elder law\nI don't you don't care for the lawyer has knowing Marion son\nAt the bar I'll do our work\nWhat ... what do you mean you'll do all the work you're going to do all these ...\nLegal documents I Love to do it by ...\nDidn't want to do that then ... is this for you of course then why don't view then where does that then why don't you represent yourself\nBecause ... kind of like why they say only four represents looked out\nWell let me ah sixty one year old lawyer who has never written a document regarding elder abuse in his life uh that's probably a less competent than you are my dear\nBut he had a choir behind\nSo why you can represent yourself I I live so why do you think someone who has\nEsquire behind their name is going to somehow when the case and by the way it was a case\nDismissed and what was the case dismissed\nNo I think they're going to die for every dollar an hour ...\nHow did you lose Mary how to how we thank you wash the case how does what does that mean recording now\nSo you haven't lost\n... ... ... ... ... ... ... anyone in the area quite I think it's a federal court now like those people caught a lot of\nLow I see so you lost the case and now you're appealing the case\n... well\nAppeal by the way you'll never find in a good appeals lawyer that it'll charged four hundred dollars now are those guys are six seven hundred dollars now we're looking\nFor something new because they're\nAll right well you have the word out ... ah well you can leave your name and number and if Mr sixty one year old lawyer who's never done a case in his life ever who just passed the bar and you think is going to file an appeal now I have been a lawyer for over Thirty years you know that Mary\nWell why don't you have\nA problem is I Would never I don't have the skills that to write an appeal I Would never dream of writing an appeal I just don't have that skill set that's right I Want it so but you want someone with no skills said just because they are best square behind their name\nWell it's better than the lunar well\nNo it's not better than you alone I'm telling you you are more invested in this you have more experience in this\nThen that lawyer does are you in press\nJust because someone has Esquire behind their name\nThat means nothing well\nMaybe mean something but uh not a whole lot so anyway it's fascinating how people are impressed with lawyers ah ... never get\nThat All right I every\nThere you go high ivory welcome to handle on law we're going to do for you\n[noise] [noise] Hi I'm I took out a ... year warranty contract with the term my company and [noise] and and that was in two thousand six to ... thousand Seventeen I started noticing that my would wish tripping on the corner of my house yeah and I\nDon't know what they were turned my findings I called the representative that initially treated my own [noise] and his tone made for a couple of months\nI finally called the the main office and explain to them what was happening and that my throw up which were loose and my own [noise] they sent their representative out\nExterminated again and then another facts and told me that I now have\nSubterranean termites so he says you can get an extended on the mind you I was still under the contract of the ... but yet the what was going on underneath my house and he had written which I didn't notice what repair looted\nOr what do you mean in a way where you didn't notice say so you didn't read the document\nUm we were talking that don't matter but you didn't read the document\n[noise] no I didn't know okay oh I didn't know All right\nSo you now subterranean a termites I guess that were treated eyes so they did treat but it said would repair excluded and okay with oh hey\nSo at this point I accepted it another show from another company to come into and expect said that was in\nJuly now mind you march is when both termites were treated again the other company findings where I had major infestation of both [laughter] so I contacted the state of California pest control\nAnd they had no record whatsoever that this company had ever been to my own tree so they told me\nWhy would they why would they have a record of it [noise] because I don't know why would the state of California\nKeep her record of maternal my company going to your house\nBecause by law they're supposed to submit a W T o form notify them\nReally okay I didn't know that so they have to be All right so I asked to do it within ten days while I didn't know that okay so every time they treat they have to let the state no we just treated a home here's the address right right wow okay new study\nSo they told me there in violation and that's an internal thing so I ended up filing a complaint with the state of California in the meantime the owner of the company wanted to give me seven hundred and fifty\nAlright let me you know I was going on forever okay this is taking way too long so the bottom line is there any violation internally or you can sue them for all the damage\nOr based on the damage subsequent to they're coming in and treating and then you can argue that they had not had they had they treated correctly all the additional damage wouldn't have been done\nI don't think they can defend even based on the fact that they were violation of the law that's probably the violation of that uh that ordinance for that statute it would be ... and\nUh you got a small claims suit that's it and now when you say you bought an additional warranty was that from the tour my company or or a third provider no from the same\nTerm okay you're you're you're in pretty good shape a you'd have to go and you have to go out get another term my company to straighten all of that out including the term I damage treat everything and just to I'm a small claims court\nOkay now my question is I Would like to know what type of attorney do\nI Am all claims court you soon do you do it in small claims court\nYou don't need an attorney [noise] oh okay I won't go damages will not be more than ten thousand dollars [noise] okay All right\nAnd uh and make sure you tell very complicated story to the small claims
