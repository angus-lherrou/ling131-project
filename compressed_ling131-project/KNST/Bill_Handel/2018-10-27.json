David he passed an ordinance said restaurant employees will be punished with up to six months in jail time or a thousand dollar fine if they get plastic straws to their customers\nBars restaurants other food service establishment ... um they'll still be allowed to hang up plastic stirs but only if customers request them\nOnly they request them\nAnd that's why I predict at some point here with a more every day it seems like a new Tucson restaurant is like are we going to see the ocean living in the desert yeah and\nIt has nothing to do with it again at ten rivers in Asia and Africa lead to up to Ninety five percent of all the plastic pollution in the oceans but they're going to make a difference at local scene in downtown Tucson and they ban stress so so so insane so interesting [noise]

then you'll enjoy when you listen to it again I already dot coms there's Guerra Lewis thank you oh You're welcome All right we've got we've got a place for them a thank you some Trump stuff or will do and we get back what the the comments that Trump made yesterday um\nWhat he said about trade with John Claude Juncker to you guys said 'cause again at our our lawmakers on both sides they all think Trump's an idiot\nAnd he has no idea what he's doing yet again Europe linked right they blinked\nAnd they said fine you got us we'll cut our terrorists\nIt's awesome what happened and it's like it's kind of being downplayed in a way by the media because it was the one simple as that will continue with this can't as the Ames have Ninety two sons most stimulating by the way this is this is hilarious before we continue with the uh the trade stuff right there's a story from the Associated Press\nYou know student loans right uh you know when I was on with that are that old hag at Fox News in the interview over the weekend she's an old I mean she's that guy Trump's just joined on student loan prize yang man Obama destroyed it by taking out of the private sector the government being in charge and if you have a pulse you get a loan right\nAt some point you take it alone or with their responsibility as yours so how how do price of college so it's more affordable well\nYou you don't give everybody alone and they call it the other colleges raised tuition like crazy because everybody was getting a loan and you're like it's not as long as you're getting money will raise the price you're going to pay anyway\nSo it's ridiculous it's too much and there are so many colleges that are just scams they have their way too bloated too many majors I make no sense if you're a women's studies major what are you going to do in life besides be annoying\n[noise] you can organize Regina marches what are you going to do go on Fox News yeah and and him and yellow over me yes that [laughter] so Betsy ... the education secretary here's this here's the headline ready for this\nAssociated Press Betsy ... proposes rules that would cut student loan or leave by an estimated Thirteen

loans are raised under new proposed rules by the Trump Administration Wednesday You're already the proposal aims to replace a set of Obama era rules that were never implemented\nDrew applause for from the for profit industry sharp criticism from advocacy groups and that represents student borrowers really what's going on\nYou ready for this under their proposal students would be eligible for a loan relief if they can prove their schools knowingly misled them with statements directions that directly lead them to take out loans order all the school\nSo that would be a higher bar they right so one you have to prove you been to ... you can't just say you are getting money back you have to prove it\nThe tire yeah that's good you got hit by a ... that's the you know some deep pockets there\nUh well I thought it was from entering his brain\nOkay then uh hopefully you have deep pockets so what is your question\nWell ah the ... the front of the damage the bus I think it was like three hundred

nothing more to say you give them a statement you say that's bull a while you can't say that's bull 'cause you have no idea if he was in fact uh injured or not\nYou're not a doctor ah so what's your question\nUh well I mean I I've got the hunger\nDefined by yeah it's not going to go down to ... you know\nIt's not going to go for more than two thousand dollars\nWhat do you think he's going to get for a in a in a car accident in which a bus has three hundred and fifty dollars worth of injury or based on the based on a collision with a car oh please but we don't just certain over your insurance companies are going on for the guy nothing\nI wouldn't worry about it okay All right there you go a Alex Hi Alex [noise] whole middle yes\nI'm a truck driver California local driver and I just had a quick question or I was doing the delivery at this place that I go to regularly and I use the restroom there plenty of times before this one particular day they told me that ah the policy change and drivers weren't allowed to use the restroom\nSo I asked them work and I go to guy for South by these says go find\nA port a potty that we have a ... for the drivers so I walked around the facility didn't see a port a potty came back to them uh told them they look role you said there was a port a potty there is nothing can I usually go to the restroom now\nHe's like telling me now because you can't use the restroom so I told them you know it shouldn't be against the law for you to operate a business and conduct business and not have restroom so I don't know where I stand on\nI well first of all ... and I don't think there is a law but even if there is a law I it he can say to the public or you can say non employees you can't use our bathroom there's not you absolutely you can do that\nFounded absolutely nothing\nOther than nothing a driver can do now how big a facility is is that you're a delivering to\nIt's a pretty substantial\nSo why would why wouldn't you call the uh the

you oh that's for for malpractice then you're in a different world entirely but I always say the same thing call contact a medical malpractice attorney to make sure that I Know what I'm Talking about

couple of years ago I found in the works because my wife she is she going to like ... gardening and I'm from ... to me for the ... and me\nThat is a horse and you know five out here on calls later yes go ahead\nAnyway I have a car loan um didn't begin in bankruptcy and if I call them if you think of the crowd away\nYou know now if you don't know if it's a car loan you probably don't have a enough equity in the car where it probably the car is worth less than the amount of money that's owed on how much money do still on the car\nOn how much\nYou're three thousand dollars on the car and how much is it worth\nAs maybe he will Fifteen hungry\nI Know you don't worry about it now you just keep on paying it no one's going to touch you can go bankrupt all you want\nOh okay I don't worry about it that that part\nIs and that's usually the case is I assets are deal I dealt with with the bankruptcy court so you file for bankruptcy and the court looks at how much money you old versus what you have and then if it's a liquidation splits up the assets but cars\nAre almost never ever put into a bankruptcy unless you've got a Bentley or a Rolls Royce\nA that is a paid out that's been paid for but other than that what you have users exemptions where you're allowed to have a personal car and usually whenever there was alone I as in his case you owe more money let's say you buy a car for twenty thousand dollars\nA day and so you you you go ahead and arrange a payment schedule you finance the car with a second you drive off a lot it's Fifteen thousand dollars is value and you still owe twenty and that's the case all the way down so no cars are pretty much\nA left out of it so I wouldn't worry too much about that I hello Mike or your answer her yeah oh yeah\nYeah yeah of course you're all

the first of all\nTime Mike Mike Mike I'm going to stop you right there because you're you're going way way beyond a what what they show is about\nUh you have a bankruptcy issue but just the sound of your dismissal issue you need a civil attorney to look at it because you may have a case of legal malpractice there was some statute issues obviously the judge had some issues uh with the statute asking you to file an amended complain it didn't happen on time there was a dismissal yeah you are definitely going to have to contact\nA civil attorney on that just go to the website of the story was
