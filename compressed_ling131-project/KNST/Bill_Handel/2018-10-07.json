someone's feet and that may do it and that would probably work for all of it do they have a duty to\n... to raise or to lower services I don't think so and so I Would argue all we have to do is make

...\nWho was that what your parents and there are still alive yeah OK and it so I'm assuming it's a remarkable trust your normal everyday trust that they can change things around correct yeah\nWhile they're doing their they cover lawyers that my grandmother's home and a lawyer said that you know it you have if they ever have to go to the home that the government because they have so much money has come back she's getting paid for cooking on Medicare they're saying that the government can comment trying it money\nNo unless she is she had been is a Shia beneficiary of uh the ... of the narrowest\nVeterans with regards to my parents and something what's happened to my parents and they were going to go home\nOh I ... yeah and they're saying that they can do some type of paperwork that can stop that from happening\nI Would be there or if it would be an era vocal trust\nWhere you're [laughter]\nWhere are your parents no longer have any control at all to trust just shut up and then it's over that's done they just don't own it which means that they don't have assets for the government to grab but because they do go on I think not Medicare uh and I you know I don't know what the rules of Medicare but they're not going to let you go on the government Dole\nAnd pay for for example a home or to live for folks living with\nA million dollars and the bank that's just not going to happen now let's go ahead why if\nThey're not going to cut Fifteen thousand dollars\nTo what to change a judge to make a a a ... trust\nThat make it so that they didn't give me the name\nI Know that's

for my money\nGood for you good for you ... a little stiff basically taking a trust and making any irrevocably trust a that's not a very big deal at all\nAs the high asked me how you doing yeah yes ma'am what can I Do for you\nA coupon question for you\nKeep it short I am looking for the most and um I guess the new thing now is my cat after paying rent also monthly\nWaves are you where they want to wait your cats have to pay rent monthly\nCharge 'em you know there's a deposit\nOh yeah of course at yes I Know plus the thirty five a ... thirty five per cat forty five per dog car I'm not an okay\nUm my question is my cats are certified animals now I'm In I'm embarrassed they won't get into that but the animal um [noise] I can I waive the\nOther side of the question or work yeah well you're not going to be able to pull it off with two cats I promise you that\nEven if I got the paperwork\nI you know what if you have five cats and they're all service animals no no I probably could get away with one\nEye and I'm sure you're stuck and then I don't know if they can still charge you a for the cats are ... you know yeah that I don't know I don't know if I bought for you arguing the service animal business then are you um\nYou would have no chance they can charge whatever the hell they want pet fees you can charge extra so like the bottom line is that you for one service animal\nAnd it's now this is this an emotional service animal or is it a city and emotional support or is it a straight out service animal\nI Know no respect for an emotional\nIt's a low yeah because they are very few seeing eye cats don't be right [laughter] yeah yeah yeah they're not that now I understand right I Want someone when she asked me about a seeing eye chicken and it wasn't a wasn't the same I should probably not\nSo the quick answer is\nI have no idea if a money can be charged but if age I Can't it would be under those circumstances and therein lies where the rules are changing rather dramatically because there's a big difference we know train service animal in this emotional support crap\nYou know like they do on airlines peacocks and ferrets and whatever they'll cause you

I Would ... okay so here's your choice here's my advice you're asking I Would get a lawyer that specializes in going after the church they know what all these lawyers incidentally which are the ones I've talked to were the ones I've heard of I actually do care\nAnd if it's a question of you need therapy more than you need money or you need both and negotiate with the church that's the way to go\nOut and my question is\nDo I get out 'cause obviously with the climate look\nAll these people coming our yeah me too yeah yeah well that's actually what would have prevented me from filing an

sir\nI'm trying to figure out how to get someone to live up to their their false advertising\n[laughter] yeah good luck alright I'll tell you what happened\n[noise] um I had a car that I bought from a dealership and it two years into the lead they sent me a written a letter and also email wanting to buy my car back\nAnd they said they'd give me up to a hundred and ten percent of the appraised value my car no matter if I bought there or not and then when I went in front of them on it and they have praised the car and we out of the hundred temperature because the car was an excellent condition\nA ... we'll give you the deal will give you a hundred percent but you've got about what our cars but in their printed advertising and my emails especially especially that belief that this away rates that are paired up are you up to a hundred and ... percent of the current market value for your vehicle [noise]\nIn fact we're so interested that we will buy your vehicle back even if you don't buy our\nShowcase so now the issue is the value and you you got him on that All right there's no question that this is what they said ah they're out is up to a hundred and ten percent that's for one or one aspect and connected to that is\nWhat is the value of the car or that they're saying it's not that much or they say they're just not about not buying the car back no matter what\nIt is in their ... by the ... say they did the appraisal on the car so I went ahead it appraised by car max and then I came to them and they were the original ... told me the car two years or\nWrite an are they not recognizing the car ... appraisal or they're just saying we don't care\nThat racial came higher than ... oh my God okay so so so they put they put it out to me and brought it up to me and then and then I said well what about the hundred ten percent and like I I don't know nothing about that they brought the manager out\nI gave him the document and email and he goes\nWell yeah we'll give you a hundred percent because your car I mean you're a cart was showing initially it was ten thousand miles under ... should have been particularly on at least that time and he goes will give you the deal but you need about when our cars and I and I go to ... highlighted another thing I go but it says you'll buy micro no matter what buyers are not ...\nWell ... and they they just stumbled on themselves\nAnd get mad or anything yeah okay let me let me ask this uh and that is a why wouldn't you buy one of their cars\nOr just in I understand there are a bunch of jerks but if they're willing to give you a hundred and ten per ... percent legitimately and they give you a reasonable deal and one of their cars why wouldn't you jump on it or even though they're much lying scum\nOkay I bought two new cars within a week of each other when I bought my Chrysler I bought one from across the street from a ... a dealership from them out of that and my truck I drive thirty five of them out here in my car sits in the garage so I'm sitting there going you know I'm spending over five hundred\nOr a or you then are you are so are you not going to buy a car then you're just not interested in buying a car period I was just trying to get out of the week\nOkay uh and they offered that yeah they're going to buy your car back uh and and they're releasing it too\nI yeah\nYeah they are releasing it to you yeah I'm just trying to think they are in breach just one of the damages a and now here's here's\nWhere I figured out the dad 'cause it's been a year and I've gone through\nBut right now I got it okay all I have a a you could sell the car or to anybody else at whenever the value is and the difference is they're responsible for the ten percent okay\nWell the problem was with a hundred percent I Would only had to chop up three hundred bucks on a been out of the league at that point I couldn't sell it for what the hundred and ten percent would have been\nWithout you know taking a bigger hit so I've kept the car and I just put it in on a leash so ah what I mean we only on the hook for just the love of payments and car insurance and vehicle registration which comes to fifty six hundred dollars\nAnd they would have been to like ... and they weren't going to let you out of that and you're but you're not going to replace the car correct right\nOh okay ah but you [noise] wow yeah I'm just trying to think of a of a clever way of doing this without hiring a lawyer and that's the problem and what the damages are and how you figure out\nA God ... ah the difference is\nWe can try figuring out the damages in small claims court but the problem is going to be that you're on the hook for uh the lease you have to say I wasn't going to buy another car\nAnd the judge is going to say really uh therefore but you could have and you didn't have to and you turned it in and you took the deal\nAre saying they'll pay you a hundred and ten percent I so it's a little bit complicated but whatever your damages are uh you can try to take it to small claims court\nI but that's the only way to go I can think of and just trying to figure out your damages and frankly as I was going through the entire scenario and ah the formula I didn't understand it worth it so ah that works out\nNow isn't it the ... when it comes to math beyond like fifty plus fifty\nOr\nA hundred divided by two I have a hard time see how that works\nTammy Hi Tammy\nYes good morning they'll yes ma'am\nMy question is I Am one of four owners or on a property and I had them paying the property taxes for
