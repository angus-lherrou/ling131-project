said\nMy man identity [noise] if you're a young lady yes ma'am I'm can you hear me\n[noise] um I had been working for a school district and so Cal for sixteen years um I'm part time actually less than part time and they've done that for this reason\nI'm getting ready to retire when I had taken um days off for being sick and the whole sixteen years generally I think in a few and and put them on the book the sick days but um mostly I've accumulated I'm thinking that I could\nTrain them at the end either take a pay out or um take that time off prior to my retirement in looking into it we're getting ready to retire this year I have over three hundred and twenty five hours accumulated and I can't take any of it\nAnd why can't you take any of it\nOn the same because I Am part time work less than twenty hours on it so what's your question\nDo I have any recourse at all\nI didn't know if\nIf the policy of the school board\nAnd the policy in which you hired is that people were under twenty or twenty five hours a week or month whatever it is or not entitled to take their shake pay\nAt the end of it uh then there's nothing you can do that's their policy and some school board some companies allow people to take sick days my police departments for example usually do\nSo while you got cops that retiring literally a year's worth of sick leave that they pull out early and then there are companies and uh there are introduced to say no for example uh my my company to send a preserver good parenting\nIt's using or lose it Mm same thing uh I work for this radio station it's using are losing\nThat they said the only recourse I could have is if I had because I'm part that if I took a different um government job that was over twenty hours\nRight well I mean whenever the policy is\nYeah then it could it stays with me I guess\nOkay but it's whatever the policy is you have to live within the policy\nIs perfectly legal to have a policy that says using her legit yeah as

could take my landlord small claims\nIt doesn't matter it does it doesn't matter if they don't care that\nResidents to the IRS then reduced from Nineteen thousand nine hundred back the fifty nine hundred I paid the debt off so I'm square my question is since the credit card company and white at the debt from fifty nine Ninety nine do I have a record\nNo because because no because you didn't pay the tax on the Ninety nine you ended up accepting the ten Ninety nine was for the fifty nine hundred dollars that was originally and default the point is there are no they they knew that there are no ... but they reduce it again\nNo not that I'm the Ira is that\nRight but that's the only thing you have is the IRS they already have a judgment they've given up they're not collecting on the judgment\nSo a credit card company has no records\nThat's right it's only been there done all statute is done\nEven though the un like the fifty nine hundred\nIt doesn't matter ... they inflated the fifty nine hundred on the ten Ninety nine\nNot not on the judgment they issued a ten Ninety nine for Nineteen thousand you got that reduced to the original fifty nine hundred dollar wherever your damages\nThe question is spent the credit card company and played at the original amount\nYes they did four times over yes there is no records I guess the\nOnly because you have not been damaged\nIf you want me to go out in dollars when I send you a bill for a hundred thousand dollars and then you end up paying me two thousand dollars I expect it and I accept that well uh I'm I've been damaged

ability nor would I Know people that a lawyer to read the contracts you got the food that you know what to do with your record Laura\nOkay here is a ... this gets a little bit complicated because clearly her damages are pretty extraordinary example of that river we support by the way of course I mean it was a theft I I get a burglary of I'm above\nThat to the beach or whatever like that so she clearly I has been devastated there's an emotional issue here\nBut how much is that words is pretty speculative and a jury would have to determine that assuming that goes to a jury okay or the other issue is the contract that she signed and there it is we're not responsible if someone breaks than well she signed it however\nShe signed it while she was burying her son correct and then the argument is goes wait a minute no one in their right mind they don't know what the hell they're signing\nA it so she didn't have the mental capacity at that time or the emotional capacity to know what you assigning there so I Would argue that right so ah the point is and what's worse it's valley so the ... out there uh she's never going to replace the ring itself\nCorrect uh so I what what is money what would you want\nI think part of the nation could I could go there quite a week and just look to learn and understand the\nPoint is you know I that no cameras or any kind of like a really good for Kerry and she says I could and said look at it brought me over the\nHead you know they could have but it's a good order should up a you know in ... they don't necessarily have to have cameras okay [noise] uh I don't know if that's reasonable or not and they had they had cameras that would have stopped the stealing oh no it would be exactly who went out there you go by whom you know so that\nMy question Ted got to get to God and the reason I'm going to get up because our car was hit by the truck that way but she didn't even listen to it but I remember I cook ever you know I remember\nThat yeah [laughter] so that's\nWhy it's time to time to contact a lawyer and I want to go I\nGo to a personal injury lawyer because this is emotional distress on a pretty high level and they weren't like maybe bono maybe it would be a contingency wouldn't be pro bono can do for a percentage of whatever and now you get to look for a lawyer\nIt this is an interesting case and uh I don't know if there's anything close to it\nOn that ... that has been filed and won or lost and this is where you start just talking to lawyers and see if any of them would be interested in it it's just kind of a norm or can we go I don't know if you go to the handling law dot com you go to my website to start\nOkay and you and you want to go under the personal injury lawyers if there's anything there they all say no or then you can keep on going out and if five or six or eight or ten say no then you don't have much there\nI get it right that that one and I think\nAll right yeah it's a heartbreak or with a with the mom that really is and when you talk about what Thirteen thousand dollars that she can't afford\nBut that's what happens when a loved one dies and you're responsible for ah getting a\nFiguring out
