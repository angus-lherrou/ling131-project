[noise]\n\nOh\nMore phone calls this is a handle on the law alright Laura hello Laura Hi yeah I've\nBeen I was employed two and a half year than I had exceptional work ethic and perform and and my boss discriminated against me to my religion and political affiliation\nI how well first of all are your what is your religion\n[noise] Christian okay and I'm assuming you're not a wild ... liberal is that fair to say oh got it and you're not [laughter] yeah but I kept to myself okay so fanatic All right so a discrimination is a how or was it shown to you\n[noise] um she made a comment in front of a couple of others that have Christians\nOkay now ... that's all she did she say she hate Christian where you fired where you've demoted or were you held back from promotion or is it just she hates Christian\nShe lock man so I kind of transfer out I've heard of it and then a lemonade that my position [noise]\nWow yeah OK protected by her by her good friend\nAh who is no doubt a VP Muslim or a Jew or or [laughter] or somewhat of that ilk huh yeah here's here's the problem\nIs uh that I mean I'm ... on his face it looks like it is straight out discrimination show there doesn't seem to\nBe a a lot of a lot of doubt there but let me tell you which way the law goes on this even if you can prove discrimination and\nUh your boss can prove there was any other reason uh in addition to that that firing flies also eliminating the position completely gives them a lot of a just a tremendous amount of power for example I Know the company\nThat had a and it's a company that is in it's in the spotlight I mean it's that people know about this company and there was an issue a day and African American who was working there\nAnd I was and it was very obvious that this is the one African American that was their out of two or three people\nWhat they did is they just shut down the entire division and say I literally and said everybody everybody in the division is a shutdown we decided to shut down the division and boom where are you going to go with that or you shut down the division because you are a bunch of races I Know we\nShut down the division as a as a business decision you see that's the problem that uh you're up against\nMy performance was better than the three parents but together\nBut that's what you say\nAnd then I have proof that way and\nBut ... but even so as I say I division part is going to be a horrible also because your performance used to be wonderful doesn't mean that she's\nGoing to say that you are in subordinate I she doesn't judge said that and you it has changed I mean those are very very hard cases uh\nLaura how how's your Hebrew [laughter] horrible I see I work on that a lot truly [laughter]\nAll right Laura that yeah I mean it's it used to be where discrimination was\nIt was it was in a dead bang when or if you could prove discrimination the court has actually gone the other way in California which was a shocker to me when I heard about the court and because I and also firing someone you can fire someone for any reason\nLet's say you're employed and you're the best one in the division by far proof here is a you know what I Want to fire you today I'm your boss I just don't like any more boom you're gone\nWith no rights so uh it gets to be a problem to say the least alright Joe here you go Joel welcome Hey Joe\nHi I'm a Seventeen year old disabled\nBut I have some serious disability and I'm I'm having problems with my age oh\nWhat a shock whatever\nI Want to put a window in the bathroom in the bathtub after so I called the management company you buck Fifteen times they never called back where it got a chance to talk on the including trying to get a supervisor the board of directors are going to try to go to one of their meetings\nBut and they put out flyers saying when the meeting with the but they never put down the time\nSo I didn't know was eight o'clock in the morning or eight o'clock at night when it hit that put the window when ...\nOr ... they said the CDC in ours um rent we were having a window because of the zero why so but I went to the board meeting got very very nasty personal\nWith the way I may go back [laughter] um so that's where I Am\nYeah but it was but it has nothing to do with you the problem is you're probably you're probably going to need a lawyer\nOr to get you out of it it will be dismissed I mean there's no question you're you don't have liability here are based on what you said because you didn't know that you're innocent he just came out and do this you don't know what he paid for which credit card you have no idea now they fraud the company but it's a superior court action\nOr ... you know at this point uh I Would contact a lawyer\nOr that's representing the or the company that suing and and just and send them a letter first of all say he was going on and just say hey I I had nothing to do with this\nNothing and lay it out and just say I I really appreciate if you were dismissed this because I shouldn't be a defendant\n... it's one of those where you will win but you have to go to court dismissed and if the lawyer actually gives a damn and views you as an instant is an innocent party here and you truly are uh then there should be a dismissal just because he's a decent guy\nRight sometimes not but that's worth a shot just a\nLot of the founder no there's no there's nothing to counter to nothing to counter sue on a because even if you are not liable I in the end there is not a frivolous lawsuit or he did work on your house the allegation if you were caught up in this is legit it's a legitimate allegation and may not be true\nBut it is an allegation it's not as if he just grab your neighbor and started suing your neighbor and there's no connection so but you do not counters too but at first I just asked to get out of the damn thing and then and then you probably have to see a lawyer especially if it's an enormous amount of money\nOkay well a lot quicker than I write in a ... the attorney but I also have to file every bond\nYes you do yes you do within thirty days you have to follow the response and you need some help that we're on\nAn avid attorney I could see that\nYou can do that yourself you write well actually I go to a paralegal and because you want to put some of that yeah you want to just there are some legal language that you have to know now you can go on the Internet and do your own research ah that talks about the fences and their affirmative defense is\nBut uh it's yeah you can do it yourself or with a little bit of research I absolutely\nLorraine Hi Lorraine welcome to handle on law I fail yes\nI took my car or in the habit that this is a pattern noise in my car and now I don't think my breaks for perfect when I took the car or don't drive a car I'm\nSure you have a I chase and and then you have to pay for\nAll right ah yeah\nFigure out first of all you want the money back for what you paid for and that's it that's all you're gonna get a weekend in fact I didn't fix a the noise ah you're still the same place with a noisy car and it could be the battering you're hearing aid is going south and you're hearing rattling noises and uh I have no idea how that works\nBrian Hi Brian welcome ...\nWanted to ask you for your whenever I've seen like down to he's trying to uh talked me into installing a bread on a a I have an open more that ah\nBeen chewing on pretend you're no no uh\nNo problem who have been trying to talk me into installing a bridge on their thing and it was a big three and a half weeks ago I allowed him to do it he turned thirty five hundred dollar and part of that preparation for bridge is you're going down\nTo write two teeth on uh yes I have one that I've\nBeen in a structured and calling for three and a half we thought it was settled down it didn't I've been on ibuprofen eight hundred milligrams you know twenty four hours a day for almost a month now that we can end up on this\nYesterday and ah he says that I'm going to need to root canal that grounded proved them too much for the call is almost to the sort\nOf that's lovely okay so what's your question\nThough his response of uh my original Dennis responses\nIt's just one of those things that have\nNo no it does that first of all I don't even understand why a dentist would push for a bridge today when they're dental implants\nI mean all you have to do I have a bad do you put in a dental implant so you don't have to do a bridge which I mean I have a bridge but it was put in the decades ago before implants were even around so I I have no choice but I mean the guy is from what you said this is pure malpractice\nNow you need a I have to go to another Dennis it'll say yeah this is crazy and then as soon as that happens or you get to take 'em for malpractice problem is how much is dental malpractice worth\nA but now you start going and doing all kinds of research first step get another Dennis get a second opinion to say this is crazy this is not just one of those things that happened this is malpractice on its face and then you go from there and then you start talking to\nMedical malpractice people are in there's plenty to specialize in dental malpractice\nAnd I'm not really interested in pursuing my\nFingers right now than get it straightened out and send them a bill me going to show them anyway and if it's\nUnder ten thousand dollars a year go ahead and there's no problem and go to small claims court and other problems going\nTo be you'd have to bring a dentist in there you're gonna you're going to have to bring in a dentist a dental a dentist who is going to be a witness because he's going to say\nIn my professional opinion this is one of those things and it just went south and he's within the that is you are within that tiny little percentage that no matter what job I Do it's going to go south okay and and I\nLet her be the appropriate way being thought of it then\nYeah maybe or bring in lots of them are bringing in two or three and then see what the judge has to say\nOK okay alright traumatic yeah tennis is he spent all these years talking you into doing something\nWent in in ... when you when you get a dentist hockey when anything you go to a dentist when you need a dentist\nKnow you've probably heard by now or the new hack a Facebook actually Facebook\nHas had two acts within a couple of weeks of each other and it's kind of crazy how many tens of millions\nOf people have had their odd information exposed to these hackers
