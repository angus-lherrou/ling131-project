in Santa Barbara said David he passed an ordinance said restaurant employees will be punished with up to six months of jail time or a thousand dollar fine if they get plastic straws to their customers\nBars restaurants other food service establishment ... um they'll still be allowed to hang up plastic stirs but only if customers request them\nOnly they request them\nAnd that's why I predict at some point here with a more every day it seems like a new Tucson restaurant is like oh we're going to see the ocean living in the desert yeah and\nIt has nothing to do with it again ten rivers in Asia and Africa lead to up to Ninety five percent of all the plastic pollution in the oceans but they're going to make a difference it local scene in downtown Tucson and they ban stretches of so insane so interesting\n[noise] um there's more of a need to get to that was\nAnd by the way can you you got to put that one and by itself on the radio channel okay I couldn't hear it 'cause I was talking to the foot and then you'll enjoy when you listen to it again I already dot coms or Jerry Lewis thank you oh You're welcome All right we've got we've got to place them a thank you some Trump stuff\nOr will do we get back what the the comments that Trump made yesterday um what he said about trade with junk junk or to you guys said 'cause again at our our lawmakers on both sides they all think Trump's an idiot and he has no idea what he's doing yet again Europe linked right they blinked\nThey said fine you got us we'll cut our terrorists\nIt's awesome what happened and it's like you've kind of being downplayed in a way by the media because it was the one simple as that will continue with this ... of Ninety two sons most stimulating by the way this is this is hilarious before we continue with the uh the trade stuff right there's a story from the Associated Press\nYou know student loans right uh you know when I was on with that\nAre that old hag at Fox News in the interview over the weekend she's an old I mean she said God trumps just joined on student loan prize manning it Obama destroyed it by taking out of the private sector the government being in charge and if you have a pulse you get a loan right\nAt some point you take it alone or with their responsibility as yours so\nI had to lower the price of college so it's more affordable well you\nYou don't give everybody a loan and the college the college is raised tuition like crazy because everybody was getting a loan just as long as you're getting money will raise the price you're going to pay anyway\nSo it's ridiculous it's too much and there are so many colleges that are just scams they have their way too bloated too many majors I make no sense if you're a women's studies major what are you going to do in life besides be annoying\nYou can organize Regina marches what are you going to do go on Fox News yeah and and him and yellow over me yes\nThat [laughter] so Betsy ... the education secretary here's this here's the headline ready for this Associated Press Betsy\n... proposes rules that would cut student loan relief by an estimated Thirteen million dollars\nYou're taking thirty billion away from students wait\nWait wait but how do they started students who are defrauded by their schools would have a harder time getting their federal loans are raised under new proposed rules by the Trump Administration Wednesday\nYou're ready the proposal aims to replace a set of Obama era rules that were never implemented\nDrew applause for from the for profit industry sharp criticism from advocacy groups in that represent student borrowers really what's going on you ready for this under their proposal students would be eligible for a loan relief if they can prove their schools\nKnowingly misled them with statements are actions that directly lead them to take out loans order all the school so that would be a higher bar they right so one you have to prove you've been to ... you can't just say you are and get money back you have to prove it lifts so mean it says you're it'd\nBe a higher bar then the bar or a defense rules finalized under Obama twenty sixteen after the collapse of\nTo for profit schools ITT Tech and Corinthian Colleges those rules allowed a relief in a wider range right have a breach of contract now it says here devoted ... says well students should be protected from fraud\nThey also have an obligation to do research before picking schools oh the ... this was just terrible right research [noise] the education department [noise] but in a statement said post secondary students are adults\nWho can be reasonably expected to make informed decisions if they have access to relevant and reliable data about program outcomes\nI mean that's why I said when are they one of the lawsuit is going to take place where the people that major in you know women's studies or\nWhatever these stupid majors aren't stuff like that they can't get a job are they going to sue universities they might as well rights but they chose to do this stuff like I don't feel bad if people graduate with a ... billion dollars in debt\nIn college and they have trouble paying it off because they choose things that don't pay a lot of money\nYou have to ask yourself is it worth it would have if I Want to be a social worker I'm not gonna make that much money would it be better for me to do two years in community college to save money and then two years at a regular college after that probably like you have the power to make the choice I still have I have one year\nNext July is when I finally pay off my student loans I chose to do that I\nChose to leave a profitable a profitable job as a bartender I was paying cash for college\nRight I chose to leave and go into radio and take out loans because I knew if I were to make it in radio I had to get in it early and work my way up I chose to die I took the chance it's on me so I mean if it didn't work\nOut it's still on me as it worked out\nSo people have I mean there were ... she said they're adults you're adults you have the chance it's up to you as simple as that\nSo she said they were adults they can actually they should be able to make reasonable choices I mean this is this is going to make the snowflakes melts you expect me as an adult to make an actual choice\nAnd on top of the world\nIs really your love

the other party should be responsible for anything reasonable your damages or your damages and there is a and if the damages run that you'd eat forty five days for example the repair your car they just pay for that is what happened to me\nI'll get my car had to effectively be replaced and since it's a beamer three quarters of the parts had to come in from Germany on a ship\nAnd so it was almost two and a half months and do you know the other side just cough it up now I had to pay for and I put it on my credit card after thirty days\nAfter I don't want to do what I mean I don't think you have a choice I don't think you have a choice because the other side isn't going to send the check out until the repairs finished\nWhat my question is like what the white cat my inner part of the companies

the other insurance company that's paying you\nHas nothing to do with your insurance company not aware of what's happening is it's your insurance company is fronting the money and the other side is

a bunch of BS\nYou can't sell your interests to someone else is there I you have a lease correct yes you're right and it is there anything in the least that gives the owner of the property the right to deny new owners from coming in for example they have to well they have to okay you\nKnow then you're fine then this guy's crazy then if he went in and lock the door okay then I couldn't get out oh man do you have a lawsuit against these people\nCall but I call the cops and they say that was beautiful it couldn't go any\nYeah it is on the ... yeah costs won't do anything ... this this is a civil

out the minute he said no that moment that you know I don't think so\nUh so I mean there's going to be some argument as to uh you wave your rights you should have come in sooner so it's going to be the the issue is going to be damages a and you're going to argue two years' worth of loss of income and then it's a I I don't understand how an owner\nOkay that's the way we do it makes sense to me I

check let me tell you people normally do they use that deposit towards their last month's rent\nAnd even though technically uh the landlord can force you to pay the rent\nThe the problem is that he has to offset the seven hundred and fifty dollars that he has so it really becomes a wash and so just see what happens try or just call him and just tell a landlord can I use\nThe uh the deposit towards the last month's rent and if a places and reasonable shape it should be OK depending on what a bastard the landlord has arisen\nAlright alright alright there you go see some question sure why
