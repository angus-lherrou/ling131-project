premiums are rising or you can't afford them or you don't want to do it anymore give us a call will take a look and see what we can do for you remember financial group it's about both registered investment advisory and they broke a dealer\nThe registered with the SEC the members offend right and the members of set back on the show talking about different products a different strategies and also we all have our own ideas whether it's our our our our ... our ideas\nAre strategies products everything has some type of risks we highly suggest you understand the risks prior to investing it's important\nIt's important because when the markets go up in September in a month that's not supposed to really go up and you're feeling\nGood understand the risks that can happen after that\nIf you do not take some money off the table if you do not weigh some cash if you do not protect yourself and the markets fall have the worst October since two thousand seven\n\nYou will pay at least mentally you should have been prepared because you chose not to do anything before and that is why we tell you to take the risk allies test to make sure that your portfolio and your risk tolerance match up\nYes we have cash in on the sidelines we've had cash in on the sidelines we always have cash on the sidelines August September and October yes we're looking to be by is one thing you have to understand about the markets right now\nYes the down and corrective territories which means about ten percent most of the stocks underneath underlying making up the index is already in bed markets\nWhere Facebook is\nLook at even Amazon look at a lot of the tech stocks look at three AM looked at a lot of the stocks in the dial that down a lot of stocks at the end Serbia down over twenty percent already\n\nIt's a little bit different than we had in two thousand eight two thousand they we had a situation where the banks were collapsing and there was selling that continued to go on today we have three things that are causing the markets to be nervous\nThe election\nRising interest rates in Paris\nWell you know a two way street elections are going to be done so the markets can deal with that we do know Sunday the terrorists are going to be all fixed we've already fixed it and dealing with Europe where you're already dealt with Mexico and Canada there's no way of China the biggest abusers of all of them all\nTrying to act as an emerging country and getting all those breaks for being a a emerging country when they got how many billions of people and how many people how much money they're getting from everybody else in the unbalanced trade\n\nNow there's some pain to pay to equal playing field\nBut how could they have the strongest economy how could they have the strongest army military as one of the top two or three ... uh uh countries in the world competing with us every day but yeah they're the emerging country and we have to foot the bill\n\nYes there's some pain I promise you that pain is a lot worse than ours\nWe\nWill prevail and that also\nBut in the meantime we have to go through some pay in here and it's not so much to terrorists the terrorists will reason why some of these companies are using for excuses he knew know that anytime that company wants to look up to the future they're going to tell you everything that can go wrong so they can surprise\nBut it's just in case it does affect them they already told you a year ahead of time that this could be the case\n\nBut they're not telling you is consumer spending is through the roof at the GDP it into is another three\nAnd a half percent these numbers that no one ever thought that we would get to or were there the economy is strong\nThe terrorists will be fixed interest rates will stop going higher or at least what's going to happen I think it's going to happen to probably raise one more time what ... saying we're going to be more\nLooking towards the information coming to us it's not going to be just yes we have to raise interest rates we've done that will be more sensitive\nTo market conditions inflation growth housing what's going on they're going to say I don't want to ruin the economy I just want to make sure doesn't overheat they start even talking that way it's going to be a great thing for the markets\n\nTo mention what happens after the midterms the third year the ... of every president usually is the best year that they have robots come out would incredible numbers of how much the markets actually move up after these midterm elections\nAnd you'll get a double digit returns so if you sell now or don't put your money back to work between now and the end of the year you could be missing out no one said in the markets can't go down more talking about what happens at the end\nAnd I know when I hear it more and more violent what if I'm Out here when this happens is what\nYou're not here and it doesn't matter\nAnd I'll never forget my grandmother and two thousand two when the markets crashed after nine eleven and they went down to choose a hundred years old and she said\nTake this money and put it in there for the grandchildren and the great grandchildren I Know I won't be here when this comes back but it does it matter I Know will come back I watch every markets comeback since Nineteen twenty nine since ... depression I watched it come back\nI didn't have money then I Wish I did in Nineteen eighty seven in the markets came back in Ninety four they came back Ninety eight they came back\nTwo thousand one will be no different the markets will come back\nAnd she would have said the same thing or two thousand eight after we've made a new high after two thousand one that the markets come back and make new highs that's what they do\n\nIt's painful it's scary how am I going to live how am I going to do this gets wet you will it's not the money that kills you it's the health that kills you know how much money you have in the world will not help\n\nDefeat some of the health problems that we get as we get older and I tell people all the time to spend the money you have great you spend the money why why should go down and go get all pissed off that you'd be three hundred thousand dollars and now you only up a hundred and fifty\nWill spend it enjoy it do something with it because what happens is the markets will definitely go down\nTimes and that definitely go back up at times just a matter of time that's why it's long term investing you buy the good stuff you never put too much one stock you're diversify and it goes forward so if you look at what's going on in\nThe elections are gone done in a week from Tuesday interest rates\nWill find out in December and the terrorists are going to be fixed it some time we didn't have three defended of things in two thousand eight\nWe had a collapse of the banking system that we never thought would come back as Merrill Lynch and started having to go downhill and then you had best er into Lehman Brothers go out of business\nNot having that now you have see us go out of business is that a surprise anybody\nOn we've evolved into the technology world even when you go shopping you go on your phone and you order on Amazon because it's cheap we've all become cost conscious\nBut it prices keep going higher but inflation in check\nBusinesses are making money I told you this before we have not even seen the effects of that tax break yet they came in this year so when everybody starts in February and march and April in doing their taxes that's when they're going to feel the difference\nThat's when they're going to see some checks coming back that's when they're going to see another stimulus in this market as long as the markets don't act like they're going to blow up we keep spending and that\nThink that they can spend that things are going to be better we didn't have that for the last Fifteen Years were like okay I'm going to spend some money but I kind of keeps them on the side I got to pay down debt\nCorporation woman's picking out ten twenty Thirty years they were thinking out two three years\nWhen you have corporations sticking out that far they're thinking in there the money that goes to work and we investing is incredible we've talked about the colleges that just setting up to to to hire people to train people the way they want and being trained\nWhy did we have to go through the whole well repeal peeled the whole thing or or why didn't the Democrats when they had to start tweaking it and say hey we got a problem here we've got to fix this\nBecause they were afraid that it would be fail you on the other side and it's not\nWhat we want to do what we need to start asking a fellow Americans a fellow people our congressmen start working for us come up with compromise is that the coastal states and the and the ad in the middle in states we all can get something out of it\nThat's what we need everybody needs to be better and we got a good economy\nLet's not blow it let's not screw this up\nOkay by now ... you know going ahead and changing everything let's keep going better and where we need to tweak it fix it and make it better but you do it and we won't can use more money\nEvery corporations should be able to make more money it helped everyone must be the wealthiest nation in the entire world by a long shot let's have the greatest military in the world by a long shot let people come to us and make decisions from there so we don't have to go do that\nYeah we're going to screw up and yeah we're going to give people money that don't deserve it we're going to give arms to people that are going to shoot the wrong people I get all that and that's probably that's the world and that's what's gonna happen because people aren't truthful\nBut let's start with us\nOkay and let's figure out what we need to do because our economy is good we don't want to blow it and let's make sure that everything else goes along with it and will be a very very happy group of Americans will be back\nWe got pay the costs are today we're going to bring them back and we're going to talk markets all day long this is the

I think I've ever in\nMy own ever put your hand in a bus to get a cough\nAnd now I Know one thing I can find out a rattlesnake means is very good very taste oh you'll eat it won't be around ... am on the merits like check on the line of it it's very similar to ... fried chicken was it was excellent as a matter of fact\nAt All right let's move on because that I can handle [laughter] what are we introduce improperly since you do such a good job with that\nNow with the introduction well I'm not sure that I'm going to go through the whole entire back story but Peter and I met um on the strength as New York I maybe I Need to tell the story because that sounds a little weird\nTo get it done so what you pay the idea that they will they see you later she was at that it had it a second job yeah [laughter]\nEverybody now is I think that listen to the show that we took um LA San our oldest daughter to New York for her high school graduation 'cause we talk about all this stuff all the time\nBut we were fortunate to me Peter giving an interview on the street tiny couldn't have been more perfect and I I\nWanted to get a picture with Peter [laughter] to send a team and ribbon and dad just meet him 'cause here all we see Peter as you on come on CNBC and they're always interviewing him and that nice nice traders jacket\nAnd we thought oh wow this is really add to that is just call and I said this is what we do for a living\nBut we ended up getting to know each other at you it took me down on the floor of the exchange I I've never I've been there and said\nYeah maybe middle school with my dad long time ago and I'm just a great experience I learned a lot you took a lot of time\nShowing my husband and I and my sister and Ali San ... around and watch the opening bell Sherrilyn Williams yeah that's right yeah you let me me Jim Kramer is that I was crazy 'cause I kept wanting to me and I said hey can I go meet nickel a pet ... from Fox yeah like whatever Natalie it's kind of took me around that\nBut he was right when you make Kramer and he didn't really need to was in that friendly\nNow it's not that he wasn't friendly and he was um it wasn't ... he's not like Peter very at not as outgoing I'm well here's here's\nAn inch river which is strange because you know when you see him on his show right he you would think he's a huge ... extrovert but he's not not he's not at all he's he's he's very shy his body language and that he\nNever which isn't there in the in the guy who will you know periodically but he always looks down and he's he's a very very not he's a very smart guy I don't know what I mean well given that he's he's a you know has a Harvard degree which we can argue about that but\n... said I I Know he um he is a very smart guy and he also has a I don't think he has a ... memory where you can remember everything you see but he has an incredible memory and he can pull up facts and and you know um discuss basically any company\nRight off the right off the bat it's not even like he has any kind of a preparation going into it you don't want to show they do tell them what company they're going to you know like when you call in they ask you what you're going to talk about and then they'll put the the stock symbol up on his screen and\nAs soon as he gets on the phone with you he's off to the races so you know he has a incredible memory in an incredible um you know he just he's very depths of his death of knowledge is is really unique so\nBut uh you know what I found that my career was that I went a lot I was horrible and in some aspects of the job that I was doing was mechanically I quit NATO subtract\nBut my from New how well I traded and my ... one of my two of my skill sets were relationships with people which down on the trading floor you needed to have that and I had a very good intuitive feel for markets are directions trends you know what I kept up on a lot of different\nUh different things with a lot of brokers didn't do like I Would understand we would be in certain stocks with trading certain companies and I would learn what the company did so you know when news came out in a particular\nPart of that industry I knew how it would impact the company that we you know we were trading so\nThere were a lot of things that you know [noise] I did that a lot of other brokers didn't do you know most of them just wanted to earn a living and they had you know you're really good living but they didn't really go the next step and I tried to so I think that that was one of the ... one of my head and values to my firm and to my clients so\nAnd what else we ought to know as a dog a king or so [laughter] I think that the sec scary off from going into fourth or you know what that was just my bigger issue was that I'm\nDefinitely allergic to poison ivy Mm I Know and I hate that some of my fear but that means we'll come back to the next section and you know what that is it's Dylan's domain [noise]\nYou're going to listen to him and talk about the GDP we'll be right back when I measure [noise]\n[noise]\n\nI look back here on Monday about a show it's a great show today we got guest all over the place we're talking about different things but\nBefore we go to Dylan's domain I got to congratulate the Wildcats catch plural Wildcats plural you'll have a great game last night and those of you that no\nAlso Kentucky Wildcats fans my son played Dylan played for him they won this evidence one they got a chance to win the FCC east by beating Georgia next week\nAs pretty darn good so we got very very happy while catch all over the studio today in many many reasons but I'll tell you one thing about that right Peter everyone complains I you know everyone's even everyone's ... when he was a hell of a lot\nBetter than losing who wants to be a loser now always has been right you you you lose again they don't get it out you know so much out here yet but like the SEC 'cause I Know you went to Tennessee they take losing to hot it feels horrible not that you go out and do something bad but it's All right\nYeah yeah and another game and that's why I think it matters so much when you do have a season I mean you've been around you know how bad Kentucky been for a long time and football rice is an amazing\nYear for the ... really is probably a ...\nRight but the microphone closer to your mouth he and I think he had it on its own but put it closer to turn it up there you go all the little things you gotta understand so now so now Mr wildcat Seventy one go ahead and uh the Dylan's domain\nAlright well today it's still wisdom and we're talking about GDP GDP was twenty four one trillion dollars and the second quarter US GDP is ...\nThe number one in the world currently and the and he was growth rate of ... percent between July of September\nWas what it was after the Fort ... in the previous quarter this was a one point two percent from this time last year but what is ... ... gross gross domestic product measures the value of all funneled goods and services produced in the country in a given period usually a quarter or a year when it's\nTalked about it includes all private and public consumption government outlays investments bribing inventory paid in construction costs and the foreign balance of trade\nThe calculation is C. plus jeep was I was an act which seagulls consumer spending gee equals government spending I equals country's total investment and and actually it was a total exports which means exports modest imports\nThere are two types of GDP it's nominal and real nominal GDP doesn't account for inflation or deflation resulting in higher GDP number\nUsed this is used when comparing different quarters of out but within the same year real GDP is calculated using the GDP priceless later which is the difference and the difference in price is between the current year and the base you an example of this is if prices rose five percent in the base here the plate or would be one point of the\nOverall ... real GDP is better index of expressing long term national economic from\nThe G empty is gross ... gross national product this different from the GDP that in that measures the production of levels of any American or American own business regardless of where the actual product is taking place so can be in Europe it could be an age it could be anywhere\nBut GPS important because is most common indicator of economic health of the country as well as a gauge of a country standard of living and there's also use to compare the productivity the productivity of various countries economists use GDP to keep track of how an economy is doing\nA decrease in the GDP means indicates recession in an increase in GDP indicates economic expansion\n[laughter] well ... ...\nPages so that ... well it ... not well yeah [laughter] good [laughter] the people that read by the time he was appalled player he's got their strong\n[laughter] to keep trying really strong what [laughter] so\nSo the GDP number helps the government make decisions whether to simulate a stagnant economy by putting money into it or slow down economy that's getting overheated businesses use of GDP figure to decide how to expand her contract or contract their production and other business activity\nAnd that was also maintenance we've got a very good down ... to look up I Will do the research has and get it back\nThat was good I learned something someone see I didn't I didn't know the formula do you know the woman who now I did not have you know the\nForm you know I knew the formula but I had never use it\nThat's why I didn't know it good jobs ... you get better every week that's good so ten years or twenty eight years like we've been doing this you'll hopefully it'll be good yeah let me ask\nYou this question ... from a GDP standpoint\nWhat what do you know what signals a recession from the release of GDP numbers quarter to quarter what that what the definition is ever recession as it relates to GDP solely slowing down or if it's selling down\nFive if it was lower than that right\nThey look at too or negative quarter of negative GDP is from a GDP standpoint that's officially a recession\nAnd I don't think if we keep trumping that we're gonna have to worry about it or not\nClose to negative right now but there are other signals have session and there are other there are other economic\nData points that will signal you're headed that way but from the GDP standpoint it's back to back ... negative quarterly GDP numbers\nYour job doing I got to get a question for you Peter yes do stocks anticipate a recession did they tell you when you watch the stock market and say we're going to have a recession\nA well I mean a lot of people would like to think they could but not every indicator is you know it works one of the things that I found is that when you look at the housing numbers\nOr you know new homes existing homes if the sales and those two categories start pulling back\nInconsistent following months I think it's like three months generally a recession will be it's not far off but what if it's a cause because they wage enjoyed instrument because you're even raise interest rates and caused a recession do it's usually housing is is one of the best indicator is over a potential looming recession\nOr you know we didn't see that in two thousand and seven\nBut there were other factors in two thousand seven that caused this we're almost in a recession at that point I Believe and the banks were you know on the verge of failing all the way across the board shows was that was a cataclysmic more cataclysmic type of thing but generally the recession so we've had over the last forty years they\nStart with housing\nBlowback and then I and as such with raising interest rates are they do anything would raise the kind of stopped for a little bit I think you're kind of making then make didn't actually watch normally markets do very well Seattle rising interest rates are what we have some other things to talk about too with the liquidity if they go into ... we have some good things to talk about the next hour stay tuned in some money out of the show [noise]\n\n\nFrom the region will studio your local area for you dot com is fantasy instead of a nice yard radio station [noise]\nHey translate not have a place anywhere I'm Pam who sales Fox News the words of Pittsburgh Mayor Bill to do though as his city mourns the loss of eleven people who was shot and killed while worshipping at a Senate cod\nAnyway a e as a letter of the week we're gonna talk it was a busy week of earnings economic\nReleases energy you know we got the mid term elections coming up emerging markets we can throw in there as well um I'm gonna try to keep this shorter than I normally do because I Would rather listen to the extrovert\nI'm In my ear a because there's a lot to learn from Peter from the floor um anyway in trouble\nThe way and I'm a you had to throw that in just 'cause he likes during the ... I Know here from the floor\nAnd anyway uh you know the market had a rough week there's no doubt about it I think we were down about four percent on average and almost\nA on all the indexes I don't know whether it was the investor enthusiasm that petered out whether it was as ... as screens ... Greenspan said back in a in the nineties or this irrational like ... I don't think we're at that point but maybe\nA things were a little too exuberance\nBut anyway the earnings that came out really driven by four companies you know we have caterpillar and three M company report on Tuesday and that drove the market down for five hundred points or so and then on that we recovered Wednesday and then on on Thursday um we had a excuse me\nIt was Wednesday Thursday Friday there\nOn on Thursday we had um Amazon and Google come out earnings were good but their sales were below what expectations were and uh you know the market fell apart against so those are words through most of of will not most were through with about half of\nThe earnings that are going to come out um and according to facts at the third quarter a forty eight percent of the companies that the S. and P. five hundred of reported\nSeventy seven percent of the S P five hundred companies are have reported positive surprises at fifty nine percent of reported positive sales surprises so the numbers are still good or the earnings growth is at twenty two point five percent\nI'm In the uh originally I think expectations were that they would grow at about Nineteen percent\nSo they're going faster than what the expectations were we still have a number of them to report the revenue growth what's up seven point six percent that's a little bit lower this quarter than the last quarter\nAnd the valuation Peter I know you used a different ... but the forward twelve month PE ratio a is Fifteen point five percent that continues to come down I think a last quarter we were up around the Seventeen point seven or so\nSo um it'll be another busy wake up learning and we'll see where that takes us\nUm as far as the economy goes\nA Dell and talked about the GDP number that came out uh what's it for three three and a half percent which was better than expected I think the one of the key factors that came out of there was the measure of inflation that the fed uses it was a one point six percent\nWhich was lower than the two point two percent that was expected by economists\nAnd consumer spending grew by four percent a third quarter that's another key factor there we also had durable goods orders come out on earlier in the wake increased point eight\nTenths of a percent September that was that third gain in the last four months and they had been forecasting a one point nine percent dropped so\nThat number added a little um\nEnthusiasm to the ... the economic numbers\nThe consumer sentiment is still very high in Ninety eight point six percent in October barely off its eyes so the two year treasury is a two point eight one percent at the end of the week the ten year at three point oh eight\nThe thirty year a three point three to money flowed from the equity market end of the bond markets a that spread a between the two and a ten year roommates at twenty seven\nBasis points that's still not really ... you know a a a recession here\nNow [noise] what are some of the effects of rising rates on the pipelines we have a lot of people that own the pipelines and in our accounts a rising interest rates if they continue to move up\nThere becomes an alternative to investing in these Hi Devon empires\nAnd of course borrowing costs rise as well so if you're on the pipelines you know just to make sure that you're not over\nExtended in any one any one of them the emerging markets um had a terrible year the market cycle quotes that we look at case only are there at the bottom of the list as far as an asset class\nOr through the end up September or the emerging markets are down seven point seven percent after being up thirty seven point three percent in two thousand Seventeen so there's been a little correction there we know that what's that's the bottom eventually it's gonna work its way towards\nThe top maybe not the top but it'll work itself up\nA there's a the word emigrate\nImmigrate how do you say that\nNot immigrate with an eye with any immigration\nAndme ethnically\nAnd eat him as a big move for a lot of people from Honduras and while I'm a ... one of my life been caravan\nNo [laughter] but they're not they want to have a lot of emigrate\nAnd to the United states so ah you know that that's going to continue to unfold I think they're still march I expect a lot of them are going to give up\nThe waiting to what a next weekend right before the election they're way down there just north of the bag it on the door there just\nNorth of the border of of a of a\nDown a lot out there and it's hard to Mexico and so a long way away the elimination since seven eight days\nSo anyway bottom line here is to examine your shopping list for equities because they're on sale I think a Peter maybe can tell us more about what he thinks the markets so let's get back to Mr Peter\nYour job extremely ones [laughter] same spores as a ...

I mean this is a little bit more than what we've seen in the last seven or eight years but it's still\nYou know there are opportunities you're talking about just saw this in February not as bad as this some time to do this this is this is different I mean these are you know it in February was you know a hundred and fifty three hundred point moves maybe a five hundred point to move and then it it it and they used to find them up right away I mean it didn't carry over\nThis is the type of market that's going to be like this for a while and ... one of the reasons and I think that\n\n\n\nFox

of the New York stock exchange with thirty seven years that was a lot going on\n\nGood stuff in bed so let me ask you a question yes\nWe talked about this the other day we'll talk about the I'll go with them trading everyone sees that they don't understand it um\nObviously it exasperated markets in both directions but here it heads is the next thing you know goes down which when I see that that's when you don't sell you look for being a buying opportunity to go from there to ... ... talk a little bit more from the floor perspective of what you see when this happens\nWell you know what we um with our clients what we would do is whenever the situation when it happened where you start seeing that type of trading in in that\nIt it almost seems like it's a panic selling but it's not because there's not anybody on the other end panicking it's a computer models that are designed to\nUm sell out of certain positions at certain prices and as a tick through these prices they sell out more shares so what we would advise our clients to walk away let the market do what it's gonna do\nCome back in ... markets a little more stable when they're the the price fluctuation slice price fluctuations [laughter] that was last night\nComing down again make out there where you go to Bob\nDylan everybody yeah All right um yeah so what happens is the price fluctuations would a moderate and that's where we would bring our clients back and so we'd never participate in those movements because they\nYou know in in this is an old adage on Wall street that I basically road is that everyone is a genius only when the market's going up and there were no geniuses on the ... when the market's going down so\nYou know you let the market go where it's going to go when it's selling off and then you pick your spots and I think that goes with individual investors as well I think that's a smart move\n\nIt's hard and you know that it I think one of the things that our clients will call and ask\nPeople that listen to the show is\nIt exactly that and they get caught up in ... should I Do something here we we said a couple of weeks ago you know try to catch a falling knife no you don't even need to buy and we've had people ... what are you dealing we're not doing anything relating this thing's settled we're not going to panic out of that stuff\nBut we also we need to see where it settles him where it goes you've got a good plan\nUm you know and when you're dealing with that with the\nRetail investor and individual investor and this is their IRA they said their retirement money to take a monthly income you've gotta practice some discipline when these markets yeah as you would you agree from that standpoint that it's set in motion you said you don't get emotional yeah I don't know ... people be a whole ...\nEmotional ... yes they generally do hurt people and what if there's not an institutional fundamental reason for the market or stock to be going in a direction that it's going and\nThen you say the hell away from it I actually I mean that's that's the bottom line is that\nWhen you had two thousand seven two thousand they when the market went down to fifty eight percent of whatever the number was there was a fundamental reason why\nThe market and the economy was acting the way it was acting and that was there was a legitimate reason to get out but if a if a company is selling off because the markets selling off you know one and a half percent it is not any underlying fundamentally\nA fundamental reason why company is going you know prices going down like that you stay away from it because they're you know that could just be some sort of electronic trading or an algorithm that has just you know decided on load you just let it go I mean they're not you\nKnow I Would say probably Ninety percent of the time you're the bounce back as is bounces back to its original initial level or or\nDo you have a strategy on the upside of the market as opposed to the downside of volatility when you look at a stock that's arriving you look at in the Amazon you look at a Microsoft you look at it as\nIf Facebook from ... you know that I peeled at forty and dropped and gets to two hundred which what is your perspective or strategy to the upside\nI mean what the first thing is you know if I get into anything it's generally something I Know I'm you know I've I've advised people for thirty five years you invest in what you know\nAnd you know you know certain companies if you work for a company or if you have somebody who works for you know rock well ... and you know they're doing well they have what is coming out the you know dig in young\nYou know the company is going to do well so that that's my first rule of investing is to know the company you're investing in\nA generally on the upside what I Try to do is I Try to you know you can't time these things even those people think that you can I think they're trying to time in a move or down moving any stock is is is an fool's gold I mean it's a fool's errand it's just\nYou'd normally don't it normally doesn't work that well\nSo what I Try to do is I Try to average into certain things by like a company and I see that there's a there's an up with a momentum and up we're biased I'll Try to average into it I'm not going to go in all in at the very beginning I mean there are some people strategy they do\nA mind is more about averaging and it was over a certain period of time and also you know in that averaging into something that you believe if you look at a company and you say well I really like this I like this six month than a year prospect and you take a week or two weeks the by even if you're buying small\nYour average price is probably going to be right around the average with the stock moving up\nAnd they'll be opportunities there'll be potential arbitrators by maybe a little bit of itchy because of just because of market generation so you try to keep an average going and I mean it's a safe way as little as ... as a little less risk on it and you know my age now I'd like to be a little less risky\nWhat about accepting ...\nPeter yes I think you're one of our client that's likely to well I mean you know [laughter] ... that's the reason people use you know\nI Know we didn't ... says no no I mean but that's it's like you know people use a from like yours because you're you know your firms interest is their interest is ride your interest is there so\nBut yeah I mean it it's it it's almost\n... you know some people say that kind of investing his archaic but I think it's actually works very well you know you have to be very careful and there are opportunities will always be opportunities to buy something a little bit cheaper but you know at some point you want to be fully invested in whatever it is you're looking at and there's a reason why and that reason is something you're looking for something that's going to happen in a week\nOr that's not really invested in that ... you know over long term it's invested you\nKnow I think people individuals get very distracted in ... by because of technology and media news because it's a non stop cycle we've we've given the advice many times on the shell of\nBe aware of what's going on but if it's on all day long and rich and every and it I Can't remember what it might it now is that ... recession it
