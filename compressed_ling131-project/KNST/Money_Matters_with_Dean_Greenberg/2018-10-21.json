do that every single day we match our clients risk with the their portfolio risk and we make sure it's in the line it's simple it's easy today's technology\nAllows you to do that\nI saw one reason that fees and everything of come so low you can do use technology to take care of business\nAnd that's a benefit to investors that's a benefit to investors\nSo going back to the market's going back to where we are\nFlat and now we have the\nThe election and it's just so interesting that the Democrats\nRules the house and Senate would think that it's going to go down and if the fed and the Republicans keep the house in the Senate we think it's going to go up that just shows you the differences in policies and how clear it is a policies that drives the economy\nDown if you're one of those type people that just think capitalism is bad and capitalist so horrible and people that are successful uh uh pigs you know\nThen you're right I get it I get why you go the other way I come from the decide that you work hard it's okay to be successful\n... ballots to be successful\nI'm not embarrassed that I've worked hard that the people that work for me work hard there's so there's no problem with that why should we be embarrassed we help people every day we get back every day\nTo help other people be successful to understand to move forward\n\nI don't hide behind it it takes time and effort and and and and experience the fact that I got people in my office that have been around thirty five forty years tells you something about what I Believe in\nI Believe and experience it helps you get through all the problems we have barest about being successful no we'll continue to be successful but it's\nCrazy to me listening to all these people that even more successful multimillionaires all these Hollywood people all these tech people all these people out there that claim\nThey want it to the other way they don't they're the biggest capitalist in the world\nThey won't sign a contract for less money these football players that want to nail all the time and and and everything else in a you know I get it and it's about social injustice right but rather than doing something about it they want to just say it and do it\nBut yet they're not gonna go and play it better than they should get less money\n\nEverybody that gets money complains about taxes and then I hear why don't mind paying more taxes\nAs long as it's going to get right into you do get to have to pay more taxes than you complain about them so why don't we just put a strain on the table\nIf you make money it's okay to pay taxes just pay a lower percentage\nThis is what the craziest thing is if you're making a hundred thousand dollars and you're paying thirty thousand dollars in tax or thirty percent in taxes right you're paying thirty grand and taxes now because everything is so much better you make two hundred thousand and you only pay twenty five percent in taxes\nYou're paying fifty thousand to the government and taxes that's twenty percent more you are paying taxes in Dallas\nBut instead of paying the other way it would have been six they can pay twenty five but no one understands this part you would not be making that much more money if you didn't have a good economy if people citizens didn't have money to spend on what they need\nIt they didn't have money they didn't have jobs they can't pay money to do the other things so right now everyone I Know it was making more money\nEverybody\nIncluding the people that started in the restaurant business what may making minimum wage at six seven dollars an hour ten years ago\nNow making twelve Thirteen fourteen dollars they're all making more money\n\nI get it if you make less money doesn't get to spend as much as the person that's making more money I understand that but whose fault is that\n\nThe people that are making minimum wage I've not done most of the things you need to do that other people's Don and taking risk and go into colleges and and going to get jobs I'm working and doing the things you need to do not all but most\n\nIn the restaurant business so that was in and I hope never to be in it again the bottom line is the people in the kitchen in the back off that\nMany of them were from drug rehab\nComing out of jail\nSo these are jobs that they needed and now instead of making six seven eight dollars an hour they're making eleven twelve Fifteen dollars an hour\n\nBut do you think they ... they did they look at it any different than they did before no and that's where the problem is\nIn our society\nAlways going to have people at the lower end and people at the higher end and the people at the higher when like these movie stars in east Texas\nWho want to help all the lower people which we all do but I Want to help them any idea it given them the ability to be better to for them to believe in success for them to understand how to be better than what they're doing and make more money\nThat's what I Believe and I don't believe in just giving it to them\nIf they're able bodied but not able bodied was take care of everybody\nIf they need assistance let's take care of them I'm okay with all that but somebody that would rather just sit and get a check them work I'm not about that never happened never will be\nI get it some people have the ability and the background and just by the way the the born to do better when life I get that I also get the fact that there is other changes that we have made with box checking\nThat helps others and other races to help others so that the level goes down a little bit and I'm okay with that I\nUnderstand that comic backgrounds\nBut I don't understand is the philosophy that has gone away growing up I've always remembered by grandparents saying their parents wanted them to be better my father ... parents says I Want you to be better than them and my parents said to me I Want you to be better than us\nI'm here to make you better I'm here to support you know I was the first one in my whole entire family to go to college\nOkay\nBecause that's what they wanted that work for the phone company and they were nervous but they save money for me to go\nIf things as much as we know what's wrong that's their life\nAnd then\nWe still have to get along with them so however this works out I'm Glad I'm not the one having to make the decision because on the surface you want to tell Saudi Arabia I'm done with the\nThen how does that affect the world\nThey messed up we all know they messed up we don't believe in that but my question to you if you think it happens here\n\nRemember whitewater and Clinton all of a sudden people turned up dead no investigation but it happens it happens because the power don't know how to get people\nHappens all the time in trials people who threaten Joe is even though it's illegal witnesses go missing\nWe know it's illegal without a body without saying what do you do\nI'm not saying what happened is right it's totally wrong in much said when they do it here was right or wrong but it happens but when you do it on the world stage different\n\nNobody's perfect we are not perfect\nBut I Know this once we start changing our whole frame of mind about what we're doing and we're starting to do that now remember this\nWhen you have to look at the Democrats and worry about the markets we tracing what we've done and our economy is slowing and taxes going up and people spending money and corporations not being able to think about the future\nVersus the party that the economy's doing well people have money it's so much easier to get things done socially and and at all when things are good\nIt's not that easy to do when things are bad and people can have enough money to pay for their kids' education or the food on the table ought to be able to go ever go on vacation or to fix their car or to do anything else that they need to do\nThat's not the world we want to live and we want to live and the other world when you go out and people are happy because things are getting done\nThey have some extra money sitting around and things are doing way they want it we get all that and the economy's good all these things go on the problem we have is we'll worry about all these video or ideology problems\nAt home we detect on judgment if you're going to have a country of ... a country that has so many different religions and so many different races in so many different backgrounds who always to say someone should do something\nWe should never tell someone that can\nBelieve in Jesus of God and we can never say someone shouldn't believe in the Muslim religion do the Jewish religion but however we do things\nBut we need to do is become accepting of it all\nAnd working together and not putting the other people down [noise]\nWe'll be back this is the money manager [noise]\n\n\n\nFox News on that he hand like President Trump says the vote for Democrats to vote for the caravan of immigrants\nDemocrats want caravans they liked the caravans a lot of people say I wonder what started the caravan\nThousands hoping to make it to the U.S were

interesting campaign and I'm Talking about the midterms which are two weeks away from kids day it's hard to believe sixteen days\nAt what do you ever remember them being this important or this mattering or this caring or this like so involved I have a question for Dylan\nYou were talking about education you know how many senators and the United states I came in the mid to proceed\nI'm asking you [laughter] if you are right you see you got one right okay and how many representatives are there\nWell that's all I don't even know that [noise]\nYeah I'm sort of thing to Asia things you should have learned in school\nRight ...\nWhat's the number you might as well so I get a deal is a lot of people out there that don't know how many representatives I think it's for thirty five cents or thirty eight but I think it's right and that's what we know it's over four hundred we know what's on the five hundred\nSo yeah I should say even that number seven one's easy\nDoes every state Dell and have the same amount\nOf um Congress House members that within the proportional ahead\nThe job how 'bout centers senators they all have to say you know they've been they of course you got\nTo help it gives you ain't good job you did that at least ... take a big did drown where did you have a lot of pressure Internet in high school [laughter] elementary school or in college or at home or at home or at work are limited in school\nI don't think so foreign alright herself one yeah okay alright living on man you also point yes did you go to a point to women\n[laughter] I was a no no ... it would have been ... Williams high school\nWhich one Williams oh you went to Williams yes we were the Vikings okay [laughter] and I thought my answer is we were the ... there you go was that in the Arizona Mexico I don't know it\nCould have been washed Mexico a long time ago and now and that's what I'm saying\n[laughter] All right let's move on here interesting week ... ups we kept trying to go higher they just came back down and really at the end there was all flat again\nBattling it tried to go higher on outstanding issues you mentioned\nThat in your monologue but on Tuesday when they had the jolt report that was Tuesday right these weeks yes five days seemed to\nLately there's so much going on and so much news and so much happening and a lot of volatility here in October that you almost forget which day things were but\nTuesday was a very big rally the Dow was up over five hundred points almost five hundred and fifty points on the news of the jokes are port and that was a big big deal dean you mentioned that\nUm earlier but over seven million job openings and they are not enough people out there to fill them\nAnd um you know we've never been in this position in the economy when we talk about strength in America and for Americans I was reading a headline this morning that the Democrats if if elected if they take over you know their goal is to cut the uh\nIncrease the taxes back it rid of the tax breaks\nAnd start giving more handouts back it's and it just seems so opposite of what is good for this country when you have jobs that cannot be filled it seems like the better thing to do is turn this into a pro education\nI'm working opportunity there's all these things you can do if you live here in America\nThere's jobs but you got to figure out how to go get them people can't do it you're not going to have them handed over to you but go and start looking go to where it get educated in the places you need to be educated we talk about it in the office of\nAbsolutely an example you know wherever they're marketing JC penny the Web and marketing shares you know for and you can go through a number of those Facebook Facebook are there are a number of companies that you can have that twenty percent down so you can pick individual companies to use a shorter by\nUm or sectors for that matter are sectors that fried but when we talk in general route in general about bowling Baron markets on the market or talking about the whole you know the S P five hundred for example\nAnd the doubt and then that's right and the bottom line is that is why we always say you need to have some indexes and your portfolio why because they will go up all the time\nMaybe the stocks won't like if you have Facebook and that's that could be making new highs but Facebook isn't making it into high it's in the bear market and the reason it is as we know when the Dow what did they do they rotate the stocks out\nRather not performing and they put in stocks performing which always gives them the ability to go hire\nMe ask you a question if the market was down ... percent yes if we were in a better market mhm let's say friday we turned into a bear market right would we be bearish no but you wouldn't be wrong and be embarrassed by the by the definition of what a you know a a bear market\nSo I don't listen to that if I'm going to be buried show going to be berets Wilma crossing through the correction line of ten percent and try to as a tax write what is going down ... past twenty you might hold off of that you're looking for fighting opportunity\nNot selling All right we'll be back if somebody amount of show manning\n[noise]\nTalk [noise]\n\nBanning\nAnd welcome that you are listening to the money matters show on seven Ninety cayenne S T give us a call ladies you know five six seven eight eight eight zero ... if you have any questions for us\nComments thoughts\nAnything at all we are here last week and we started our new\nSegment and our segment was with Ellen\nCampaign I Know we've got it really is domain that was last week to keep an eye Dylan you really liked we asked everybody for feedback to Facebook we've got so we got emails we got a lot of response to thank you everybody\nDylan you think that you kind of like the first one that came in ... it makes you smile when you say and if you are very happy and something about it that that resonated with you know everybody gave us some very good suggestions\nAnd Tom we may have to change it up at some point but I think we're going to stick with Dylan's domain\nAnd the goal of this segment is every week Dell and will prepare\nIt kind of a breakdown in layman's terms of\nAn economic report or a term that we use on the show or that we use in the markets when talking about the economy and give them a little bit easier to understand explanation of what it is what it means why it's important et cetera\nSo Dylan we do not have it at Sesame Street song to bring you in it's just that pain and now dealings domain to take it away\nOh thank you well this week we're talking about retail sales report that came out on Monday morning retail sales for September ... five hundred nine billion dollars which was a point one percent increase from August or from September\nAnd four point seven percent higher than September of two thousand Seventeen total sales from July two thousand Eighteen through September to those Eighteen were five point nine percent from the same time period or a year ago\nBut what do retail sales even ... so retail sales are among the economic indicator that covered the previous month is combined measure of the cells of retail goods in store\nCatalogs and out of store sales over state of beard this measure is based on a monthly data sample from roughly fifty five hundred retail and food service firms in the United states the sample is supposed to be a representation of the entire country\nRetail sales or an indicator of the pulse of an economy and its projected path towards an expansion or contraction this is because retail sales are miserable consumer demand for finished good\nWhy is this important retail Sears sales are important because consumer spending accounts for two thirds of the gross domestic gross domestic product in the United states\nThis major retail sales major indicator of economic health in the U.S also means that any extended drop off in retail spending can trigger a recession by lowering tax receipts and forcing companies to reduce their workforce\nRetail socks become\nMore volatile during periods when retail sales reports are released because individual retail companies are also released their own sales figures at the same time each month and it and investors to all the data and tried to process what it's telling them in a stronger economy annual retail sales rose by about three percent\nThis four point seven percent increase from last September to December indicates that the United states is having a strong\nEconomy for that is ... very good\nRetail sales how much you can contribute to that number that way\n[laughter] [noise] I\n... I'm a I'm a contributor but I'm probably a contributor along with\nWith others but I I can be quite at that\nSaid you said it breaks down how many fifty five hundred\nTo take a sample of about fifty five hundred retailers like Amazon included in that\nIn one of those numbers are they didn't specify [noise] but it's more like I think it's more a local of the guy go around the country right states gay humor\nWill get fat I'm sure different um different areas and you know allow rate of getting that feel\nRetail sales is one of the recession rush\nIndicators ... and you said as you said it's positive right now yeah right I was\nAbout [noise] what's it also tied to Russia is investor confidence to write in K\nIf investors are confident about what's going on and do we have just all time high investor confidence\nConsumer confidence Schumer okay is that what you mean yes I I've just double checking that adventure in butler that's why I Know what you're talking about you do but everybody listening might nighttime at consumer confidence and yes they do\nBecause you if you believe things are good you'll spend today because you know you'll get it\nTomorrow and that's where we have the economy today in corporations have you ever saw corporations in the last Fifteen Twenty years actually twenty actually be doing what they're doing today planning for future not only three four or five years but twenty Thirty years from now\nThey're doing things for long term success and that's what we finally have the different and most people don't get why that is important but it is they're not worried about just holding on an audience\nI should say how do we spend this case was willing to keep getting cash as we keep making money\nAnd it should grow that way and that's what how the why our economy's going the other thing is everyone so worried about China and well things are going to look at Mexico everyone would talk to about people that have a\nManufacturing in Mexico it booming they they can't even keep up with all the production that they need to do down there because of what's happening\n\nWhat talking nothing either often okay [laughter] yeah you know and and and that goes back to\nOur a sales numbers everything that we have going on just keeps getting better and better\nAnd I don't I don't want to ...
