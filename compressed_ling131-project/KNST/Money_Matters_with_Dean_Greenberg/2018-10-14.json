in hosting the money matters show which we've been doing for twenty\nEight almost Thirty years\nStarted in Nineteen eighty nine Nineteen Ninety off and on\nAnd we started doing our own show\n\nThe market's dropped over four percent this week\nDidn't even give you one of these signs didn't give you any hands it just\nDid it and everyone thought that it was going to come back especially the day we were down over eight hundred points and just didn't then the next day we started up boom right back down we dropped another five hundred and some odd points\nNext day\nOpened up four hundred when all the way back down about a hundred came back up two hundred and something back to the all the way back down backup backed down back up and finished up almost three hundred or two hundred and eighty seven points to the upside\nThat's volatility\nAnd how old are you combat volatility you combat volatility by being a smart investor don't look at the short run look at the long term position yourself according to your risk tolerance position yourself\nTo make money dumping greedy when the markets and making new highs have cash on the sidelines prepare yourself or the markets do this this is the second time this year they do it two maybe three times a year with the markets will fall off and give you what I considered great opportunities\nNow does that mean you just buy one is going down oh you don't jump in with both the you might be\nPicking at some stocks\nThat you might not have any portfolio adding to it like I did with Amazon the other day on Thursday before friday\nYou look for good quality companies that come down and you put money into it it could drop even more\nBut if I'm buying it with the idea that I think these companies are going to have good earnings that we're going to go much higher than you use these opportunities and not worry about a month to month it's going to happen but as you see\nOver time the markets go higher\nOver time the markets makes new highs over time things turn out to be good even though in the short run we could have what we have right now so if you listen to wash\nOver this time you reduce your exposure to ask you made sure you took the test the risk alive so you knew that your portfolio and you were in sync together and then there's the markets fell he yeah you're either born or you now have cash\nThe first thing is if anyone had any investors on those it was a good day to probably come out of them or at least ... we came out of all of them\nNot because I thought the market would bounce right away or go down I just thought we were really oversold and I think we can have a little bounce which we started on friday and go higher now here's the opportune time that I'm looking for but being the buyers opportunity\nWhere the casually have on the sidelines that we set aside will be reenacted reinvest it\nThe markets come down you don't know where the bottom is you just don't maybe we hit the bottom able we didn't I knew we were on the short term basis oversold\nMaybe put ten Fifteen twenty percent of your money into some things you like that you took off the table before the markets will rally maybe it's a day to day five days who knows maybe that goes straight backup you usually don't see a V. bottom like this\nWhat usually happens is you come all the way down hard like we did we ... we make a lower high then we come down and we make a low in low a higher level I'm Sorry a high and low that's what I'm looking for\nIs the next week trace mint\nDo we come down and read test\nWhich is okay if we don't break it or do we come back\nDown and we don't we test and then we turn up\nIf it that one I liked\nThat and I liked that well especially when it breaks out of how high we go on this trip this is a very very important on a technical basis something I'm looking for we come down we've got down to almost\nTwenty seven I think it was twenty seven ten on the S. and P. five hundred twenty seven sixty seven percent we get to twenty eight fifty on this rally okay then we come back down again and several you only get to twenty seven fifty\nOn it and then we start turning backup if we break twenty eight fifty that is a sign to get back in the market again\nAnd move higher and I don't mean just for fifty hundred\nPoints on talking about okay we put in this correction here we go so what sustains behind that that's just a technical you need the fundamentals\nYou need the fundamentals the fundamentals\nOf most of the geo political political problems that we're having\nNow I Know you're listed out there there's all these guys the market's going down forty percent it's going down fifty percent if you live your life that way\nYou in trouble it can do it\nAnd it has done it and look we're all standing we\nAll have gotten through two thousand one and two thousand eight\nI Know when the markets go down you look at it and say oh man I'm too old for this I Can't lose my money here I Can't do this I Can't do that and you're right then you'd never sit your portfolio all the way it needs to be\nYou didn't take the risk allies you didn't match it up if you can't handle it because if you put all your money in the bank and you would take you out five six percent a year you would be down\nYou would have been draining a lot more than you take out as these markets go hide because you had no chance over the last ten years for appreciation none zero\nIf you put your money in the bank and you were earning a half a percent one percent\nIf you were lucky and still taking that out so you knew you were going to lose four or five percent a year we use this way you can get it and dividends you can get it in interest yes your principles gonna fluctuate no doubt about it and if you keep taking it out\nYou are going to drain and you're going to see your portfolio go down over time\nBut if you do it like you're not going to outlive your portfolio and when I said do it right you set up a plan and you don't take out more than that you know to go take it out three four five percent now and all of a sudden you need a fifty thousand dollars more yes you can get that but if you don't want to just something else you're going to have less money\nWhen you start raising it talking about doing more for more next year you know then you're bringing up the uh the

everybody's got to pay more so now that we've got these quote the tax break we're not going to get any tax break if we're going to depend on on other things\nBut I still believe the economy's going to draw\nA full of kids who go to go higher if we stop worrying about the things we don't need to worry about and we need to worry about um if we keep raising interest rates compared to everyone else that was going to keep going high which is going to hurt our exports\nThere's so many things out there I get it with the terrorists but they will all be finished up one day China will come around and

today right O L\nNo okay I just I don't know if it could\nBe could be we have a new such a a section today you know we do yeah you you and not only came up with it for ... we've got to come up with a name for it though we don't know what it is and I think maybe we should put it out there maybe somebody will come in with a good idea\nThat's a great idea yeah they'll have a listener named the next segment you want to describe the segment I think you should have some\nKind of like we had we had somebody in last week that names his cars so we each got thinking about getting a new one where he doesn't know what to name it so we're having a little bit of a contest to find a name helping him\nYeah but you have to tell you how do you need to get me a new name something before you eat it and sit in it and we know what it's going to sound like you're you're having like a baby oh there's a boy or girl that's going to do it\nAll kind of ... we already know exactly what the cart is\nYes you're on the color yet the car color ... the feel right we now kind of what the drive behind the name is so we're just exploring some different ideas\nBut on this will be a great and you can respond back on our Facebook page at Greenberg finance ... financial group you can email us you could call last\nBut semi names potential names for Dylan's news segment but several people have asked us over the over the shows that we do\nIf we can and I I really had one person asked\nYou specifically can we do one show where we break everything down\nUm we can hear that dean we can hear your phone\nOf [laughter] a turn off your phone or your Facebook Live I was was while we're alive and get the comments that are coming through and through them what you do you have to turn off your volume this again things were teaching on an older than I care about re Ellen ... highly you about all the technology yeah\nWell it fails and how to shut it all ... I couldn't hear it [laughter] and we can all you're at and say okay everybody else on the show\nSo anyway there was some ... questions and request to take some of the topics some of the verbiage that we use some of the economic reports different things that we talk about and and explain it a little bit deeper um or more basic more um\nLayman's terms ... so it's not so complicated what ... what do these things mean some of the things that we talk about what do they mean how do they affect the market why are we reporting on them why or certain economic reports\nUm important test cetera so we've Dylan every week now will come prepared with an item or a report that he will explain and go through more basic terms of what it means how it's used why it's important\nSo that is that we're having a tough time naming that because for people that are asking for more clarification\nThose are good questions we all have been there where we needed more clarification to understand why they were important we now understand them but we do this is our business so we should but for most people and and this is\nThis is why we enjoy this radio show and that's why we do our workshops and that's why we invite people in is if you have a question there's no question that stupid or dumb or ... you know but a lot of people feel that way I get a lot of questions that they start with and say\nYou know I Know this is a stupid question but and I tell everybody there is no such thing as a stupid question if you don't understand something ask\nUs ... will explain it so um\nThat's what we're going to do we're going to explain things you can call in and ask questions during that segment if there's a term or something out there that you want to know more about\nLet us know and we'll make sure that Dylan ah goes through that on the next on the next job we can show or that we talk about it while we're on the show so we need a name\nFrom doing something\nAnd you know how we like to use the alphabet so we typically keep letters the same so we're trying to think of something that goes with the de fer Dylan\nRight Dylan's diligent ideas\nWill come up with something will come up with something I write songs about the mortgage with a little round table right now\nWhat are you interested in her room and very but you know before we get into that I just wanted to say you come back

all this volatility\nAnd they also damages on because I was very liquid Microsoft at all these big companies can again looking ahead toward the gains are I don't even\nCare about but they don't even care about the games when the trading because I guarantee they can get back in ... what is the music which means it's the brakes which means when we come back we have billings\nSecrets

council education foundation and the ad council walk [noise]\n\nThan I was back in the money out of the show and it's that time first time for everything delivered\nAnd we've had a suggestion for this segment already lead that we had somebody on Facebook suggest Dylan's domain now I like that's a good it's a good start sell for this show we're going to do with that as until we get more good job my calls ... and ...\nOh and then I've got another one that just came in ... just ask segment stuff you just ask\nDylan ahead of time he'll make sure it's prepared for you said that a lot of participation on Facebook you can call us at age era five six seven eight or email us and I just now your suggestions thank you everybody out their art and Mike\nAnd and and ... mom sell All right here we go to Ellen Ellen domain and ... just ask\nStagnant yeah so this week in doing so and we're talking about the CPI in the ... index which just came out with updated numbers\nThe CPI went up ... percent and the ... point two percent this past week or this past month\nBut really what is the CPI like your staff for the consumer price index and it deals with inflation is the main inflation report for the future is in the financial markets I think indicates the cost of living for typical consumer in America\n[noise]\nIt does this by putting together a market basket of consumer goods and services used by people everyday such a transportation food housing and medical care and others\nUnexpected rises in this indicator ... usually leads the following bond prices rising interest rates and increase market volatility\nThe formula for the consumer price index equals\nTurf price of the market basket divided by the base prize the base your prize or the market basket ... hundred and the base priced base your prices usually in the Nineteen eighties and it's based on one hundred so if it goes higher I mean the period that we've got possible inflation if it goes lower possible deportation\nThe two main the factors of the CPI our prices at the consumer level or not us is supporting the men as they are to the ability of retailers to pass their own their own costs on to consumers\nThis is because people will begin barring disc out items if the retailers increase the prices of their premiums items to quickly from increased also cost\nIncreases and then the other key factor is increases in prices at the consumer level or result the ongoing increases at different levels of the question this increase in the consumer price index again this month suggests that there is a slight inflation which is expected of you\nThat actually one is the ... which stands for for the producer price index the producer price index deals with the price level at the producer level not to consider it as a measurement of the costs of raw materials to companies to do their goods such a steel farmers except for\nThese are the producers who produce everything like I said from Steve ... electronics to food the two things that the two things\nOr get as interested in with ... is how fast these prices are rising and whether the producers are passing along any price hikes due to consumers\nWith how fast the prices are rising if a ... and PBS except for good significantly large in comparison to previous on the market check the market checks to see whether where it's coming from an example of this is food and energy important expresses everyone\nAnd if for example corn because more expensive to produce than you paid more as a consumer you end up paying more than ... upper corner of the grocery store\nThis\nPoint two percent increase in PBR September that indicate the prices will immediately increased because of us that for the producer increases oppressed quickly people will be given by the discount it was\nThe second one is whether producers are passing on pass a law any price hikes through the consumers if inflation remains normal after the increasing producer price index that it can be indicated that the producers did not pass along their increased costs to produce their consumers to consumers\nAnd this was the only in the midst of this week and if you guys have any specific things you want me to explain all do the research during the week and get back to you next week and I'll do the job Dylan\nWe've got Dylan's dialogue we've got ... ... ... um hold on I Can't see all of them hold on just a second we've had so many responses that I Can't see them all the changes each week uh we almost could no deal and that was\nVery very good it's hard to take it there's so many pieces that go into inflation from the producer level to the consumer level\nAnd the fact that there are two separate reports in a week\nOne at the producer level and one at the consumer level and why why there are most people would assume if prices go up for producers they're automatically going to pass on and go to consumers and that's not the case\nThe producer has to put a lot of thought into whether or not to pass that on because again competition will kick in\nOr consumers will start going to discounted items and not pay that price so consumers hold a lot of power in what they're willing to pay and spend which is more the reason that producers have to put so much thought into into why did they change it doesn't\nDo up right away pushed the the the inventory they have they want to get rid of\nIt before it goes bad it's kind of a lag effect to the consumers if you CPI going up first the producers part consume is probably a month or two or three away maybe raising 'em but they don't like to raise them because then it it it it does exactly what ... said people then say well I'm going to go for the cheaper brand\nThey do tests do they said like a ... and stuff they would put it in the grocery store like little raised if the ... and then they would kind of see if people would buy it or not or if they would go and if they do end up on it than that no the cameras\nRight [noise] well it's good that was good you you you are you a very good to explain the difference between the consumer price index and the producer price index and what most people don't know that what the differences we hear the numbers\nLike oh it's inflation but they had no idea where it comes from how it comes from so we're going to keep doing this I think it's good to come out with some stuff in Dylan's domain that are just simply\nDon't ask don't we can't do my gash in but as we've got now I got another one that you your money one oh one segment the Dylan's dialogue I mean these things are coming in like [noise] like hot cakes\nAre now you're making me hungry I know what can you do a buffet will make some aren't good for you ... the writer that in fact the villain you did mention that\nThese number I mean these released come about once a month mhm right so um [noise]\nYou know and the other important we've been talking about the Federal Reserve raising rates they're looking at inflation they have a target inflation rate and so as these inflation rates and what showed this week is inflation is not out of control we don't have runaway inflation\nAnd so that kind of goes back to that goal they lock situation we've got a really strong fundamentally\nSorry to cut you off but we ... the heartbreak and we'll be back\nWhen the with money manage and Reuben with his letter of the week [noise]\n\n\nReasons will studio your local area where you will dot com and it's the use of a nice yard radio station [noise]\nCalls for a credible

information technology companies posted correction levels or worse on Wednesday according to facts at which is a division of eh shouldn't be\nNow what is a crash versus a correction I did get an email earlier this week about you know how do you know the difference between a barrel marketing the bull market\nMaybe this will help clarify that a little bit but it's important to note the distinction between a crash and a correction\nAs a rule a correction should not exceed twenty ... twenty percent loss in value in the market the term correction is for a period of time when an asset or asset clashed drop sober ten percent in value but doesn't exceed the twenty percent threshold\nBaron markets are usually when you have a twenty percent decline in that market or you know asset clashes\nSo that basically is is is when you have a bear market you've got to be down over twenty percent\nThat signals the Baron market if you're up over twenty percent from the lows that would signal that you're in a bowl and marketing we're still in a bowl and markets started what long time ago or two thousand nine I guess\nAnyway there are a lot of people that love\nSeeing the panic that takes place in the show off like this as you know over a couple of quote this week the several money managers assessed a number of names in the tech arena that we're overdue for a correction by the market in the shell off presented an attractive entry point\nFor some of these issues they love seeing the panic on the street because\nIt doesn't give them a chance to get back into maybe some of the stocks that they were not in the midst [noise] um so you know there are people that take advantage of these big shell option and um you know I guess we would all do that if we had a chance to ...\n\n\n\n\nI watch the News I'm Teri McHugh federal and state officials in the Florida Panhandle personally assess the excessive damage done by hurricane Michael\nGovernor Rick Scott and FEMA director Brock Long came to

Michael meeting with rather than trying to reassure them that the state and the feds are doing everything they can as quickly as possible to provide food and water and get power and cell service back\nThe big thing is that when people continue to stay safe and when and make sure everybody learns from this when when somebody says there's going to be nine foot ten foot fourteenth for the storm surge it's deadly\n... Keating reporting China defend their trade practices with the U.S as each nation slaps billions in tears on the other\nWay on how the trade off but if somebody is tied to that tried to war against us we'll have to respond and defend our own interests\nChinese ambassador to the U.S slate tiny key on Fox News Sunday this is Fox News [noise]\n[noise]\nMy name is Joe Tom I'm twenty nine years old and have a career that I Love is a systems analyst career is still sounds cool to say that word [noise] I never could have gotten on this path without a college degree\nAt the college I mean we're here he tell you I never would have gotten to college without big brothers big sisters [noise]\nI could have ended up anywhere on the streets even [noise]\nA college Joe Thompson not likely [noise] my big brother helped me out\nHe taught me I can do anything [noise]\nAt a time when a lot of people were saying just the opposite\nIt's sending your own\nMeans a lot [laughter] I Need my name is reading I

brothers big sisters dodge or [noise]\nBrought to you by big brothers big sisters them yet council [noise]\nRight at that time\nWe have a half hour of asking us any question\nAbout anything you want eight eight zero five six seven eight eight eight zero ... oh so you're enjoying the show I think you can tell that we love doing this show because I think it helps people\nIt's good information it's real information that's honest information and it just that's the way we ... you know when we're not just going to try to sell you something or give you a product you want to talk about what's going on in the world how it affects you\nAnd I mean I think that's a little [laughter] a little unusual for a lot of things is now everyone wants to have everything sold perfect in social straighten and everyone's so smart and talk above people you know just stuff\nWe've got to make it simple we got to show you how to do it we've got to help you do it and get through and that's one of the reasons you know I've been doing this show for almost thirty is not twenty eight twenty nine years and\nBeen in business here for a long time and keep growing it and getting good people in and\nAlways looking for good people so you don't want to get people's only give us a call will be glad to sit down and interview 'em and talk and see what they can do to help themselves and\nHow we can help them and how they can help us because it's got to go both ways when you agree that Ruben absolutely you know we've been doing this way too long to have people in the in the in our office that don't fit in\nYou know talking about uh keeping a simple that's really a good term to use you know we\nTalk about the diversification and the discipline but you don't have to it just doesn't have to be an elaborate scheme that you have when you put an investment plan together it right right I mean that it's become so complicated with all the derivatives out there\nI mean you name it there's a new product and they're all fancy names and everything I mean just returned back to basic fundamentals and and just you know keep it simple how many new\nProducts we ever using them I think gee WG bonds might be the most new thing but that that's\nBecause of last night it was a bomb badge because of lessons we've learned I'm the one the benefits the most is a person is putting the packaged together it was\nProbably the thing that I remember the most of my career is when they came out with the government bond funds yeah in the ... okay government bonds ones um and the explanation was these are secure the Judy ... is is that that the U.S treasuries\nNo risk they forgot to tell you that interest rate risk right I mean the interest rates started\nTo go and hire all my everyone's like what happened to my money was my money and it doesn't there's no maturity so would never came back\nTo what they expected it now obviously if you held onto it to now when interest rates went ... basically down to zero you would have gained everything back but they never told people that everyone short term and I remember not doing that because I didn't understand that risk part I said if I buy treasury for\nFive years at least I Know in five years I'm going to get my money back\nBy by this they how am I going to do it while you don't know why is everybody asking because they want to do with it too easy they can put their money into the fund or why would I Want to do that because it's easy now because you're going to make more money off it gives you bundling them together\nRight I'd go let's go to Thomas good morning time issue on the money to show\nMore than ... a great intro by the way um [noise] you got to talk a lot of a bomb on interest rates are going up they are\nOn a less a practicing this\nWell depends how you look at it the ones that your own ... are going to have less attractive missed because they go down but if you buy a new ones obviously you have a better interest rate today than you did\nA year ago okay so that leads me to my question and I and I hope you can relate to me so I can actually even understand it what what is on the lettering that a valuable thing to pursue now there's a market\nWhere I'm going to turn to solve the robot but I'm going to say it's the only way to buy bonds right now and but and then move is going to explain to you why because it takes away the risk of interest rates continually rising without you been able to do something about it so explain to what bottom lettering\nWhile a bond ladder basically is you're buying if you had a hundred thousand dollars for example and you want her to do a hundred or a a bottom ladder for ten years you would buy ten bonds ten thousand dollars worth in every year beginning next year year one year two years for a year for\nYou so you're not trying to I guess we're interest rates are going you're satisfied with the current interest rate market now let's just say rates go up over the next year you're first majority is going to mentor\nAnd you roll that out to your eleven or your ten next year so now if interest rates are higher you've ended up with a higher yield on that ten thousand dollar bond people\nThe five year ladders people the ten year ladders but I think whatever you do I I think it's a mistake in my opinion to put everything out into a into a thirty year piece of paper um I'd rather be a lender\nUm I I'd I'd rather I'd rather I'd rather be a bar or if someone is next explain why going out through the years right now is not a good idea well I always\nUse the the example of and I go back to Nineteen Seventy six I had a client come in wanted to buy a thirty year salt river a tax free bond hundred thousand dollars member what happened in the late seventies endless rates went up because the oil embargo and immigration\nThat that person paid a hundred thousand dollars for that bond by six years later if they wanted to sell it they would have gotten fifty cents\nOn the dollar fifty thousand bucks um if they held it they would have been fine right but\nAlready bought more they would have been better citizen tight you know obviously I always tell people you see double digit interest rates\nOh about twenty twenty five years I'm okay with that I mean even went to Fifteen to twenty percent but if you get ten percent on a on a municipal bond take it all day long\nYou know going back to that salt river they had to borrow money again in Nineteen eighty to\nGuess what they paid fourteen percent right I mean the state and federal tax free they paid six percent six years earlier which one would you rather um\nAnd that's why the bond prices went down by the understand that Thomas Oh yeah\nOh so am I the understanding that a ladder like room and said that he gave I mean we're talking about how lucky to get maybe two percent two and a half percent on something like that\nNo no the on a short on right now you might be able to get a little over two percent on a two or three year bond and then it's going to go up to a ... a highly three something on a five year bond and probably go a seven year bond in a tiny a bonding they go up I wouldn't go past ten years right now\nUm I probably would have been goal I think interest rates of our economy keeps doing well is going to continue to rise so I probably would only go out five years right now and then the ... and then as those would come and do that I Would go out longer", "show_name": "Money Matters with Dean Greenberg", "year": "2018", "city": "Tucson", "day": "14"}
