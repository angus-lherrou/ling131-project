please\nLet's talk about [noise] gives me\nThe difference of fiscal versus monetary policy\nThe markets this week continue to be resilient it's amazing the beginning of the week how we saw a um huge gains ... the Dow Jones came within points of hitting twenty seven thousand we had a huge surge in the markets beginning of the week\nAt the end though that surge\nWas on trade news when we talked last week that Canada would probably come together here at some point while it did on Sunday night in the last hour final hours\nAnd the markets cheered on that news President Trump was able to get rid of NAFTA and replace that with the United states Mexico Canada agreement the U.S MCA United States Mexico Canada agreement\nHe did exactly what he said he was going to do he was going to renegotiate NAFTA he was going to get rid of NAFTA and have a new agreement with Mexico and Canada Mexico was on board Canada was lingering out there and there were a lot of thoughts even the week a week ago\nThat this may not happen and it did\nWas a lot of optimism there was a lot of excitement enthusiasm over what's next because we now have trade agreements with Mexico Canada South Korea that the president is renegotiating trade agreements for\nUs for America so that we are on a more level field so that we are not being taken advantage of by the rest of the world\nWhen it comes to trade ... uh to China's\nGoing to be next China's out there those discussions are going to be next the European Union Japan there's other countries out there that are in the works of course there's been a lot of nervousness over that but that that is the next in line it's a positive thing for the markets\nAs we got mid week we started seeing interest rates spike and so we saw reversal of the early early week gains tenure treasury yield went to levels that we haven't seen in seven years over three point two percent on the ten year treasury we\nHaven't seen those yields in since two thousand and eleven\nSo we're seeing we're seeing the ten year treasury move higher or seen interest rates hold well above that three percent level that we couldn't get to stay above for a long period of time now they were surging\nReally we had a huge moving interest rates that scared the markets a little bit we saw sell off in the markets towards the end of the um end of the week\nThere are so many things that were happening in between all of that that we're going to talk about on the show\nBut for the week the Dow Jones ended flat literally flat started the week ended the week the same\nYes and the five hundred was down one percent the NASDAQ was down three point too so you did see a little that you we some more of a sell off in the tax theories that have been so strong this year we saw more money coming out of those areas year to date the Dow Jones is up seven percent\n[noise]\n\nThe News I'm John McHugh Democrats still vowing to go after newly minted Supreme Court justice Brett

promised Mike good morning are you still there\nYeah I don't mind waiting it was her show [laughter] well thank you how are you doing good I got a question of weeks ago you mentioned yes and\nI don't I don't drive so I don't understand this situation works but I just like when it comes to approaching when we shouldn't be in those purchases over a computer for the fish [laughter]\nWell I'm an Italian Mike I personally\nAgree with you and the concept of buying a phone or a car excuse me over your phone or your computer\nAn e commerce platform to buy a used car does seem a little I'm Crazy now I Will tell you we have someone that that we know that it's actually kind of ours that bought a car to carve on us so they described to me this whole process\nAnd it was pretty interesting how it works have you are you familiar with how it works\nCompletely the question\nBecause you can do can you have the option to strike because yes you have to concern is\nYeah you do so here's my understanding eminent disclose I've not bought a car from their ... actually gone on and tried it but\nUm this is this is how it how it works you go online and you look and they have an inventory of cars you get a three hundred and sixty degree view with some ... was at a type of imaging technology that really I I don't know I guess it helps you see what you're looking at a little bit better like it's like you're looking at it face to face\nBut you can get financing warranty coverage all of those things on line what you do is once you select the car that you'd like to try they come and deliver it to you so they're they carve on at the headquarters is out of Phoenix\nBut they will come this client of ours lives here in Tucson they got the car delivered to their house on a friday they had seven days that they could test drive this car\nI'm sure there's something might that you have to do ahead of time before they just give you a car I'm sure there was some you know ... you know you've qualified for financing so if you take the car and run off or I don't know because they don't stay there with you don't have to drive with a dealer there's not a dealership there's not a sales person will bill like\nQuestion because you would think most people would go with you shut it down\nAnd then when you drive a car there with you they have your license but they are in the car with usually can't drive it off and take it away this is not that way they literally got the car and they were able to drive it for seven days if they decided after seven days they didn't want it then they could have it picked back up\nThen pick a different car to have to try out instead and they're all cars they're used cars I knew a lot of them are um least cars you know so they might just be a couple of years old but I I I have yet to look at all the inventory in what they have on there\nBut that's basically the process and if you decide to keep it if you decide you like it then\nYou know you can do your financing or what not and now you bought your car without the salesperson so it is a different concept but it's picking up and it's it's ... in it for for us that haven't used technology forever it is different\nThat are used to these face to face but I Do think it's a brilliant idea especially if you have more and more people are going up with technology\nSadly they don't do the face to face stuff as much so this is a way or if you don't have the time or you don't want to deal with the hassles other dealership you know that we are talking at the at the break my dad my about just what painted as to go into a dealership sometimes\nBecause it yeah [noise] so dad what'd you say you bought a car from Costco right or had gone through the process on Costco the costs New England\nAnd that was an easy because you get rid of the dealership\nPart not that we're promoting getting rid of dealerships it's just a different um less hassling way of looking and talking to someone that's not trying to sell you anything you're able to browse and look and try things out and do what you want\nTo get one other question was can work this week in Texas would still waiting for is Rick I'm In the winter the experts go into objectively already gone into effect\nYes and if they didn't do as payroll so if he has a certain amount of deductions where you would have seen a difference in your tax or your paycheck at this point and we can ask this question we're hoping we have a gas that should be here in the next an hour that's an accountant so we can ask him the same question as well\nBut what should have happened if ... and it really depends on people's income and how they get paid if you have a set hey that doesn't you know you have a set paycheck or a wage salary\nThan you would see it some people that our our our earlier that work on commission or in seeing seeing it's there but they're not seen at the same but basically the tax brackets have lowered so if you were in the twenty five percent tax bracket that went down to twenty two for example so the withholding or just a little bit different which is what gave the increase in the\nIn the um\nPaychecks to people\nBut not everybody can figure it's not as simple as just looking at a line item that shows your extra money it really depends on how how you get paid or what your paychecks look like\nYour salary\nYeah yes exactly okay so You're welcome mind thank you for calling and thank you for listening All right All right we're going to go to\nBill Hi Bill that you're on the money matters show\nIs I'm Wondering if you were grounded\nWho I Am yeah well let me well you know what I'm going to do 'cause we're about to go to a break bill in thirty seconds but I Will tell\nYou a little bit about myself before that

Fernandez\n[laughter]\n\n[laughter]\nPet tape [laughter] the first hardliner\nSets of\nOn in there you could put a CPA in there yeah and we have a very important yesterday who's going to talk about\nThe new tax law bill and how it's affecting a individuals' I'm so I'm going to even though I have a light the um report on the letter see I'm going to try to cut back a little bit because I think it's more important to have the Mr CPA\nA you know be the headliner today what do you think\nThat this is your time to shine so whatever it is that you'd like to do and you are cooperating very well okay with that with that the gas that's locked in ... when excited to have him here\nFirst of all congratulations to the cats of on that big win last night a little\nBit of a comeback in the defense or played a significant role a also tomorrow is Columbus Day uh we are open a lot of the banks I think are closed but um it'll be a busy um week I think with the earnings season starting to kick off\nTowards the end of the week and then there's some important economic releases throughout the week uh but getting back to fundamental Stanley which uh you got into on the economic side\nUm I thought that might be appropriate to talk about common stocks versus corporate bonds because we that's what we talk about here investors are always told to diversify their portfolios between stocks and bonds here's the difference between the two types of investments and I'm sure there are many people out there that don't know the difference\nBut common stocks or ownership of the company corporate bonds of the dead of the company stocks and bonds represent two different ways foreign entity to raise money to fund or expand their operations\nWhen a company issue stock it is selling a piece of itself in exchange for cash when an end to the issues of bonded is issuing debt\nWith the agreement to pay interest for the use of that money during that period of time they that that that bond is out stocks are represented by shares in individual companies here is basically how it works say a company has made it through it start up face\nAnd become successful the owners wished expand but they are unable to do so slowly through the income they earn through their operations\nAs a result they can turn to the financial markets for additional financing one way to do this to split the company up into shares and then sell a portion of those shares on the open market in a process known as the initial public offering or an ideal if they're going to list on one of the exchanges\nA person who buys a stock is therefore buying an actual share the company which makes him or her a part owner however small that is why stock is also referred to equity\nBonds on the other hand represent that government corporation or other entity such as ... that needs to race cash borrow money in the public market and subsequently paying interest on that loan to investors\nEach bond has a certain ... value say a thousand dollars is typically a\nA par value of a bond and pays a coupon rate to investors so that's part of the contract that they get into when they buy a bond for instance a thousand dollar bond with a four percent coupon would pay twenty dollars to the investor twice a year or forty dollars annually and tell them the Tour de de\nUpon majority to invest in his return the full amount of his or her original principle except for the rare occasion when a bond goes into default and they can't pay a last caller mentioned GM you know mhm GM went into default on a number of their bonds\nThe difference foreign investors sent seat share of stock represents an ownership stake in a company meaning the owners shares in the profits and losses of the company someone who invest in the stock\nCan benefit if the company performs very well and its value increases over time that's why people buy stocks just let their money grow at the same time he or she runs the risk\nThat the company could perform poorly and the stock could go down or in the worst case scenario bankruptcy disappears it disappears altogether\nIndividual stocks in the overall stock market tend to be on the riskier of the investment spectrum in terms of their volatility and the risk that the investor could lose money in the short term however they also tend to provide superior long term returns stocks are therefore favored by those with\nWith the long term investment horizon and no tolerance for short term risk\nBonds lack the powerful long term return potential uh stocks but their preferred by investors for whom income is a priority also bonds are less riskier than socks while their prices fluctuate in the market sometimes quite substantially in the case of higher risk sacrament\nThe vast majority of bonds tend to pay back the full amount of principle laboratory and there's much less risk of loss\nFor those than there is with stocks which one is the right one for you we think a combination is the best way to diversify having both stocks and bonds and your portfolio if you can afford you know that\nThat risk\nCommon stocks are just quickly are are near all term highs a button investor Ron Baron who I quote on here about every six months or so thinks that there's plenty of room to run he runs a company called Baron capital\nA and he's consistently on CNBC a as one of their people that talks about ah you know the markets he says growth is accelerating um and he says that he says if the stock market is tied very closely to the economy\nThe economy doubles roughly every ten to twelve years and sell the stock market should double every ten to twelve years over the long term he says I Can't see any reason why that is going to change I remember he said at one point\nThat ah the Dow was eight hundred Nineteen eighty guess where it is today are close to twenty six thousand that was six hundred Nineteen sixty\nOr the GDP of the country was five hundred and twenty billion dollars back in Nineteen sixty today it's Twenty one trillion dollars uh he thinks that stocks are going to continue to rise even after climbing ten years some last financial crisis\nSo he says stocks are the best play as they return eight percent a year compounded\nNuts we know we talk about those numbers over long periods of time the markets through the ups and downs will average somewhere between\nThat eight ten percent or a return\nSo for the weekend you gave the numbers the Dow Jones was flat yes and the down a one percent the NASDAQ down three percent\nA it was a pretty volatile week there's a doubt started up a Monday when Tuesday and Wednesday and then on third you know it had five straight up days and then on friday Thursday and friday it was down\nClose to four hundred and eighty points which brought it back down to level\nUm as far as uh let me talk real quick\nUm we talked about interest rates are ready companies with a letter she would just mentioned carbon nano was founded by guests who a former Tucson and who is now a billionaire ... ... there are several billionaires that have come out of the Tucson area\nOf one of the guys that came out of

affect\nIndividuals and businesses et cetera so we appreciate you being here with some updates our phone lines are open aided zero five six seven eight that's eight eight zero KNX T give us a call with any questions or send us a question to Facebook Live on the Greenberg financial group age we can answer you there\nAs well are we before we picked back up there is a a question that\nEncompasses I think something about about taxes so let's go to the phone lines to Eric Hi Eric\nThe wording good morning you are live on the money matters show\nThat you're listening I'm this question is a little more ... economy related which individual if if we cut taxes\nSo that the loss of revenue for the government either how did they make up for that do they cut services or do they borrow money\nWell\nThere's a combination of things that the government does the idea with the tax cuts\nAnd ribbon Harvey felon or jump in at any time but the idea Eric with the tax cut\nIs to put more money into your hands and my hands and ribbons and Harvey is in every other American so that we can choose how to spend our money what you are seeing this year is we're seeing our gross domestic product or GDP the growth of our country consumer spending\nAt a very extraordinary level that is the the gross it's stimulating growth in to the economy so the idea of cutting taxes\nIs to put more money into our hands to continue to stimulate stimulate for people that um hire more so for example and Harvey you can probably touch on this a little bit you deal with small businesses if you and and companies\nIf you have company hiring more people now you have more people that are paying taxes so you've just increased revenue to the government but you've increased it I have a more tax payers\nThat are thriving that have wages going up that are paying tax at and we and that's we talked earlier in the show about unemployment being at a forty nine year low it's at three point seven percent that means Eric that a lot more people are working today\nThan we're working a year ago two years ago three years ago et cetera and their wages are going up to what we've done is instead of having\nMore people out of work which requires unemployment benefits food stamp\nI'm a ... federal assistance so there's an outflow of money\nAnd then you have let you know people paying taxes what what they've done the goal of this has to get more money into the hands of people Americans and businesses to stimulate the economy and get people working and it just expand your tax base\nSo I don't know that the revenue yes there is a cost to lowering taxes absolutely because you lose\nThat revenue but the goal of doing it is that you pick that up\nAnd then some by strengthening the economy overall if that makes that\nThat makes a lot of sense of so that so that would mean then that the deficit is holding steady are shrinking but I'm hearing that the deficit is growing\nWell we'll go into that in a second because you also have spending that's not stopped yet so there is a process to that to happen but Harvey I Know you want to do their part\nHow to tax law was the part where they're they gave a break for companies to finally bring money back into the country\nThe corporations if they are in profits overseas the taxes were so high to bring them back here that they weren't doing that so they lowered that raid\nAnd some of the larger companies have been bringing that money back you know and paying a lower tax and what it used to be but at least they're bringing it in and paying taxes and the other thing is that they hope this means that companies won't leave which what was happening\nCompanies were becoming they were moving out of the U.S through a become a I forgot to\n... a company and Europe someplace or whatever but ultimately would take revenue away from here to and another item which we had seen more lately is even individuals becoming ex patriots who would move\nAfter they retire move to Costa Rica or someplace and uh you know because they pay virtually no taxes down there and all they weren't paying any us taxes either so I think they were hoping to stop that a little bit now whether this all balances out none of us well known\nFor a while for exactly right and I really like what has happened\nIs we've got to cut spending bill that bending\nAnd Eric I guess you could think of it in your own household with your own income if you have more income\nThan in your household let's say you have a certain amount of income coming in and then you spend a certain amount of income if you are spending let's say you have you are you know for every dollar that lean in and income you're spending a dollar twenty\nThan you are net you're you\nHave a deficit you you are out of balance there spend more and more than ... should exactly [laughter]\nSo let's say now you go get a job in this case you have a tax cut but anyway now you're bringing in a dollar can you have more money if you're still spending a dollar twenty\nFor every dollar tenure bringing in you still have a problem so there needs to be a mix on both sides if you can get ... up to a dollar ten and reduce your spending down to a dollar ten\nNow you're you're getting closer but if then you can from their start balancing that out\nAnd then now you start spending a dollar five ... upbringing in your dollar ten it doesn't happen overnight it but the first step was to get this tax reform bill through\nAnd Harvey touched on some of the ... that you know from the corporate insight repatriation of money keeping businesses here but then you get into the hiring you've got more people working if not more people paying into\nThe system it's just and that's why they say we're just starting to see the effects of this bill isn't just starting to to get going to go through\nThe ports yesterday\nOn the local level I can say to that we are seeing more people coming to us from who are thinking about starting a business that had really dry up\nA substantially uh people were wanting to just get a paycheck", "show_name": "Money Matters with Dean Greenberg", "year": "2018", "city":
