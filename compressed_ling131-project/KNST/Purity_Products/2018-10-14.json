we'll get back to it here with Sherry\nTurkle she's an author and pharmacist and always great to have you on the show such great information Sherry can you share with us a quick study or to to sort of back this up highlight the science behind the elite asked his anthem that's found in as to FX 'cause I Know there were dozens and dozens of studies maybe you can pull out and highlight a couple of your favorites\nYeah for sure so Dr Mark Miller he's a PHD a biomedical research or he explains it well and he's talking here about how free radicals compromise and undermine\nFunction and tell you that performance in the body he says after his Anthony simply sip heard at negating this as evidenced by clinical trial showing improved performance and accelerated recovery in fact research published in the journal of medicine and science and sports and exercise found that those who took\nFour milligrams a vast event and daily over twenty eight days scored better cycling times with greater output and those who did not take it for the bike that I mean remember this after that and it's one of the few that fireball antioxidants that can actually neutralize three ...\nEven at the site of the mitochondrial men brain it's like saying in the body armor protecting yourself your joints blood vessels brain heart and Oregon's on many levels so this is mark and there are fourteen clinical studies on after that than for brain how seven studies on skin house\nFourteen studies on I help including research for that protection\nAnd focus fix studies showing after the event and supports cardio function\nForty two studies on how the aging and ... their house and there's a ton of research on human performance to showing benefits for energy stamina endurance and the fact that it's incredibly powerful and versatile it helps you stand the game of life they energized active alerts healthy and even stronger\nThat is impressive on so many levels so much information there and I know this last as Anthonette was about a dozen happens to\nI'm looking here I see there's a patent for promoting I health\nAnd reducing I fatigue there is a patent for inhibiting the expression of cytokines in sales end up having to get this on composition for body fat reduction there's one for improving muscle atrophy and older adults Sherry I'd like to be a little bit of a skeptic here how can this one simple nutrient\nMagically do all of this disaster ... give us so many benefits I mean really\nI Know it it sounds amazing too good to be true that it really is true many studies that I'm referencing\nHere there and they lived a long time that these are reputable clinical studies conducted by leading researchers around the world that really act\nThat benefits the best advantage and by the way muscle output is better with asked advantage to and this comes from after that that research published in the international journal sports nutrition November two thousand and a lot and this is another study done with cyclists they took for granted access than than it was a small study\nBut very positive showing that cyclists improved their child time by two minutes and twenty kilometers bike race I mean that's a meaningful improvement in a race like this and the researchers said that they also bring fat more efficiently which makes sense\nBased on this research purity can actually make the claim that after the FX will promote and improve power output\nIn your muscles I mean I tell people ask the FX in his strength and power out its transformative if you like energy and this is found in other studies to like one that looked at hand grip strength\nOf so much great information if you just do it again we're talking with pharmacist an author Sherry Turkle here I'm your host mark Larson on his hand ribs study the you mentioned I understand there this involved what a twelve milligram dose\nAnd they saw Ninety three percent boost in hand strength and people who struggled with but tennis elbow now that's a big deal but our listeners might be saying well okay maybe I don't play tennis ... what about me what does it mean for me right\nRight so so think about this I Ninety three percent increase in a person who has some repetitive stress in their album it's an almost doubling enhanced strength so just think about all the things\nThat you do in your daily life picking up groceries your kids your grandkids gripping the steering wheel of a car playing golf for tennis gardening or riding a bike a doubling of grip strength makes a big difference I mean when you take after than than you get stronger you'd feel stronger you get more energy and difference if you play sports\nYou play stronger so to me it's really quite extraordinary\nBut it's great information to Sherry I Want to share a couple of more testimonials that caught my attention out of the so many right there on the purity website again these are unsolicited these are from real people here's one from Rick you use a
