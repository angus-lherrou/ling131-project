the B. C. M. Ninety five that you mentioned offers about seven times the absorption of any other ... human extract so\nWhen you take two hundred fifty milligrams of this stuff you get about seven times the activity that you would if you took say a comparable amount of another curriculum and extract so this in my opinion\nIs one of the most life and Hansing protective totally beneficial substances on earth and it has just\nDecades of scientific and medical studies to back it up\nNow Chris I Know that we turned her over to you by the green tea in the Kirk humid in your new green tea GR liquid soft your formula which purity is giving away for free today but first\nTell me about the third nutrient on the list the risk their ritual which is super hot right now here was on some of the headlines in the science behind her spiritual I notes from red wine and the French love it but why is it on your shortlist\nWell Rivera troll is one of those remarkable compounds that I just said to shake my head at how many different things that does\nIt is found in grapes in wine grapes it also shows up and cranberries what we know about resveratrol is that like green tea and also like Kirk human extract it's profoundly antioxidant\nBut more than that it shows significant properties when you look at some of the things in the body if that happened during aging as a result of fat accumulation in tissue and\nInsulin insensitivity resveratrol helps to protect against those things so it's a powerful immune regulator and you know our immune system is responsible for keeping us healthy it is remarkably beneficial for the heart and this is why it's considered one of the key is to the so called French\nParadox you know the French drink a lot of red wine they eat a lot of cheese they smoke cigarettes and they stay slim and they have good cardiovascular health which just seems completely unfair but is there a trial appears to be\nKey in that and additionally\nThere is a brain benefit like\nThere is with the court's human with blood flow to the brain so when you take resveratrol you get rain blood flow this means you get more oxygen to the tissues of the brain your brain cells stay healthier longer your mind is clear sharp and focused\nSo this is on my short list for all those reasons and for about a dozen more that would just plain take too long to explain\nRight again we're talking with Chris ... also known as the Indiana Jones of natural medicine sometimes called the medicine hunters well chrysalis laser in on how this wonderful formula you created in conjunction with purity products I Know that ... he's been a business now for\nWhat is it over Twenty years they've gotta top reading from the better Business Bureau and people can get complimentary bottle of this green T.

you today but first\nA quick question number one is there a pill you can take that can actually help make you stronger number to let's say you could get stronger would the extra strength make your life better certainly think about this are you weaker today than you were say oh I don't know Twenty years ago\nWell listen if you answered yes to any of these questions than stay tuned Dr Neil eleven is joining us today to discuss a miraculous compound with hundreds of clinical studies that just may unlocked the key to helping you get stronger and healthier at\nAge now Dr ... eleven is a chiropractor a nutritionist spokesperson and a longtime advisor for purity products that eleven welcome back to the show\nOh it's great to be here with you today pat and we have a very exciting topic to cover today packed they were talking about strength and power and how to get it back even if you're in your fifties sixties seventies eighties too if you want to feel better if you want to feel stronger this is some very important information we're going to cover today\nYou know this is an exciting topic to talk to me about this important message today what molecule are we talking about and how it's impacting the lives of people who follow the science\nRight right right well we're talking about a new supplement it's cold every strong and it features and exciting molecule called Korea Team now had a lot of our listeners may have heard of Korea teen I Know you've used Korea teen right but for those that don't know about Korea Tina it's mainly use\nIn the Olympic circles professional athletes body builders college high school athletes because it does something extraordinary and what I'm about to tell you is proven by hundreds and hundreds of human studies so here's where Korea Team does for us\nHelps us to get stronger more powerful helps put muscle mass on the body and it helped protect us from losing muscle tissue\nWe get older we know that's a big part of aging not only that pat great for the brain great for memory and it helps promote bone strength as well so an amazing molecule that everybody needs to know about\nIs an amazing story can you share some of the science and tell us why you're calling Korea teen one of the best kept secrets to healthy aging\nOffshore pat what we need to understand with Korea Team is that it's a natural molecule to the body it's in every single cell tissue Oregon in your system\nAnd its job in the body is to generate and maintain strength and power that's the reason for being to maintain strength and power it's an every single so on the body Ninety five percent of it however is in your muscle tissue because that's where we tend to use it the most it powers up the muscles it's good for strong muscle contraction\nAnd it's important to help maintain strength and muscle contractions when you're using them over and over again for instance if you're working at the gym if you're playing sports golf tennis anything like that it keeps your muscles\nPowered up in their high energy state\nSo they're strong and ready for action packed here's the key this is so important for those of us say in our fifties sixties seventies\nYou see we had lots and lots of Korea Team when we were young we had all this stuff it was coming out of areas we had lots of creating our bodies made a lot of it but as we get older like everything else we don't do that is well we have less Korea Team in our muscles you know the good news is that hundreds and hundreds of human studies show that wouldn't you supplement with Korea Team\nIt goes to work or go straight to your muscles it's absorbed easily it pumps up at the Korea thing in your muscle tissue and you get stronger you get more powerful not only that it helps support memory and brain health and it helps support the strength of your bones\nYou know we were talking before the show and you were talking about how it lipic athletes have been using Korea teen for years to enhance their strength and performance tell me more\nWell this Korea Team is the premier sports nutrition supplement there's no question about that pet you used it body builders know about it athletes know about\nKorea Team is the premier sports nutrient so you know back twenty twenty five years ago the Olympic athletes and their coach is of course you can do about it they knew what made you bigger and stronger and faster they knew was natural to the body it was supposed to be there\nBut there were a little bit afraid to supplement with it because they were afraid it might be considered cheating that it might be considered too much of an edge\nBut back in Nineteen eighty eight the international Olympic Committee\nThat came out the officially confirmed that I'm quoting here Korea Team can be used by athletes to enhance their performance and now that it's not just for athletes anymore because the studies are clearly showing\nThat for adults for people in their fifties sixties seventies this stuff it was amazing and purity has this incredible new formulation\nWe call it every strong because that's exactly what it does it helps you get stronger in space stronger with hundreds of human studies to help you and it's the purest form of ... money can buy the stuff from Europe this stuff is fantastic\nAnd we should point out that naturally occurring in red meat problem is in order to get the amounts that are going to benefit you you'd have to eat large amounts of red meat and he's like four pounds of red meat a day most people aren't going to do that right and what about vegetarian it can be Korea teen deficient\nExactly when I have a vegetarian that comes in here and their energy efficient they don't feel the way we don't want to feel\nAnd I put 'em on every strong they noticed the benefits almost right away because they've been so low and if you're if you're a person out there that staying away from red meat if you're staying away from meat in general or you have more of a vegan style diet this is for you you definitely want to add that ...\nHigh so obviously this works with athletes but you say Korea teams\nOh and mainstream there's a lot of studies are showing the folks in their fifties sixties seventies and beyond that Korea teen can be a cornerstone compound to help people stay strong stay healthy stay sharp Steve vital right\nOh exactly I mean this is the ideal muscle enhancing strengthening muscle protecting nutrient for folks as we get older fifty plus or like you and me patent but let's go to a couple of studies on seniors just to show this we'll do one on the guys and one on the gals when I\nFirst on the guys love the title of this one Korea teen supplementation improves muscular performance in older men\nStudy done it several American University is\nA group of men get this at age fifty nine to Seventy two hey you know we can do that is not when people are known for getting stronger right right so this was just a one week study people need to understand that that's how effective and rapidly this stuff works with just a one week study get this the guys on Korea Team they put on four pounds\nOf lean mass that's muscle tissue for those that don't know that it shows they built the muscles and they hydrated the muscles nicely they increase the strength of their bench press that's a chest pressed for people that don't know by seven percent they increased the strength of the leg exercises they were doing by Fifteen Percent pat\nThey could get in and out of a chair more times faster without using their arms on top of that it could generate more power on a stationary bike pat this happened in one week when I think that yeah it's really quite incredible\nAlright but what about the women out there did they get those kinds of benefits to as well will actually help women in their fifties sixties and seventies get stronger to\nArabs are loosely let's go straight to another study loved the title on this one is well Korea teen supplementation improves muscular performance an older women published in the European Journal of applied physiology\nThirty women age fifty to Seventy one the course they could either Korea the placebo that's the way they do these things again a one week study the women on Korea teen increase their bench press by almost four pounds they increase their leg press by over ...\nPounds and they had better balance and agility so fifty to Seventy one year old women not only getting stronger not only getting more powerful getting faster with improved balanced pet study after study shows that older folks that use Korea Team\nGet amazing result they get great results if they exercise they get great results even if they\nExercise they can live more weight they get faster they get stronger they get more powerful their muscles don't fatigue as fast and get this this is very important especially for the ladies ... you know that when women do resistance training their bones get stronger as well right\nIncrease lean body mass for those that don't know what that is they're talking about muscle and improve the functional capacity of the elderly they go on to talk about how it supports bone health as well and then they finish with this creating supplementation without training in the elderly\nCould potentially delay atrophy of muscle and unproven difference and strength so here again we see bottom line ... is very very effective it's gonna help you to feel stronger whether you exercise or not it supports your strength and power your brain health\nAnd on top of that it supports your bone health I mean pat when you think about it this almost sounds too good to be true right now you're a person that never heard about this and you're listening to us\nYou would think this sounds too good to be true but it is true hundreds and hundreds of human studies back up what we're talking about you're going to love the benefits you get with this every strong formula\nThat's incredible let me remind everybody they can get a free bottom of the ever strong formula today plus the bonus bottle of be twelve energy melts\nJust by calling us at one eight hundred by eight zero

get ever strong this clinically tested Korea teen blend from surety products right\nOh absolutely I Know it combines the Korea teen with vitamin D the coffee buried the fruit XP moron and for those who don't know talk about how these work so well together there was a a synergy and it's also a great value to I Know we have a free bottled today but if you wanted to buy all of these things separately it would cost a small fortune wouldn't it\nOh absolutely I mean if you went out and bought the Korea pure create and that's the purest fine is pre teen from Europe if you brought that and then you went out and bought a separate antioxidant formula and separate joined formula and the vitamin D\nAnd it's going to cost you eighty Ninety a hundred bucks a month but you're not going to spend that today and that was purely products and your name or going to spend a half that you're not spending forty five fifty because today\nIt's free your job is to be one of the first thousand

Ninety five for shipping we want to get it right out you\nKnow we want you to try this out we want you to be the judge for yourself don't take my word for it try it look in the mirror go to the gym lift some weights play do whatever you do see if you don't feel better\nAll right let's talk about how you take this you have these easy to swallow tablets which are super easy to swallow it also comes in a very refreshing cherry Barry powder so how do you like to take and it gives people just choose the tablets are the powder when they're calling for the free bottle today\nYeah yeah you can choose tablets are powder I personally use both you know I'm I work at these days I'm making a a protein shake on days I'm juicing let's face it juicing is becoming very big these days so if you're doing something like that to be very powders fantastic could just take a scoop\nDumping right into your juice dumping pure protein shake and that's a great way to take it but if you don't do that stuff I mean the tablets are super convenient they're small they're coated they're easy to swallowed it's wonderful stuff\nNow I Know you're shopping at the bit to tell us a little more about this study the purity did on the ever strong powder they tested golfers and already found out that not only with these golfers getting stronger and more explosive but they were driving the golf ball get this\nFourteen yards further that's amazing\nI have such a big smile on my faith right now I'm remembering when the researchers came back and gave us information I mean we were bouncing off the walls this is so exciting the\nResearchers call this a seminal study in sports nutrition and this was on our average strong formula the products we're talking about right now the average strong power so\nDouble blind placebo control study thirty golfers took the restaurant powder for one month no exercise nothing different just took our ever strong power for one month in one month they were banging the golf ball for teen yards further pat not only that\nSix percent more power on the bench press more explosive they could lift the weights faster\nThey hold our guys spend hundreds of dollars on new clubs to drive the offer\nFor a job or you can read five hundred dollars on a driver yeah five yards right this is or team yards at people shouldn't just how how about this or your about this this is amazing because let's face it this was a golf study but more explosive and there's more speed more power this\nShould help all sports so if you're a tennis player if you're a jogger if you're any kind of an athlete this has ramifications across the board but again these golfers\nOne month on this ever strong powder we're talking about today banging the golf ball fourteen yards further can you imagine that you get your bottle of ... you don't tell your buddies take her for a month and you go out and you're banging the both fourteen yards past them they don't know what hit him\nWow I Would just got a few minutes left here I Want you to recap this amazing story today about Korea Team would you like to call the molecule of strike who needs it and what about this double free bottle offer today with the ever strong plus the B. twelve energy melts\nYou know what at my one concern with this show is it literally it sounds too good to be true right I like when I tell folks about every strong right I'm afraid they're going to think I'm making this up to not possible right\nYou know I Know how you feel because six seven eight years ago when I started to read about Korea Team or almost couldn't believe it I said to myself\nIf it's really this good with an excellent safety profile how everybody's not using it but I started to use it and I noticed some incredible benefits it's just phenomenal and it's as simple as this you're going to get on the strong\nYou're going to try it you're gonna get stronger you're going to get more powerful you can look in the mirror\nAnd see the difference there's hundreds and hundreds of human studies backing us up these aren't studies with a hamster in a lab somewhere we're talking human studies I called stuffed muscle fertilizer it's that great and of course we didn't just a a decree a pure Korea Team we've discussed that we are the fruit XP remember that joined health\nWeight of the coffee Barry extract that nominal if the opposite of that more potent than blueberries and strawberries for powerful in the opposite of protection I added the vitamin D because it's so important across the board\nRate for bone health but also for seniors vitamin D so important for muscles especially as we get older for strength and coordination so this is a very comprehensive formula again this would easily cost you eighty Ninety a hundred bucks to replicate on your own but today it's free\nAnd not only that let's not forget about the beat twelve energy milk pack 'cause we're talking about energy here today and when you

matter how much we heard him no matter how much we reject him he's always going to chase after us because we will always be as children that will never change\n\nThat's the message John was trying to share with the people he said I don't want you just to know what I Want you to know and now there's a story told John it's not in the Bible\nDon't know if it's absolutely true or not we it's not an inspired a part of God's word but it was written by a a guy by name you CBS\nA new CBS was a guy who was a historian and he's a very we're now and and respected historian and a lot of what you see this road corroborate collaborate corroborate the Bible\n\nNot used to use them big words it backs up the Bible\nAnd he tells a story about John that took\nPlace after John was on the island of ... now John is on the island of ... because he was in exile he was banished there by the government for being a Christian and while he was there he got a revelation from God for Jesus himself which became the tail end the very last book of our Bible\nBook of revelation\nThis story takes place after he was released from exile and was able and free to go about his business\nAnd John was going around us the story goes from church to church church the their their various places that he had been a part of the ministry there and he was checking up on the pastors at each of the towns he got to this one particular town and he encountered this young man who was a recent converts\nA young man who had come to know Jesus as this lord and savior and John took a special interest in this young boy and they wanted us tell him I'm I'm about Jesus and so he would go out to Starbucks with him\nWell maybe not Starbucks but he went out and he hung out with him and they talk and they talked about different things they talk about God and they hung out\nWhen it was time for John to leave he went to the bishop the pastor of the church and he said I Want you to take this guy under your wings\nI Want you to take special note of him as give them some special attention share of Christ with him I Want him to become a special project for you take good care of him John laugh that he went after several months he comes back\nAnd he goes to the bishop but he said tell me about the young man how's he doing and the bishops his face though\n\nAnd very quietly he said alas he is dead\n\nYoung man was very much alive physically speaking but what the bishop was saying is he a spiritually dead\nBecause after John had left to this young man\nStarted to see the beauty is in the treasures and the lure of the world around them\nYou started to look after the riches and desire the finer things of life the wind the women and the song and the richest that were around they're meant to in order to support that desire he became a criminal a thief\nAnd that grew and grew and grew into now he was not only a part of a bloodthirsty\nBanned the thieves and murderers but he was their leader the worst of the mall and when John Heard they'll see hardest cloaking morning\nAnd then he asked for a horse and now she was lifted up to the top of the horse onto the back of the horse he he turned in the house for instructions on how to get to wear this the as Dan was\nThe path took him into the steep ravine one way in one way out and easily protected by centuries and guards as you would imagine he got captured\nA new CBS tells us that he was carried forcefully into the Dana bleeds\nLikely to meet the end of his life\nWhen the young men saw John Standing there even though he was jets with with weapons armed to the teeth he turned and ran away from the old man\nJohn we're told with all of the strength and all of us might ran after him until he couldn't run any longer and finally he cried out stops pity me an old man\nI have come to tell you that there's still hope for your life I Want you to know that I Will play in your case before Christ myself and if I\nTo as Christ died for me so I Will be willing to die for you\nAnd the young man fell to his knees\nAnd your CBS describes it this way that he baptized himself a second time with his own two years\n\nI was a life changing moments that young man turned from his life of crime was restored to the church and restored to face\nAnd I began to wonder now why would that happen with a young man turn on a dime totally changed his life\n\nAnswer is love of a father you see this young man's felt the love\nOf the spiritual father by the name of John who was willing to march into downtown hell so to speak\nTo come after him and then\nThis spiritual father John he saw a lot of our heavenly father who is willing to send his son\nTo suffer hell so that he might be safe\nAnd then I began to wonder what what moved drawn to do something like that well move John to leave\nThis comfortable town and go into the\nOf this fantasy leagues after this young\nMan and the answer is the love of a father is he he loved this young man with all this hard\nBut he was only able to live because he himself had experience the love of a father a heavenly father who loved him so much but he called his trial\nThey loved him so much that he sent his one and only be gotten a song Jesus\nHis only fun to suffer hell to suffer death for him\n\nAnd now John is telling you and me see see\nHold please understand a lot of the father\nWho's lavish to be stowed and gifted us a love so much that he caused us\nTo be as children but he has made us his children and folks I Want you to know that this message is for you today\nJohn isn't just talking to the people and ... and the other towns of turkey\nHe's talking with you and me and he's saying see see the\nGreat love the father has lavish telling us that we should be called children to God trying to say I want you to know not know that know\nThat this father loves you but he has called ... you just child he's adopted you to be his own\nMartin also sense from a young age help them

flexibility and mobility\nThis is our ability to do things ... things get around be physical today we're going to learn more about this once mysterious substance how new breakthroughs are allowing us to get it back and keep it as we get older [noise]\nAll right here's our gas to health a journalist bill ... bill is an author a researcher in the field of health and wellness he's traveled around the world in search of information about\n... acid or H. A. as it's sometimes referred to back from his recent trip to a small village in Japan where people maintain high levels of EJ and are famous for their ability to define the e gene process bill welcome to the program\nGreat to be with you pat and all your statements to introduce the show today are certainly not overstatements after years of people using oral highly ironic acid supplements well of course we're going to give your audience a report today an update\nAnd an improvement how things are going as thousands of people have discovered how this support\nIn particular their joints but also their skin and their eyes and of course their hair and so on these are the areas where\nThe body actually is highly concentrated in ha but I Want to tell all your listeners to please stay tuned to because there's going to be an F. R. E. E. offer I said\nFree offered today from purity products no strings attached this is a free offer from a reputable company that's been in business for years just you need the phone number as soon as we tell you more about ha\nNow you see there's a youth molecule and the human body and then it holds the key the visible signs of age you know you've written about this you've traveled to Japan to do the research so so tell me about what is what exactly is this molecule you're talking about\nHad it's amazing that most people don't know this word highly ironic asset and of course it's made it's all over our body it's in our skin it's an all natural molecule we can get it orally replace it in our body\nBut more so we've learned that the little bit that we can get as a dietary supplement can trigger your body to make more\nAnd of course why do we need more well when we're young we're loaded with this stuff when we're babies we have what we call baby fat it's really baby H. A. it it makes a well as babies fall down and get cuts and scrapes you notice they never really get\nAny lifelong scars from that because they have lots of H. A. on board highly ironic gas it and to make this easy to understand for the audience I think we can all appreciate\nThat women have smoothing skin thicker hair and so on all of that is because estrogen sends a signal to make more ha and that's why the girls\nHave more limber flexible Joyce they can get in a kind of a load of posture kind of the men can't get into that they certainly have all of those advantages and it's because the estrogen sends a signal to make\nMore ha now women have more ha to lose than men do and you see the skin traveling up the joints and so on as women age but there is a way to get it back and of course purity products for years now has been talking\nAbout ha and they have a new formula just for the joint H A joint formula and it's so important today because\nI think everyone's confused an article in the New York times says consumers are confused what to do to support their joints took people are looking for alternative we need cushioning in between the joints the bones in our joints when a doctor looks at an X ray all he's doing is measuring the space\nBetween the two bones there in the knees so it's about a quarter of an in space without that cushioning\nYou've got bone rubbing on bone\nThat's what age a is it the jello or the cushioning agent in between our bones\nWe lose it either due to wear and tear or age and so we start getting problems the more that we find pain relief the more pain relievers we use\nThe more we're going to use these joint and then we're going to wear out more bone and they've noticed is people who chronically use pain relievers are going to have more bone where so what you need is the actual cushioning\nBack there to lubricate the joint and that's what ha does that what ha is that doctors call it's no veal fluids\nThey actually inject this into joints orthopedist do dermatologist injected into the skin I doctors use it as a lubricant during eye surgery so it's nothing foreign to modern medicine but it may be new to you is the listener there and you have never heard about ha before well\nYou need to learn about it it's a wonderful molecule it's all natural and you can get it as a dietary supplement\nPurity products was the first to introduce it now it's a great big long molecule path that six million Dalton's in molecular weight think of six million paper clips put together its big you can absorb it and ...\nDid he found a way to knock it down so that it's only about Fifteen hundred to three thousand that means that you can absorb this orally we actually proved that in studies conducted at the laboratory right there in Florida and we're going to tell you more about that but\nWe proved that it's orally absorbed most doctors are told that oral ha cannot be absorbed that's true if it's the regular ha it's got to be knocked down in molecular weight and more important it needs some other antioxidants to be added where that we're going to talk about one here in just a moment but\nPurity products is introducing this all new joint formula for people that are searching for alternative for their joint health and of course this isn't a drug it's a dietary supplement meant to of course support healthy joint health as as we think of it\nYou're just tuning in we're talking with Bill ... acid or Eighteen bill you said recently that the H a revolution is under way more and more people are using it tell us why ... such a breakthrough and what exactly can you do for people\nI think the brick and mortar analogy is probably the best for everybody to understand it there are bricks in our body the cells there's mortar in between and the mortar is the college and now within the college and not the college in itself item in the mix college\nBut within that college and there's moisture rising agent that looks like Jell O and everyone knows you put some jello in the refrigerator and the water separates out after a time\nAnd that's what's happening in our body we're losing the water holding molecule ha the body is Seventy two percent water and as we lose this\nThe connective tissue that connects all of ourselves that connects all of everything that we have begins to lose its water it separates out and then we begin to lose the substance the scaffolding that the support structure that holds our body together\nAnd of course we've been getting a wrinkle we shrivel up we lose an inch in our height\nWe we see the the brain a shriveled up in the eye and so on all of these things occur with age and you know ... daily on was looking for a youth molecule and he wanted to\nFind it and of course the fountain of youth the water he was looking for water fountain the body needs water but it has to hold it\nAnd of course I Want everyone to think\nOf having something like\nA jello a type of a water balloon filled with jello or one filled with water which one do you want you want the one filled with jello", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Purity Products", "city": "Tucson", "day": "07"}
