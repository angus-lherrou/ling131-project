[noise]\nLight caravans I'm Pam who sales Fox News that charge from President Trump who said Democrats are openly inviting illegal immigrants to violate our borders dance as a caravan of about two towns in migrants crossing into Mexico from Guatemala\nThey are co Q. super boost formula what can it actually do for people\nWell its energy I mean the combination of these two incredible nutrients resveratrol and co Q. ten in fact\nOne of my students called the advantage I liked that so I adopted the term it's combining to amazing nutrients under themselves which a spectacular but when you combine them indeed this spectacular ... if we can call it that this is enhanced this advantage this cardiovascular advantage\nThe cardiovascular benefits benefits to your brain function and cognitive performance it even is involved in healthy aging and it's important for supporting immune function it's great for your skin it's great for energy and endurance and aerobic capacity and as we said before\nIt supports normal and some attic activity throughout your body\nAnd I think this is the ultimate combination not remember mark as we said the energy in your body is converted by co Q. ten add to that the benefits of resveratrol this combination it is on the boat and indeed you get as my students said this real advantage\nBut it's interesting we're talking with Dr Alan ... know that your presence tell me more about the consequences of being co Q. ten deficient\nYeah well that's really interesting you know one of the assignments I gave my class awhile ago was to create a co Q. ten deficiency questionnaire in other words\nIf you're going to give a patient a questionnaire to determine whether or not they had a co Q. ten deficiency what questions will be on the questionnaire well the first thing everybody agreed on in class was a feeling of being run down feeling for the you know I hear I'm running out of gas\nI got an energy crunch my batteries are a lot you know like that so basically a lack of energy a lack of stamina and remember we need a constant supply of energy to live and to thrive and co Q. ten is that Cain nutrient involved in energy production\nBut the point is you don't have to have these symptoms to supplement keep in mind that co Q. ten is crucial for your general energy production\nAnd as we said it diminishes as we age\nAgain we're talking with Dr Alan ... no I Want you to have a pencil and paper and a pen handy if you're listening we're going to give out a phone number here in just a few minutes purity products has a tremendous offer on their new

wouldn't love energy endurance and stamina but there's more physical performance cardiovascular protection cardiovascular benefits but as we go down the list I Want to talk about immune support I'm

rough innocent fine wrinkles and your skin it's an amazing combination so I Can't give you a three I gave you a little bit more than that\nWell All right even better but regarding new co Q. ten plus was very troubling some purity products how many glasses or read one is equivalent to how many would I have to drink a day to get the same benefits\nWell I Would say two to three classes a day\nAnd that's what you see in the Mediterranean diet\nYeah that's what you see exactly in the Mediterranean diet but I got to tell you personally I couldn't handle that maybe you\nCould well [laughter] I
