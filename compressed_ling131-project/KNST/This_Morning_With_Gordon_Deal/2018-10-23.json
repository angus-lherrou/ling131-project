in a sense was able to access the previous time dimension universe and she was able to look back and see what's happening that location and maybe the child and the mom\nSaw this woman dressed and futuristic ... futuristic clothing and got terrified and ran away so it's almost like a glimpse into something else and a lot of times these are perceived as ghostly encounters\nYou ever when you're doing these studies have you ever encountered something we're even skier due to\nUm personally no I haven't been scared that legit I had an experience I'm\nA I live in sort of the country a rural area of Ohio and I'm a one morning a me and my wife was out of town and I'm\nOne morning I had I kept getting these overwhelming feeling like something's wrong like fear like adrenaline and I was sort of drawn to the outside uh we have a four acres and upon\nAnd I said why is that why do I feel this way and my dog was feeling the same way too normally she's pretty calm in the morning but she was like scratching they get outside so I'm like yeah\nOh well you know my scientific brain going just take a shower and go to work and don't worry about it and I'm like you know what I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to follow through with it\nSo I open the door the dog and may went outside in the backyard and she's sniffing around and I'm like I still got this feeling and then I looked over at the pond and I thought something like in the pond floating\nAnd I started walking and then I started running and it was a ... cat had gotten into the pond and somehow um you know drowned in there by you know building upon you know all that stuff [laughter] but I find myself this is it's not so much scary looking back on and it's a little scary but\nSomething drew me out there you know I I go to work every day you know it's the same thing\nAnd I never got that feeling or that desire to go outside but something happened and I kept asking myself\nWhat what happened what made that day different and with there's some sort of like the stress signals that to me with the cat and distress and that kind of linked with me and the dog and then I you know but that's it's not scary in a sense but looking back on it it's kind of like this so many cool things happen there it's really amazing experience\nHow many pure noble experiences occur Brendan because the person who\nDied who comes back\nNever had some unfinished business and head to head the tell somebody wanted to get something done\nI\nYou know I don't know percentage on that um I I Would say that you know a lot of the a lot of the cases out there\nOf ghost encounters have to do with easing are coping with the psychological injury like the death of a father or something right\nYou know I'm ... you know you're sort of struggling with death ah there's all these emotions happening um so you know the body sort of\n... the electricity or the emotion signify a psychological injury and that sort of sets in motion a plan to sort of human\nPsychological wound through what other whatever means possible so maybe if you're not able to cope through normal means you might use unconventional means you know and if if collective unconscious or collective consciousness exist and memories\nOf personalities and experiences of all of our humans are store to store it in the atmosphere um you might be able to tap into this field um and and get some sort of resolution like your father showing up and saying don't be fat I'm at a better place\nYou know and and I think the thing I the research out there really says that I think it's up to eighty percent of elderly people experience these um bereavement operations associated with their debts spouse one month after their death um so that's a pretty high number eighty\nPercent of the huge no\nYeah yeah and and perhaps the bereavement operations er visits from the thief shortly after death are are kind of more important to our individual psyche and perhaps ... could be sort of a way\nThe process of emotions and ensure that our cycle like psychological well being of the survivor you know a final goodbye from the deceased couldn't help but to move on through crisis or grief\nOr maybe if we didn't have that when the person died it might be a good way to sort of move towards the revolution and ... ... and when I talk to the these people that have these encounters they often report feeling more at ease or accepting of a loved one death after these operations\nAnd I think on TV usually go negative negative negative negative negative but there's a lot of positive um it can come out of it goes the encounter you know this idea of wait a minute there is something more to life where there is\nUm something to look forward to this not all negative and demons and things like that\nBrand and what have you concluded above the people who are more receptive to these guys reparations encounters the mothers what's so special about that\n[noise] that is a that's a great question I Wish I had a definite answer for that um I think [noise] you know something narrow biologically is different about them you know when they put 'em there's\nThere's some cats out there specifically with people who claim to be really sensitive to electricity and things like\nI Would like human magnets or something or\nYeah yeah exactly you know I ... the research is kind of sometimes fifty fifty if you want to think about that thing with this phenomenon exist and and it doesn't exist but there's\nSome some really unique experimental design that um you know where they're actually doing that from our FM our eyes any jeeze and what they're finding their their brain is actually and their bodies are reacting to this electricity at very low levels so there's some sort of\nObjective evidence that they can detect things that are more than that other people and the general population can you know so and this is true for but then we all we all experience pain differently right and they've shown that throughout all rise as well so you ... you know I might get\nPoked with a pen and to me it's a horrible painful event for you it's not really that\nDoesn't hurt at all say with us

you know as a precaution and I hadn't really thought about how hard that would be to fulfill for some of the schools that serve some of the\nMost disabled children and that so I watched an evacuation 'til at one of the schools it's called the Phoenix center and not leave which is just west of New York city\nAnd this was interested to see how hard the staff worked to keep the students come and get them out of the building\nUm you know school shootings you know they're obviously way too many of them but they're still rare I mean it is unlikely that this school will be um targeted\nBut at the state law to practice and so they do and they took it very seriously and um [noise] you know it's it's a lot of work when you have students who have severe autism Down syndrome or their behavioral challenges some of them or\nA seizure disorders or you know medical issues and um they they work hard to to to do what they need to do\nA lot of these students have one on one eight so when the when the alarm sound the AIDS you know each goes to his or her student and they walk out together uh some of them in the oxygen tanks or\nI'm sort of items to calm them down like blankets or ... miners some of them have these things called social story which are like um [noise]\nLike flash cards with visual symbol up you know a flame or um you know people lining up outside of a door to help uh

that I didn't have first responders there but um you know with such a high staff to student ratio I I think that the uh you know the staff would be largely in charge of the students and the pressure sponsors I imagine would be instructing the staff\nBut I I that's a good question and some of these students are are very I'm terrified by noises and they're they're really create consistency or something like a drill that gets them outside of what they're used to can be hard for some of them yet\nTo that point I I think you mentioned there is one student who sort of froze when he got to a doorway and didn't necessarily want to go outside of that time\nRight and some of the male staffer I Swear I used to him doing that it's it's happened before so they very quickly kind of came over to him and scoop their arms under his arm pets and kind of lifted him up a little bit to get his feet to start going again and helped him get to the evacuation site\nAnd another girl who are really hates
