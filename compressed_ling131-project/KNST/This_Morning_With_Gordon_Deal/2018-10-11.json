intention for she hears from the hotel says we accidentally overcharged you buy exactly the money she was overdrawn\nI'm somebody else was down to her last two hundred dollars she wanted to set up a website she had a port wine staying and wanted and was wanting to do a website and set up a business to help other people not feel bad about their birth marks\nAnd she's down through last two hundred dollars and she suddenly here from Lloyd\nLondon ... she had been a former employee to say that she could get a special amount of money because she had been part of this again out of the blue so this happens so often that it it has convinced me it's not just luck is not just happenstance\nAnd you say universities are studying the power they what are they doing\nWill we did the um we did the brain study you know and then we found him as I say we compared it to things like meditation and we found that it's not the same it all brain state during meditation still makes you feel like you're you\nThis what makes you feel like you're part of something much much\nBigger the power of eight you feel like you're part of you you kind of feel like you're part of the field that you're not this little lonely individual anymore you're part of something much bigger and granddaughter um and again we've looked at it compared to other\nUm mystical states and its\nIdentical to a Buddhist\nMonk and ecstatic prayer but now we're moving forward um life university the one who studied this hot largest chiropractic university um has their nearest scientists and we're planning\nA study with their biology department to looking at the immune system workers so what changes in your immune system when you do this\nBut one of the other\nBig pieces of this I talked about it with ...\nWith the University of California Berkeley who did this big study of what goes on when you do something else rustic when you do something compassionate like our piece experiments and they found something incredible that goes on a with a thing called the Vegas near\nIt's the longest nerve the body and it winds its way from your neck through all the major Oregon's\nAnd it has a big effect on\nUm things like releasing oxytocin which is that hormone that gets released the feel good hormone when we're when we're caring for babies and\nThen the result of this activating is that it has a really positive effect on the immune system so when we do good or feel compassionate or ... something like that we um you know we\nWe actually get healthier\nBut the other big piece of this which is why that Middle Eastern experiment came about and the Arabs started you know sending love to the Israelis they found that when you do something compassionate like be part of an intention experiment or power of a group [noise]\nUm that Vegas and you're also makes us more tolerant more tolerant of people not like a ... so that was a big piece for me George because I started thinking wow\nAmerica America is so polarized now what if we started doing intentioned experiments where we had Republicans and Democrats together would that\nWould be ... that would be an interesting experiment\nWill you know we're doing one this that this Sunday on doing a pilot experiment like that in\n... county in Florida um we're going to do something about lowering violence\nBut we've got Republicans and Democrats as part of this experiment in the same room together to see what happens to them afterwards and we're planning to roll down in a big way next next spring um we're we want people\nYou know of the different political persuasion in the same room together to see what happens to them afterward\nYou talked about a mirror affect what does that\nMirror effect to me was the biggest piece of this George because you know we weren't just seeing effects among the receivers of stuff and the receivers of the big intentioned experiments you know the outcome of\nThe biggest change all that was amazing to me was what happened\nTo the participants in these intentioned experiments so when we started doing these these experiments I started surveying the people to find out you know\nWhat happened to them and were they able to get on the Web site and all that kind of stuff but more amazingly I asked them how it was for them and I'll be getting answers back like that um I felt like I was part of a higher network you know my body was shivering and I was you know\nShaking uncontrollably and crying I felt like I was in the tractor beaming Star Trek remember these are people who were participating\nIn their own home in front of their own computer by themselves but yet they were feeling this extraordinary energy and the extraordinary emotion but more interestingly is\nAfter they participated in a piece experiment their lives became more peaceful they were making up with relatives that we're getting along better with their partners that we're getting along better with their bosses and they're co workers\nThey were ... and they were hugging strangers about half of them said I feel more love for everybody I come in contact with so that to me with the amazing thing about it the mirror effect and when we did healing experiments we had loads of healing\nWhen we had peace experiments we had loads of people finding their lives were more peaceful\nSo in a way that's probably the most the most powerful part of the intention experiment it's not the outcome that's pretty interesting definitely but it's more the active participation and what happens to those people it changes their lives being part of that\nWhen we're gonna come back in the moment and take phone calls I've still got a few more questions for you as we talk about the power of aid but we'll take phone calls in just a second on

Katrina in New Orleans and I know exactly what these people are going through and one thing that they they they never gave you as a survivor of a hurricane was the manual on like this is what you do next and and the thing now is it psychology it's\nMaking sure that the people do not touch their damage could take those photos take those videos made sure they substantiate everything that was damaged because it will help the insurance process a lot believe me this was the same case in New Orleans\nBut we went through this I find myself and a lot of storms not just hurricanes but a flood related storms as a a kind of a social worker going out and talking to people about don't touch that do this here's what you do so this is what's going on right now and and the people in that kind of direction down there\nBut it does the radio station acted as a sort of a sounding board as well\nWe'll take you know we we take a lot of questions and we try to to uh get involved but we direct uh we're not in the business of really giving expert advice but we do direct the questions inquiries to the proper authorities\nRight boy I'm at what point yesterday or what time of day did you say oh boy it's here\n[noise] um it it became very apparent when the storm made its northeast to return it was only a direct north path to pass it that we thought you know\nWhen is it going to make the turn to the right when is it going to make to turn to the right didn't do that until it was really about maybe fifty miles off the coast line that's when it got the north eastern were really kind of\nTook the right in to uh Mexico beach Appalachian coal in that area\nThe western part of Florida from say deft in West of Pensacola that were spared nothing at all no damages at all happened on that side it is just totally centered around the Panama City east to the same walk to the Appalachian coal to been been there\nIt's uh it's interesting because of hurt a number of people say who had to hunker down that they didn't really have time to evacuate why was that\nYou know and and I don't quite understand that because of the state of Florida has a great thing and you call it that Seventy two is on you and me which means uh you've got about a Seventy two hour period it was really prepare for these things and you know Governor Scott did an amazing job you got to give this guy credit ... boots on the ground he was\nAt the emergency operation centers at all of the communities in ... county in Bay county which is Panama City by the white Tallahassee and you know ... of course it's a big political a time of year here in Florida because the terms are caught up and you see some of the politicians that you never saw before\nI get to the spotlight and they want that airtime on television or radio but governor Scott's been there since day one he's been there for all of the storms and you got to get this guy credit he has been on the ground and he's really directed a great operation a movement for the emergency operations center ...\nSpeaking live this morning with Chris Brian he's the director of programming a news at ... ... talk one of the three point seven double UPENN radio in Pensacola, Florida one of our ... or so you mentioned you had been through Katrina is it difficult to compare since that hit a major city and there really aren't that that does not that type of thing there in the panhandle of Florida\n... ... you know it it is it's a different animal altogether but most people don't really realize yes New Orleans was the big\nThe big element of that storm but actually Katrina hit Mississippi and a New Orleans just had the flooding aspect to let me he broke his if you all remember ah the Lebanese breached a it was the water situation water problem this was a pretty much a a wind related storm\nI Know in in the Pensacola desolate area got less than one going five inches of rain um but it was really I write maker but you really can't compare the two in terms of Bob the immediate damage\nKatrina water ah Michael it was when really you\nKnow give me a let me about thirty seconds here Chris on why just out of curiosity that region there that Mexico beach area has gone undeveloped there is not overrun with tourists when it's so pretty\nWell because a development in terms of real estate development the beaches by the way you know the beaches from Pensacola aged ... to Panama City the most beautiful white beaches on the world absolutely but once you get a little bit he's the Panama City\nBeach tech your change is a different color not same white and it's\nA it's more of a kind of a whip related coastline ah with with trees and things like that\nIt's just not the same as the beach developed communities are the panhandle to the west and that's probably why it is a lot more rivers things like that but I gotta tell ya\nGordon if you ever want to see something that's it that's virgin and just as beautiful as can be the Big Bend is gorgeous in

strongest storm to hit that region since at least eight teen fifty one when recordkeeping began\nMore now from Jonathan urban senior digital meteorologist at the weather channel he's with us lives mourning mourning jaws and just how bad was Michael\nLook mourning Gordon yeah it's not every day that you see a category for making us landfall but uh you know a Michael was pretty impressive and that uh you know a lot of these hurricanes when they approach the U.S will tend to either holds or\nOr the week and a little bit of the approach land but Michael Woods intensifying just as it was getting toward land in fact the lightning and as I was with making Lincoln four\nSo yeah this was almost a category five hurricane and they give you a perspective on that or they're only been three a continental US category five hurricane on record Andrew Camille in uh Florida Keys Nineteen thirty five Labor Day hurricane so this was this was one intense hurricane landfall\nBoy and and the the aftermath now is what this thing is ... ... ... north east across George a writer or the Carolinas threatened here by rain\nYeah that's right right now ah the center of Michael was no just over a or Europe gust of Georgia and it spread it all of the rain into a part of the Carolinas\nThe Appalachians and ah over the next twenty four hours it'll just blew up pretty quickly to the northeast across the Carolinas\nThe southeast Virginia and spread some rain or as well along parts of the north east seaboard including a sell these New England we produce an inch or rain or so on its northern plank you to a New York city Philadelphia but fortunately by friday or this thing will finally be able to see will be gone with it\nI think this compares to some of those other big storms I feel like it's slightly different because it didn't hit a major metropolitan area\n[noise] well that's true you know or you know with apologies the Florida Panhandle you know it's it's um you know if you think about the places where hurricane could hit and do the most damage or think of the places where Michael ... it didn't hit New Orleans had been hit Tampa\nOr they need Houston uh so it's a it's a relatively lower population swat in the ... still hit very hard\nBut ah I guess if there was a small all sorts of relief or certainly as far as the the ... the overall damage figure from this instead of hit a relatively unpopulated area the Gulf Coast\nSo why such a little time to evacuate as some people say to Florida radio show host on earlier said that shouldn't be the case you to board has good about giving people a Seventy two hour window but I was surprised that some people said they didn't have time to pack up\nYeah I mean they're part of it is part of it is due to becoming so intense so ah so close to landfall you know it just kept intensifying intensify and that's something we we never liked to see but certainly the national Hurricane Center National Weather service had a watch with the warnings out well ahead of this that you put\nA watches out a good forty eight hours ahead of times and uh we we knew this thing was coming you know a good three or four days in advance uh but uh\nI think the intensity and ferocity of it or you know I I personally did not expect a borderline get five later today so I think that'd be a benefactor\nThat's something we're speaking live this morning with Jonathan urban senior digital meteorologist at the weather channel I hate to even ask when you and I have these conversations what's the rest of the season look\nLike either I don't know next couple of days or weeks\nWell you know we still have about six weeks of the hurricane season left typically goes to the end of November ah right now there's a there's a couple of systems on the central eastern Atlantic not to worry about it was the dean\nA there could be some develop in the western Caribbean next week a that will probably stay buried in Central America and that could be a flood threats so you don't see any us threats\nOver the next week or so but again the hurricane season still can go into November we still could get a surprise here and there\nYeah you know I was I was thinking about this the other day the hurricane season runs June through November I mean that's half the year but the concentration of this stuff the worst stuff seems to be my wrong like September October\nNo you're absolutely right or really the peak of the hurricane season are usually goes for about the last um the last two weeks of August through early October that's when you get the worst of the hurricanes the biggest threat to the United states\nOr just because of the warm water in the low wind shear that's when the ... that's when you tend to see the peak impact we can still get big hurricanes and tropical storms early in the seat in the late in the season but uh there's certainly a prime time it's almost like the kind of race in baseball almost matts up exactly with that\nKind of good things for a few minutes has always appreciated in crisis situations we call on Jonathan urban senior digital meteorologist at the weather channel twenty minutes now in front
