{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KNST", "content": "But you know at lunchtime I sit down at the airport by have a beer on the straight and I have a beer when I can [laughter] yummy red paste man next to me as you looked like a fellow you'd like to hear a story and I look at the interest he introduces himself he's a former cop he's a former detective from the East Bay area all interesting\nHe looks at me he says Robert he's let my name I have to share this with some ... I was in a graveyard this week and I look at him\nAnd I was in a graveyard I've never been to before never been in this place and just having a walk\nAnd I'm thinking about a girl I loved and could never have from Thirty years ago and I looked down on the name of a headstone is her name the full name\nAnd there's the dates this person died last summer and I can't believe it's Hubbard ice cold\nShe'd never beat in the air as far as I Know I make some calls I discovered she died last summer and something drew me to head start he says what do you think of that I said it's a great story it's a very great story I mean not introduce his whole themes about\nYou know the energy and the connection that might exist between the living in the dead and how someone who has died my coat into sudden close to a certain place might even be an age of the simplicity but\nAs I'm telling us it's also an example of how like attracts like I like stories so even on a day when I'm staying at the airport I don't need a new story today I'm given what else to live as a story immediately just like that and in the these examples proliferate so ...\nYou know what it how it works is that the the attitude of the energy you are carrying again to have results your attitude travels ahead of you in life\nShaping wanted waking foot waiting fuel round the next corner which is a very good reason every tuning in life to pause and check your attitude check what is playing when you're in a soundtrack check what you're saying to you so drop the negative mantras and self limiting beliefs\nAnd be open to something more positive coming into your life\nRobert is there anything physical about this I mean I Know you need the brain the dream but we're also tapping into I think the subconscious and it does its thing outside of the physical body but how important is the physical body to all of this\nWell I think about is very important that the first of all I mean scientists telling us there is no barrier between mind and matter anywhere in the universe mind to match up into leave at every turn in every level in fact some scientists tell us about how to matter of reality as a dense consciousness so\n... there's no hope of separating mind and that are there always play together but when we think about the kinds of messages the kinds of discoveries that we're exploring we\nHave to remember the party has its own messages his discoveries there's the phenomena that used to be called pre sentiment which I experience a lot and maybe you do to what it means in terms of the body is the body sometimes seems to know things that are going to happen before the the mind of the brain can recognize what is\nGoing on the body reacts\nTo something ahead of time ... example I go to the doctor for routine annual physical one time my blood pressure is much higher than usual even though it's controlled it's surprisingly high\nAnd there's no explanation for this until the nuts trying to get get some blood for a blood analysis hit the gusher in my blood is boating and that's why\nYou lived in pants and after that I competed common my blood pressure is normal and she and the doctor trying to understand what just happened\nI said well this is pretty sentiment it's what's called an Alice in wonderland the the white queen gamble the white queen screams\nBefore she pricked her finger so she doesn't have to scream when she actually picks a thing where I just did the same thing I had a reaction in my high blood pressure to it in the Ford took place and the doctor says my goodness that probably is a scientific\nProof of a sudden the phenomenon ... sentiment or anticipate three symptoms he says but I couldn't possibly be reported people think I was looted you\nWell you know I said so I think the ... we know in our body all sorts of things we know thing\nWe know what the bleep we don't know that we know enough about it you know of a sudden medic responses we pick up things from a distance from other people we feel what they're feeling in our body as well so that's part of the story\nNow you teach active dreaming what exactly is that Robert\nWell active dreaming is way of getting active with dreams in the sense that you again to remember your dreams are going to share them the right way to you're going to take action that will empower your life and bring some healing energy and guide in July from your dreams I mean that's one aspect of it\nIt's also method of lose the dreaming you'd call it shut medical use of dreaming we ... my favorite way of talking on the loose and dream adventure\nIs to start out lose to the state ... what does that need it means that we use shut many drumming and the workshops\nAnd we might take a dream that we remember as a starting point we might decide okay there's some romance an adventure still in the stream let's go on with the dream let's get back inside the treatment have more we might decide okay it's time to brave up to a nightmare terror and stuff that stuff going on\nBy going back inside the dream and facing the scary based on its own ground it might mean I Want to talk to someone who turned up in my dream whether it's spreading narrow someone else\nSo that's an example of traumatic looser dreamy another example is that I encourage people to spend a lot more time in that risky try like state\nTo eat and sleep and wake because that's where creative connections made where we are extremely psyche can intuitive and creative naturally so I encourage people to instead of complaining about being awake in the middle of the night\nRelax into that state make of the state of horizontal meditation if you like I tend to the images of rise and fall and see what he wants to make one of the scenes that will come to you the\nPort of pollution dreaming and finally active premium the method is also about treatment with your eyes wide open we got the how to look at simplicity outlook for signs and symbols in the world around you so this is also a program and the method of attending to the dream like symbols of everyday life\nRobert did the dreams ever mislead us trick us basically\nI don't think that dreams themselves misleading I think that our spin on the dreams can often be misleading we might be in a rush to interpret reminded to interpret according to the wrong standards I think I don't think the dreams and themselves as a deceptive\nI mean we can pick up things in the night of the problems with the floating around that we don't watch around we can pick up things from other other entities from whether they're just a bit confused or militias\nThat that can be confusing or deceptive but I think that any image that belongs to us that it's truly our own\nCan be worked in the service of health inhaling it might not be great to begin with it might be horrible my dream of some horrible beast but by learning to go back inside the dream and confront these two on the ground you might find that behind something that's scaring wiring and you and\nYour dream is a power power the understanding of power that might might give you a kind of spiritual ally or a life guide a life coach if you're willing to work with the material I I think as I say that the dream is not deceptive but a rush to interpret according to narrow understanding what dreams is about to be very misleading\nYou got a Robert we are going to take a quick break we'll come back and take phone calls and continue chatting about your latest war mysterious realities\nFind out more about tonight's
