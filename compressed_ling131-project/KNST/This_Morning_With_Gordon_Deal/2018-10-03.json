think to themselves\nWhat on earth is a monkey or a chimpanzee doing up here now he couldn't cross the river and\nWhen the thing came down on the tree it went into the the trees the surrounding it a little in other words there were like low boroughs ten Fifteen feet and then this big tall tree\nStanding in the middle so when it was up in the high tree he could see it and went to climb down we couldn't see it so obviously you're out there this thing has your attention but he's watching this thing going up and down and at one point it comes up sits there and won't position and staring at him\nSo now he's looking at it it's looking at him and then it lowers down again well moments later he sees them less willing in the bushes on the other bank which kind of came down a hill alongside the fool's\nAnd here is this little big foot sitting on the shoulder of daddy coming along the bank and going out of sight in front of him into the woods so you had one carrying the other one\nWho knows it's anybody's guess what this little critter was doing maybe it was like you know I I Know it sounds ridiculous but I think of it in human terms like when we used to go down to the monkey bars or something to play with the kid in the park you know\nThat's right now you mentioned earlier about a couple that moved on to their house to get away from big what happened\n[noise] well I've had a ... there's been a number of people that moved houses are a\nUnited sooner out in the rural areas right\n[noise] ... yeah for the most part are people who have backed up against a wilderness areas or for instance when we talk about man this is a very interesting a story\nA involving no sighting but evidence like it's nobody's business uh these people and when you talk about Maine George I don't know if people really realize this Maine is the size of the rest of New England combined\nAnnual Ninety percent of it is on an habit so when you talk about wilderness it's not just the Pacific northwest British Columbia Canada here we have a lot of wilderness in Maine we have a lot of wilderness right here in New York state [noise]\nAnd so these people had more from one house to another house in northern Maine or the money was right the property was right the people that had lived there before them we're gardeners they will gardeners\nThis was like a match made in heaven well as it turns out\nOver time they found they were accusing each other of losing the gardening tools\nThe wife is saying the husband was to shovel where's the rate was this so finally the husband get the idea that they're going to gather together with the tools they have to an inventory and then they were going to keep them all locked up with the exception of two small hands spades\nSo having accomplished that they realize they were missing some tools [noise]\nAnd they started they left to hand spades\nOn what she called the the wife called the heat stroke table on the patio and they were using them for ... plants\nAnd no sooner had they left them out there a couple of days went by and now these hand spades withdrawn they it actually called the police report on the property of you know tools and this and that\nNumber and understand who would come on their land and the tools and take two of them is ridiculous you're going to go to jail for taking a shovel\nYou're going to Rob the place Rob the place well Frank [laughter] bright TVs and things like that [laughter]\nSo they actually went out into the property in the woods\nThey found one of the shovel leaning on the tree and the wife spoke out nine feet off the ground one of these you know what one piece hand garden trials with a rubber handle on it shoved into the side of a tree nine feet up\nNine feet up show they went back to doubt they got a like I guess an iPhone or something took pictures of it they brought a ladder out the husband couldn't Bush this thing it was buried under a tree several inches thick couldn't budget\nSo they had recalled the police and told them the story about finding the shovel in the woods showed the cop shoveling the tri ... everybody was baffled by you know the turn of events you\nAnyways the long and short of it was the cop told them look if you have any other problems get back to us I'm not sure what happened here I'm going to pass it on to the detectives well as I said the long and short of it was a couple of days later\nThey came outside and the guardian behind the house\nHad been trampled down there were huge footprints in the bed or made orders were taken the head of lettuce one mashed and whatever had done this which was obviously a big foot\nI stepped right over the fence not using the gate there was a gate on the garden and it just step right over the warrior\nWent and had it's full of feed and then left they recalled the uh the police over to see what had happened that would have transpired\nAnd he actually told them that this was pretty much the best evidence he had ever seen a and that they had had reports periodically of people saying they saw these big ball creatures coming in their property of walking around now so it\nIsn't convincing yeah it's not like it's not like these things on being seen it's just that they're not being\nTalked about which is a very odd thing you know you don't George think about the UFO\nAlleged talk about that when we come

Wednesday nothing's ever settled in politics right polling is a good guide to the state of play and you look total contests but specific polling Evers can have\nSignificant ripple effects that's why Philip bump at the Washington Post says it seems clear that the fight for the Senate will be the more hotly contested partisan battle next month when we go to the polls\nFill up a lot of data you're crunching what do you have\nRight yeah it's very Beautiful Mind so the upshot is that the Democrats are always faced to climb this election cycle there are because six years ago\nBut like the term was two thousand twelve and watch the Democrats did well with a bomb on the ballot there are a lot of Democrats and now after defense each day old against Republican challengers in the mid term election year so we have a lot of that already sort of in a structural imbalance against the Democrats but\nAt the moment it seems like they're forty nine races in which the Democrats either aren't up for re election or heavy elite in ...\nAnd fifty races in which the Republicans either hold the seat or heavily going and then there's one way stories in Tennessee\nThat's essentially tied so the upshot is go either way\n... how about a ebbs and flows as I don't know particular issues come to the forefront in any given week is that is that happening\nNot really I mean we've seen for example recent polling in North Dakota which shows the Democratic incumbent Heidi Heitkamp in trouble that's not surprising it's North Dakota it's a very red state uh there's been some indication or or or I should say some some\nAh we're we're cool arguing that a high camp is suffering from support for cap and all that ... that she wasn't immediately on board with a supporting Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court\nHas been pointing to as a reason that she's a falling behind their state but the Democrats have consistently had trouble in any way so I'm not sure that's really the case the main thing that we're seeing is ship that in states where there are\nA where Hillary Clinton won for example the Democrats and do well in states that are down from one of the road and do well there are some outliers like West Virginia where Joe Manchin still maintains a lead a despite the fact that he's a Democrat in a very red state as a general rule no it doesn't seem to be swayed by ...\n... we're speaking with Philip bump national correspondent at the Washington Post she's written a piece in Delaware the fight for the Senate stands right now um how much could things change over the course of the next month there was starting to get really locked in here\nTo some extent I mean we were starting to see where races are starting to separate to some extent and what that means is that parties will then stop putting money into those races which means that those races will become even more solidly whatever color they were training in the first place so yes we can see some of that\nReally this is going to come down to a handful maybe five Senate seats on election night which will determine control the Senate I think the house\nPretty likely to to go to the Democrats at this point in time the Senate continues to be a big question mark\n... what were those that did you ... five thirty eight crunching numbers than they about are the odds of one party cleaning the house in the Senate\nThey did yeah and so the numbers change a lot depending on what they get in but essentially it is the Republicans I bought one in ... chance of holding the house the Democrats have about a one in five chance of taking center\nOkay so you were to it like the some of the gubernatorial races correct any any notable similarities\nWhat's remarkable all the components of the races is that if you look for example the Senate map and look at the state of pulling there there's a lot of sort of the areas where the Democrat and Republican or wanting sort of even\nIf you look at that map though there are a lot of states where there is an incumbent Republican governor who is going to win reelection\nRight so you look at a state like a Maryland or Larry Hogan is very popular looks like he's not going to have too much trouble running for re election even though it's a blue state and there are a lot of reasons for this one of course is the fact that the Democrats have a map on the Senate side so you're going to see 'em a few were ... great voices they're simply because there aren't a lot of you know strong\nLet's during a white nationalist rally that turned deadly in Charlottesville

a review on how best to protect ourselves we're joined by Dr Schaffner infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt medical center in Nashville working with the CDC doctor what should we know\n... there's going to be a flu season that's the important thing we should all know more severe severe but it will be here who is nasty which means the bow it's the talk to get vaccinated let's all rolled up our sleeves the ...\nThey've been digits are so simple we don't have to think about them if you're older than six months of age yep\nYou're eligible for vaccination we should get vaccinated to protect ourselves as well as everybody around us you don't want to spread the virus this nasty virus ... anybody at work\nIn in your family at home and your house of worship don't be graded spread or\nGet vaccinated [laughter] how difficult is it to create the correct vaccines these days\nWhere we have lots of options there's the standard flu vaccine and for people age sixty five an older this is important because they get more serious complications there are actually two vaccines that are licensed especially for them one is called simply the high dose\nAnd the other has a fancy name called the ... vaccine that just means there's an immune stimulant in it\nThe pharmacies and doctors' offices almost all have one or the other and that's great for people age sixty five and older and Medicare will pay for it you don't have to worry about that Mm\nI'm do vaccines make it more difficult to battle the flu strains\nVaccines don't make it more difficult in fact they are the single best thing we have available to combat the flu and we want to ... emphasize people age sixty five an older\nThose younger than eight sixty five we have an underlying illness such as diabetes lung disease heart disease or immuno compromised and a special shout out to women who are pregnant and back flu vaccine is safe it protects the pregnant woman\nWomen were pregnant when they get to have a very high rate of complications that we don't want that and then there's a bonus\nProtection they make actually passes across the fence it gets into the newborn baby and provides protection to the new baby after its Bork well so that's a bonus\nYeah we're speaking with Dr Bill Schaffner infectious diseases specialist at Vanderbilt medical center in Nashville they're working with the CDC is we head into flu season with some tips on preventing flu or any read on what these this season is going to be like the worst than last year uh not as bad\n[laughter] but read is that there will be a flu season the odd that or a crystal ball it's cloudy and that's why we just say let's get vaccinated each and every year I don't think I don't try to anticipate there is this going to be a bad one just go ahead and get vaccinated that's the best protection\nThat flu vaccine will protect against\nAny number of different influenza virus strains within three or four vaccines battery get the one that's in your doctor's office or that pharmacists ...\nWhat about ah what about the spreading of germs let's say you you do get the flu what's you know how do you use yourself or use your own body to prevent it from spreading the others\nYeah so it's it's very simple the CDC has a take three approach\nGet vaccinated number to try to use hand sanitizers and hand washing frequently and avoid people are coughing and sneezing\nAnd if you should get sick don't wait call your health care provider because they may prescribe an anti viral drugs which can reduce the duration of the owners make it less likely you get complications and make it less likely you'll spread it to others so that's a comprehensive approach\nDoctor bill Schaffner infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt medical center in
