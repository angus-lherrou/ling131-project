remember the artistic sketches of the shooting where they track the bullet Connelly was sitting in front of the president\nSo he got he but but what I don't know is whether he was in a bench before him how that seating arrangement was I I I think he was sitting in a bench in front of the president or the way I like the front seat I think he was in the front\nAt so the so governor currently and his wife or in front of President Kennedy and his wife\nSo there were three people in the front seat\nNo they were in another so it it would have been a row of feeding their and Andy Dr\nEarly or the

November six more employers to are taking an increasing the active role in trying to get their workers to the polls on election day more from general McGregor at the Washington Post who writes about leadership Jenna what's up here\nI think you're the same kind of insurance then fever pitch that were being around that the mid term election because kind of cross over into and requirements faith and a lot of employers are\nPicking up on that and also trying to do more I think to either give people time off for a little more flexibility or\nPlay a role in in voter registration our awareness in ways that\nEven though that's gone on in the past seem to really picked up and expanded something this year\nThere are no laws right that say companies have to give employees time off or paid time off the vote\nIs no federal law which is a big difference there are a lot of state laws that require some kind of either\nTime are paid or unpaid I think it's something like thirty eight twenty or thirty states have some kind of law at the state level but not all states not all ... states have any kind of consequences for noncompliance\nAnd even if there's some kind of law that says well you have to get people off a number of them have a kind of exception where if the person is not scheduled to work and the first two hours a day or during open polling car and then that doesn't go into effect so it's really a patchwork\nOh All right so explain I guess a couple of examples of what companies are doing something to play an active role here in getting folks devote\nSome companies are doing is saying I'm going to take the fun of myself and doing a little bit more than a you know one of the best ones I heard it was a kind of a restaurant critic the Mediterranean that casual chain based in DC but they are they're in a number of states\nYou know this is really I think a little harder for people who are in\nFrontline service jobs in retail workers if you're scheduled to work that time it's a little bit harder to get off that somebody who's sitting at a desk and become just step out for an hour and so um they are giving all their workers here hours of paid time off at the beginning to end their shifts on election day\nThey schedule it with their with their manager and in advance\nLevis drown is gaining knowledge you know voting kept each of the offices and distribution\nAnd also getting people take Tylenol for many people may have heard of Patagonia\nWhich actually is closing stores on election day they did so in twenty sixteen they're doing it again this year and they were kind of an initiate or in a big effort that something like a hundred and thirty five employers have signed on to to try to\nUm really push the issue and say we need to make employers more aware of how they can\nYou make time available for employees to the\n... speed magenta McGregor right or at the Washington Post she's got a good story about how companies are taking more active role in getting their workers to vote on election day um how much of this is tied to more companies speaking out and being encouraged to speak out on things like social issues\n[noise] yeah I mean I think companies realize they can't take a stand on climate change your gun control or you know immigration or whatever that second out on it and then\nOf not say anything when it comes to actually voting and elections and so I think there's an expectation levels are employees and so they're they're following her through a little bit on that and this is not going to say that\nThat's something that every company is doing and obviously there's a long way to go but I and and that may very well be\nPublic relations in a way to just you know look good and the either their employees but it's it's something

Wall Street journal reporter Ben ... who covers veterans issues and what have you found\nThe Democrat strategy to try to run veterans or the ... uh this year and to to find folks who could walk that tight rope of being bullet proof on national security issues while also being bona fide of their progressive or the progressive background\nI mean a lot of times that the G O P the Republicans are the ones who who are sort of aligned themselves with a party of ah the cardio flagging country and patriotism but there's a both ah both an\nUp and coming crop of recently elected congressional veterans who are sort of shutting the framework to to bring other vets in and then there's a few dozen veterans running on the on the Democratic side or the vets are seemingly\nWilling to do this\nYeah so this has been a has been sort of a two fold every one is um folks in the Democratic party upset that veterans have been a habit of approaching the party say where we're interested in running a and the same time the Democratic party has a has a number of different things that's putting into place\nTo to welcome back into the party so when there's a couple a couple of first term a first term Democrat in the house of representatives to put together fundraising apparatus take a leadership role in the party and uh have have really come out to support so veterans are coming up behind them in the system\nIs that right is that number correct that there was a hundred and Ninety nine veterans I guess of of all parties who are actually congressional candidates\nThat's right so that's a Republican

speaking with Wall Street journal reporter been canceling he covers veterans issues he's written a piece about how Democrats are trying to win with help from military veteran candidates\nUm there was one analyst directs burger observer in your story you said a military service doesn't necessarily translate to the best candidate for office which seems obvious but what was the point there\nRight well the point there is that ah with with any military veteran running sometimes the the iconography is a form of learning as a patriot the background and experience would be the military\nOr can can can issue warn people into being one trick pony so that the military service can become the summer there are some of the parts and right now that's that's a strategy that that some folks are using if they're if they aren't veterans themselves in the running against actress to say yeah we you know like\nWe we appreciate we appreciate the service but you know there's there's other all the cases that are more work\nAnd in the very heart of that environment a polarized election cycle [noise] um there there are there are observers who are saying but you know the end of the day\nYou need to have the

are are looking for people to align with them politically that's why they don't vote for him yeah I Know what\nAnd I don't know but I think there was one woman in your story you said that was a why she was choosing a particular veteran because he seemed willing to compromise with the other party\nAnd the the one woman I spoke with that I think stricter you know talking to a number of different people said hey I I don't like the partisanship that that that's happening in the country I don't like the direction we've gone\nI Wish people would talk across the aisle but at the end of the day I Want to make sure my party when so there there there are a lot of voters that I've that I've spoken with to have that\nHave that um have that opinion you know I wouldn't want people to work together
