that used to come in in the morning and sometimes they would find books in the middle of the floor and they couldn't understand why it happened so she finished do let us be on one side and then I get up and began to talk it suicide began to speak one of the books from behind me came flying\nLa la la until the middle of Rome in front of thirty five\nPC and there's no way they would just fall\nNo it didn't it was like just fall down behind me I mean as they come flying by the end\nLike somebody was throwing them at you\nExactly that and like I said with thirty five people saw it I didn't see and unfortunately because my back was during to it but I saw the but they'll buy and screams [laughter]\nDo you think there was somebody back [laughter] tossing them at you\nI'd certainly looked in ... so you know but there was just a ...\n... what has for you than you know on the cases that you've been in have you ever felt that\nYour life was in danger\nOr never buy the dead\nNot by the by the leading me\nAnd I first book uh goes chronicles is ... is the second book on the series\nA marine and I didn't investigation was the daytime investigations jumped him and called me up and asked me to check out his house so I gather are right now but we went to his house and the places that massively looked like it had been trashed and this guy insisted that there was this spirit of a young girl there\nAnd ah so anyways uh they were pretty big ... ah and ah they kinda got us for a while after we did our thing and ah one of them move separated me from the other one and the other one talked marine we later found out that\nThat the guy had just been released from prison for murder or a friend of his and uh so he wanted a marine and come back alone but that didn't turn out so if\nThere was any fear was then [laughter]\nYeah she was telling us that story before I Would imagine\nIt's it's one that's left an impression with us\nI think so what kind of equipment Ron do you bring with you\nA very on on on the particular case uh the you know the logic of the um the case you know as far as locations and the more people but more of a piece of equipment or the smaller case the lesser amount but you always want to um\nYou know tried to ah bring the proper equipment that you would need for instance if you have reports of a operation being seen you might bring more video equipment are and like they're ... or ... whatever\nThat you you believe versus a sound equipment or something like that and it was and vice versa if for instance most of the the um reports manifested by\nAudio than you would bring more audio crummy so it it it varies a poet and we've gotten to a location\nWhat would you say has been the most incredible visualization that you've come across\nThat I'm Sorry what was the word the visualization visualization\nUm actually I Believe I've seen a full body operations probably four times um but the interesting part about it or judges that\nThey weren't really well I was ghost towns in but more while I was just doing normal stuff yeah\nWork with a lot of White House history funds for them and we do you know public goes on and that type of stuff and there are two separate occasions or one that I Do these goes to his cause I'm On the board of directors of a personal habit\nWhite House that we do these hard two tours in one time we were in the um [noise] it's a like an observation tower it's a square\nBuilding with glass all around you and sees windows all around you can absolutely see you know three hundred sixty degrees and it was one daughter in and out of it and there was a group of people there and I began talking to them during my view and I looked outside and I saw a woman a walking on the outside towards the door\nAnd she got about halfway down the the side of the world you know going towards the door and I I stopped because I don't want to repeat myself and she came and they didn't want her to miss anything so I I just thought waited for like a circuit generally walk all the way towards the door and I waited and waited\nAnd yet nobody came in so finally said is there anybody out there and there was a volunteer sitting on the rock out there and there was another one by the door and she's just notice there's nobody out there but yet I saw her as clear as day so clear that I had stopped my bill to wait for her to walk it\nAnd yet there was no one here and oddly enough\nThat said well ... is with the coast guard 'cause it's on the coast guard base a coast guard reports she and women walking on the wall in that same location so\nThat was kind of intriguing I'm a ... for the other one which is going to the opposite scale was on a Sunday Morning after we did a public or goes typed on uh what Iowa White House and a good fit pool meals Maine we were in the White House ah keep U.S House it was on\nUm renovation at that time we were sitting on the ... the one in a room off the kitchen look towards the kitchen my service dog all across the or the kitchen and ah but I didn't hear anything you know how it drives you hear their claws on the\nYeah yeah the the there was no it was a ... so I\nJumped up and meal you're into the kitchen\nAnd the dog to the door was closed\nSo I came back and spoke to the woman is she says why would you see that's that's our dog she says can you describe Mrs sure absolutely yes ours clear as day like described the door she just stood there and\nShook her head and smiled at me and she says well you know run there was a White House keeper here who had a dog and when it was time for him to be relieved them leave the island uh the dog wouldn't go so all with the White House keepers afterward\nTook care of them to a dog actually died and\nI don't she says the dog you describe pretty much mattresses\n'cause she has a dog but that of that dog and I did see a picture of it looked like it but can I say that was it though I Know but so I mean is two things that I'm really not looking for

so we can try this thing to America's first news this morning with Gordon B [noise]\nMuch with us we'll come into Wednesday\nSince Georgians went to the polls in twenty sixteen more than half a million voters have been registered including an increase in the voting ranks of women and minorities groups that tend to lean democratic\nMuch of that increase is the result of a change to a driver's license forms and acted two years ago in which new applicants and renewables are automatically registered to vote unless they expressly opt out more from Wall Street Journal reporter Kamron McWhorter in Atlanta Campbell is going on\nFor a very strange thing because\nRepublicans as a rule don't like these motor voter bills which are bills which is what's your path in several states which allow people when they go to\nRegister or re read or we knew their driver's license they automatically get registered to vote unless they opt out or say purposely choose to opt out and so what it's done in those states as well to\nA lot more registration and it's been fought by a lot of Republicans who consider it a a a way to that that could be misused this you know where people who are driver's licenses but aren't necessarily said as soon as somehow end up voting at a could cause problems\nSo that has been the case in Georgia but about two years ago\nOr the department of drivers services here\nJust made this little change in the document on the advice of their attorney general and I can't get a real straight answer as to why they did it and but what it did was it basically created a motor voter situation in Georgia without passing a bill and so the result is\nThe scene registrations go through the roof here way more than any a\nA voter Dr efforts by democratic leaning groups or anything I mean registrations are way up among all groups African Americans or Asians Hispanics white people to a lesser extent I mean it's really brought out a lot of new voters\nBend the Republican governor signed off on it right\n[laughter] right and again that everyone gets very skittish where I started crossing as to why they did that\nBut the uh the Democrats and meanwhile the Democrats are are somewhat skittish about it because they want to talk about voter suppression that Sarah one of their talking points and the truth of the matter is if you look at the wrong numbers of people who are\nAbout the possibility of voting in Georgia it's increased dramatically in Kabul digits way higher than the population has increased in the last two years\nSo as one observer or expert in your story said just because there's an increase in registration for particular\nGroup that does not equal turn out all the time\nOr exactly so but now the battle becomes turnout so talking to various experts that I spoke to regarding\nThese bill they say look what what's it just promote ZIP Code all so we'd have more people registered to vote so they're allowed to vote now it's up to the parties which should be to engage voters and get them to the polls so\nAnd that's certainly what both parties here are doing ah regarding the governor's race and torture which is which variant tanks and all the polls indicate extremely close\n... speaking with Wall Street journal reporter Cameron McWhorter about his piece entitled Georgia's motorboat or drive boost eligible voters in groups leaning democratic I saw the tightest together now because we have this very closely watched in what appears to be highly intense battle for the governorship in Georgia\nRight so Stacey Abrams is an African American woman running on the Democratic ticket she is the ah she would be the first African American woman to ever become an issue in any anywhere in the United states where she where\nAre you a

previous governors like Nathan Deal who is now leading\nWho's very pro business but also very conservative and anyway and so these two are candidates are really clashing they are ready to both raising tons of money in and out of state they are both uh a hammering each other whenever possible [laughter]\nAnd they are bowl I'm scrambling to get voters to the polls the this will play in you know if Stacey Abrams can bring a for example more African American voters to the polls Richard according to the primary she did do that in the in the in the Democratic primary if those people show up\nEnough numbers and Asian Americans and Hispanic Americans who are um who tend to lean democratic come to the polls are the Republicans could have a real tough time and uh they they were very aware of that I mean and they're\nDoing all kinds of things including trying to get um [noise] make inroads into these minority groups because they know the ... that's a that's a weak point for them\nIs Kim Wall

developed into a category ... storm\nAs targets landfall today hundreds of thousands in the Florida Panhandle and the Big Bend area have been told to evacuate we're joined now live by Weather Channel senior digital meteorologist Jonathan burden job in the morning what's the status of Michael right now\n... are right now or you're just a little over a hundred miles south of Panama City Beach Florida is a solid category for hurricane\nAnd I I have to say this is a bit surreal is a meteorologist watching this\nOr we go look back into the historical record there has not been a category for landfall along this part of the Florida Panhandle or the Big Bend in Florida you know we're bands of ... in any historical records dating to them Mitt nineteenth century so what we're seeing today is truly an unprecedented event\nWas it a surprise that a jump to a category for\nWell you know I'd have to admit uh looking at this last week we were expecting at least a tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico but uh you know I I'd have to be honest I was not expecting a category for landfall\nUm you know it's just basically been such a very old Gulf of Mexico water temperatures in just some some optimal wins a law that allows the such rapid rising motion in the Iowa the hurricane and it's just taken off in the Gulf of Mexico far beyond what I expected\n... time would be roughly what middle middle of the afternoon\nIt looks it looks like the eye of a of Michael should make landfall in the early afternoon hours somewhere between Panama City beach in Appalachia cola Florida\nYou can kind of think of this is kind of a somewhat larger version of perky Charlie if you remember fourteen years ago Charlie a random like a barn saw through a southwest and central Florida where the category for\nSo unfortunately the this is going to try the massive storm surge possibly nine to Thirteen feet above ground level I mean can you imagine night the thirteenth even no water outside your front door a so you know really if anybody's\nStill along the Florida a Gulf Coast they only of hours left to get away if they if they've been ordered to evacuate\nThe goodness which we can live this morning with Weather Channel senior digital meteorologist Jonathan or even the uh are are are there were the comparisons to Florence which struck the Carolinas last month\nWell you know it's interesting because actually this is probably from her her we get to Florence in one of the big differences of course the intensity\nBut looking at a category for landfall as opposed to foreign spinning down to a category one or two words organizing slow crawl Carolinas that produce the you know the feet of rain and the uh the flooding that occurred for weeks at\nA what we're seeing with Michael is again it's much more intense\nAnd it's going to accelerate fairly rapidly through a southwest in central Oregon that end of the Carolinas\nA Thursday on Thursday night and really by this time friday morning it'll be off the east coast in and out of the way so it's moving the good news is moving quickly but it get it to the ferociously intense storm a unfortunately for the Gulf Coast\nSea so a bizarre the kind of the historical perspective you gave before about this type of storm not hitting the Florida Panhandle in so long or ever but I'd like listen I'm up in New Jersey so I think Gulf of Mexico I think hurricanes big storms I'm bud bud why I guess not those area\nYou would think so I mean I I'm I'm looking right now at a map of all the historical category for hurricane tracks the Gulf of Mexico\nAnd you know there there's been a number of them that have hit the Alabama\nGulf Coast the Mississippi Gulf Coast of Louisiana and Texas and South Florida but there's just this strange gap a from a north of Tampa or through say Appalachian coal and Panama City\nThat has not seen it has not seen a category for landfall and it's sometimes it's just the steering wheel in the atmosphere that when you get the really intense hurricanes like this\nThey tend to go further south and then further west in the western Gulf of Mexico and not so much hitting the Florida Panhandle Gulf of Mexico or so since it's October the steering would tend to steer it more towards Florida than toward the west or do\nSomething very good hey thanks for sharing a few minutes is
