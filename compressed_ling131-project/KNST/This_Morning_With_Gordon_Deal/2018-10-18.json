reason Americans are cutting back each month is there need to save more money but for what purpose analysis from Greg McBride sheep on angel enlisted at bank great right what are some findings\nAbout two thirds of Americans are limiting their spending are\nBuried reasons but the fact that two thirds are holding back in it what is otherwise a pretty good economy notable this is the highest it's been four years um you know in the middle of the range that we've seen over the years but it's a reverse the trend where you see where\nThe economy got better and better\nUh each successive here we saw that people are a little bit looser with the purse strings and that changed the share it jumped from sixty percent now to sixty six percent that say that they are actively limiting how much they spend every month reversing that downward trend that we had seen a in several years prior to that\nYou referenced it in a couple of your remarks there but this is a solid economy right to wages are creeping up the tax cut pour more money in Americans paychecks why this trend now\nYou know it's interesting you mentioned the growth in household income and I did that is one thing that we have seen consistently show up of the last few years that was initially a well we started looking at this oh five or five years or so ago\nThat was the topic of the people limited they're spending it was like as their incomes weren't going up what we noticed over the past several years though is that as a income growth became more broad based that became\nLess and less the case where that was the reason people holding back and instead people were saying well I'm holding back in order to save more money that continues to be the predominant reason and buy a pretty wide margin a couple of other things that that they're watching the percentage of Americans that point too\nToo much debt as to why they're holding back\nThat's been creeping higher each of the past few years down the highest that it's been at any any point that we've looked at this over the last five years and I think that's consistent with a rising interest rate environment that better economy we are seeing debt burdens come up but that the higher debt burdens\nCoupled with rising interest rates are they get shows that there are some people out there are starting to feel the squeeze on interest rates and then we even an assault economy there there there are still those that are\nYou know those ever present worries about the economy there are still ... percent of people that say that the reason they're holding back us there's the you know worried about the economy began not a whole lot different from what we've been seeing last year a lower than in years past but not a whole lot different than last year but again I think even shows that he'll even on a sunny day nobody's worried about right\nNow and we're speaking with Greg McBride chief financial analyst at bank great dot com and got a new survey that indicates sixty six percent of Americans are limiting spending about my generation what's that break down\nAnd you know it's interesting guy the tendency to both back on spending and inclination to save more as the reason for rolling back\nSkew younger so I wasn't particularly the way they are the most likely of all the generations to really be limiting how much they spend and they're also the most likely to say I need to save more money and that's why I'm holding back on on my spending Gen x is not far behind um but it's so similar trend there\nAre most inclined to be limiting their spending because they want to save more money\nBut that's where it changes the baby boomers those are the sandwich generation a couple of things one they're not as likely to be holding back\nOn their spending as their younger counterparts [laughter] but when they do their reasons are different and it but the predominant reason is stagnant income so even though we're seeing broad based income growth in on the economy's doing well I think that's another indicator that you know particularly for baby boomers that are in the workforce stagnant income is still very much an issue\nThat much of this is the recession hang over that may have been passed on from parents who went through it to say\n... what the Generation Z or the millennials or whatever some of these young adults just picking up on their own\nSo certainly with millennials I we've seen this this is no fluke I mean we've seen this\nIn a number of different surveys that we've done over the years you know some of the things that you and I talked about in the past ... millennials have a greater inclination toward saving they have a less of a consumption focus and they're more averse to debt than what we have seen from\nPreceding generations and I think a lot of it stems from having had a front row seat for the financial crisis either experiencing it first hand in the case of older millennials or seen the impact that it had on family members\nFriends older siblings I'm just as you were sort of in those financially formative years has undoubtedly had in the fact that we see that\nManifesting itself in a number of different ways you know in this case it's that that focus on saving limiting the spending in order to save more money\nLike Greg Greg McBride chief financial analyst at ... dot com twenty minutes in front of
