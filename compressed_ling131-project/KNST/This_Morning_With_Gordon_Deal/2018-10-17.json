people will spend\nA national vote in an ass it's the same way they did when Hillary Clinton won the popular vote in twenty sixteen but don't have a very big hold on political power if they simply have one half of Congress and so\nThat's a that's a recipe that is probably going to produce um obviously divided government has a hard time getting things done and it's a continuing democratic anger at their opposition within the political system\nStarts so there's no for example uh [noise] I'm no lessening of the divide because the Democrats let's say when the house and Republicans maintain control of the Senate because there's more balance I mean\nWell in in you know that's possible and in order a couple of issues interestingly trade maybe one they're actually may be some common ground you know there are a lot of Democrats who are\nCloser to President Trump on trade in his use of tariffs and um basically challenging allies on trade issues some Republicans are Republicans have tended to be more free traders [laughter] so you may actually have a slightly bigger\nBalance of support for the president I'll trade in a in a divided Congress but on most issues and particularly on health care it's going to be very hard to get something done 'em and I think you're going to have\nA ... if he if Democrats do in fact take back control of the house there's going to be inevitably pressure from the Democratic base to begin investigations of various um activities in Trump world including potentially\nA re revisiting the confirmation of justice Kavanaugh but also having a look at some

forty we're sticking around\nI think it would be I mean I think it's a big deal a you know some of it it's actually more than forty depending on how you count so it's a big number and you know I saw some of those are the Republican incumbents were going to be in trouble in this environment anyway so they you know got out while the getting was good\nSome of them probably could have better defended their seats than a newcomer can answer that opens the door or the wider for Democrats is actually I think one of the unappreciated factors in in this campaign is the amount of open space Republican\nRetirements left for Democrats to move in and one of the interesting things that's happened in one of the reasons Democrats feel good about house races is that these democratic challengers in swing districts where there is an open seat or Republican U.S left\nOr by and large well funded this time they've managed to raise a lot of money um there's a very active democratic financial support network now a lot of small donors a lot of it's on line\nAnd so you have not only democratic challengers who are facing an open seat that they have a chance to win in a swing district as well
