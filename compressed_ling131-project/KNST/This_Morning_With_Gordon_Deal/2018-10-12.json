{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KNST", "content": "And and where does this where does this message come from that I've been up another subject which is sometimes people received messages and dreams which on the cognitive\nAnd who's giving them the ...\nThat's the question right where's this message coming from [noise] you know we can we can speculate you know we can say it's coming from the unconscious or we could say it's coming from something they've added or we could say it's coming from the spirit world\nYou know but some of these messages for example this woman I mentioned who had the dream that should be killed in a terrorist attack where would that be coming from that could've been her fear mhm you know um\nAnd maybe it was just a coincidence that somehow when something like that happens it seems to be more than a coincidence\nNews there was a movie about to a group of people government people who tried to enter the dream state of other governmental leaders\nTo to assassinate them and you know the wanted them to die of heart attacks and they were going to put fear into their dreams and stuff like that do you think that really might be going on many\nWell that reminds me of the dream telepathy studies that I mentioned that were being conducted at my monitor these medical center in New York because I think people can be more specific\n... the I Know while they're dreaming while they're asleep I don't know to the point of getting having making someone have a heart attack I don't know if that would be possible if that's ever been done\nWell who knows when people die in their sleep what caused right that's\nRight that's right because you know I sort of take the position that anything is possible you know and I think that's possible although we don't really know and how how could we know\nIt's right you know so yeah\nThat could be pretty remarkable mhm\n[noise] yeah I was also talking about messages and dreams 'cause I've also had that experience where I received a message but it wasn't um wasn't a pick our native gene which is the message and I didn't even know what to make of it but I remember that just clear that\nDay when I woke up this is the message I got I I just studies where it just said this is a world of illusion and the biggest illusion time\nDidn't Caesar's wife have a premonition about the ides of march\n[noise] that's right in fact she dreamt the night before he was killed she dreamt that he was going to be assassinated\nShe begged him not to go to the Senate ignored pleas also with the favorite told Julius Caesar the where the ides of march which is the fifteenth of march and he he ignored this his fair ignored his wife and he was\nKilled so yeah that was a a very strong permission premonition is usually a warning\nHow many people don't act on their ... maybe\nI'd say probably the majority I Would agree because I don't think people believe them they don't leave their intuition\nAnd then they do the ... after the fact\nYeah exactly and how many times has that happened and all that said the majority of people don't pay attention to it because they they think well we live in a you know scientific rational society and we need to think of things rationally and they disregard things which could be dismissed that superstition\nThere's always the fear of being labeled superstitious\nThere was a a movie called let it ride with Richard ... was about horse racing and oh yeah one of his friends apparently really understood who's gonna win the race but didn't back on that horse but on something else some washed\nIn ... in the movie screaming at ground you knew you knew you knew that is a little like not acting on your permission\nYeah for sure that is yeah and you wonder why I think it's fear I think people are they don't believe in\nThey don't believe in and also they were afraid of getting into something which appears irrational\nTell me a little bit about blind people in a obese and things like that\nWell that that's very interesting story because\nThere have been reports of blind patients who've been blind since birth will have another body experience during surgery\nAnd then when they recover from the anesthesia and they wake up to be able to tell the doctors and nurses are what they saw and what they heard while they were out of their bodies which one patient with blind who when he returned to his body after the surgery was able to describe the color and the parent and on his\nDoctors pie and of course the doctor was astounded with another case for the blind patients who left his body during surgery I think no she was a he was wasn't surgery he had a cardiac arrest and they took out his dentures\nAnd he left his body and ended up surfing everything that was going on and then when he when he recovered and I couldn't find where she put his dentures\nHe wanted his teeth back right you have you\nBack but then then they said I don't know I put them and he said well when I was out of my body I follow you put them in that door over there and she open that door and sure enough there\nThey were they were wild yeah it works it would that work yeah\nWhat what have you learned many about all of this what do you think it is\n[noise] I think well I think that there's a spiritual component life I have to say that\nYou do I do and you don't think it's paranormal\nWell I think it's related you see I think it's ... I think it's paranormal and I think it's spiritual I mean there's certain words that are used to describe these experiences are these phenomena some people call them ... some\nPeople call them paranormal some people call them spiritual or anomalous or mystical are mysterious Israel different words have been used to describe the same events so I think paranormal events can have a spiritual component\nYeah but I'm not saying every paranormal event but some do of course it depends on the person who's having experience how they want to interpret it or what they want to how they want to think about it\nDo you think science should do a better job investigating these things\n[noise] [noise] oh definitely I think it improves the quality of life for people to feel like there is something more out there that we don't just have to live her routine nine to five feet you know day to day lives that there's something more that we don't really know about and I think it should be explored\nUp

down you can't panic over every move or you'll go crazy so says market watches Maria ... who has some tips for us on how to remain calm amid volatility Maria how can you keep yourself from freaking out\nSo it's obviously hard to do this week was really crazy in the market the Dow fell you know more than a hundred points on Wednesday so it's easy to get caught up in that but the truth is if you're a relatively young investor you should you know play the long game as history has shown and\nNot get overly panicked about every bad day that the market has\nWhat the problem with constantly checking all your accounts\n[noise] the thing is you know most of us are probably not going to be getting the money out of the account that day so what you're the number that your account says can either be really exciting or really disappointing but the truth is it's probably far off from what it will be when you actually cash but account out\nI'm at is different obviously for someone that's

okay instead of panicking about where the market today\nCan I look at my budget is there any wiggle room for me to amp up how much I Am contributing to my retirement account and time spent during now there's a lot better you know time spent than just hyperventilating\nMaria what about the importance we've talked about this a number of times of making a budget and or evaluating a budget you've already made\nYes so it's it's a good time to just take a look over it again I'm it's possible that something had changed maybe you've gotten a raise or maybe the opposite has happened you know maybe you're\nIn the gig economy any business has been slow lately it so it's always a good time to just kind of reevaluate um you know look at the normal things that their subscription or a cell phone plan you can negotiate on and maybe bring your costs down um all of those things can have really big ripple effect for the future if you can just take the time to do it today\nWe're speaking with Maria lasagna of marketwatch Maria what is the downside of spending money to make yourself feel better when you're stressed out\n[noise] yes so if you are trying to distract yourself from the headlines you

has\nYou know more than a trillion dollars in credit card debt so it's not a good time to contribute more to that\nUm so you know there's plenty of free things you can do go for a walk you know go for run even watching TV is better than going on a shopping spree so try to do pretty much anything but that\nAnd with interest rates rising this is the time now to pay off that if you can\n[noise] exactly so we are going to the interest rates probably rise several times this year or so um you want to get ahead of that before your credit card is charging you even more and interests so if you can pay off as much as you can now that will really pay off later\nOn the positive side of higher interest rates some banks may be paying better rates\nYes that's true so um if you're looking for a new
