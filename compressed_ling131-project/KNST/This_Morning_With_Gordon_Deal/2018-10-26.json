October statistically is no worse than any other month but it's it's been a month and calling to extremes a lot of bad things happen in October and a lot of good things happened October it's a it's a

decades other countries have rigged the system so Americans pay more he says Americans are now going to pay the price as other countries pay\nHow could that work we're joined now by ... cents and president and founder of GDP advisors except the morning is this possible with the president plans to do\nGood morning you know it's absolutely possible for where the president can control certain things so specifically the proposal that ha chess I outlined targets Medicare's reimbursements of specific drugs that are administered in physicians' offices and so the Medicare system itself\nFor cures roughly forty percent of all drugs in the United states actually it is the consumer of these drugs\nTherefore it says under mandate in the law how it's going to pay for these drugs so ha chess has the power to go back and say this is all that Medicare is going to pay for these drugs this is how it's going to work and doctors that are prescribing and and the ministry of these drugs are only going to get paid the some out\nOkay so then the pharmaceutical companies if I can try to guess what they'll say is well that's fine we now will no longer have enough money to do research and develop new life saving drugs\n[noise] that's the argument that they're already making on the heels of his announcement is that a visual style and their ability to reinvest or even make minimum bottom line requirements are\nOf their cost and this was a great step in the right direction I think upset for a long time that the federal government being the largest consumer needs to act more like a consumer uh and and how they're paying for drugs and\nWhat President Trump said yesterday is absolutely right in the U.S pays in some cases twice as much as other foreign countries\nThe challenge here though is that it's it's what the us pays that helps subsidize the what the other countries do at the end of the day this is still a profit margin issue for drug manufacturers\nRight All right so is that approach than anti free market or no because we're describing the federal government has a consumer\n[noise] yeah I I don't think it's the anti free market for that latter part because the federal government in this case is a prince as a consumer the government is not price setting here the government is just saying what they will pay for these drugs\nAnd so in in this we can't remember this is specific to doctor administered drug blood pressure medication or standard over the counter type stuff this is specific to drugs specific to like cancer multiple sclerosis rheumatoid arthritis\nSo these are high cost drugs already and the government's saying we're not going to pay as much now this is also a problem because of the way the Medicare system works and this is specifically with us is targeting Medicare part B is actually the\nPiece of Medicare that reimbursed as this and it pays doctors a commission for ministry and these trucks so this is it through the traditional Medicare part D system which is the prescription drug platform to get out of the weeds here there's an\nUnintended adverse incentive for doctors to do a administered drugs during his prescribe drugs and this challenges that at face value\nWe're speaking this morning with ... and he's the president and co founder of GDP advisors were talking about President Trump's attempt to lower the cost of Medicare drug or why are the costs of drugs so high by the way what are the basics here\nWas it a couple of key things one is in the absolute pointed out in a real problem is that the U.S government as well as the U.S consumer subsidizes the rest of the world when it comes to drawing\nChallenges you have and this is a multi layered complex situation is that it takes roughly on average two billion dollars to bring a new drug to market and that is largely based on FDA requirements\nAre bringing that drug now\nTo in order to offset the cost and recoup the cost to do that\nThe U.S patent all also gives manufactures a twenty year patent\nThose manufactures a really good about tweaking the drug at the end of that Twenty years later they keep it for a little bit longer so this is a complex issue and we really weren't caught which is a great first step but we also much reduced the regulatory requirement to bring drugs to market soften that allow foreign testing\nUh in in certain countries to be allowed in the U.S to reduce that cost so you can have more competition and let the free market do what it does best innovate and compete\nOr some say a hey these CEOs of these pharmaceutical companies are not millions and millions that part of the problem is that true or know\nWell is it I mean it all goes to the bottom line right and and and you can make the argument that CEOs make millions and millions of dollars and\nThat's the market value for those CEOs and this is this is the conflict in a capitalistic society when it comes to health care and I'm a free market capitalist but if a if a pharmaceutical company feels like it's necessary to pay their people that much well that's what the market provides", "year": "2018", "show_name": "This Morning With Gordon Deal",
