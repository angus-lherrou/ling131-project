I didn't want to leave our our sailors out\nNo nine years maybe for me so let's not leave aside well\nYeah I'm going to make sure I have those in there so the interesting thing about uh after World War two was you had these battleships\nYou had ... ah aircraft carriers and they were engaged in so many activities so much a honor that ah the sailor served in that it was a shame to just got all them or to reduce them to scrap but luckily for us a lot of um\nPeople got into preserving those um ships those aircraft carriers and his battleships as living museums and they brought him back to different ports and and also when they brought him back to these ports\nThey brought a lot of a ghost stories with them and and some of the ones that I collected the USS Yorktown which is now in Charleston Harbor\nUm there's a lot of activity or a witness their shadow figure is probably one of the ones they call him shadow ed and Ed's stands for enemy designated which was a World War two term for when you come in contact with the enemy or there's some pretty dramatic stories of\nGhost hunters chasing the shadow creature around the uh the carrier USS Hornet I think is probably one of the most documented a ship based a haunted sites are there there\nIs a story about a man dressed in white naval uniform who uh wanders around the deck some of the battle ships the USS North Carolina I worked with um\nA a few a paranormal investigator from Port city paranormal and they basically told me they they have a career documenting the ... on there\nUm and of course we mentioned USS Arizona oh those are and there there are a lot more I was finding them even as a I was starting to publish this book so yeah there are a lot of World War two ships are on it and I'm just glad that they preserved um and have him back here ghosts and all\nJust an amazing series of events that have been happening that seemed to all of a similarity in that has to do with tragedy for some reason tragedy makes these ghosts or whatever we want to call them hang around don't you think\nYeah I mean absolutely that seems to be the one common element of uh you know all the not just the ghosts of World War two but uh when you talk about haunted rock and roll which I investigated and even some of the ghost stories of\nOf country these tragedies just seemed to linger it's like either the spirit doesn't want to let go uh somehow this is a a\nInteraction between consciousness of reality or maybe they were just so primed um to to\nWhen we hear these tragedies to maybe hope that that uh the spirits go on or the spirits linger there's probably a lot of different reasons for that those are just some of the ones that I've come across\nOur special guest of course is Matthew ... we're going to take calls next hour with him stories and questions of course and uh let's get into when we come back also after the break Matthew a little bit of your haunted rock and roll stories those are those are

listening to America's first news this morning with Gordon Deal [noise]\nBut with this woman the Monday after months of tension and insults in their trade war President Trump\nTried out a new role with Canada's prime minister Justin Trudeau peacemaker\nWith a historic trade deal in mind political\nSays the two men are looking for a bigger reset after U.S Canada relations had some to their lowest level in decades reporter Alexander Panetta says us in ... a Canadian officials are starting to consider a post NAFTA agenda with possible projects near and far space cooperation global trade reform\nBorder modernization and regulatory streamlining Alex what are you hearing\nSo but the starts kind of it and President Trump and prime minister Trudeau had a conversation a three way conference call between um the the Oval Office the prime minister's office and the United states trade representative ...\nAnd uh [noise] from what I gather it was about Fifteen minutes wrong and President Trump spoke for the vast majority of those fifty minutes\nAnd you know the phone call was described to me I could just picture his voice right you know talking about how beautiful how excellent things are going to be now things are going to be different now uh you know don't worry about everything's amazing the classes that things are good\nAnd you know and you see the way he's he's a he's talking you publicly um something people haven't really picked up on is you know talking about how our continent as being ripped off\nAlso a look at some of the behind the scenes frustrations a leading up to the moment where there was a deal\nI Know you mentioned as kind of one of the items on a potential to do is we'll be regulatory streamlining anything I'd\nJump out as one of the yeah she was\nYeah I'll give an example so the for years now\nOr the governments are um I've been working on this thing called the regulatory Cooperation Council\nAnd the ideas as follows I'll give you one specific example of how I understand it so the different countries have different rules for Britain products to market which is normal every country has its own sovereign right the the the the regular stuff but sometimes those differences are so tiny and so insignificant but they cause big problems right\nSo let's stick to lipstick cost something like eight hundred bucks to bring the market in the United states Canada it costs I forgot what it was it was like Fifteen hundred two hundred thousand dollars I don't I don't remember the exact number I'll be honest\nBut it's a lot of money and the reason that cost that much it's going to Canada a lipstick with that yes like some sun protection yeah Scott's it by the pharmaceutical oh\n... yeah exactly and so there's a whole bunch of different stuff like this and the system so the question is can we find a way to remove duplication of record of regulations that don't really matter that are insignificant [noise] and then you get rid of those regulations and you just allow it to make it easier for companies to sell things a back and forth across for\nThis thing has been kind of you know that that whole thing starts in stops over the years hasn't really done much for the last couple years 'cause there was a new government gather you've been a ... in the U.S [noise]\nSo the idea is to have a conference this fall to try to jumpstart the process and get you know businesses rain gauge the government channel what can we do to change regulations that are basically costing our economy money why things out\nAnd we're speaking with Alex Panetta from Politico he's the editor of political pro Canada has written a piece in titled behind the scenes with Trump and Trudeau\nHow they made nice uh you represent a couple of times too like digs in public speeches at each other across the border could that actually hamper things or is that something that's starting to\nTone down now how do you see it\nWell okay so here's the thing I think that President Trump deserves a lot of credit for some of the things she got an agreement you got things that frankly a rock Obama would have liked but at what cost right uh because what you've done is essentially you know publicly beat up on a smaller country next door\nA tugging these little things and in the meantime so the President Trump's approval rating of St Paul's that put it as low as ... percent and get her right\nWhen you when you're ... percent yeah there's I don't want you can do with another country and the other countries are gonna be happy to do with the right you you can't really ask them any favors\nAnd so you know take this compound it around the world so the steel tariffs you know using this this big stick to try to get changes it might work it really might work but on the other hand it might also in second eyes every single country in the world and make you make them less likely to help you or do things with you a going forward [noise]\nSo that's the ... right so the you know the Obama's approach to the Trans Pacific partnership for instance was using the ... try to gently bring countries along to the U. S. schools get some buying an agreement\nOn this is how we should do trade misses that we should be work state owned enterprises that we do to deal with data protections and to try to eventually get China to join that sort of international order\nTrump's approaches I had to put on brass knuckles and found on you until you get in what I Want and the Chinese are going to do it to me it might work I don't know we'll talk in ten years but it also might really causing problems [laughter]\nIt's great to Alexander Panetta at Politico it's Nineteen Minutes now after the ...\nInformed we have to have

split on whether to compromise rather to promise coverage for every one\nWhich would be one already ripped up liberal base or target centrist voters by campaigning on the more modest school of fixing the Obama era health law polling indicates that new issue is more important to voters than health care in Wall Street journal reporter Stephanie Armour says this internal tension carries risks Stephanie what are we seeing\nWell actually what you've seen is as the midterm elections get closer and closer in November the Medicare for all it's an idea has really taken off far more than even the supporters of it expected it really thought that says something more for the twenty twenty\nPresidential elections and it\nWas emblematic of the struggle going on right now within the Democratic party be you have sort of the more liberal side is wanting to do more aggressive policy is such a Medicare for all and then you have some of the more centrist Democrat crafts especially in conservative states that are like whoa we do this we could\nAlienate some of our more kind of a centrist democratic voters so that's really the the\nThe battle of the debate is playing out right now\nBoy who support this ah well I'm ... this is obviously the idea of what I'm kind of brought forward by Bernie Sanders and his idea of a really ... for Medicare for all that is that single payer\nHas now at this point a gardener um sixteen actually Fifteen court watchers because Al Franken just wander on there and um they're now Medicare for all cock it in the house I you're seeing a lot of um sort of the more younger\nNewer faces who are challenging incumbent choice according to us and also in in a lot more liberal states you're seeing that you know become a real talking point Minnesota a methane fill up\nAnd then on the Democratic side as well who are saying well well well we need to go easy here\nI think in the um uh individuals like men for example who ran who didn't fully come out in support of Medicare for all um you see people like I'm In West Virginia who are the a mansion who is um\nYou know taking a much more cautious approach a number of candidates who are saying look what we really need to do with the Affordable CARE Act and build on that versus kind of throwing out I'm the baby with the bathwater\nAnd speak with Wall Street journal healthcare policy reporter Stephanie Armour ... some ...\nOne Medicare for all others aren't so sure how much of a role by the way those the slogan itself play Medicare rule versus say the phrase single payer system\nYeah that that's a good question when he when the parents go out and ask people voters about Medicare for all the support strikingly high around Seventy percent but you know that Medicare for all that has gotten the most\nInterest that brings me there's plant in the form of single parent is single payer and so if you ask people what they think up single payer as a form of health care that that dropped precipitously show I Do think some of it is quite frankly a lot of people don't really know what Medicare for all is and even among the Democrats\nThey're widening support for war watered down version such as allowing people to buy into Medicare is what the option even though they're technically not I'm old enough\nSo that kind of where I think it's going to hit the road as it goes forward as Democrats are going to have to come to some kind of consensus on what they mean what they want and as we saw with Republicans and their effort to repeal and replace a theater that's not an easy task\nIs there a perception among those who support Medicare for all that the government is good at running programs\nI Know it would go so far as to say it's good at running program that I think they they are building on the popularity of Medicare itself which has high\nApproval rating some its beneficiaries and can serve as a positive connotation the public and I also think they that they see that a as a way to expand health care coverage to everyone I'm as well as a way to a\nA word us health care spending which I Would say the the critics of it being mentally disagree with\nMedical groups would rally against it I presume because there'd be less money for them\nRather than the federal government getting really in almost all cases pays a lower reimbursement rate for care than a private payer such as insurance companies so they're concerned obviously about lower reimbursement but also\nThey're looking at it as okay let's see you overhaul that complete healthcare system they're saying that this is going to be what we're left my coming into hospitals which then will cause massive job losses in the industry is their argument or their concerns", "year": "2018",
