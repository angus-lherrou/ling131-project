dorm and uh it's very difficult on the ground\nI'm home served on schools there on business there on a power is still coming back a bet a lot of people are without\nUm communication towers came down there still debris and some of the road so it's a challenging environment and we're doing what ever we possibly can\nTo help people out um we have about Thirteen hundred volunteers in the affected area and they're twenty three shelters that are open with about Fifteen hundred people living in them um there were ten thousand people AT T while we also have um\nAt Seventy five emergency response vehicles and they're driving around the affected area and getting people hot meals and um water and lots of hug and so far we've already served about\nA hundred twenty five thousand meals for snack so it's a big operation and I'm a volunteer their amazing I never\nUh never get used to have generous they are I just couldn't see can made me\nFeel for how long they'll be there at this point\nWell we cannot leave until the last person\nAnd in a shelter place and of course we had\nUm a number of people that are employees and volunteers that live in the impacted area because we're in about three thousand counties across the country\nSo um they never leave they they don't pack up and go home because they are home and um yeah we we just stay until people find a place you go we still have about ... people in shelters in the Carolinas from Hurricane Florence\n... is that right yeah yeah\nYeah so you know this is a difficult period I I think generally speaking like stories now start not to get told right the media begins to pull away from affected areas as they start to focus on other breaking news or does it become more difficult for the volunteers\n[noise] well um it becomes more difficult really for everyone um because uh you know we need health and we always need volunteers\nUm you know those those um Thirteen hundred volunteers that I talked about they work two or three weeks shit for\nUm twelve hours a day seven days a week so they go home we have to re fresh and new volunteers so it and it it did become a bit discouraging when people think they've been forgotten not only the IRS people impacted\nAnd of course everything the American Red Cross does\nIs because the generosity the American public whether they're giving us financial gifts or a donating their time to volunteer and I'm sadly Gordon um we had a cancel a lot of blood drive\nBetween a Hurricane Florence and hurricane Michael because a lot of them were scheduled in those areas and um we were looking at a bit of a blood shortage right now that we're also encouraging people to donate blood if they're willing to give the gift of life\n... speaking this morning with Gail McGovern president and CEO of the American Red Cross what's the what's the greatest need at this point is that the blood is it's a more volunteers money\nI'm yet yet and yet and\nUm you know what we're really focusing on is providing food shelter water um we're helping people figure out how to navigate through this you know some people\nJust barely got out of their home and that they need their a prescription street though they might have lost their\nTheir eye glasses so the red cross does all that and um we really could use help as you said um\nYou know if people want to donate blood or if they want to become Red Cross volunteers and by the way they don't have to volunteer in a big disaster like I just described how we respond to sixty four thousand disaster every single year\nThat's about one every eight minutes so wherever you live if you wanna go to your local Red Cross chapter we'll put you to work um that we can always use volunteers we we do need blood and", "show_name": "This Morning With Gordon
