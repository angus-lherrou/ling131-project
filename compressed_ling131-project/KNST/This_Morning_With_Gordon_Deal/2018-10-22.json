{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KNST", "content": "About Fifteen men on a floater net and those are the kinds of nets that had the cork pieces throughout the net to keep it afloat and then we're spread out on this and just this huge frenzy of sharks attacked\nAnd there was nothing left and so reports like this were coming in that you know and even all the way until rescue I mean part of the rescuers that counts because by the time that the rescue arrived\nThe men were really incoherent they were able to tell or know what was happening by that point in the story but\nYou know the rescuers are reporting that they're fighting off sharks are literally punching sharks in the face to be able to pull men bored\nBecause the shark and ... attacks increased as the I guess you know I don't know how much sharks ... things but they said it seemed as they were pulling the men from the water the shirts um the attacks increased and you know this is\nI Can't imagine how horrifying that would be I think seeing one shark would give me a heart attack and imagine hundreds of them you know one of the sailors reported they were so sick they could walk on their back you know from shark the shark that we're underneath them just swimming there they\nCould stand on them\nThere's one account you have the sailor who you sort of go becoming delirious and he's looking don't use drugs thinking oh there's food I'll just reached out and grabs a boot right\nMhm [noise] yeah I'm young and some by the name of John ... and he actually took his socks off and thinking he was gonna wiggling toes as bait to lower the sharks in and catch one [laughter] and then if you know he kind of came to a sense is that the last minute and realize oh this is probably not a good idea but you know he was\nNearly out of his head at this point and put a sock back on quickly and managed to stay safe you know so they\nWere doing the worst thing [laughter]\nSo some of the worst effects Lynn are happened to those people who drink the water they just went completely crazy\nYeah that was really chilling to me because you know here you know if you can imagine they're they're on their ship ah the everyone knows it's almost the end of the war they were having this leisurely a sale they think across the Philippines see\n'em and then you know the next thing they know they're trying to survive this horrible ordeal these these young sailors who were just playing pranks on each other the day before and then by the second day forty eight hours then now we were talking about the hoarding of water but it's Sara mentioned there were only a\nSixteen rats between there were there were four groups was it three groups that there were four groups of four rap\nOr three groups of four rats in any case\nThere were four groups of four raft but then the one group split apart on the second day okay that's right so so there were so any water that was available with only available on the grass and so there were only about forty\nMen among all these hundreds and hundreds of men who had any water at all and so by you know second day in in the third day and they were starting to get very desperate from dehydration and so\nThere were some men who absolutely knew not to drink the salt water no matter how Thursday they got that there were others\nWho although they knew that the sun and the exposure and the dehydration itself was perversely causing them to lose their faculties lose their ability to reason\nThat some of them to come to the idea that they could strain the salt out of the water and so you see one sailor holding up the torn piece of his shirt\nA while the other one poured the water through it into this into his mouth and thinking that that would strain the salt out well of course that didn't and then others would you take small heard is that the sea water\nI'm hoping that no one would see them and talk them out of it but then eventually they would just begin gold thing it like they were hoping it out of the mountain stream\nAnd what happens with this is a condition called ... and\nBlood vessels for\nBlood cells ... from the brain um brain short circuit just like when a tree branch falls on a high voltage line and they would just go out of their heads and um they died very horrible deaths from drinking the water\nYou know you have the the Japanese commander who decides oh let's get outta here because he figures there's no way the ship is here by itself or something else has to be around you that or that was out of sight all of a sudden and he thinks oh it must have gone away or\nYou couldn't imagine I guess it immediately that it did so quickly so he leaves I'm which is I guess fortunate because they could have surfaced and finished them off\nYou have a somewhere I was I who ends up testifying at the court marshal waiter\nOr an American pilot who saw what he thought was a battle he ended up telling somebody about it but no one paid attention are we going to go to a break in about a minute maybe a ... Sarah you want to talk about that guy\nYeah there was a gentleman by the name of Richard With Francis and he was an army pilot he was transporting a general who had been wounded and you know that the generals up in the cockpit with him and it's a late night patrol you know it's just after midnight and they see this\nKind of explosion coming from Milo and\nThere's no report coming in saying that there is any kind of enemy action do you think well maybe this is true or something of that nature but yeah I get the same kind of out of sorts for him so he said well you know report it\nAnd he did actually try to report it a couple of times and yeah the army side of things that will let the navy do whatever they're doing just ignore it\nAnd still want to hear a navy personnel at Guam I Believe you know hey I saw the genuine look into it and they said no there is nothing report in that area don't worry about it\nAnd so you know\nThere's actually more to the story with that where you know they\nHad a son who you know the gentleman richer the friends that have passed away but his son carries on a story and you know there he actually had diary entries of the time and we're at the ... father and it did line up with it but he didn't find out until a few days after\nWhen were released about it that he would\nWe are talking about ... about Indianapolis the true story of the worst

resale to questionable repair shops or unsuspecting online customers law enforcement authorities in several major major markets have noticed a flurry of reasons ups\nMore from USA Today business reporter Nathan booming who's been researching this made them what's going on\nYeah this is really interesting story I I was surprised to see that Honda's our susceptible to Arabic that this is a crime that has existed for many years but it's really a spike in recent years with late model Honda vehicles specifically the accord and civic although\nSome of the hundreds as well are being targeted by the two are realizing that these airbags can be worth more than a thousand dollars in some cases they break into the vehicle they they basically tear out of the steering wheel and then they fill in the black market\nAnd ... with what just anybody who happens to be in an accident and blow the euro beggars is tied to the to Cato recall\nWhat happens when you need to get your bag replaced you have a couple of different options course most people are going to go to the dealership going to go to the repair shop either place there are\nSome people ever gonna get it done this either going to have a friend or they'll go to maybe more disreputable type of repair shop and that's where\nA lot of these type airbags end up being sold if you actually go on ... for example and you search for this you will see their airbags being sold on line so it's it's definitely happening\nAnd it's it's a big concern you know if you go to a reputable dealerships suddenly you're not going to end up accidently buying a user airbag or something but there is a market for these things\nShe saw it and the reason that it's Honda's because they're popular vehicles and just happen to be more of them perhaps\nOn in ...\nWell I definitely think that's a factor I mean there's no doubt that Honda's long targeted for theft but that's in part because of the fact they're popular but we don't make much sense to me is white only ... because in talking to the police and various markets um\nYou know almost every incentive looked at it was exclusively on this show you know the you know it doesn't make much sense why would only be honest I'm not sure if it has to do with the actual specific\nArabic conductors or some being exactly what it is\nProbably the thief themselves are the only ones you know at this point I'm as we know they if there's money to be made though don't make it\nSo it ... the ... what uses a night ... kinda strips away the ... covering of the center part of the steering wheel and just

know they hit dozens of vehicles in the same parking lot on the same night\nSo you know it's it's definitely I'm\nNot a difficult thing to think about this is like you know\nAs a laptop out for the seat in the car I mean if the left towards thousand dollars' worth so there was a big incentive for the ... and you know with all the recalls that have happened on airbags in recent years including the other one that you mentioned Arabic prices have gone up so the incentive is also gotten up well\nWe'll speak with Nathan booming business reporter at USA Today he's written a piece in federal
