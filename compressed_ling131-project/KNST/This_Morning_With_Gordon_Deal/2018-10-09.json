more dark dark needs ally and yet they hit the darkness one flight so I think it's you know people are are these bright lights and I think that this entity kind of makes its way\nAnd and I don't really want to spoil for folks because I I I Hope people will read the book um I I've what happened that last time that alec saga have land because of that is probably the most profound event that happened in my entire life\nWould you wanna duplicated\nDuplicated experience yeah\nYeah I could handle it now you would really I could what you couldn't live on it\nWise um\nI'll just tell them you're selling your audience laugh and I'll do it if you want me to charge like All right I'll tell him he may have a couple of minutes I'm\nUsing something about the blackout oh I'm Sorry\nI mean when you say you're going to tell them\nI guess so I guess so I I say well how am I just tell everybody instead of just giving them having to read the book to find out because what happened was that Alex called me one night and said I saw the man again\nAny any steps to me\nAnd what he said to me was how her my name is Ron\nAnd when he he said why\nIs it how her my name is wrong if they notice the message for you and I said yeah that's the name of my accept that it was not\nVery nice\nAnd I said and he's trying to scare me away from you\n\nYou think I Wish him\nI don't think it with my extent that but I think it was a man who was let's say a lot about a lot of people say um but I think you know\nIf anybody tries to at least if there's any darkness they're just trying to scare either going to find that thing that triggers you\nRight there is fine I eat dark thing they're going to find it was the antagonism this person's life and mine is my step dad and and he brought that up and Alex didn't get even knew about my extent even name\nWhen all this was happening\nWe went weird yeah I mean\n\nAre you all under control which now I mean you you lose if you or you can control what's happening\nI I Am I Am I Am now because I\nNow understand cats I Am in charge I completely understand\nI Am also becomes deal is\nThis is talk of the all ... fascism that it's almost like matched the hobby what you do the rebels to\nEat out of the coast which hog graffiti and I'm In er\nAnd storytelling it would be considered the inciting event it's it's bad event is what triggered all this other stuff to happen on the photography which you know a little scary at first because I\nIt's weird it's it's it's weird to shut down\nYou know the subject matter is we're ... or these random ...\nUm I Do have a picture of my mother is um I didn't include it in the book because it felt a little too sacred to include that in the vote for him but other than that I don't recognize a single one I had a couple that have come back twice\nSome of the looks like you're in the Eighteen hundreds guard\nThey do do you\nThink you know I I don't know if all of them are there some of them um you know I feel like I've gotten a few that looked like they had a rough time the last time\nThey and their bodies like a guy looks like he's been beat up a woman who looks like she's very sad\nMaybe their dog\nCould very well be fairly well maybe they talk to you you know I Am after a while and after I got past the\nI Can't believe this is happening to me face um when I Would be able to see them I Would I Would start to ask 'em I better\nWeirdly by communication is better when I talk to lots of people a lot of cash than they are strange guess\n\nReally rigor with us for which is your name goes she goes to the um dot com the ghost would talk\nWe're going to take your calls for next I were in ... some of your experiences as we get close to Halloween to you pick it up a little harder\nOh hey that's the time heck yeah\nI have I Am like ghost house rules for every one\nAre you are you just happen to you\nI Am no regrets nice single on\nAll right we're going to come back in the moment on the um\nThe will take some phone calls would you be remote dot com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNaming up in a box\nAccording to a category too with one hundred mile an hour sustained winds could be a cap three when it hits tomorrow\nWell I Will go by that during the day and water and they act good battery\nIt was very noticeable that Rosenstein to tag and you know sessions the attorney general we're having very different experiences leading the Justice Department you know while a Rosenstein was going to the White House and answering questions about the uh\nYou know the Russia investigation going to the hill and answering questions about you know this trove of documents that Republicans in Congress were seeking sessions which just basically traveling the country and beyond a talking about like violent crime and terrorism\nAnd as time has gone on that has become more apparent including when it is actually run by that is traveling to the international cheap the patient conference in Orlando with drug\nUh that is something that would be very close to a session heart\nAs somebody who is a big fan of local law enforcement that he's in France for the the G ... summit so it just kind of an interesting little reality for both of them\nWell these are the conservatives are pleased with what sessions has done\nUm I think they would normally be pleased with what sessions has done but I think that a lot of Trump's allies are really sort of you know set a session like trumpet for stepping aside from the Russia investigation ads for you know allowing Mueller's investigation to progress as\nIt has so I think in any other sort of environment\nA section ... you know prioritize immigration and violent crime and that you know drug policies um you know we're getting credit from contributed but that's not necessarily happening at the time\nWhen I say we're speaking with Wall Street journal Justice Department report or CD girl and she's written a piece titled the split screen existence of Jeff Sessions and Rod Rosenstein you said that ah there's going to be renewed focus on immigration in the coming weeks for Mr sessions\nWell that that um actually I think that's still true uh that was a stray that was written back in may but um and that we really thought migration burst onto the field after that but I think that still true it still\nDefinitely a high priority for session but you know I think right now they're kind of just looking toward what's going to happen at the Justice Department after the term the story right now is about you know whether Trump is going to um you know fire either or both of them and whether they're going to resign on their own accord\nSo it just kind of like oh wait and see I think\nDoes seem to be a strange relationship at times\nAre all yes for both for all of them and the president they get you know our reporting has shown that Trump and Rosenstein actually get along fairly well at Rosenstein has done a pretty good job of you know keeping the present appeasing the president and such a way that he's been able to keep his job\nAnd continue overseeing the Russia investigation but obviously sessions relationship with the president is totally deteriorated and so that's a little bit different\nAnd you said a of Mr Rosenstein and Mr sessions often talk about other things that are happening in that agency\nYeah it's I think when they're together they're talking about day to day affairs a you know what is going on they don't typically talk at length about what's going on with Russia I mean sessions has recused from that so you know he's not getting briefed he's not getting a you know updates about the investigation\nIt's interesting fascinating stuff what else uh jumped out at you as you were pulling all this together\nBut I just think it's interesting that you know Sessions' recusal has not only really damaged his relationship with Trump but just kind of um you know separated him from his the department that he leaves\nAt a time when it's getting involved in some of the biggest you know stories of the day like immigration I guess well Rosenstein to hit the answer to a lot of the complaints from Trump and his allies session has really gotten to the executed agenda in peace and relative quiet because the focus is that right and what he's doing\nAnd says sessions has kind of just been you know traveling talking to a local law enforcement grew up during the day that he really likes and stay out of the cauldron of Washington\nStadium small Street Journal Justice Department

nation's officers\nFactory floors and break rooms which have grown only usually rife with political discussion have closely felt the impact of the ... debates Wall Street journal reporter chip cutter has been sampling workplaces and it says the stew of politics and gender surrounding the new Supreme Court justice\nHave made this moment notably personal ship would have you found\nPolitics have really spilled over into the workplace and so we heard a lot of different examples of people saying for example uh that that they were having really kind of tense conversations with some of their colleagues [laughter] we have examples in this piece of people going to their bosses confided in them about really\nPersonal experiences of sexual assault um once you had to tell his employees to tone it down the political debates we're getting too heated to a broad spectrum but just showing that this was something\nThat really couldn't be avoided at work\nGoodness I mean it did it cause enough friction where somebody might want to quit or they're pushing and shoving or yelling\nWhat we heard a talk to one person for example she works at a a distribution center in New Jersey and she said she really had to her tone as a group of men in front of her were walking into work and trying to kind of\nReally get into this and she felt she just didn't want to engage with some people had to try to suddenly redirect the conversations their tongue not engage because they just knew that they didn't want to have a heated conversation at work\nThat that's that's almost like Thanksgiving dinner right ... at at work avoid religion politics things like that\nFor a long time this is politics have stayed out of work for a number of people told us that they do but it's it's no wonder possible that you do bring it to the office\nThat the issues that you're you're discussing outside of work of course are going to become a into the workplace and one person I spoke with made a point that we don't we don't have a third place for these discussions anymore that there's home and there's work where we spend a lot of our time so of course these conversations are going to come up when you're talking with your colleagues even if you prefer for politics to stay out of it\nAnd I thought it was interesting too I think it was um a PR group in a like New York and San Francisco and there's actually a memo that went out reminding employees that they had like a handful of free counseling sessions or something right\nRight this is just the company is called the Bateman group and offices in New York and San Francisco and what the company sent out a memo early last week just outlining the resources and benefit to the company had to deal with this uh and and what I thought it interesting that that particular company\nThat they set up a slacker them they'd had had to set up for the past year the flack room was called ... resistance\nAnd it was a police for workers there\nDo we engage in these conversations without talking out loud so if people want to have political conversations at work they could do it in this specific slack messaging room and if it didn't want to engage they didn't have to be there and so the person said about Fifteen employees were active last week talking kind of providing real time updates on what was happening and this was a good form for them to do it about\nThat well for me what you cut her Wall Street journal reporter he's written a piece titled the capital effect political debates shake up the work place I can imagine to some managers are no may not be worse than having to deal with politics of this type of a passion\nDetroit I think some manager said that they felt that there was just no place for politics at work I spoke with someone he's the CEO and president of a wealth management company near Philadelphia and he said that he had to tell his his small team\nThat there really is just no please for political bickering network he's often telling them hey Mr Smith is on the phone he's take care of him he's the one who paid your salary enough talk about politics here so some have taken kind of hard line approach like that\nUm I think others are a little bit more unsure about what to do some I spoke with said for instance that they're going to see what happens this week to determine how they respond to want to see how their employees feel before they determine the next steps\nUm but but one one executive I spoke with said that she found the best policy\nTo be just having an open door just try and she said it's important for\nCorporate leaders to have an open open open door open ears open heart she wanted them to just listen to employees to be there if they did have concerns or wanted to talk about politics and then we'll go from there\nHow much of this boils down to gender battles\n[noise] well I think you can't separate them I mean I think that these are these are ... these are gender issues that but I think but we we heard on on all sides of this they were men kind of come into twenty support saying we're there to help you were there to support you\nAnd and so I think we talked to some people in the story for instance who felt that they did not feel that a judge Kaplan I was getting a fair shake in this and that they were having those conversations so I think it really\nCross gender lines across guy economic lines it was something that this was a very personal debate for a lot of people and and it of course played out at work where we spend so much more time\nWhen he's chip Wall Street
