education center and saw what was happening on nine eleven so\nSo that was my um\nMy pre cognitive or premonition dream it wasn't specifically about airplanes or buildings but it certainly was a the you know an a very apocalyptic event that or or life changing and world changing event\nAnd later I learned that this was there were many people around the world who had a nightmare as some more much more specific than mine but that very morning that this happened\nSo there there is my daughter had more than those two we didn't know what you're saying yeah we didn't know what it was bruised but ah

me with what the card was and a\nWet well above chance we would get the the suit right we would get the sometimes the number or the or the ... you know whether it was a king or jak face card\nA very often we get we get it a right to the to the point where it would make my dad upset because he was a very practical carpenter a blue collar guy no nonsense and he let us do it for a while and then once we had got a few hits he'd say okay that's it stop it\nNo more yeah he did he said when dad said stop if we had to stop or in my my mom you know so I had a special kind of relationship with my mom dealing with that and that she's the one that I think really cultivated\nIt and I I that's where I got it from it ... it wasn't for my dad I got the story telling thing from my dad that's how I
