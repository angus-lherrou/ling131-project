{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KNST", "content": "The book is from Nineteen twenty seven it becomes a kind of a best seller and a lot of people\nA lot of people in Europe and America read the book and get interested in thinking about their dreams as somehow predicting the future and you know I sometimes give talks about this in different places and I always have audience members come up to me I always have people emailing me saying oh I'd had dreams like that [noise]\nUm so you know it seems to be a fairly common experience actually that people in dreams seem to get glimpses of things that than ... than a than happen in real life\nAnd then you have experiences where people are not sleeping there not dreaming and they happened in a while they're awake at time slips or day job blue or were they seem to be in some other reality and then they come back to this one side of the audio ... what's ... how do you how does that fit into the framework that you explore in this book\nYeah yeah exactly I talk about some of the experiences as well so in that chapter six um\nAnd then a little bit in the chapter on cs Lewis I'm as well and then I have a chapter on Madeleine L'Engle right who's the the famous writer of wrinkle in time just recently a movie made of that\nOf that book but she talks about time slips um and and time travel um and so on and some of her books [noise] so yeah how do they make sense of that um\nWhat time is not linear right my like my president could be somebody else's future\nYeah well for sure I mean I think one thing that one thing that done picks up on his as you say that Einstein has a new way of talking about what time is which is really\nCounter intuitive and weird right I mean before Einstein people thought about time as just linear as something that just flowed out of uniform rate right we we have a sense of prime flowing we have this kind of intuitive sense that time flows forward\nUm in fact so you know Einstein had a number of counter intuitive things to say but one of them was that\nOf the ways that we experience time has probably just an illusion and the product of the limitations of our own consciousness that Einstein's equations for for the universe really lay out something that looks a little bit different but they really lay out a universe\nThat could be called a block universe\nUniverse that already exist\nSo um you know all locations in the universe and all times in the universe I'm already exist and they're all laid out in this big block\nWe are we are kind of a passing through [laughter] passing through that that block right are we occupy a little portion of that block but every moment in our past in in our in our president and in our future and in the earth's future and in our son's future\nAnd and all of our descendants future's all of those moments are already laid out in the block at least according to the\nThe laws of physics um and and this is actually discussions to discuss if anyone wants to look at it it's disgusting my book but you can also look at Brian Greene's books he's a professor of physics at Columbia He wrote a new book called the fabric of the cosmos where he talks about this kind of block universe so I'm\nDone and all of his own laid out what does that say about destiny and free will and yeah that sort of the questions that you as a professor religious studies back all the time\nYeah you're right you're right at least it lays out these big philosophical issues right like um faith in destiny and human free will and how free or are we to make choices on and so on [noise]\nUm so and we can definitely talk about those issues I mean one thing that done did um and some of the other people in my book did as they thought through these problems was they said you know I'm I think what ... what's happening is that\nYou know the fact that these future moments are already laid out somehow in the block universe makes it more plausible or makes it more possible that you know maybe it's\nDreaming could somehow lifted up above our\nThree dimensional world or I should their ... world right because we have three facial dimensions and one from Pearl dimension\nThe dreaming felt he said and lift up out of that block universe and peek into future moment and Don believe that um you know you're in a bit of Einstein here and a bit of you know him thin and higher they lost their um that's what he believed to happen and some other dreaming consciousness had an additional\nA degree of freedom an additional direction that it could move in\n'em and and if we can talk about that as an additional visual dimension or we could talk about that is now maybe consciousness somehow can move with an additional degree of freedom but that's what he thought and he you know everybody everybody's sleeping so had this degree of freedom and he also believe that everyone if they have kept a journal by their bed\nOf their dreams and he had a couple of recommendations for how to how to do a dream journal\nYou believe that if everyone did they would be able to see that all of all of our dreams contain bits and pieces of future events and how that I'm sort of mixed up together well\nI guess the central question for me about higher dimensions is are there people there and can they interact with us or is it us that's over there we're going to get into that uh those topics as well as near death experiences what to talk about science is a sharman remote viewers\nHow some of those ideas that we have discussed on this program before\nFit into our

but after historically partisan confirmation by the justice is made on answer\nUSA today's Supreme Court correspondent Richard Wolffe says cases challenging the timing methods funding and providers of abortion or headed toward the high court at a time when chief justice John Roberts and his colleagues are seeking a lower profile rich explain\nBasically what happened to the portion is a mostly Republican and conservative state legislatures passed restrictions in any number of different ways that can be restrictions on the timing or the method or the funding\nThat cetera and then mostly lower court some state courts more often federal courts\nUm strike down those restrictions not always sometimes they um um allow them but in more cases than not they strike them down based on what they understand to be Supreme Court precedent to those cases you know move along through the pipeline they take you know years and what the Supreme Court does frequently and what they are likely to do\nAs much as they possibly can and these cases has fought them down and say we're not going to take him what whatever that lower court case decision was at the federal circuit court federal appeals court we're going to let that stand [noise] so that's going to apply which one would think in a lot of cases including several that are now pending before the Supreme Court\nArts so the court has the ability to just say no to taking these cases but it points you can say now it seems like a good time\nAnd it's like well yeah another which the court gets um what's the number the court gets like eight thousand or ten thousand uh petitions a year to hear cases and it takes about one percent of those and\nIt says it takes her either important national issues that it feels it has to weigh in on or very frequently it that they are cases where circuit courts should the federal appeals court so the lover right below the Supreme Court\nAnd they they're sort of reaching all there are regional circuit courts and those are often split I'm two or three circuit courts may have ruled one way on an issue\nAnd one or two or three circuit courts have ruled another way I'm the same issue and and the Supreme Court says well we're going to have to resolve this show a lot of these cases come into court on abortion now not reflect those kinds of circuit split the court can easily say\nI'm for instance here's an example of court and there's a couple of cases that are pending now and these are cases that are not directly on the subject of abortion but they are directly on the subject of states that are trying to restrict funding to Planned Parenthood and the court could simply say\nUh the the way those courts have ruled stands people that just wants to avoid controversial topics for now they've just been through this ... confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh it was very tough on all sides and the chief justice John Roberts who would normally side with Kevin on the conservatives on the court\nAnd might be anxious to eager to take some of these cases in another year simply doesn't want to do anything that might be seen as partisan\n... we're speaking with USA Today Supreme Court correspondent ritual so to that point just clarify the Supreme Court can say uh we need more time to warm up or we want things to cool down and we'll take an abortion case when we for lack of a better phrase damn well please\nYeah they they wouldn't they wouldn't signal what they're going to do in the future they would simply you know a case goes through federal district court comes out one way or another dog goes to the federal appeals court comes out one way or another\nLet's say because it's often the case that anti abortion plaintiffs those bringing the case\nOr want to go to the Supreme Court and say hey he you know we want to ... a a a twenty week limit on abortions or we want to outlaw a certain type of abortion and the second trimester or we want to outlaw\nAbortions that are undertaken touch a particular reasons like the ... or the disability if the fetus the court the Supreme Court only gets involved that says All right we're going to hear that case not because it's interesting\nBecause it basically has two because lower courts are ... of course ledge because legislatures in court you don't know what to do because there's a conflict between appeals courts and\nThat doesn't happen very often I mean the last major abortion case that the court took a on the subject of the actual medical abortion as opposed to things having to do with like you know harassing\nPeople outside clinics or something like that was back in two thousand and chef and it had to do with partial birth abortion and then in two thousand and six team just a couple of years ago
