papers on my website Go check it out and tell me what you think that I think the answer the question is yes I think is the world's first example of an architect using his own to him as a blueprint for monuments\nAnd thank you for the call Joe and that paper is underneath the latest papers the second one listed over on my news website\nAnd one last question from Twitter before we had to the break this is from dino and do you know says are there any other pyramid in central and South America that carried the same traits as the ...\nTraits meeting\nThat's just what it says in the winter we don't know yeah um\nI I assume there would be a couple of things I Do know is referencing your one would be size in orientation or to true north and may be uh something astrological ah within the alignment\nWell let me let me put it this way so I think\nI you know I've I've watched a documentary or which is intriguing they're basically saying is that all these monuments are lining up a across the globe and I find that fascinating I and I don't know how to explain it\nThat is true that would definitely suggest that master plan that you know people were coordinating this this this is building activity and of course that's what Graham Hancock\nOr has been writing about four years and uh so I I think it's possible yes but just specifically some of the trades I Can't really comment because I don't know enough about it\nWell let me help you with this idea when we look at the the tops of the the the pyramid in Mexico in Mexico city and the mind structures throughout Guatemala and Honduras\n'em and believes that the tops of these pyramids there's always something there\nWhat about the top of the great pyramid is what do not not the top top but could there be chamber or something and the at the upper levels\nYeah well I think so I think that could be that that could be a space uh that I'm connects that connected to the summit\nEr and of course the summit itself I'm you know like I said before John a\nDrop off ... has provoked pose that the summit of the great pyramid was not at peak was basically a virtual top and a and it would have been a you know as fear and it's interesting that the diameter of this year is a meter\nOr it's a very interesting a very interesting theory or and others have proposed similar things there's even a hero cliff I think I'm\nA this was first mentioned by a stitch Jeannie in a night in the Nineteen Seventy one book by Peter Tompkins that there was this fear on top of the great pyramid so not if you're a media and by the sphere so yes I I think I think those theories out there I but I don't know how you would otherwise prove it I'm\nNo you've got to anomalies and a and one is clearly defined at roe one Ninety six and do you do have a ratio there could there be a chamber at the very top\nI I think so\nHow big would it be\nI'm looking at those upper rose or the dimensions of the pyramid at that high um how big could that chamber be\nI think a chamber like that would be maybe\nNo more than five feet something like that five feet by age and height I'm saying right you know\nMaybe maybe a five six courses or something like that\nUm and they would be it would be difficult to detect it may be on a on the ... and especially if you have a grand gallery in between which you know the last year ... was from the queen chamber so I think in order to protect these spaces you have to put the place up in a in the uh in the or the chamber of that's off limits right\nNow yeah and how would you how would you detect more than one chamber will the new one scan show multiple chambers that were stacked up on top of each other\nYeah maybe not if they're stocked up maybe not but ah they might not be stocked up um they could be you know like the one for example I mentioned that uh Rudolph guns and bring a is suspecting that will be a chamber that's in the southern part of the pyramid maybe close to the face\nYou know so they may not be stocked up I'm a one way you could do\nWhat you mean by putting the places that knowledge that we talked about you know the one that was on fire investigated it's up on the south it's on the north side\nYou know the north east corner right\nNorth east corner it's a fairly sizable states you know I mean I I don't know how big the plates are but I Wonder if you could set up the place up there and then you might be able to actually the sun the different chambers it made it might be possible\nHow expensive is it to perform these ... studies\nIt seemed like it wouldn't be that expensive because you're just placing the the wage throughout the pyramid and then of course running a computer system it's not like there was any efforts excavations or right right it's not that expensive but\nYeah they have I think they've already spent the main capitals already spent basically you know making the plate\nAnd then you know that you have to pay the people to experiment I'm guessing multiple a million dollars I think maybe hadn't and Marion or something like that to do this project I'm a and most of that money has maybe already been spent and now like you're saying you know and now it's just you know you just to repeat studies\nUm but I think if you do any kind of invasive a project or in a project like this is spending several million dollars a which if we want to go back to the things and things that is a kind of money that will need for a project like\nThis is coast to coast am host Jimmy church it's been an all Egypt the great pyramid evening here going
