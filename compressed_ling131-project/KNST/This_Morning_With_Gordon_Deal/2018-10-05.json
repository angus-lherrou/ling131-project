that kind of skepticism that is productive\nI I think can become a great exploration and a wonderful adventure for people\nProbably could win no new Juno gr Mitchell before he passed on\nYeah very well regarded worked with him for years wonderful person Edgar said in the interview I did\nWith him for death makes life possible that you know I mean I was really interested in his story because he was a person who had been fighting in Korea he had been a test pilot and he talked about you know being on those aircraft carriers where\nWhen they would go off on a mission and then they had to come back and find the aircraft carrier in the middle of the ocean it was like a needle in a haystack\nAnd so for him that was a scary moment when he got in the Apollo capsule and went to the moon he said you know there was plenty of space on the moon and it was hard to find\n'em but you know his thing that he said that I thought was so wise is that he felt that was much more important\nTo live a good life and to be a good citizen I'm to be loving inclined toward other people than it was to spend a lot of time worrying about what's going to happen next and I just thought that you know it's a powerful notion and he was a great man\n... where do you have evidence to prove that there's life after death if you are like quarter law mhm ... challenged ducts which challenged could you prove that there's life after\n[noise] so this would make a great reality show and I love you Ina courtroom let's do it [laughter] so you have a judge and a jury\nAnd you have people representing different points of view on controversial topics so take this one you know life after death and you have these people arguing their various position\nWhich witnesses that come and go\nExactly giving their own um personal testimony based on their experiences\nWheel in the corps would write a letter\nAnd then you get into this question of what would shift to people's mind about\nThat question and is it the

people or is it the personal experiences that somebody's reporting you know I had a conversation with my departed dad and he told me to go to this closet and find something\nYou know that's really persuasive for people much more than accumulating a lot of data I think\nI think she'll to Dr Merrill Lynch which were those were going to take phone calls next hour\nAbove ... let's talk a little bit Marilyn and the time we have remaining here about consciousness and how important it please which rule but employees with ... what would you first of all say consciousness ...\nWell I think again we can have many definitions for me it's been about our awareness and also our lack of awareness of what we are not aware of so by that I mean when I first talked about Thomas ... book on paradigm shifts\nWe live in a paradigm or a world of you and the interesting thing to me about world views is that we don't even know that we have them\nAnd yet they're the most important thing that shapes her experience so it's like we're walking through life with these colored glasses on and it\nIt Shapes Our experiences and so we can't see those things that lie outside of our expectation\nAnd I think part of the process of becoming aware\nIs becoming aware that we're not aware\nAnd that we have what's called an attentional blindness for example we are primed to perceive those parts of the world that we expect to see and if we don't expect to see them we simply don't see them and I think that that is a remarkable\nUh aspect of what our consciousness is all about it's a lot of a functioning on auto pilot at the unconscious level and to the extent we can\nYou know turn the light on what those experiences are and what Shapes Our awareness where are we placing our attention that then offers

intelligence it is self correcting\nIs reflective and so you can go into a rain forest and\nSee that as consciousness manifest in the forest because every ... is filled with life and with that intention to manifest life and so I I Do believe that consciousness as something much bigger than our individual brain\nI don't think it's an ... phenomenon of the brain and at the same time I think the brain is kind of like you\nKnow the radio that is taking the signal and so if you destroy the brain you may destroyed the radio it doesn't mean you've destroyed the consciousness or the\nIt keeps
