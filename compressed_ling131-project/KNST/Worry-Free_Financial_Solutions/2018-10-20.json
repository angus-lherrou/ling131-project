All right that I had that you know be\nPaying to stay in other words what I read there is that they do it if they don't have to report that to the state\nOr hang on hang on hang on I think you might be focusing on the wrong thing here it sounds like you're focusing on trying to avoid additional taxes additional Medicare expenses\nWhat I'm more concerned about is do you have sufficient income to sustain your lifestyle and will you have sufficient income to sustain your lifestyle over the rest of your combined lifetimes of you and your wife that's much more important issue isn't it\nYeah so have you done that analysis to determine that\nI haven't really done it out but I think I I'd probably have enough money stashed away that it probably going to be an off whether or not you know depending on how long that naturally and how long to wipe it\nSo I think it would make sense to do that calculation uh let me just do real quick back of a knack for what's the total amount of money that you and your wife have between savings accounts investment accounts for retirement accounts IRAs et cetera add it all up what's it worth\nA probably a couple of metal I get\nAnd how much money do you and your wife spend on a monthly basis\nUh probably three thousand bucks maybe\nTotal all end all expenses\nAre yet probably about three grand aren't\nThen I Would agree with you based on two million dollars in savings and investments and only spending thirty six grand a year and we haven't even talked about Social Security yeah I Would agree with your urine find economic shape\nWhich means you don't need to be taking a lot of investment risk\nAnd therefore I don't think you need to be getting terribly exotic with your investment strategy I mean although it's possible that you might get a higher return from a treasury strip or a a inflation protected bond\nA relative to a bank CD I don't know if the difference is all that worthwhile relative to the complexity these securities\nAnd the lack of certainty you have about them and understanding of how they work compared to ordinary banks CDs the difference in the yields is not going to be all that significant and I don't think material enough for you to bother doing something different\n[noise] All right I was wondering if it would have any effect\nI don't think it's going to be material enough that this is based on a thirty second conversation I'm having with you if we delved deeper\nOr I could certainly argue that all of the choices you've mentioned are paying very low rates of interest in today's economy as you know and there are other strategies that are worth considering that can dramatically improve the potential for higher rates of return\nIs it necessary in your case not really not relative to the amount of money you've got and the amount of income you need not really necessary is it perhaps desirable well maybe that's up to you\nUh so I could argue that you should meet with one of my colleagues we have an office in Cherry Hill not far from you in Mount Laurel where we could go into all of this detail and show you the alternatives that are available to you\nBut that's entirely up to you if you just kept doing what you're doing\nFinancially speaking I think you and your wife would be fine\nOkay okay do you take the oath in Cherry Hill New Jersey right\nYes it is and if you like I'll put you on hold and get your phone number will connect you with our colleagues in a Cherry Hill and ah go from there okay be fine\nAll right Neal I really appreciate your phone call thank you very much you can do it Neal dead and call triple each plant wreck and it's really important that you put your investment strategy and the proper context why bother adding complexity to your life tax complication to your life\nGetting into securities you're not really familiar with are accustomed to when the material differences in results are really not going to be there when\nIn fact you might need to be addressing a totally different question instead which is am I going to be able to sustain my current lifestyle for as long as I in my spouse may live that's the more important fundamental question and you want to make sure you have that answer nailed down first\nThanks so much for your phone call you know I'm really glad to see folks so intently focused on retirement and engaging in planning will you have enough money that's really the key question isn't it I mean if you were Bill Gates I don't think he'd care very much\nWarren Buffett I don't think he really needs his Social Security check right so for them it's not a big deal for you and me so how do you know if you're going to have enough\nI Want you to find out by getting your free retirement review we will

to say you came out one day and you gave training to everybody and they're all on board I didn't hear anybody that didn't understand exactly what you were talking about um there are a few that may disagree with this or that but the truth is nobody understands the narcotics problem in Tucson better than the people who work at the counter and er Cox was\nOh I'm sure as I had somebody asked me this ... can you think some people are feeling oh I can continue to get high and do my thing because our cat will bring me back I'm safe\nSewing and maybe within a British got other experience with this but my experience with that is that was a story people were telling to try to justify why they were not issuing marking him\nTo police officers and I'll go step further and police officers if you're responsible business and you have an ADD in your business for people that have heart issues you ought to have march into if you're if you're a place where people gather today\nThan you should have ... as you don't need a prescription there's a standing prescription issued ... health services you walk into any pharmacy in for forty dollars you can walk out with mark and\nSo it's just like a fire extinguisher anything else you have schools out of all have it um it's it's one of those drugs where uh the downside of using it to zero and the upside is you save lives and so we really believe in it we curate art are cautious period\nPatrol officers all cheery it we have ... and patrol and the patrol officers being in their first were truly the first responder at these things and\nWe beat the paramedics because they don't know what's going on and it's important those seconds to make a huge difference between a Brady what's going on in the field with that now the still suffer are the stories bridging the success they were initially\nYeah I mean I don't have any any hard statistics on the number of of nor can um administrations we've done in the field that I Know that it has been used to have seen the uh the emails come through about it\nUm and yeah the officers are are grateful to have it because when they when they do encounter someone you know if this is a new a new thing that we're dealing with and we have to adapt to deal with it um it used to be when you encountered someone who was unconscious and possibly under the influence of something\nThe assumption was that they were passed out that right we're intoxicated uh we can't make that assumption anymore I'm and probably more likely than not it when you come when you encounter someone who's unconscious and passed out there and they're not breathing it's going to be as a result of an overdose\nSo um yeah we're we're very grateful to have it on as a matter of fact I just got a noted notice it was um we actually haven't had it for for a while it was back ordered from the state but we just got another shipment in and so will be\nA we had another round of officers go through a with our partnership with the center for 'em using the center for\nA urban health um they provide a more training for the officers are so we even have more people that are trained on it now and they're going to\nBe getting their their doses of a no oxygen here pretty soon\nYou know and I have to say a A R experience has been very positive I Do know very specific cases where we've made saves [noise]\nAnd and um this idea though that someone somewhere isn't abusing it in order to get high twice or whatever I'm sure someone is but we just don't run into that that's something we encounter and it's I think it's an excuse to do to to to avoid doing what's appropriate thing is there anything that\nEven so if that is occurring you know in in my opinion it's it's well worth still having it out there to save the people that we do um because it it is I mean you can go on the uh the website for as easy da chest dot Gov which has an opioid section which shows\nReal time real live data of how many doses of nor can had been administered throughout the state and how many had been dispensed and it is saving lives every single day\nOr their classes available for the general public to go and learn what to do and not to do when it comes to this yes and as I said the center for the center for urban house I'm so they have claws yes senora convention works also has availability interest is I think\nYou this is Stephanie ... she is the vice president of nursing services that Kodak and she and I partnered together to to um developed and present the training to all of the officers that that we did a few months back then Kodak has been a great partner with us in this\nWell thank you for joining us thank you nice to meet you too okay the other question I I was thrown at me [laughter] the ... the TV show the ... and we only have like forty five seconds left they killed off Rosie odonnell with another day of opioid\nHow do you feel so I watched it and I am and I think it's a great platform to talk about the problem but I was personally really really offended by the laugh track they had when Rosie o'donald so I was on screen daughter\nA show that she'd stolen a bottle locks and everyone laughed about it because that's exactly what the problem is and maybe we can talk about other than the other side of the break but\nJust a flippant way they treated that showed a real lack of sensitivity to the issues\nAnd uh I appreciate the fact that they want to address the issue I just think they probably needed people a little more experience than rapidly\nRight okay well when we come back I Want to I Want to talk with you about everything that's going on in the presentations that you do\nThere are grants there are there's access there is more than enough resources to cover the cost of your treatment so that should never be a reason that you don't seek services we've just been ... um afforded\nMore opportunity to focus on young pregnant women who are coming in showing themselves onto admitting that

because we have a whole clinic full of people who are going through what you're going through some of our employees or even in recovery and have worked the program and um gotten silver\nVery cool tell me more I talk about your program because I think it's important\nYeah so um as I said we started July first I'm In partnership with Kodak and uh so October first Martha three months that we've been ah we've been doing the deflection\nUm we've had ride around Ninety deflection which means I'm there have been Ninety individuals that officers have brought to the ... clinic for um for treatment for substance use disorder of awesome of of really any kind um it's not just limited to opioids\nUm so that's cool to the Kodak is is helping us with people that are addicted to meth and and other drugs as well um of those Ninety people about approximately sixty percent of them are still engaged in some form of treatment there\nUm which I think it's a really positive awesome number um we are still doing things like getting our our officers trained in motivational interviewing 'em to try and I get more people I'm engaged in services\nUm but I I I think that sixty percent is a really awesome number at this point um in terms of how many lives when you look at how many lives are saved\nAnd Stephanie correct me if I'm wrong but that's in line with the success rate for treatment it is general right it is can you tell them a little bit about the difference between not treatment versus just you know success rates versus regular treatment\nSure for persons who tried to go cold turkey just tried to quit using opioids success rate is somewhere between five and ten percent will actually be successful that success rate of persons who hair their treatment um with medication assisted treatment such as Suboxone or methadone\nWith a hero modification through group therapy individual therapy psychiatry\nA success rates are closer to sixty to Seventy percent on average I think it's around sixty three percent was the last study that was done so the chances of gaining sobriety and entering into recovering ... every go up on you mentally when you pair medication assisted

it's not a life long medication it is not a cure it is not a curative process it as a corrective process that allows you to let the psychosocial interventions take old allows your brain to heal from
