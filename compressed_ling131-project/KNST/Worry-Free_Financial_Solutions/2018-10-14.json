{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KNST", "content": "In a three and a half hour car ride you can be in Seventy degrees you know whether and and pine trees in lakes and and just not what most people imagine about Arizona\nI'm well that market actually peaks in the month of September\nAs as the highest because everybody went up when it was really hot and they ... you know say hey this is so cool that's why something and and so it's kind of funny just\nTracking those markets and understanding the demographics of of the market and then you know you you also have to factor in the price point and we've talked about this you know read repetitive Lee over the years\nThe million dollar price point is is just not moving I mean last month we sold five percent of all the million dollar homes which means Ninety five percent they're not so\nWell and that's not a very pretty picture if you're trying to sell your home and you have a five percent chance of success and in Ninety five percent chance of failure you I mean there's gotta be something and and the question then I'd like to ask people is\nWho is the buyer of your home describe your buyer\nI mean where do they work in Tucson where the median family income is forty seven thousand dollars that they can afford a six thousand dollar a month\nA house payment and you know with three air conditioners on your home I mean you're looking at a six or seven hundred dollar a month air conditioner electric bill and and the property taxes are going to be you know north of ten thousand dollars and and that's no longer detectable\nSo I mean there's a lot of factors that that are kind of going into that but then I kind of say you know who you're by you're used to be\nYour by are used to be the guy that owns the tire store\nThe guy that owned the movie theater the guy that on the convenience store they you know the local small business owners\nAre the ones that the banks just don't have a place for any more because all the lenders are bundling up their loans and selling them off on the secondary market\nAnd they bundled him you know by credit score by by a loan to value ratio by downpayment there's all kinds of things and they don't have a box for these self employed business I was at ... am I right terrier mhm yeah that's right\nSo um this is where there's a there's a huge opportunity and that is what this conference that I'm having here in Tucson is called a note business builder and you can go to the website and no business builder dot com but these are uh I have over a hundred\nPrivate investors from all over the United states flying into Tucson for a two day conference and then we have a a three hour little class on Saturday which is\nThis is something I'm doing that's new this year I've had several people come in the past and they were like oh my God it was drinking out of a fire hose and I just didn't feel like I could you know I didn't know where to start so this year I said I'm going to take and and they have a three hour session and we're just going to go and make a flow chart\nAnd every single box if if you don't have a name on it you know we'll have a name or have a date when we're going to have a name and and and then let's do this first and then let's look at what we can outsource maybe somebody is really good at doing that task and they could do it for\nFour or five people and then that part has done for everybody and then you know you you kind of team up with people because all of us do marketing\nAnd investors in real estate agents are are very much a you know we do the same things the only difference is a real estate agent does it for someone else\nInvestor does it for themselves what it's all the same stuff right your marketing you're converting you know the person and picks up the telephone raises their hand and says hey I'd like to sell or I'd like to by\nSomeone has to be there to answer that phone and and um and and respond to that email and and reach out to that person so it's just it's the same and the lending business you get leads that come in you meet with the people\nAnd then they think well we'll think about and you've got to have somebody that's following up with them and and keeping them on the hook and it's like hey are you going to do this or not\nAnd and um so it's it's a process that's not in any event and this this um training that we're we're doing is\nIs really gaining in popularity I I think in the investments space the real estate note industry is is growing at a faster rate\nThan than any other real estate investment there's people that are just getting fed up with rental properties I've got a lot of people in her seventies that\nOwn rental houses for I've got some teachers that have a spreadsheet full and every summer when they had a break from school they would go get part time jobs doing whatever they could find\nAnd take the money they earned over the summer and put it down by a by a rental property next year they do the same do the same they ended up and they said you know what teaching was our passion\nBut we knew that it would never pay for the lifestyle that we want it to enjoy so the rental property was the lifestyle and that that the job at the school was are passionate so I mean if you can do that I have a a job and that's the that the job that I have I absolutely everyday love what I Do\nAnd helping people you know especially buyers that the\nBanks turned down these hardest working people in the United states\nIt's I'm self employed business owners I don't know a single self employed business owner that works for forty hour week I can I can tell you I I I talked to a jury sent many times at seven eight nine o'clock at night um I talked to mow it nine o'clock at night and he's three hours ahead of me [laughter]\nSo um yeah yeah yeah and and you know what that's why you're successful that's that's why you know people are successful they don't have an eight to five o'clock punching job where they just get off work and quit and and um and it's just unfortunate that those are the folks that can't get a loan\nThey have the largest down payment and then when you look at the loans that are being approved\nAnd and you know the the people with minimal down there asking the either they have a bond or or I I'm I'm I'm payment systems program for the down payment they're asking the sellers to pay the closing costs are asking sellers to\nRepair everything on the house because they don't have any money for any repairs risk costing most sellers\n... percent to sell their home\nAnd and um but yeah a person with twenty percent or thirty percent down is being denied for a loan when a person that doesn't have enough money they had a guy called me the other day and asked me if you could write a promissory note for the earnest money\nWhich means you're going to write on a piece of paper that he owes me a thousand dollars [laughter] no further Ernest Moniz if you don't have a thousand dollars you got no business buying a house I mean what are you under the water heater breaks\nRight so um anyway I ... I don't mean to get on a soapbox but this this opportunity that exist\nOr my mother is here from North Dakota\nAnd my mom's eighty four years old and she's still goes to Columbus and lupus every winter she'll be eighty five in January and and\nYou know what she would not be able to do that if she didn't have real estate notes because the money she used to get from interest at the bank at four percent\nIs now is zero point two percent ... so the you know she is basically making a fraction of what she she used to make and and it's the real estate notes that I've been able to enjoy it better retirement lifestyle that's what I'm sharing this weekend with with all the people that come to my conferences\nThis is how you can live a better retirement this is how you can sell your home faster for more money with the least amount of a hassle this is how you even if you're a buyer you can get a home that no one else will let you have\nIf you're a neighbor of one of our investors or you're going to love that we just sold our home but probably the highest price of the neighborhood which is going to drive everybody else's you know ... right so so I mean there's somebody who the losers are the only loser is really the bank\nThat turn down the buyer and the first place\nAnd they did it turn them down necessarily because they weren't qualified or were bad credit risks as I said earlier and we've had people with eight hundred and eight men middle eats in in a credit score and and they don't fit the box you know of the of the bank\nSo I'm Jerry where do you see this opportunity going as interest rates creep up we were talking about this right before the show um you know if you had to guess right now in two years where do you think interest rates are going to be\nUm I Would say you know six percent probably a good number for a maybe a little bit higher than that but I don't think my mind\nI think the the next four to six months will be interesting for the real estate market a nationally take his side of the big markets like San Francisco New York cetera but um I think consumers are getting a spit mean in headlines we're seeing headlines every day about realistic\nAnd every journal and that you know obviously that whereas on confidence and so um I think a lot of it you have to re pass line one two and three to get to me to the article right ah and most people don't do that and that is a I think we're the concern lies um that plus rising interest rates may pause\nMay slow down this real estate market for a little bit I think in the next year it'll be fine\nYep me too I agree\nUm thanks for listening this is Tucson home solutions on ... will be back next week\n\nFrom the region will studio your local area reason well dot com is fantasy seven and I are radio

they had said was in an aggressive stock market strategy now they were in the early sixties and looking to retire this next year and now yes the performance in their account was fabulous\nAbsolutely no denying that just look at the rally that we've had over the last ten years now\nBut what about the future what about the risks they needed this money to be there to provide an income in the future and that income needed to last a long time\nSo we were able to come up with a plan that took a little bit from their four one K. and moved it into safety into one of our safe money programs\nAnd we found a solution that was able to provide them with certain guarantees with no downside risk on that safe portion\nAnd then at some point when they decided to retire received that mighty income replacement that can come from your savings and at the end of our planning which does take a few meetings they were relieved and you could tell that the burden of worrying about the stock market day in and day out was lifted\nThey now we're able to finally relax a little bit and look forward to some of the more exciting aspects of retirement\nSo if this sounds like something that interested you

to worry free financial solutions with your host me even further ego\nWelcome back to worry free financial solutions I'm Nathan fritter Rico safe money retirement specialists\nHave you considered why we have money in the first place [noise]\nWhat's the purpose of money\nWhy do we go to work why\nDo some of us try to save or maybe put money in a four O. one K. if we have one or an IRA or other savings accounts some of us clip coupons we buy used and so forth what's the purpose of all this\nIs it just to buy a fancy car or a bigger house for some people maybe but that's not the true purpose of money when you really think about it the reason we save and have money is all about security\nSecurity in the ability to live the lifestyle that you want the freedom that comes from knowing your needs are met\nSecurity is the foundation to a happy and worry free life you've probably heard the phrase money doesn't buy happiness well that's absolutely true however money does buy security and that can provide comfort and peace of mind\nSo for retirement planning your financial security should become a primary issue and this is what Mayfield financial here in Tucson is all about\nOur retirement planning methods are designed with meeting your security needs first and foremost\nAnd we accomplish this goal through careful planning tailored to you which is founded in what we call our safe money strategies for that portion of your portfolio and your money that you need to protect and keep secure\nSafe money provide you with a peace of mind and knowing that your central needs are covered\nAnd when combined with Social Security will provide you with lasting income you can't outlive and can keep you ahead of inflation you know a lot of people ask me why is safe money the key to establishing this foundation of security\nWell for one a safe money portfolio cannot lose money to any stock market volatility that's right it can't lose money to the stock market\nSafe money also offers guaranteed growth options it has beneficiary transfer availability it can be held in an IRA or a ... or even just regular saving money\nAnd if you're over fifty nine and a half and plan on still working most ... allow you to roll over your retirement money into a safe money IRA\nThe key of having safe money is that financial security that it can bring to your retirement plan\nNow we don't normally like to compare safe money to stock market money or risk money because they're two separate things they're designed for two separate purposes and we're not trying to pick one against the other\nSo to save money still offer growth absolutely yes it does well safe money is no get rich quick schemes it does offer security and stability and growth which is exactly what you're looking for as you retire\nIf you're looking for more information on this save money and what I'm Talking about today and you want to know more we make it easy for you we have a book here and it's called safe

stock market still is one of the most powerful tools available when it comes to growing your money there's absolutely no doubting that however that requires an ability for you to ride out the ups and downs that come with it\nBecause Wall Street is one of the absolute worst places to keep your money when you need to protect it\nWhich is usually about five years before and any time after you retire\nYou see Wall Street isn't in the safety business they never were and they never will be when Wall Street rises and when it goes up that's what's called a bull market it's a stair step up at inches higher and higher and higher this current bull market is now officially the longest in us history\nIt's easy to get caught up in the excitement the games the trillion dollar market caps however

solutions with your host these in front of Rico\nWelcome back to worry free financial solution I'm Nathan fritter Rico a safe money retirement specialists\nAnd most of us if not all of us have heard of Mr Warren Buffett who perhaps is one of the greatest investors of our time\nWith all of the talk about the future of the stock market and what seems like every day new headlines that can create what amounts to an incredible seesaw of stock market gyrations\nDo you think that Warren Buffett tears which way the market goes probably not but you might think perhaps he's rich enough that it doesn't matter while on the outside that might be true after all he is worth about eighty billion dollars\nBut that's not the reason why he doesn't care what happens in the stock market you see Warren doesn't play the stock market game like most think Warren's approach to investing is different all he cares about is the value in certain companies war and wants to buy dollars for fifty cents\nFrom an early age Warren has had a knack to see opportunities where others did not his perspective on investing is different than most on Wall street Warren is all about the long term and Wall Street well they're very much about the short term\nSo well none of us will likely have the luck or the fortunes of Warren Buffett a lot can be learned from his investment ideas and his approach to managing money Warren is frugal here at Mayfield financial we see hundreds of clients come through our doors at our office here on Broadway\nMost of them are either retired or getting close to that time in their lives were that almighty paycheck from a career is ending where now new sources of income must step in to fill the gap\nAnd provide the income needed to have a stable worry free financial future\nIn almost every case I see the clients that are on the best financial footing have a couple of things in common first they have little to no debt\nAnd if they do have any it's usually very small or maybe it's just what's left on their mortgage by keeping expenses low not living a lavish lifestyle and focusing on what is important in a central\nThese clients are able to stay debt free and by doing so when they are in retirement\nThey get to reap the rewards debt can drag you down into the woes of misery because it will eat away at your ability to safe for the future and why is that well that's because interest never sleeps Warren even in his great wealth still clipped coupons\nWhy that is because it's in his nature to be frugal and to not spend where he doesn't need to\nThe second treat my clients have been where they're able to enjoy their retirement and be able to be financially worry free comes from one of Warren Buffett's rolls of investing Warren says there are two rules to investing rule number one is never lose money and rule number two\nNever forget rule number one this rule can easily be applied to retirement planning and is one of the hallmarks of what Mayfield financial is all about these real things simple never lose money sounds pretty reasonable to me\nNow well Warren Buffett has broken this real before as there are many times where his investments have gone south he always tries to abide by this rule and that is to never lose money\nThe second part of why my clients here at Mayfield financial knows that I see are able to have a worry free financial retirement so the first part is they're able to remain debt free by their frugality and the second part is to never lose money so what does it mean to never lose money\nIn retirement planning this is sometimes referred to as the power of zero or the power of zero losses which simply means that for a portion of your portfolio you are going to want it to be positioned in a way that provides you with certain protections\nThis is your nest egg after all and you don't just leave that uncovered for the taking you keep it close you protected\nAt Mayfield financial for over twenty five years we've helped our clients harness the power of zero\nYou know jet used to always say on this program it's not what you earn but it's what you get to keep\nWell we all want to have our money grow which we still do for our clients the Mayfield difference is that any recommendation we make for are happening on Wall street that's because these safe money strategies are a completely different breed of retirement planning one that Wall Street's simply overlooks\nIf you want to know more about the safe money strategies and about the power of zero losses then request a copy of our book it's called
