{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KNST", "content": "And our radio listeners are going to have the opportunity to\nGet in for a far less a lower price than the out of state of people are paying so I don't want to announce it on the air in case anybody streams my broadcasts and here's an so um if you would just um if you're interested in finding out about note investing\nAnd yeah and you're a loyal listener of this show just call me at three one for sold\nA three one for a so wealthy and uh my name's Bob ... and I wouldn't be glad to give you a code to type in and by the way a hundred percent of the proceeds from this conference go to the make a wish foundation as they have for the past and years mhm I tend to you're doing this so I'm One of the things I'm\nA I Walter Wolford is one of the smartest guys I Know with them investing and Ross IRAs and very small balance accounts that you're only allowed to put five thousand or six thousand five hundred dollars into a year\nIt's actually fifty five hundred if you're under the age of fifty and then over the age of fifty isn't there was a thousand dollar makeup that you can put in six thousand five hundred well how many home loans can you buy six thousand five hundred dollars or you know not a lot what do you do with six thousand five hundred dollars to earn on this is your retirement money I mean what what can you invest in\nAnd Walter has a a a presentation put together we're actually going to do a live auction\nOr option on you know an option in an option is like a real estate contract but you have the right but not the obligation to purchase something so it gives you the ability to tie up a property worth hundreds of thousands of dollars\nFor a few thousand dollars a and then find a buyer that would pay a higher price and and make the profit without ever owning the property\nAnd then in the event that you can find a buyer\nUm you know the worst case scenario is is you ought not to to buy the proper diet and exercise right so an option is like a coupon for tide laundry detergent right you have on the coupon is how much you're going to save and what they had expires right so that's what you're doing is the right you're buying the right\nBut not the obligation to purchase a property\nAnd and therefore you can kind of tied up and then if the deal goes through fine if not they keep your option money so I mean this is a a really good way to just explode the value of a small IRA and an especially for those that are just starting they're very young they've got a lot of time to work\nI mean just think about it if if you could quadruple your money in the first year\nEvery time that doubles that's four times as much for the rest of your life new quadruple the endgame right right if you can just do it at the very first out of the chute so this is just one thing that we're gonna talk about that well they will will also be coming into the studio\nWalter actually doesn't get in until um uh it's three o'clock in the afternoon so um he\nAnd and he's going to leave before the the show a vote this time we're going to miss him he's been in here several times and he's always fun to have him but he actually has a a very short window he's only going to be here on Thursday October eleventh\nHe has a college class reunion that is on Saturday and he's waking up early Saturday morning a flying all the way back to Mississippi to go to class reunion buddies coming out here on his own dime to come help me raise money for make a wish and share his knowledge with with all of the people that that's great so and then\nI'm Quincy long is the owner of quest Iran trust company\nAnd this is the smartest man in America on self directed IRAs and just what you can and can't do in creative investing he is the only person I Know who's the license attorney as owned an H R Block a tax franchise for over Twenty years\nOpen up an IRA company he knows these laws inside and out actually seen him quote\nIRS tax code and then from memory [laughter] and and then it's like that's scary [laughter] but that's the guy I mean if you want to know what you can do a better yet what you know where you can't do yeah um yeah and and then put that with creative investing techniques I mean Quincy has um two\nPresentations one on each day on on October eleventh and twelfth\nAnd then the one of the highlights for me as as I said we we do this event every year for the make a wish foundation\nThis year our guest speaker from a make a wish is a little girl named ... told me\nAnd we actually got to send ... on a trip to watch the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade last year and and this will be the first time in ten years that we've actually had a child that we sent on a trip with the money from last year's conference\nTo come back and tell us about it this year so it's really really gonna be cool that is cool yeah\n[noise] and actually with the with the funds raised last year we were we were able to grant eleven which is this is just one and and you know it's just very very rewarding we've been very fortunate\nWe've sold over four thousand homes in Tucson this is just a way that we get back you know in the community and when we when we started our or when three team\nUm you know when when when is is went when three stands for and and the clients when both the buyers and sellers the company wins the buyers are the owners the agents and the and the staff\nBut also the community wins and that's that's the third piece of the puzzle that a lot of people tend to forget so this is just our way to get back in the community that has helped us to prosper so a lot of good stuff or my friend Kevin drop is coming in from Indianapolis\nUm he is buying homes between eight and twelve thousand dollars a two bedroom one bath home about eight to twelve thousand believe it or not you're either rent for seven hundred a month so just doing some quick math let's see twelve months seven hundred a month that's eight thousand four hundred you could buy a house in a year with the rent\nAnd and why aren't people doing this why you know and the answers they don't have eight thousand dollars they have seven hundred on their pay day and and that's what they have an and it's just amazing to me how many people in this country you know could one home and in less than a couple of years and and don't find a way to make it happen\nWow so Kevin is going to talk about wholesaling\nI'm flipping houses I'm turning them into rental houses or into real estate notes and just carrying the paper where you get paid every month without any of the maintenance for the phone calls or the taxes are insurance are liabilities that come with rental property\nSo Kevin is going to talk about that so there's my three out of state speakers and then Kelly importer um has been a friend of mine she this'll be the ninth year she only missed the very first year that would be the ninth year she's made the trek to Tucson from my annual events he's the longest ... attending member of a conference and a Kelly is going to do a\nA fun to or a host a panel and the title is ... and new ways you know the mistakes I made and then the and the things that I'm On a whole bunch of things I don't ever want to do it again so I'm going to be a really fun time\nAnd again anybody that comes it's going to be able to acquire a new copy of my book who needs to the bank\nAnd and it's not a a you know I don't go to the bank is just if the bank turns you don't don't stop there that's\nAnd and what this book is is is a very fast rebound every question anyone has ever asked me about private financing like what if they don't pay me like what if what if you know why can't these people get alone aren't they did beats and you know any question like that I've just a a twenty five chapters in the book everyone ends and a question mark\nAnd it's just answering those questions and I love it it's a really really fast read um each chapter three to four pages long\nMy mother was able and she's eighty four years old she proof the book from cover to cover and two and a half hours I'm not just reading a book looking for mistakes in it and two and a half hours so that's pretty good\nUm and then one more story real quick before we end a Denver um has a homeless problem and and so they built the storage containers little modular things that\nWould allow um homeless people to lock up their stuff during the day and and you know when they're out looking for food or or you know where's their stuff I mean and and you know here you are homeless and\nThen how do you protect all your things so they actually made these outdoor storage containers that were meant to give homeless people are safe place to store their clothing and possessions when they found out that the people were actually using them as homes there four feet by six foot cabinets and people were sleeping in them\nAnd and lots of other illicit activity there's there's cases at a prostitution rings we're in a poor by six container out so the city had paid thirty thousand dollars to install ten of these storage containers and\nNow they've just said you know what that was a complete failure we're going to pull them all back and we're not going to do that so that is not the answer just in case a [laughter]\nOther cities are listening exactly exactly\nSo uh that Jerry a son if you want to meet if you listen to us religiously Jerry son is going to pop his head and at the conference also and you know Jerry ... like when you're coming in oh I'll be there on on friday for sure okay and Garrett Lewis typically comes in and if you would like to see the presentation to the child\nOr over the west child even told me that

couple here at my office on Broadway and we have a nice view that overlooks the Catalina send the rink on mountains\nAnd one of the individuals was about to retire after a pretty extensive career at a large corporation here in Tucson\nThis couple had saved and save had very little to no debt and had a pretty decent size four O. one K. one that if they handled it correctly and properly planned it and protected it could keep their income in retirement at levels where they would feel completely comfortable for the rest of their lives\nThey also had an opportunity to receive a partial lump sum payout from their pension\nWhich is I Will admit getting a little bit more rare these days\nBut it was another sizable amount of money to add to their retirement accounts\nTheir current advisor who operated on a the only basis wanted them to move the entire four one K. and the lump sum pension payout into their risk based portfolio allocation strategy which was all based on Wall street funds\nNow why wouldn't this advisor offer any alternatives or look at some safe money strategies now some advisors do some advisors do a very good job at looking at the portfolio on a whole\nSome advisors only focus on the fees they only want to generate as much fees as they can and I'm not saying that that's a bad thing but I'm saying that that doesn't work in all situations\nAs you get closer to retirement it's important to kind of shift you're thinking a little bit you shift from your wealth accumulation phase to your wealth spending phase now this recommendation by their current advisor was it the best thing for them in their situation\nMost likely not so what do the client end up doing well here at Mayfield financial we were able to put together a plan that use part of this couple's retirement funds we took part of their four O. one K. and part of this lump sum payment from their pension\nAnd created in income plan that will guarantee and income stream not only to the husband but also to the wife in case something does happen to the husband one of the great things about being a retirement income specialist\nOne that doesn't use Wall Street risk was that no matter what happened on Wall street there was still a guaranteed amount that this couple would get each month and best of all this couple's income would grow each month to accommodate for inflation\nSo you
