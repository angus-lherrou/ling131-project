[noise]\nWe'll see where president ...\nHe would have voted I\nI had voted no\nRepair will not change the outcome is out there for withdrawing I thought\nThe senator has that right\n\nSenators voting in the affirmative Alexander ...\nThrough the tally you had heard the explanation fire from law Murkowski or a Republican from Alaska explaining that you've ... the Republican ... from Montana or where president he would have voted yet\nAnd already grant is opposed they would vote no but you allow a his vote to count I without him being here because it does not count\nShe is voting present and made that announcement and you heard the virus in and say the senator has that right that is something that does not happen very often in the United States Senate a marine used to be a tradition that was more frequently than it is\nA recently called airing a ... vote I Believe the last time it happened was was ... fourteen and it is a ... when you have senator sometimes of the same party sometimes of different parties that are on two different ends of the vote and\nFor one reason or another Senate or can't be there and and they find a partner to to pair with two are not change the outcome in any meaningful way and that is what we just saw him as you made the earlier point John\nUm it is a sense of of comedy a sense of unity that is the explanation that land Murkowski gave last night when she explained that she was going to do this threat Ryan\nAt least bit by bit or store um some of the the the ... nature of the United States Senate has really been tested over the last few weeks of his nomination\nWill keep in mind that leads you'll nature maybe back to where it needs to be on the Republican side I don't think it necessarily there between the parties are because of what has happened over the past few weeks it's going to take our time\nA Senator Flake is an open about that he wants to do something ...\nTo ... that process or a very ringing I guess you could call it a more film a camaraderie uh within the Senate certainly it's not it's a place where senator has legs who spoke about this on the Senate floor and also during one of the Judiciary Committee hearing White House wanted to be\nA that's something it's going to take\nAs I said you're a quite some time especially when you consider we have some mid term elections upon us for weeks I Believe from today\nAnd so the partisanship it's only going to increase in the weeks to come\nAs it stands right now with no senators change their vote we believe that vote tally is fifty to forty eight fifty yes votes to forty eight no votes that would come from\nOnce this vote is official Brett Kavanaugh is an associate justice on the United States Supreme court senator Danes Republican from Montana not voting is he attends his daughter's wedding Senator Murkowski explaining\nHer reason for voting present because of Danes apps and so they are still working through the vote tallies making everything official um before this vote is called but as we expected\nOr the votes appear to be there for Brett Kavanaugh that upcoming associate justice on the United States Supreme court but John there's a little bit of formality of a little bit of paperwork a few other things that happen to be done before a Brett Kavanaugh will be addressed as a Mr justice right\nWell that's right he of course still needs to take the oath he needs to get sworn in the White House indicating that could happen as early as this Monday but that is a federal holiday so perhaps we're looking at Tuesday when he's sworn in and of course you know this already chaired the Supreme Court\nA session this term the Supreme Court has already begun began the first Monday in October this past Monday so a ... soon to be called justice Kavanaugh will have missed much when he finally takes his place as the ninth justice on the U.S Supreme Court\nProbably will be able to catch up and it's too old so I think that Supreme Court justices have to take not just the one that you are\nCorrect that's correct and so uh we'll see a public oath that the uh\nBrett Kavanaugh will take that will likely be here at the White House if they follow the same form and function that we saw with Neil Gorsuch last year when he took his place and of course there was a big ceremony and the rose garden here at the White House when that took place I Would imagine we'll see the same thing take place for Brett Kavanaugh\nIt looks like or many of the Republican senators have started to walk around shaking\nHands I see Bob Corker the retiring senator from Tennessee shaking hands with majority leader Mitch McConnell who is um had a pretty broad smile for most of the days you can imagine getting this confirmation through it has not been the easiest road we're waiting for that vote total to be announced by the vice president who's presiding over the Senate Mike Pence\n\nLooks like he's got the gamble in hand which usually is indicative of an announcement about to be made by the presiding officer um other senators now now moving about as well as this vote is about to become official\nFifty yes votes forty eight no boats confirming Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme court\nAnd we continue to\nThe way to ... sometimes ... there is a little bit of of um formality and procedure that takes place with the Senate votes particularly on these\nAre very important ones you want to make sure every US Senator has just been counted everything's been counted the correct way before you\nYou drop that gamble but this was an outcome that was expected after those procedural votes yesterday in the announcements that came following from a senators are Collins and mansion and flake um the loan or a Republican no vote\nAre coming from Lisa Murkowski who is changing her vote to president Mr Carr indifference to Senator DeMint [noise]\nStrip Carper\nNo [noise]\n\nSounds like they are working their way through it was a senators are beginning to leave the floor so that would be an indication John that\nUh they believe their their work here is finished um regardless of of the outcome that they favored are opposed\nUm it has been interesting to watch Lisa Murkowski the Alaska Senator or the one Republican opposed the Kavanaugh a sitting at her desk watching all of this continuing to speak with colleagues are shaking hands with it looks like a West Virginia a Republican Shelley Moore capital or\nA Supreme Court justice who she felt would be hostile\nTo Robie waiting she announced her support for Brett Kavanaugh yesterday or that vote was considered key to his ultimate confirmation here's a little bit\nOf how Susan Collins explained how she got to her position of yes uh yesterday on the Senate floor\nDebate it's complicated further by the fact that the Senate confirmation process it's not a try\nBut they're fun nano legal principle that you press\nThe presumption of innocence and they are you there on my thinking and I can not a band and that\n\nThat was Maine Republican Susan Collins talking about the sexual misconduct allegations that have\nBeen leveled against Brett Kavanaugh he has a very defiantly a defended his name and said that those are unequivocal early not true uh brought out a second hearing a in front of the Judiciary Committee with him and uh a woman who made that accusation Christine Blasey Ford\n'em and ultimately you heard that they're having a big impact on on the ultimate decision of of\nOf ah Susan Collins the Republican from Maine now one of the other undecided up until yesterday was another a moderate Republican Alaska's Lisa Murkowski or the one Republican who ended up uh stating a negative position on confirmation and here's her explanation\nI Believe that judge Kavanaugh man [noise]\nGood men [noise]\nClearly and learning channel [noise]\nIn my conscience [noise] while I have kids out the end of the day with my conscience I could not concluded that he is the right person for the court [noise] time\n\nThat was the only nation about Alaska's Lisa Murkowski and again the one Republican who would have voted no she ended up changing that both the president to a pair it with Steve Gaines to Montana Republican who wasn't here but the outcome remains the same Brett Kavanaugh confirmed to the United States Supreme court by a bow to fifty\nTo forty eight is one of the narrowest votes ever for a Supreme Court nominee though we expected that to be the case that vote interrupted at times from\nProtests are shouting from the gallery but uh at the end of the day the Brett Kavanaugh will join this United States Supreme Court or you want to talk about close divisions in the United States Senate we have seen in recent opinions John ... a pretty closely divided Supreme Court as well but\nUh that uh soon to be justice Kevin Will will become a member of\nWill that's right over the course of the past few years we've seen quite a few five to four decisions by the U.S Supreme Court a largely breaking down along ideological lines of the swing vote over the course of the past I Would say\nAlmost two decades has been Justice Kennedy who's a place on the court of justice soon to be justice capital of will take the place of and uh it's thought that Kavanaugh will be a more solid conservative vote and so perhaps we will see that swing vote emerge\nA during his tenure on the Supreme Court which could be for the next few decades given how young years\nAnd we've talked about this during the confirmation process uh justices are difficult to predict sometimes you don't always know exactly how they will rule on on issues that we may not even be able to imagine a a pure before them\nWell that's right now justice a soon to be justice a cabin on al judge Kavanaugh he sits on the U.S circuit court of appeals for the DC circuit a he was asked quite a bit during his confirmation\nProcess how he would vote on numerous controversial items that may come up before the Supreme Court he refrain from answering those questions but he'll certainly be tested a and it will be interesting to watch his first year on the Supreme Court he will be confirmed as of course as early as this Monday\nBrett Kavanaugh confirmed that the United States Supreme court by a fifty to forty eight votes in the United States Senate a

out of town or has some family matter she's addressing today so she's not with you but I'm sure she's listening to us all Hi Sherry out there and uh but they were talking about\nWhat's going on in the special victims unit here at the ... office and a ... which is affected directly by our border so what what's going on trees you and your you know what's a trend you're seeing what kinda programs are are you putting forward\n[noise] you know one of the things he talked about is one of my rules as a prosecutor at the county attorney's office involves handling human trafficking cases and we talked about in our first segment the vulnerable populations that come across and\nIn some of what we see me the women and children that are coming across the border um and people\nTaking advantage of them because they are hoping to come here for something that is a better safer way of life and instead get stuck right back in a situation where they continue to be sold again and again whether it's in the form of labor trafficking or sex trafficking\n... I'm sure a part of what you do in your offices educated law enforcement two and a there'll be folks and groups about what's going on in our counties what's going on in our state and what's going on for a border you have a program that you do that an outreach program to educate our community to come to this\nSo and and I I'm sure it's in effect in and I well I Know Mr mcentire is also part of it there is the southern Arizona anti trafficking unified response network and it's an organization that are off as the Pima County attorney's office as a part of\nAnd it's law enforcement agencies and community groups here in southern Arizona\nAlong with prosecutors offices who do do their best to try to educate the public on what is human trafficking what does it look like um how can we identify it within our own communities what are the kinds of things that we're looking for and more importantly if you see it what can you do to stop it\nSo Saturn the organization that I was just talking about certainly is a collaboration of community members and law enforcement and prosecution organizations to help get that message out there\nI Know we've had that what you've got to be educated groups come down to educate law enforcement oh what what to recognize it and there's there are some clues and he's with recognized for citizens to if you see something say something that's the model here with our moments very\nUh but I'm sure some some of the your office to if you ... what you look for somebody looking for a child that's been exploited ... would you say they should be looking\nFor one of the most vulnerable populations that we see here I think at Pima County involves runaway juveniles and kids who are\nAt risk already kids who may be placed in group homes um kids who may be placed in foster care and what they're looking for is a sense of emotional support maybe even financial support and there are people who prey upon these young kids\nAre runways who are on the street who need to figure out how they're going to get their next meal or approached by um these creditors who are in a position of taking advantage of them\nPerhaps providing them what they need in the immediate sense and form of food or clothing or even shelter and the trade off for that and and the part that the victims end up suffering and having to get for that certainly is not worth it\nIn it and this is just not a Pima County attorney's problem or a law enforcement problem or this is a community problem that\nEvery comedian is country I Know you're three thousand plus sheriffs in the country and law enforcement beyond that are all affected I mean these kids are not just in ... county and the numbers are there going everywhere in the country right\nAbsolutely are yeah and it's something that certainly crosses the states um some of the and I'll say young women at obviously happens to young men children girls and boys alike\nBut this is the kind of thing where once they are part of her under the hands of someone who is controlling them they will not just be here in Arizona but Southern California into Nevada up into Colorado\nThis doesn't stop just within our state it's all over the place and people\nCan look for certain things and try to make sure that they do their part in reporting things that they notice to law enforcement you know one of the things I think here and Pima County and Sherry's been a bit\nThis as well as folks from the Tucson police department as educating parents on things that they can look for with their kids they actually have a program here and it's a class for parents to take on how to keep their kids safe on the Internet\nBecause let's face it in this day and age most of our kids do have\nA way of communicating and it's all on the Internet it's either going to be on Facebook or Instagram Snapchat or Twitter whatever it is that they're using and there are predators out there who are willing to try to take advantage of the kids\nAnd these classes there's not one scheduled currently I'm sure Sherry will advertise that I've heard her do that on the show in the past when the next one will be in one of the things that parents can do is just learned how to get educated on the things they need to look for what their kids social media accounts\nAnd make sure that there isn't a predator out there\nAnd I agree with you know we think of a child exploitation of human sex trafficking we think could email was not just about females as the males are involved just like emails you talk a little bit about that how much do you that\nI Know I don't see as many males as I Do females but we know that it's out there and one of the things with especially sex trafficking as\nWhether it's young adults or teens it's not the kind of thing that they want to talk about if you take a run away who has been on the street who is looking for a way to support themselves they come across someone who doesn't announced himself as a pimple or a predator but someone who's just going to give them a place to stay perhaps for a night or two\nAnd then in order to help make a little extra money whether it's a young man young woman boy or girl they then are\nTaking advantage of by this person they are either\nTwo different forms that we talk about um we have people who install force they actually employ force beatings things like that to get these kids to do whatever it is that they want them to do\nAnd you also have others who romance their way into the hearts of young women or young men by buying them things making sure that they have\nMoney um to go do things with and to buy a items they would never even been able to dream of before and once they have them in that environment where they feel as if they're going to be able to trust this person and the victims are then asked to do some pretty terrible things with other people", "show_name": "Worry-Free Financial Solutions", "year": "2018", "city": "Tucson", "day":
