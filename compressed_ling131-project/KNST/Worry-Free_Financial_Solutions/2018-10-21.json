{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KNST", "content": "But now we're actually going to see sustained increases in in mortgage rates that we haven't seen in in three decades and and and I think that's going to change the\nDynamic of why would I give up when I have that's a lower price mortgage why would I spent ten percent of my home equity and the cost of\nMoving and ... and and and selling and paying closing cousin in purchasing costs and everything when I can just stay in the house already have keep the mortgage I already have instead of signing up for a new thirty are alone you know paying off the loan that I have the only as a teen years left to pay it it just makes makes a big\nUh a lot of sense and and so here we are\nAre are a human tore increased a little bit in Tucson last month that just seasonal because the number of buyers slowed way down and and and we're starting to see that a number of come back up but were thirty two hundred dollars for sale\nAnd a lot of the people who would have downsized probably aren't going to sell their home until they passed away in their their kids do it\n... the one caviar to that and I had a bar or a few weeks ago call me a they want it they have not remodeled their house if teen years they have a three and a half percent interest rate but then they've got you know a hundred thousand dollars in untapped equity\nAnd well okay so I Want to I Need to remodel its been Fifteen Years I Want a new kitchen I wanted to bat\nSo how do they pay for that remodel on let's say have assets in the bank or retirement account they pulled from the only way to get it is out of the mortgage out of the house itself\nAnd uh so do we do an equity line where you know as you've already seen prime rate to five and a quarter right it's gonna be five and a half I December and you know a equity line rates are sitting somewhere between you know if you're straight up high price pledge zero five and a half or one above prime\nI even seen two or two and a half about prime\nDepending upon the credit score so those equity lines are getting expensive\nSo then you have to wonder does it make sense to do and equity line\nYou know depending on how much you're taking out versus the mortgage you have or refinancing to the higher rate it's a and blending it altogether\nIt those are the kinds of discussions people are going to be happening in the next year with with rates going higher because a lot of people do want to stay in their home but they want to remodel it they want to they want that new bathroom or Kitchener backyard or whatever it is\nAnd the question is how they pay for it so it's so I I just think that those the kinds of discussions that mortgage lenders and consumers will be happening is well why not let's just do the math let's do a weighted average of what your current mortgages plus and equity line versus just refinancing go higher rate\n'em and and watch it which is a better option to do go\nAnd then Jerry what you know or something that may play in this this is something that you advise people on\nIs what if they just purchased a different car and now they have a car payment that mortgage that interest on a car is not to duck will but mortgage interest is so wouldn't it make sense\nYou know to to pick out a little bit more out of your home where the interest is ... and not have a car payment and then you know you can I don't want a third of your car payment\nBut you know you can do a Fifteen year alone and and and throw your current on on top of it and actually end up with a lower payment then you have and not have the car payments and those\nAre the kinds of things that you can help people with with you know just how would you like to have an extra three or four or five hundred dollars more in your budget every month just by restructuring a few things\nAnd people always look and say well you know they look at a thirty year fix and they think well they look at it as an absolute the odds are that probably within five to seven years they're going to be moving\nRefinancing because they want to you know remodeled their home or they're going to be doing something to that mortgage is going to be paid off you know we always think long term when the reality that is people don't keep their mortgages All right All right\nSo it's it's just those are the kind of kind of dynamics gotta talk through it with someone\nAnd break it down and see what's in their best interest you know let's\nLet's look at the alternative is lined them out and you know again it's doing a second mortgage Joe weighted average between your current work first marketing or second mortgage\nHow long you're going to be in the house for the probability rates increasing higher and uh as compared to this refinancing to rate today so it you just have to look at all of that and so there's not a simple answer I think everyone situation's different depending upon those dynamics\nAnd um to to decide what is better you know what's the best solution for for them to achieve their goals\nAnd you know this is something that we're seeing as people stay put and they're not getting as many um loans and there was an article that came out this week and Wells Fargo just reported the worst mortgage number since the financial crisis and\nThe um in billions of dollars of loans and the month of September a Wells Fargo had forty six billion dollars worth of loans\nWell it's been running it like in twenty sixteen it was in the Seventy billion dollar range and in the twenty Thirteen and was in a hundred and twelve billion dollar range so Wells Fargo bank just went from you know in in in twenty twelve they had a hundred and thirty nine billion dollars worth of new loans that they said\nAnd there are at forty six billion dollars worth of loans and the month September so that's\nAnd I can attribute this to one specific Ida okay Wells Fargo does a tremendous amount of beef in it\nOr ... yeah and who wants to revise their low rate when there's the new ... rates higher\nAnd so you know they are um again there are some excellent you know Wells Fargo a originator is out there and again nothing against um\nUh you know anyone who is in originated with Wells Fargo but there's just it seems to me from what I hear and I say that they do um they don't do a lot of purchases and it's all ... well as they move up\nEvery five market dries up they're not doing the participant\nOh and then that makes total sense journey because in twenty twelve when rates have fallen everybody's running into refinance before the right's turn around and go back up again\nSo thank you see this is why I loved to have Jerry ... went on this program you can take\nA news article and basically make it makes sense and and when you understand something you know you can you can actually use that and and and understand how it's going to help you how it's going to hurt you and then start to kind of almost predict\nWhat might happen in the future because you understand why something happened the same dynamics happen again you can know that is probably going to happen again\nAnd what's funny is that you know you and I always laugh about headlines and that says this headline for this article is well it's just part of the worst part is number since the financial crisis well I interpreted that as oh this is bad news really bad news\nAnd but it doesn't mention anywhere here about their break down a percentage of refinance versus ... here in the that's the answer sure but it doesn't delve into that element of uh the the business\nOf interesting so I'm One last thing the um National Association of real tours\nReported this week that the existing home a median price in the United states was two hundred and fifty eight thousand one hundred\nSo in Tucson this month we reported in September with our and molest that it was two hundred and ten thousand dollars so we're forty eight thousand one hundred lower than the median ... a home price in the United states so that is a very positive positive thing or Arizona\nAnd what's interesting uh there was an article that I'm\nBrian Moynihan who's the chairman and CEO of bank of America\nAnd he said you know they're really when you look at all the homes available in the United states there isn't a shortage\nBut there's markets where everybody's moving to like San jose in Seattle and Denver and in San Francisco\nThat have a tremendous shortage of homes and then there's other markets like Detroit and and in places that people are moving away from and then several Ohio markets and and there's actually a glut of of properties and and so that's where the sometimes the national numbers on\nOn housing don't really demonstrate what the problem is they just there's a glut of houses in one area and and the shortage of houses and the other area someone nationwide pretty much across the board there is a shortage of homes and one of the things I Do own a\nMortgage notes on on properties in seven states\nAnd in one thing that I Do before I buy in those states is I I always go to Wikipedia and I look at the census and I look from two thousand how many people live there in twenty ten how many people live there are they gaining people are losing people if they're losing people that means there's going to be more homes than people\nAnd the value of that property has a tendency to the pre she ate rather than a bridge\nReshape that's how I ... when I where I'm going to invest so be sure to plan to come to our even December fifth there'll

Rico\nWelcome back to worry free financial solution I'm Nathan Federico a safe money retirement specialists\nMany of you might remember Superbowl fifty one after all he just happened in February of two thousand and Seventeen when the Atlanta Falcons took\nOn the New England patriots on the gridiron maybe watch the game maybe you didn't maybe you just watch the commercials either way I wanted to remind you a little bit about what happened during that game\nThe Atlanta Falcons took a commanding twenty eight to three lead halfway through the third quarter which meant about thirty five percent of the game was still left to play\nYou could see the excitement from the falcons fans as it was looking like they finally we're going to win the Superbowl for the first time in their franchise history however on one particular office of dry that the falcons had now mind you they had a twenty eight to three lead\nAnd at the time they were instilled goal range so they could have had a pretty easy three point field goal\nThey decided on third down to drop back for a deep pass on this play it was the turning point in the game as Matt Ryan the quarterback for the falcons\nWas tackled for a significant loss this loss was so bad it took the falcons write out a field goal range and they were forced upon and turn the ball over to the patriots\nWith the ball back in the hands of Tom Brady and the patriots a miracle happened if you were a patriots fan but an absolute disaster happened if you were a falcon span the patriots came back and scored and unanswered twenty five points to tied the game\nAnd then in overtime won the falcons lost the game many pundits spans and casual observers were shocked with what they had just seen why didn't the falcons just run the ball and go for a field goal when they had the chance why take the risk on a deep pass\nNow Monday morning quarterbacking is easy to do and yes I realized that in that moment decisions like this are difficult to make\nSo how does this apply to retirement planning if you are in a late quarter of your life and you have the lead why risk everything now there's no doubt that if you had a stock market IRA or four O. one K. that Wall Street has done very well for you the last nine years during this bull market run\nBut wouldn't it be wise to take the opportunity now and move some of your hard earned savings to safety why take the risk on a deep pass to score another touchdown when you've already got such a big lead\nSo that's why here at Mayfield financial an estate protection services we failed out what we

put your entire nest egg at risk in the stock market\nThere's so many risks from all sorts of different avenues especially right now there are so many economic arrests out there and talk of a slow down\nWe're seeing action on tariffs and trade wars and rising interest rates\nEven major investment from some of them are telling their clients to get out of the market and that we are quote in the last hurrah of the market I don't care what you think about what's going on in the White House or how the media is portraying everything\nWhen it comes down to it the economy and Wall Street are going to do what it does on its own\nEconomies are cyclical it's always been that way and it always will and the fact is right now we're seeing signs that were near or already at the top\nAlan Greenspan put it best when during the dot com bubble of the nineties he said he saw quote irrational exuberance\nNow maybe it hasn't reached that far maybe it has you'll be the judge so even if you have a Wall Street portfolio now but you feel like you're safe with your bond funds don't fall into the false sense of security that you think you might have\nThey bond fund now I spent ten years as a Wall Street advisor and many advisors they don't talk about this but a bond fund or bond mutual fund or ATF\nThey all have the potential to lose principle value you may think that they are safe because it's in a bond but unfortunately it's a bond fund that managed by Wall Street\nAnd it trades and it moves that has a price and it's highly sensitive to interest rates so if rates are on the rise those bond fund values will go down and depending on how fast rates move\nYour principal value in that bond fund could decrease substantially faster than you are fun to yield in the last Twenty years or so we've been in a downward trend in interest rate environment to where they almost went to zero in two thousand nine\nNow rates are on the rise and we have yet to ever experience in the history of Wall Street what kind of an effect long term rising rate have on bond funds so what do you do here at Mayfield financial an estate protection services\nFor over twenty five years right here in Tucson we have been a
