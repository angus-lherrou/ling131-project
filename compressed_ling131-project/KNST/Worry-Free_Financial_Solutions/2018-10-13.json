{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KNST", "content": "This week in Nineteen Ninety two Eighteen year old Michele nap is watching television and our parents living room and the skill New York when she hears a thunderous crash in the driveway she went outside to find a sizable hole in the rear end of her car a matching hole in the gravel driveway underneath the car and then the whole uh bowling ball size ...\nMedia rights are fairly common in the media right hitting a cars nice car is after all very small objects on a very large planet in fact as far as scientists know it is only happen twice before once in Illinois during the Nineteen thirties em wants to St Louis and this week in Nineteen Ninety eight the U.S house of representatives\nBoth to proceed towards impeaching President Bill Clinton on charges of\nPerjury and obstruction of justice by December Nineteen Ninety eight the Republican led house had gathered enough information from investigation committee to vote in favor of impeachment which in turn sent the case of the Senate Bill Clinton was the first president to be impeached by the house of representatives Andrew Johnson in Eighteen sixty eight Johnson was also a way to\nLook back at this week in history\nBased on what already happened so the market is a leading indicator not all lagging indicator so yes to some degree prices are based on what everybody collectively things is going to happen but having said that\nWe are never really shore truly what is going to happen or when so while many people believe that the fed will continue to raise rates nobody's really sure when the fed will raise rates next or by how\nMuch and therefore bond prices are not fully baked end on that answer so for that reason you can expect that there will be further declines in the bond market if there are further increases in interest rates second\nBonds react differently to interest rate increases depending on the maturity date the duration of the bond a thirty year bond will have a much bigger decline than a thirty day bond\nThat makes sense the longer the duration the longer the maturity date\nThe greater the swing in value due to changes in interest rates so if you're fearful that there will be more rate increases then you should probably not own long term bonds\nUnless you plan to hold them to maturity if you hold on to mature you don't have to worry about it you'll get your money back at maturity regardless of what interest rates are doing but if you're thinking it might sell your bond prior to maturity meaning you'll be subject to whatever market prices are being offered at that time\nThen you would probably want to own shorter term bonds rather than longer term bombs in our case we tend to recommend three or five years seven year maturity is rather than twenty and thirty year majorities or for that reason\nSo yes you do need to be aware of this and this is something new and different for investors most folks are comfortable with unfamiliar with unaccustomed to\nInterest rate risk\nFor the past forty years if we go back to the early Nineteen eighties interest rates have pretty much done nothing but go down\nAnd when rates go down bond prices go up so for a generation many people have grown up in an environment and not realizing that rates could go up not just down\nAnd they haven't been used to the fact that bonds could lose value because for the past since Nineteen eighty bombs are pretty much done nothing but go up in value because when rates go down bond prices go up we're now in a different environment\nGenerationally so a lot of folks are unfamiliar with us and that's why I'm Glad you raised your question 'cause a lot of folks at the very same question\nDon't buy a bond unless you plan to hold her to maturity if you're going to own a bond fund you should probably own bonds in that fund that are shorter in maturity rather than longer and to know exactly what kind of bonds are best for you\nAnd how much of your money you should be placing into them\nYou should talk with a financial advisor and we're happy to help you triple each plane wreck to tackle that question for you\nHere's another question we got this on a lot of people's minds that comes from Mick here it is\nIraq is just make them more prone to answer a question about terrorists we're hearing a lot about additional tariffs being applied all kinds of products and the fact that this is likely going to lead to an increase in prices for a number of the products that we consumers purchase\nMy question is where does all that tariffs money go as it goes straight to the government coffers\nThat it is in essence become an indirect tax for the people the U.S thanks for taking my question\nYeah Mick uh the terrorists are getting a lot of attention and rightfully so and yes you are you are correct a tariff is essentially attacks\nIt's attacks targeted on a foreign company that is selling goods and services in the U.S\nAnd it's a way for the government to tell American consumers don't buy that foreign product instead by a domestically manufactured provided product or service instead so yeah terrorists are essentially taxes and the money essentially does go into government coffers um\nIt's really that simple foreign governments retaliate by doing the same thing you know when one government you know throws a punch the other governments throw equal punches and are there you are so yes the terrorists um make products and services more expensive\nAnd the money goes into the government and taxes which is good news right we've got a massive a deficit right the government is spending more money than it's receiving this helps to solve that\nProblem but uh the burden is paid by American consumers who a foot the bill so yeah that's what tariffs are terrified his synonym for tax\nRevenue generation protocol right I mean they come up with all kinds of you ever noticed that

station [noise]\nIn the oval office I'm Roger Stern Fox News American pastor Andrew Brunson got a hero's welcome after being free\nAnd they kept moving on me um I think there's some valid concerns about how federal law enforcement local law enforcement interact I'm not an immigration department were not a federal immigration enforcement agency we don't have the power to enforce those laws\nAnd I'm I'm just interested in in proactive enforcement of federal immigration laws I have about five hundred deputies the border patrol has about four thousand border patrol agents in the Tucson sector I have neither the resources nor the inclination to engage in federal immigration enforcement on a proactive bases\nThat being said I have to cooperate with my federal law enforcement partners because it's a it's a dynamic environment out there I Need to have their intelligence a resource sharing a both with human capital and physical resources\nSo the people of Pima County should rightly expect that I Would cooperate with federal law enforcement because I have to uh we have a hundred and twenty five mile linear exposure to international border it's it is a public safety issue for the people in my county\nAbsolutely let me ask you as\nPeople wrote to their representatives but that changed their mind or change their perspective of what's going on\nI I think that it might I Would encourage people to uh go ahead and write a communicate with your um board of supervisors district representative\nBut like I always say let's do this in in a professional courteous manner and threaten people yeah I I'm not a I get beat up because I tend to be a gentleman and people can misconstrue that as being weak I think you can be of a very polite and and a dignified person without being weak\nSo refreshing healthy yeah I'd just my mother raised me to be a certain kind of person\nI'm In I think when we communicate to the board we ought to simply say we have public safety concerns moreover we trust the share of ... that this county elected me to maintain public safety in this county um and that was not just a single district but the entirety of the county\nOr have Thirty years of experience doing this I hold a master's degree uh I work with federal law enforcement many times in the past and the people just can't even trusted me to pursue public safety and I'm just ask that the board of supervisors allow me to pursue that a commensurate with my constitutional statutory authority\nAnd I know that the different counties work together as well you share information with different counties that surround us so it is a team effort and they're getting this money they're getting a portion of this money and it only makes sense that you look at what you need to do the job\nAbsolutely and and you know that is a strength that the state of Arizona has I think better than the thirty one years that I've been in this area is we have Fifteen sheriffs in this state they get along we respect each other we collaborate we cooperate we communicate we do all those things that the public should expect us to do\nThat in the past we didn't do so well on there were a couple of outlier shares um that didn't get along well with their peers um Pima County tended to kind of um segregate itself from the rest of the state and now we're all working together we're communicating I'll be down in Santa Cruz county here in a week or so to speak on behalf of sherpa straw to\nUm I just have been elected to a service a vice president of the Arizona State sheriff's association starting in January which I'm very proud of the first time that a Pima County sheriff has ever held office in that or a association which is a that's a proud ... yeah it's yeah well ... especially um rewarding for me because\nIt was my fourteenth peers that nominated me and you know Matt you ah unanimously elected me and and that means a lot to me because there are people who know me as a share of probably much more keenly then a lot of people do\nWhen you have to run for office when is that coming up until years\nYeah I'm On the same a calendar as the president and so I'll be in twenty twenty I'm so we'll be back at this again and um I Hope that I've learned the trust of the people in this county and and the do allow me to continue to serve in that capacity that I'm currently doing I Love my job I Love the Pima County sheriff's department\nAnd my whole life spin about public service I became a law enforcement officer in Nineteen eighty one um my wife's been a nurse since Nineteen eighty um public service something it means something to me it it ... it's not something I take on and off with a uniform it's it's a part of who I Am in and I've had the honor of\nBeing able to surf are very very long time now and the pinnacle of that service is serving in this county as a share of that and it means a lot to me I don't feel entitled to this office I think too many elected representatives I think it's all about them\nMy mother was good at looking at me and shaking her head and she'd go son anal about you [laughter] and she was right then and she's right now and ground you [laughter] yeah and she would she keep my head screwed on straight um about a lot of things and\nI think it's um too many elected officials begin to think it is about them it is about I'm a congressman or I'm a senator on this on that uh I'm a public servant and I've been blessed to be able to serve this county um and uh have the honor of their vote to do so and that that's a huge deal to me really really are ... families\nIn public service though\nYeah my youngest son's Tucson police officer or my youngest daughter just pastor nursing board she'll she'll go to work at Tucson medical center in the emergency room here very shortly and um my two oldest children they kind of went into the private sector they're both Raytheon\nUm my son ... a deputy chief engineer Raytheon and my oldest daughter is a financial analyst for a the on um I I'm a blessed father I I I have four adult children that I like [laughter]\nThey're my kids but because they're good human beings and I would spend time with him and enjoy it if they weren't my children and um my wife and I've been married for thirty five years and\nUh I could not be more blessed with my family I've got to a grand daughter will be two next month and a ... it's been a good journey really has\nVery cool yeah you have a pretty remarkable family I'm impressed okay when we come back we only have like forty seconds here I Want to talk about domestic violence\nAnd what's going on in ... county to address the issue of domestic violence because that's really one of the worst calls I think\nAn officer can answer is we've got a message to violence is you never know yep slowly so um and tell me what's going on in the Eighteenth October okay now\nAll right now [laughter] I thought that was the leader teaser on October Eighteenth we're going to paint Pima County purple uh in in awareness of domestic violence in the scourge of domestic violence and how harmful that historic community and tried to waste raise awareness or both of 'em the community and uh of victims\nOkay and we're going to take a quick break we'll be back and if you\nTake a pause got kids and I'm worried about getting\nA new study from the University of California Davis as it happens in ten percent of households and that boys are more likely to get it and then girls by tapping more often in homes with fewer children and they found out that weren't state or neutered were more likely to buy the kid\nHow well trained group a therapy dog helping passengers and marked down their travels at Miami international airport canine ambassador

found it and and now\nI now there are benefits fewer crying kids\nSomebody to give you the same and if it is but I think\nA very good thing take ties to eliminate on Fox News\n[noise]\nThing with us our common numbers they zero five six seven eight and I'm curious how did you become an officer\nIt's kind of a a story that keeps me grounded and I tell this community groups that cause I can give some insight into maybe who I Am at the core but I I got hired as police officers about November of Nineteen eighty one and the department was going to send me to the academy the following January\nAnd I begging begging begged him I I really I had not to dime stir up together and I begged him to let me come to work or early I filed papers I chase detect these around whatever they wanted me to do because by the way they're going to pay me more money than I ever made my life seven dollars and forty seven cents an hour and I thought I was rich and um\nSo they finally said well look you can come to work December fifteenth Nineteen eighty one\nAnd talk about it with all these kids and it was that you know fire department hospital you know do the right thing don't hide it down to the wrong thing you're talking about that's pretty scary so emerges a place that you can go and get help\nAbsolutely be a victim of domestic violence uh remember it's probably not going to get better unless we intervene some way and get people into counseling get them to the resources so please do not I'm staying in abusive relationship don't believe that you're you're the problem\nA there are resources out there that people don't care for you and I'm less wear purple on October Eighteen plus paint Pima purple and bring more awareness to a domestic violence and and it's um toil on victims and and that even a offenders um abusers can get treatment and get resources\nIf somebody admits that they're in use or can they go to merge and get some help\nOn day would be a place where they could get connected up to some services well yes\nDo people who do that ever change\nWhat I Want to believe that there's change just like an alcoholic saying an alcoholic never not be an alcoholic well no you can get counseling and I think an abuser the first step to getting help as admitting that you have a problem and and I think that's the first step in any of these\nOkay let's take a break and

things\nI don't like being a politician I'm an elected official but I have politics\nAnd I I totally agree with you I I don't like this time of year and I've I've listened to TV by like I said my mute button is just about war out on my remote control because the same thing over and over and over again and they're all negative\nAnd I'm sitting here thinking okay if you're going to bash the person I'm On live TV\nWhat are you doing behind closed doors in the midst representations that are going on how do you feel about all this that's happening\nWith will I I guess I'm not a political consultant but I'm I'm a consumer of this and the molecular official I don't think I ever wants mentioned my opponent's name in any of my political ads\nDid not want the people of Pima County devoted get somebody I wanted them to vote for me and that's what I Wish politicians would tell us\nUm okay tell me why I should give you the sanctity of my vote in a in in a democracy the the vote he is a very sacred thing it's a sacred trust and I would like politicians to tell me why you a deserved that not why somebody else shouldn't have it\nBut rather why I should give my vote to you and then basically in a political edging say anything because nobody's going to fact check 'em that nobody's going to go back and see if that statement is true or false\nAnd um it's troubling I'm this is not new I mean there were terrible things said about Lincoln and the Eighteenth sixty race I'm there I'm at the end it's just it's not new are not new to politics but it does seem to be getting worse and I I don't know who the political consultants are but I Would like somebody to tell me\nThis is what I bring to the table this why burns your road um this is why I'm asking for your vote\nThat's a secret thing a democracy and I wish that the politicians would do that um and report themselves to be somebody that we could all be proud of rather than somebody who we have to say well I Wonder if that's true and boy that's a lot of hateful rhetoric and and you know it's just\nDoesn't seem to be the way that we should operate but I think that's the way that has been for a good long while and it does seem to be getting worse\nAnd something that they're doing that I I find happens in the news media lot is they'll take a soundbite and they'll wrap a story around that knowing that it's not the whole story they're misrepresenting the person that they're running against and you actually have to go do research to find out is that true ...\nPeople and they're going to do their research and and there's enough blame to go around I mean each party wants us to believe that the there though on the white hill on standing on a white horse and and they're not to blame come on everybody who's to blame in there so I don't care if you're a Democrat or Republican uh everybody who's to blame and this and and we could turn that around we could do better\nI don't wake up in the morning worried about me or even about my children but my granddaughter will be two years old next month\nAnd I worry a great deal about what kind of country we're leaving her\nUm I was raised to believe certain things I was raised to um embraced a meritocracy the United states of America My mother and father were poor when they were children\nI Believe I Would always be poorer just be able to scrape by but my mom and dad told me that if you do not want to be poor or get an education work harder than the next person and be a good human being and you'll never be poor I told my children that I've I have not been poor or since then\nBecause I always try to be a good person I work hard and I've gotten an education my children have done the same thing when I look at my little granddaughter Lexus and I said to her\nGet an education or work hard to be a good human being you'll never be poor I don't know if the meritocracy United States of America still embraces that or will still embrace it when she's thirty or forty or fifty years old\nWe have a responsibility for the generations to come and politicians should have a responsibility for that and I don't think that we think enough about that
