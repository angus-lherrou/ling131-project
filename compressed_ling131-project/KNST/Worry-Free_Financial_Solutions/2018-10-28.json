{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KNST", "content": "Sounds amazing and you won't be wanting to call to get pre qualified so Jerry what's your phone number sure and I may I dial\n[laughter] I have two or three seven zero nine five seven six\nAll right and I'm Talking about appraisers you know a lot of times people especially in a rising market there's appraisers are the top of the conversation because there's challenges sometimes in banks skim the appraiser rules of\nOf uh you know what they can or can't do and they give them a rearview mirror saying show me other homes and it was sold for this much money and that means they gotta look backward in time not forward in time\nSo we had talked right before the break about\nAbout a range pricing what what is range pricing and and you know how does that fall into play well when when someone posts arrange the ... the most common question I'm asking is yeah I saw your home listed for five eighty five to six Fifteen so if I Know they'll take five eighty five why would I write an offer for six Fifteen\nWell the range pricing they will take five eighty five it's not a bait and switch right they'll take five eighty five if that's all they have to pay but if you want to come in and and ask for closing cost and you want to ask for a bunch of repairs and you want to ask for you know just a whole bunch of concessions\nUm there's a difference between an offer and five eighty five that closes with cash in two weeks\nAnd an offer for five eighty five that once three percent and closing costs and doesn't want to close for six or eight weeks and and then asked for another five thousand dollars in repairs so the idea is is yes I Would take five eighty five it that's all I had to pay\nNo closing cause no repairs or if you want to finance the closing costs in this is quite common where people asked for closing costs the sellers counter offer back to a higher price that way the price still falls within the appraisal\nOf are within the asking price and and the president saying why are you paying more for this home than the list price [laughter] so that's the reason if you ever see range pricing\nAnd our MLS requires that if you are going to arrange price or property it has to be the first word of the lifting says range price you know some people know right away um but I I actually think it's it's it's a really\nGood way to market at home because it isn't a bait and switch putting some low ball price that you'll never accepted it's a it's laying your cards on the table saying this is will take\n... and and um you know and why why play this game of let's ask way more money than we expect to get and hope somebody comes in and offer ... everybody knows they're not going to\nThis way it's like this is what they'll take bottom line and anything less than that don't waste your time that's transparency about what it boils down to ... so I'm you know and that said we had a a a property that is listed in right now\nIf you look at this deal fell out the ah the buyer just kind of got a case of buyer's remorse and and then write two days before closing backed out and and now there are just when he's now in jeopardy\nAnd and um you know basically they're going to probably lose it because they didn't back off because of financing they just change their mind\nSo the cellar and taking his house off the market for six weeks\nDo you think there's any fewer buyers right now than there were six weeks ago yes tremendously so the sellers been harm they should get that earn this money so um but anyway this I had a ... an offer come in and this properties list and it's the cheapest lowest priced home I'm\nA three bedroom home with two bathrooms if you do a search from ever valley over to Mount Lemmon all the way down has green valley it's over five hundred square miles this is the lowest price livable not boarded up three bedroom two bath home available in the entire MLS\nAnd its price at a hundred and thirty thousand dollars and I got an offer this week for Seventy thousand I'll give you a Seventy it's fully renovated it's it's a it's a fix and flip home but there's some you know like what a waste of effort to just go you know ... view offers to the wind is ridiculously\nAnd of course as a real estate broker I have a job to present to every offer to the seller and you know I just you know please respond back and we'll get back to this purchase you know this person and tell them no thank you and we'll move on with their lives but um\nI think you know it's another story I Want to share with you or something else up in this ah this past because it was an exciting week um you know but we were talking about appraisers and you and I are both huge fans of appraisers 'cause they have a very difficult to correct and it is a um\nA you know that's why appraisal management companies were set up is so that lenders are won't turn around and trying to persuade a an appraiser to come at a certain value but appraisers or have a difficult you know task is that they're paid less from from what they're paid now from what they were paid years ago\nSimply because in cities are making them saying hey if you want to be on our panel will only pay X. amount of the themes he can make more money but so it's a it's a difficult so than it is an appraiser really doing an objective\nYou know a decision because they're forced to doing well I've got to get ten more appraisals done\nIn a week than I used to have to do so what are they doing they're rushing and so\nWhen when when any of us rush the mistakes we make mistakes and well we're not looking at things from all sides to to give a value and I I share this because I got a I've got a a a a situation that happened I'm doing alone for a gentleman in Idaho you buy a house on the border of Washington state in in Idaho in this in a town\nIn the city there that I'm In the AMC ordered an appraisal from yet from someone out of Washington and don't know how it happened 'cause we're not ...\nWe'd also the appraisers license in Washington or their properties in Oregon or in a Idaho\nIn Idaho yes and so and we're not party did is we don't know this and the\nUh the listening agent didn't catch it as a person one on the lock Boston and signed and he got the appraisal done the next morning after they were visiting the house and it came in sixty thousand dollars low on a four hundred thousand dollars wow Fifteen Percent low Fifteen Percent\nSo I talk to both the agents and then I talked to the AMC saying is this a lot of praise and they wrote these long\nOut as as to why it was a lot and and where the appraisers theory was not\nYou know ... is a where they were they felt that that the appraisers logic was was not right\nFor um analyzing the value of the film and so we ordered another appraisal through a nationally and see and they happen to choose someone from Idaho and it came in my ... like two thousand dollars below ask well I mean that was ... the Alvin dollars wing between two appraised\nOn a four hundred thousand dollar home that's a huge swing\nIt is and and I would if the situation like that would have happened in Tucson or Phoenix I can analyze it 'cause I Know those markets so well right\nBut there I'm doing alone for an old friend of mine that I don't know that the city and the the adjustments I can gauge that so I'm going off of a a ... to the games he found that the the first one was a lot and the the deal went through but I mean if the eight dollars in dollar swing well\nBetween two appraisals for four hundred thousand dollar house\nAnd now the buyer and have to pay for a second appraisal\nNope I'm all parties um uh the two agents and myself decided we would chip in for we split at three ways five hundred dollars for a new appraisal um\nMan but I suspect and I've seen it happen many many times this is why you want your son on your side and by the way he is license not just in Arizona and in Washington and in Illinois and in Texas I'm In\nA Colorado and you know he's given all of my sister and her children loans um but if you know the thing I like about Jerry as he does so much volume you spread those costs over\nOver hundreds of loans instead of somebody that only does one or two a month and and they have to put all their overhead on one loan\nSo more than likely soldier during let me just ask you the difference in price\nIf someone was going to buy a two hundred thousand dollar home from him get a loan from you or a million dollar home and get a loan from you what would your feeling be different note would be to say exactly the same ... that's ... ... you're so if if you know people are you have another home in other states and you're thinking of doing or ... or purchase\nJerry's your guy for loans now me I'm only licensed in the state of Arizona for homes but I have friends all over the country that have been a master minds with that I can refer you to make sure you're getting into you know somebody that does a lot of business like I Do in that way you'll have ... that kind of experience working behind you\nBut the I'm definitely in the appraisers um have a tough job I mean there's a lot of online\nAn appraisal you know on the deals out there if they have nothing to do with appraisers the ... you know the value of waging doesn't even know what have been in these your home has just look for example if you're looking at a lower truly or anything else but we'll talk more about that next week this is Tucson\n\nFrom

gridiron maybe watch the game maybe you didn't maybe you just watch the commercials either way I wanted to remind you a little bit about what happened during that game the Atlanta Falcons took a commanding twenty eight to three lead halfway through the third quarter which meant about thirty five percent of the game was still left to play\nYou could see the excitement from the falcons fans as it was looking like they finally we're going to win the Superbowl for the first time in their franchise history however on one particular office of dry that the falcons had now mind you they had a twenty eight three lead\nAnd at the time they were instilled goal range so they could have had a pretty easy three point field goal\nThey decided on third down to drop back for a deep pass on this play it was the turning point in the game as Matt Ryan the quarterback for the falcons was tackled for a significant loss this loss was so bad it took the falcons write out a field goal range and they were forced upon and turn the ball over to the patriots\nWith the ball back in the hands of Tom Brady and the patriots a miracle happened if you were a patriots fan but an absolute disaster happened if you were a falcon span the patriots came back and scored and an answer twenty five points to tied the game\nAnd then in overtime won the falcons lost the game many pundits fans and casual observers were shocked with what they had just seen why didn't the falcons just run the ball and go for a field goal when they had the chance why take the risk on a deep pass\nNow Monday morning quarterbacking
