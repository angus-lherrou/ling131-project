I have long contended\nThat NAFTA was perhaps the worst trade deal ever made\nSince NAFTA's adoption the United states racked up trade deficits totaling more than two trillion dollars and it's a much higher number then that with Canada and Mexico and lost vast amounts of money\nAt the last four point one million manufacturing jobs and one in four or do jobs was about twenty five percent of our jobs even more than the\nThroughout the campaign I promise to renegotiate NAFTA and today we have kept that promise\nFor the last half hour the pres maybe\nEven longer than maybe forty five minutes or\nYou know an extended the statement\nOnly recently started taking questions for the time with Trump is doing here which is something that I Belong advocated he wasn't just announcing that\nDeal got done he was teaching why it was important including to the drive by media who for the most part are clueless\nUh don't understand capitalism a think that it's a big bad Mimi and Trump is taking the occasion of all this attention to actually explain how trade works and how the United states has been victimized over the course of a many many years because of\nAmerican leadership believing well you know where the super power in the world where the richest we can afford to take it in the short now and then it promotes good relations with our allies and Trump stood up and said there's no reason we should have our back pockets picket\nThere's no reason that we should just let people have what ever they want from our treasury\nThere's no reason we should feel guilty about being powerful and wealthy at doesn't mean because we are so much wealthier and powerful that those who are not have ... on what we produce those days are over that way of thinking is over\nAnd he went through the whole process and explaining how trade works why it is important and how the United states was getting the shaft\nBut more importantly why it matters to ordinary everyday people and their jobs and their careers\nIncluding farmers and a number of other type people about whom Washington thinks\nNot very off and thanks very little it's been a masterful performance there is no question\nThat Trump not only knows what he's talking about he is the architect of what he's talking about and he got to run the rings around people in this in discussing the process and in discussing this substance\nAnd the details of this new agreement just it puts anybody else it's ever tried this to shame everybody that has a chance to listen to this is going to understand exactly why it was important what happened why it happened and why we benefit and why that is good\nAnd you know teaching as well as announcing is fundamental I Believe that's why the Republican Congress Nineteen Ninety four actually\nSquandered its majority after a while it's because they stopped teaching what they were doing and why as they did it\nMade the fatal mistake and believing that the Republican victory in Nineteen Ninety four men somehow that the majority of the country and overnight turned conservative and so when they began to announce this cut that cut this reform that reform a lot of people to know what they were talking but I got scared to death\nAt lesson hasn't been learned about none other than a dozen all of this Trump here's the next bite Trump saying it is a privilege to trade with us it's kind of thinking we haven't seen we've seen thinking but both parties who who believe that that it's up to us\nOr ... or in the\nRespect that bothers it's up to us to show them that we don't intend them any harm it's up to us and Trump's turning this a hundred and eighty degrees around so it's a privilege to trade with us we're the world economy\nWhere the future of the world economy where the future of world freedom and liberty to the days of the America as the world's piggy bank are\nOver steel will also imposes new standards requiring at least Seventy five percent of every automobile to be made in North America in order to qualify for the privilege of free access to our markets it's a privilege for them to do business with us\nAnd I'm not talking about Mexico ... I'm Talking about everybody everybody it's a privilege for China\nTo do business with us it's a privilege for the European Union who is treated us very badly\nBut that's coming along to do business with U.S Japan every country is a privilege for them to come in and attack the piggy bank\nYeah it's a privilege to come in now and I as I say if folks it's it's a new way of seeing ourselves and our country without the need to make excuses without the need to apologize we really we\nReally haven't as you know you can see evidence and science and that's what our own culture of the achieved any accomplished somehow feel the need to apologize\nFor it or to downplay it as some\nSort of new definition of humility a rather than having used as a teachable moment there's something inspiring\nIs this Trump points out we want every country making their country great we want to every country putting their country first we want everybody doing it that way that's the whole point\nEverybody to do better but not by piggy bank in the United states by doing it on their own these kinds of things are just they're ... they're far in the United nations types diplomatic types\nThe spider bite a don't don't forget who told you this was not possible do not forget it was barrage Hussein ... who said none of this could be done\nFear remember the previous administration said we're not going to have manufacturing jobs anymore essentially we're not going to have we're not going to make things anymore no\nJust the opposite going to be a manufacturing powerhouse it allow us to reclaim a supply chain that has been off shored to the world because of unfair trade issues\nSo there you have it it's um it's not a sexy subject NAFTA never was I mean it was in ... commanded a lot of attention a it was very controversial when it was ratified in the in the early in the mid Nineteen nineties\nBut in terms of being a subject that if if cable news announcer gonna do it two or three panels tonight on NAFTA trade deal and not going to have a lot of people tune in\nIt's just the way of the world so Trump is making sure with this extended event in the rose garden of the day but people get it's important in terms of its important says that election issue it's crucial\nIt is a I wouldn't say crucial but it's it's very important in terms of Trump being able to say to his voters stick with me\nI told you I was going to do this I told you it can be done and I told you the United states was going to come out as the champion in the subject the world trade don't doubt me and in that sense\nIt's a confidence inspiring that Trump left alone in the oval office free and clear to be who he is will me in a bunch of great things happening\nWow that can add up to ... thousand dollars in

have to be a somebody in the media or the lawyers for Christine Blasey Ford who had seen the letter and\nSo some senators began to say that it could well be Senator Feinstein and she sat there and

this past is any kind of a smell test anyway back to mark pencil very quickly\n\nAmericans believe her and both believe Kavanaugh if the FBI finds no corroboration of the charges sixty percent believe Kevin ... should be confirmed according to a weekend harbored Harris Poll of the thousand three hundred and thirty registered\nVoters sixty six percent of Americans support the decision to have the FBI investigate that includes eighty percent Democrats sixty nine percent independents with only forty five percent\nRepublicans who are the smart ones\n\nHuge numbers in the weekend poll reported seeing parts of it or reading about it forty percent thought she alone was credible\nTwenty three percent fought\nKavanaugh was twenty seven percent said both were believable if you combine all that the poll findings indicates sixty seven percent found her credible and fifty percent found him to be\n\nWhat the credibility of their testimony does it appear to be the decisive factor instead the question comes down to collaboration is the standard for tipping public opinion on whether Kavanaugh should have some of the high court in terms of the overall needle after the testimony was heard\n\nThirty seven percent say confirmed the nomination forty four percent say rejected Eighteen percent remain undecided Democrats going one way Republicans the other but but but but but the hang on no get depressed\nOnce the voters are told that the name of the witnesses deny any knowledge of the allegation that ships from forty four percent of fifty seven percent in favor confirmation meaning\nMeaning the people in this poll do not know\nDid not know many of them did not know that the people she places in the room have denied being there\nAnd when the pollsters told them that in fact the numbers of people who thought he should be confirmed jump from forty to fifty seven percent and then up to sixty percent\nIn a hypothetical question if the FBI after a week agrees there is no cooperation for her story and they've already done that but now we've got to\nCall me entering the picture now we've got to call me urging the FBI to keep digging the same FBI that's been running a silent coups FBI leaders trying to get rid of Trump\n\nI Want to grab a phone call because this guy has a great point and I want to add something to it this is a ... Jason Muskegon, Michigan Jason thank you so much for waiting I appreciate it how're you doing\nThing no problem and thanks for letting me be part of the excellent\nWell I appreciate that you are you are here as part of the excellence by association [laughter] yeah\nI was thinking on that uh there is no better way to um motivate a group by attacking them and by attacking Kevin nah they're basically essentially attacking the entire Republican base\nWhere he showed up and sixteen and voted Trump and I'm part of that reason was for the Supreme Court nomination and here we are Democrats are going to make the midterms about a Supreme Court vacancy and they think that they can last year twenty twenty so they're not really pressing issue as hard as what Republicans could\nAnd knowing that if we want to get our guy in there you know we're gonna have to show up in midterms are going to they're going to have an adverse effect that they keep the ...\nI've heard people say this I I'm a ... Jason here thinks that all of this is going to backfire on the Democrats and motivate Republicans to show up and vote not just now two thousand Eighteen but again\nFor Trump in twenty twenty\nOr let's go to the audio soundbites on this Jason thank you much we're going to start here this is a boxing friends weekend\nOn Saturday morning Rachel Campos Duffy was one of the hosts\nIs talking to CBS em political corresponded David Brody\nAbout all this\nAnd she says well we know the Democrats all ready men really energized about the midterms I don't know how much more energized they could get\nBut I'm sensing that Republicans have become very energized this week this hearing has really fired and the Republicans\nUp from my reporting and from that deplorable evangelical base I can tell you they say the Democrats dirty tricks have riled them up like never before and I know Rush Limbaugh has talked about how if Kavanaugh is confirmed it's going to be real tough for the Republicans actually if Kavanaugh is not confirmed\nThat would even rile up at the coral evangelical base in the jail the base I Believe even more at least the people that I'm hearing from and so I\nWill look I think that that's a big part of what's going on here\nYou can't blame David Broder you for being fifty percent and foreign\nBecause I I pulled back\nThat original production after it had gone viral all over the drive by media that's why it's still prominent in people's minds\nAnd my retraction of that production has barely received a whimper because it doesn't serve the drive by us any good when the drive by here me predicting Republican do they can't help themselves they got to put her all over the world in the media\nRush Limbaugh is Republicans are going to lose ... capital not confirmed\nThat prediction was based at a specific point in time on if the Republicans caved\nIf Republicans didn't fight for cabinet if Republicans just went bird out I predicted that what happened but once this began to unfold I retracted that production and said it could end up being the opposite here\nBut of course that production didn't go viral and I want to Jason in Muskegon I Want to thank you for bringing it up so that I could make the case here is one more a bite on this is a CSPAN Washington Journal Saturday morning\nJess Holland is talking to a correspondent at the Weekly Standard Andrew Edgar\nAbout me there's been several conservative including Rush Limbaugh who warned that Republicans could lose their majority if they don't get out from all of her to the Supreme Court is that something that Republicans in Congress are really thinking about mid term consequences\nArguments like the one that Limbaugh makes our little convenient on whether or not having to get through I think this whole situation is really fired up Republican voters\nNow once again somebody else you can't blame 'em folks don't get mad at him because my original production\nWas everywhere I literally all

to her had an all of these stories caused women to feel a newly emancipated to come forward with their stories and yet\nOn the tail end of the me too movement after Clarence Thomas Anita Hill and so

these people we don't even know if the people calling him or not Democrat activists to begin with just to create the phone traffic\nMike intention to you is that the me too movement alone\n\nHas no doubt inspired a lot of women so courageously step up and accused guys that have mistreated them it's not a new phenomenon it's not something\nFor which she deserves all kinds of credit because this is it the tail end of this new awareness insensitivity\nAnd yet\nIt's being spoken of Christine mostly for his testimony on her inspiration is being spoken of as though it's a stand alone and it's never happened before\nAnd that adds to her credibility don't you see\nAnd I think we're all being played oh yeah I Do know I'm not accusing\nNot saying women are coming forward I'm saying it's not a

soundbites these are from the oval office was during a\nAnnouncement ceremony for a new trade deal eliminates the NAFTA getting rid of it brand new trade deal the Dr ... under orders not to ask questions about Kavanaugh which meant they ask questions about capital and Trump after making sure enough time was spent on NAFTA\nStarted entertaining the are the questions and what we had one through four of them here\nAnd\nHere is a Trump ... this is this is not actually in response to question he's just riffing here during the ceremony talking about the mid term election fake news Kavanaugh things\nWe have Senate races that weren't even in play six months ago as you know there are a lot of repression polls are polls are aren't very accurate we had areas and we had congressional seats to\nWhere I Know it's got to be a positive outcome but you look at what's going on and it doesn't seem to be broadcast that way but I certainly had that with my election\nThey were telling me I was you know in trouble in certain states at the end up winning like in a landslide and I knew I was going to win them in a landslide but they wouldn't reported that way you know why fake news\nNow during the Q and a a Cecilia vague go\nABC News the White House correspondents said in a tweet this weekend you said it's incorrect to say that you're limiting the scope of the FBI investigation into Kevin ... when your own statement on friday made it very clear you said this investigation must be limited in scope so which is that\nThis is our seventh investigation of a man who has really you know you look at his life until this happened what a change she's gone through what his family's gone through the trauma\nFor a man that's never had any accusation any he's been out of bed statement about him he's led I think he was number one in this class it yeah he was number one in his law school and yeah and then what he's gone through over the last three weeks his incredible so\nI Want the FBI this is now the seventh investigation so it's not like the you know just starting I Want them to do a very comprehensive investigation\nLet me explain that answer it let me ... what do these soundbites and got to be yeah number thirty coming okay\nWhen this whole FBI investigation started everybody knows we we heard flake demand a week for his vote one week\nSo that's how the committee vote in Lebanon to pen and paper Kavanaugh with the provides though that flight was not going to vote for a vote for final confirmation silly FBI that's been at least another week long handled this\n\nSo that NBC runs a story out of nowhere fake news claiming that the White House intends to limit the scope of the FBI was a set up it was a it was a trap\nThey lay in a trap NBC News which is complicit with the Democratic party in most things later trap accusing Trump and the White House of trying to limit the FBI's go because you see there are things to find and Trump wants to cover it up Donald Trump who's had so much control over the FBI the last three years\nSame FBI and it's been doing his level best thing\nDonald Trump thrown out off somehow Donald Trump has been able to walk in there and tell those guys to limit the scope of their investigation\n\nSo Trump or his I'm not limiting the scope of anything I've told the FBI the look at whatever they need to look at oh OK\nThank you Mr solve it needs to go two weeks ago two weeks so the White House is not claim there aren't any limit to see how this works\nIt was a trap it was set up and Trump tweeted out\nHe's not limiting the scope NBC's white course they're lying it was a set up\n\nAnd so now it's out there but we may not be enough now Fox News is reporting along with Fox Business news\nAt the FBI is saying they might have this wrapped up tomorrow but then the question becomes what to do with that if the FBI just finished talking to everybody I talked\nTo that one of the Republicans do with that so they hold on to it till friday and or are are are do they move on it\nWill just tell you if this ends tomorrow if this was all accurate\nAnd the Democrats here but the Democrats are going to be fit to be tonight that the thing didn't go on friday and they're going to demand they're going to start saying that this thing is rigged they knew what was going to be rigged and they're going to demand even more\nTime to fix the fact that it was read they're going to\nDo that anyway they're not going to let this thing and on friday if we let them have their way this investigation isn't going to end on friday it won't be long enough besides Trump said he's not going to limit on the FBI\nSo why are they stopping now it isn't possible they could have found everything there is to find on those labels I went to the response as well they found nothing you know hundred thousand or more Hillary emails and a couple of days\n\nUh let's see let's let's skip forward here to um\nAudio soundbite number thirty reporter about judge Kavanaugh there are concerns\nThat might have lied or mischaracterized as drinking while he was testifying if they find that Kavanaugh lied about his drinking or if he lied about other

at his press conference today where he's\nNo I don't want to limit anything I said I thought that they run a fake news story NBC does\nTrump is limiting the investigation central I'm not that's fake news so then they've got it on record Trump not limiting invested ... which means you can go on and on and on and on\nAnd now they're broadcasting and everywhere White House tells me I interview when he wasn't necessarily [noise] and right on schedule CNN reports that the Democrats are submitted a list of twenty four\nPeople they want the FBI to talk to this\nAfter Fox News had an earlier today that the FBI is about to wrap up tomorrow\n\n[noise] this is gonna have to be shut down at some point this cannot go on all this is\nIs delayed delayed delayed the way and I'm going to tell you what needs to happen\nThere is an assumption operating out there that needs to be shut down and that assumption is that the investigation that has taken place since Kavanaugh was named is somehow insufficient\nIf somehow incomplete somebody needs to stand up and say if the exact opposite that this is the seven now Trump has but somebody besides needs to make the point that this has been a\nThorough investigation that every last minute Jack in the box that's popped up here has been looked into and the effort has been made but there's only so much you can do with the woman who doesn't remember where or when what ever happened to her happen\nAnd there's only so much you can do when the people in the room she sounds were their claim they weren't\n\nThis investigation somebody needs to stand up and vouch for it somebody needs to stand up and promote it\nIt needs to be spoken for\nThis has got to be stopped because the it's not real\nThe Democrats are allowed to make it up as they go submit names they want the FBI to talk to\nThey dug it investigations don't work that way FBI follows evidence leads at when they don't find anything unlike Bob Mueller face stop\n\nMueller's been looking for collusion with Trump and Russia for two years and has been found anybody is still going and that's exactly what this is going to be if somebody doesn't stand up and stop this\nSomebody on the Senate Judiciary committee needs to stand up or Mitch McConnell needs to stand up and start voucher thing for the investigation is taking place there are six separate FBI background checks and Brett Kavanaugh\nSomebody needs to speak up for him somebody needs to vouch for um somebody needs to stand up and say they haven't been thorough and they haven't found anything or you wouldn't be where he is now sitting on the DC circuit court of appeals\nBut that's not happening somehow were letting the media get away with the idea that the investigation here in the Kavanaugh has been half baked lukewarm and incompetence\nBecause of Christine Blasey Ford coming around at the last minute with no evidence no cooperation and nothing yet she's credible Kevin O's not\nSomebody look we had a caller earlier how do you stop a bully of smack 'em in the face somebody needs to stand up until the Democrats the shut the hell up that they've gotten everything they've asked for this thing and there just isn't anything there and to go home\nThe idea of this investigation is not thorough is incompetent is incomplete or has been Rand is absolutely bogus another making things up the Trump is going to limit it either no such thing\nBut he sure felt for the bait I Am not limited and the thing I've totally FBI to take us wherever it\nTakes them\nProperly Democrats while you're Twenty one people we want you to talk to\n\nIf you called the FBI say there's there's some people in my town here really really screw on the porch and I need to get something done about an IRS in when you go talk to them but it doesn't work that way does it\n\nWhat rush rush this was the United States Senate clearly that can happen to know is that\n[noise] and one other thing you know one of the one of the movies I have recommended over the years that people rent they haven't seen a go go watch it's called the lives of others and it's a movie about East Germany during the Cold War essentially\nHow the government literally spied on every citizen\n\nThe German chancellor of the time was you know rich hunter\nHe's the guy but you know drug ...
