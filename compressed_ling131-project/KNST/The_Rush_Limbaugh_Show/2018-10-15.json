thousand two as well\nBut I don't I don't look at what's going on here the last two weeks especially I and even the last four I don't see where there's this massive realization that the Democrats are they answered a what ails America\nNow the dry and buys want everybody to see it that way so they report it that way but in their generic polled the Democrats have their back to a plus Thirteen\nMargin advantage but then you look at individual races and they're nowhere near a Democrat Thirteen points up [noise]\nAnd then it elsewhere in their poll Trump's approval rating has gone up since the Kavanaugh confirmation fight came to a conclusion with independents disapproving of the Democrats' handling of the capital nomination by twenty eight point margin\n\nEven though the Democrats on the surface would seem to have public opinion on their side and\nSays the Washington Examiner just thirty six percent approved of how they handle the nomination compared to fifty six percent who disapproved of further breakdown finds that fifty eight percent of independents disapproved of the way Democrats handled everything compare to thirty percent who approved other\n\nIndependence also disapproved of Republicans handling of the matter but by a narrower fifty three of the thirty two percent [noise] so what does that mean independents disapproving everybody did it\nYou know being ...

matter where you go every story that drudge for example links links to on his page is a story of the Democrats with a massive landslide\nRetaking the house of representatives and there are stories where Republicans supposedly I think the same thing is going to happen certainly you you've talked to swamp dwellers you I mean you hear from a lot of Republicans who think their toast\nBig march you do you think they're toast big margin toast\nIn the house of representatives well what I Know what what what ... well\nYeah I'd like to get an unusual polls show nine percent of the nine feet advantage even after the worst happens of all that that's getting into the into the minutia I'm I'm just talking about over all national\nAttitude um and I look I'll be honest I'm always having to dial myself back um I I'm One of these people you probably are too I'm One of these people are thinking everybody agreed with me we would have the best country in the history of countries\nIf everybody looked at life the way I Do and looked at other people a way I Do it looked at issues of everybody looked at America the way I Do nobody would ever stop\nIt and I'm sure you feel that way now and then but we have to temper that with reality this is a lot of loony tunes out they're incapable of seeing the country the\nWay we do for a host of reasons have you heard ladies and gentlemen that the Clintons are going to start a massive stadium tour bill and Hillary\nWon again in want to get in on all of this Trump action\nNow I I'm I've been wondering how long it was going to be until somebody in the Democratic party tried this Trump's rallies dating back to the two thousand sixteen campaign and do not dumped me on this either the Democrats in the media publicly\nActed on concerned on interested in and would always say a variation\nOf you can't judge voter interest on the basis of rallies you can't predict how people are going to vote simply because of the size of crowds at political rallies these Trump rallies they're not telling us that it doesn't mean anything\nHe's earned just rabbit people upset with their lives and they think Trump is going to kick all of people out of the country they don't like it it's not saying it's not anywhere near representative\nOf the population this is what they all said that every\nTrump rally privately do not doubt me privately they were jealous if they could be and they were seizing\nBecause there's not a one of them on the Democratic side who could come anywhere close to ... that kind of excitement that kind of loyalty and knows sized crowds\nObama couldn't do it not in two thousand sixteen Hillary couldn't do what ever but certainly not in two thousand\nShe couldn't she couldn't she could withdraw flies there her book signing ceremonies Hillary Clinton who couldn't draw a crowd anywhere good people knew she might not be able to stand up for a full twenty five minutes\nWithout some ain't coming out the proper up by the albums but seriously I guarantee you they were looking at those crowds\nThey were looking at those Trump rallies and they would never say so publicly but they were scared to death by him they would never say so publicly they would never admit it publicly they would say just the opposite but\nThey're human beings in any kind any any time anybody in politics has that kind of popularity and that kind of loyalty that equals jealousy envy and anger and all things that attached to jealousy and envy\nThey have the Trump to begin with and the fact that Trump was turning everything they believed in upside down the fact that Trump was being able to accomplish things they couldn't\nJust in terms of average Americans being interested in in the campaign interested in the candidacy and those rallies twenty thousand Fifteen twenty five thousand as many people lined up outside who couldn't get an wanted to get in\nTrouble with his airplane perfectly placed\nSo that Trump in giant letters and the fuselage was behind him at every stop when he made his speech except for those events that took place inside actual arenas so I I've been wondering\nHow long it's going to be before somebody on the Democrats' side tries to get in on this action and I always thought you know who I thought it would be that would make the first Abbott trying it Joe Biden I really thought that Joe Biden would be the first guy that try to replicate this\nThen I thought maybe Michelle my bell Obama but then I thought no they've got too much to lose if it doesn't work\nMaybe Kamala Harris maybe some of these ... that somebody's going to do this somebody's got to try if they've got to be able to show the Democrats\nThinking they've got to show that there's as much excitement as much loyalty as\nMuch attention as Trump and draw up till now nobody on the Democratic side has even given it a prayer until the Clintons the daily wire has the story\nPower couple bill and Hillary Clinton

share with you a headline from political Josh just today political story ready for this\nPolitical race ratings than GOP house is crumbling here is the sub the headline Mr ...\nThere are now two hundred nine seats either firmly already leaning in the Democratic column only nine shy of the two hundred eight team needed to win control this is what you were just telling me right and then you've got Republicans telling you that they think this is true\nSome\nI'm not asking for names but you've got some elected Republicans are people in their offices telling you they believe that\nOkay so political says the GOP house is crumbling it's falling apart there are\nTwo hundred nine seats\nFirmly order wing Democrat I guess this is according to polling data to hundred eight teams there's a number of seats you need for\nThe majority in the house or four hundred and thirty five total numbers there to eight teams the majority so\nTo resign seats firmly are leading Democrat I mean this\nIf the Democrats [laughter] nine seats with this this is a white\nBy the Republican Party would have to be a party of for this to happen a party of Adolf Hitler's\nFor this ... this is ... and yet they believe it now\nFolks I don't have any inside their formation on this I don't know anybody with internal polling get I don't know I don't know beans I don't I don't really pay attention to that I never have but the people in Washington live and die by this stuff I'm telling you\nIt is their blood and water and food polling David it's how they get through the day every day pulling anything and if the Democrats are publishing stories to each other that\nTo nine seats are leading their way and if there is no blue wave I don't think there's gonna be an Alan some sanity anywhere to be found on the Democrats' side of the Iowa or in the media\nTo hundred nine seats firmly or leaning\nIn the Democratic column let me ask you a question what could be causing this let's let's assume for a moment just as a as a hypothetical exercise let's assume this is true\nCan you tell me what it is anything one thing a series of things that have American voters\nSo so ticked off at Republicans that they cannot wait\nTo go out and vote Democrat so that the Democrats run the house what is it what have the Republicans done or not done that would warrant this kind of nation wide ...\nWith the party now the left will tell you the answer that question is Trump that the people of this country despise Donald Trump as a people in this country have been poised to send Trump packing ever since election\nNight through thousands sixteen they can't wait to get out there and showed their ... for Trump and the only way they can do it has to vote against Republicans All right well as I say we're hypothetically protesting this is true what has Trump done to generate that kind\nOf disgust other than be alive and be president what has he done no no I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm being serious what you want it\nAll started Lee said he separated families at the border I'm Glad you reminded me of that\nIt's getting harder and harder to watch television shows what was I watching this this last week was premier week for all the new network prime time shows I think it was law and order in yeah law and order and us you'll be or something and\nAnd uh the show started out focusing on a bad guy who had little kids in his basement in a cage and the FDU\nCops are running around trying to prove this guy's a rubber band of the first order and\nYou know no no officer you know our\nGovernment money is separating the two parents that are born or I don't see them\nAnd the cops we bought everything oh wow we don't have a pervert here we have a hero this guy and I watch this well that's it for the show the level of idiocy and stupidity and ignorance that just permeates\nPlaces in this country where it ought not be there people ought to be more educated more informed smarter\nBut that's gone we have replaced informed people educated people learn in people with asthma so load block ad the idiots\n\nWere not separating and Trump never did separate families at the border that is actually Democrat Party policy it's related to families crossing the border illegally seeking asylum\n[noise] Don Juan running around the Senate just begging everybody to get on his way this guy had more allegations I'm literally I remember\nOne of these allegations all kinds of senators came forward to defend it while telling him he needed to resign one of them\nWas a [noise] Sam Nunn of Georgia I'll never forget is attempt saving the reputation of John Cutler I knew John Powell I think John Tower actually was forced to resign and because of one of these things was let me\nBut I'm not kidding I mean this this guy was a ... by reputation\nCocoa get a picture of the guy put him on put him on Rush Limbaugh got caught on trying to find one here to show your digital camera I mean we're not we're not talking about George Clooney here\n[noise] [noise]\nWell anyway Sally Quinn says that John Tower once assaulted her but\nShe didn't come forward and here's what she says Anderson Cooper says look in your memoir you talk about an experience for a sitting Senator John Powell basically tried to sexually assault you in the\nBack of a tax\nFolks John Tower would never be in a taxi that would be such a demeaning kind of car to be in senator you don't drive around and yellow cams\nYou have a car service a limo driver ... well anyway she search it happened in ...\nJohn Powell tried to sexually assault you in the back of the ... you didn't come forward them and you didn't come forward when the senator was nominated for ... that's what it was a nominated the guy for secretary of defense and that's when all this came out\nBut Sally Quinn didn't didn't Anderson Cooper wants to know why she didn't say anything\nDragnet rid of this nightclub and order brandy and wouldn't let go of may and finally I got away and rat out and gotten a cab and he came out and jumped in the cabin jumped on top of me\nAnd basically tried to assault may and the poor cab driver was desperate 'cause I was screaming and pounding Adam than ever stop and I was living at Fort Myer Virginia where my father was station he was in general and the army at the time and a cab driver was about Ninety miles an hour because he realized what was happening in the back of the carbon\nScreech to a halt in front of our quarters and I think then tower got scared because he thought maybe the general would come out with a shot God but I went in the house that night I cried all night long I was absolutely traumatized I never tell my parents are very\nUntil much later several years later\nBecause I was so ashamed and so guilty\nSo Sally Quinn the assaulted by John Tower um\nBut but you know she is the one here yeah there's one more ... we've got Times Square here here's another reason why number forty three when

for decades now the white vote has only then won twice in the last sixty years my husband being one of the two Lyndon Johnson being so it's not a surprise it's a disappointment that white women vote Republican and not for me but it is what it is\n\nAnd they're in Hillary Clinton stumbled and swerved in to a truth\nExcept for a very exceptional election year of Nineteen sixty four which was following the JFK assassination\nThe Democrats have not gotten more than fifty percent of the white vote in the presidential election since Nineteen thirty two\nNow when you look at it that way you can understand why in Democratic Party circles there's hatred for white people white people white women had been rejecting the white married suburban women had been rejecting them this is why this kind of a Nazi movement sprang up this is why\n\nThe ... the left has as it started contacting all different categories for non white suburban women to be plugged\nInto so that they can then be said to be Democrats constituents\nThis and by the way this is again why in Nineteen sixty five Ted Kennedy and the Democrats re opened the floodgates to immigration I Need to remind everybody again from about Nineteen Twenty one and Nineteen twenty three if you're Nineteen sixty five we shut down immigration I\nWould not does eat row\nBut we put very strict limits on it and the reason\nWas to be able to assimilate all of the immigrants that come into the country the late Eighteen hundreds through the Nineteen early twenties\nAssimilation was key to American immigration policy\nArriving immigrants all wanted to be citizens by the way and there were things they had to do to become citizens they had to learn a language and they had to learn the history of America they had to be able to pass questions about the history of America on a test\nAnd they had to swear and plan their loyalty and devotion to the United states and they were eager to do it and they were happy to do it now they they maintain their ethnicity\n\nThe Irish the Italians unit but they wanted to become Americans and they did and it took a number of years to assimilate them all\nWell\nNineteen sixty five is when Ted Kennedy who led the charge to reopen the immigration floodgates which then of course led to once that happens illegal immigration ramped up in an uncontrollable way\nAnd that wave of immigrants starting in Nineteen sixty five came from third world socialist countries Democrats\nRealized they could only when the White House if they changed the population\nOf America they were losing presidential elections with the Native American population because they were losing\nWhite women and Mrs Clinton just admitted in here to Christian I'm poor of CNN it never occurred to them to change their policies what they had to do in order to attract white voters what they had to do was change America\nSo back to Hillary she said what was done last night in the White House meeting Trump apologizing\nFor the nation to Kavanaugh\nWhat was done in the White House last night she said was a political rally it further undermine the image and integrity of the court\nAnd that troubles me greatly Christie on 'em and pour it saddens me because our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillar of our constitution looking at\nThe judicial system has been viewed by do as he lectured insurance the judicial system has been viewed by you and Mrs Clinton the rest of the Democrats as your private refuge\nYou have looked at the court as a place you can stock like minded the leftist activists to make sure things that you believe in which never could pass legislation somehow become law in America that's why they want the courts\nIf you want to really get frustrated you heard me saying that some you've probably heard a lot of other people but stop and think about this outside of Obamacare practically every liberal ... the steak every liberal idea and belief that now is\nThe law in this country would not have become law in Congress because it never would have passed\nLiberalism and the Democratic party's ideas have never been mass popular the only way that we have bastard\nIce pop culture to log on to reality today is because Democrat activists judges have been essentially writing law when they take cases and interpret them and then pronounce decisions\nRoe versus Wade is the most early example of this\nBut there are countless others the simple fact of the matter is the Democratic party has never been capable of winning\nLegislation to implement the ideas they believe in because most of the American people when they know what's at stake don't want them that's the value of judges and that's the value of courts to the Democrats when Mrs Clinton says\nThat what happened in the White House you have a night saddens her\nBecause our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitutional ... B. S. not by you in fact to Hillary Clinton and people like are the Constitution's an obstacle is well it's certainly not something to revere\n... did you see any way even a conservative Steve college when I was speaking to yesterday said the only way to repair America is to try to get back to some civility to try to make it that even if we have political disagreements we're not going to go to war with each other\nWe're not going to destroy each other Hillary Clinton well certainly I Would love to see us returned to civility Christian I'm a poor listening to one another working on our differences but\nThat is not the Republican Party that exist today that is certainly not the administration that we haven't power right now when the Republican Senate denied the right of President Obama to have his nominee for the Supreme Court merit guard and here we go off to the races again\nMiss characterizing that you're blue in the face\nThat's what Joe Biden rule the Democrats invented that rule that presidents don't get the name Supreme Court justices\nDuring vacancies that happened in the last year of their term that's a Democrat inspired instituted rule\nAnd she knows it\nBut the Republicans didn't destroy Merrick Garland the Democrats didn't have to fight battles defending his character and his life because the Republicans were not trying to destroy them as they did Kavanaugh anyway the upshot of\nThis is that Hillary Clinton says it's it's a time for instability in is it time for this kind of extremism because that's what we're up against Steve skill lease\nWho was shot by one of the believers of Hillary Clinton at that Republican baseball practice cannot believe a Bill Cassidy senator from Louisiana responded to Hillary at a time when the Republicans are being shot stabbed docks beaten\nRun out of restaurants and sent death threats Hillary Clinton or just Democrats to be even more uncivil\nWhat an irresponsible statements every Democrat shoved announced they're not going to denounce or they privately publicly encourage ruined by applauded they supported that is who they are\nThis is the party by the way that has been railing against all this instability or I don't know how long this is why\nI look at average American voters paying attention to this and I don't understand how any of them can want to side with what the Democratic Party is doing how they're doing it\nI Know what happens but it's it's a mystery to me my hope is my faith is that this instability this insanity this on the ...\nDemocratic behavior is negatively impacting the Democrats that the Kavanaugh effect pro Republican I Know that's real the polling data indicates that that's real if you want to believe polling data but we're never going to get a poll\nEnd and Kim car dash and a two for they denounce ... and his wife\nKamkar dashing meanwhile Taylor Swift host some music award show last night nobody watched it the ratings plummeted or an all time low\nSo how can it be that Taylor Swift sponsored\nInspired massive voter registration drive after criticizing and Democrat or Republican Senate candidate\nTendency\nNow where is this massive belief and supportive he's got this popularity and people can't wait to do what she says and express their support in why didn't the same people\nTurn around and watch her show that we're not supposed to ask the question of two different things Russia can't extrapolate do voter registration drives an audience was for award show I cam you people can make it up left and right I can probably mild analogies I can ask these questions\nI'm happy to hear you say out there but that this stuff doesn't um\nIntimidate you I think I think it has it intimidated average of Republican voters in a long time elected Republicans are a bit of a different story Dennis in a ... great to have used or how you doing\nGood well thank you long time listener first time caller thank you\nSo it was just a wanting to comment on on the Hillary thing as I listen to do to last night and I can't quote it exactly but she said if you disagree or if\nIf the party is destroying the things you believe in a low that you should be an civil would that not apply to the Democratic party as well Republicans conservatives I'm big on civil to the likes of her\nShort would sure whether it be that's the standard if the party that you oppose is destroying your way of life and you must be an civil against\nBut [noise]\nAnd you know this in the Hillary Clinton Democratic Party world\nUh our world should be destroyed that is just is\nThat is what's called for conservatives and Republicans being destroyed that is the new morality\nFinding backer resisting it we deserve what we're doing\nMy name is ...

in music on an I ... tense pod cast\nGreat thanks for explaining that to make it as long as I can hear you that you know that's all I Need\nThat's that's awesome I I appreciate it but I just to answer your question are we can't divulge members I wouldn't\nTell them the buddy you're a member you know you never know who's gonna\nAlthough we do a San jose Rodriguez and she was equally as perplexed last night could not get over the fact how hostile Trump was to our European your union allies news hostility\nI mean there's so many teachable moments of hissing I've read the transcripts it's I Know what I'm discussing I haven't heard of but we're going to listen to these\nUh together but that back to back to focus on us now\nJim Messina the Obama campaign very disappointed that she would try to steal the news cycle this close to the election\nAnd not that he says\nThey have to win the house and Senate to save America no they have to win the house and Senate to transform and change America against the will of the American people what the Democrats and the American left I Want to do to America is not what most Americans want America to be\n\nThey don't care about that they are willing to force\nWhat they think America should be America's transformation on everybody but thankfully they still have to win elections I still maintain that I don't know when but somewhere down the road they are going to realize that winning elections is the lone remaining obstacle\nTo them getting what they want and at some point they're going to suggest that elections are not worth it because they don't win and they'll come up with some kind of alternative\nI Know it sounds like a long shot but don't don't me I Know these people\nBut only a Democrat folks would think about report from a scientist saying\nThat she might be one one thousand twenty fourth unity and would make their claim a minority status about\nOne one thousand twenty four\nIn the\nElizabeth Warren possibly that that would be point zero nine but that's not even one tenth of one percent fault that's how little\nIndian heritage and\nHas now scientists say that the average European American is zero point eight team percent\nNative American zero point one eight she is point zero nine she is last Native American than the average European American is is er New York times numbers by the way\nElizabeth Warren last Native American than the average European American and let's see what else we have here a than it than it did it Mollie Hemingway favorite part of Warren constantly being one one thousand twenty four Native American is\n\n... is that her twenty twenty campaign is rolling it out as if it's not a complete self own how do they think this was a good idea\nI'll tell you how they think it's a good idea they say\nThey're naming Trump wouldn't they think they're embarrassing Trump remember Trump\nOffered to donate a million dollars to focus hottest as\nCharity if she can prove that she were Native American so she's come out today and she is according to her doctor and sciences and so forth\nEstablish that she is maybe an American and now she's asking Trump to pay off the the the indigenous people circumcision for America group or whatever it is an effort indigenous peoples uh circumcision information of resource or some such thing\nAnd if Trump Gibbs Trump's denying that he made the pledge even though we [laughter]\nWhy not denying it like ... or ...\nYou ever had sex with that woman not a single time ever and that's what Clinton was ... I I Do you need to go back and look what I said I did not say that\nAt most Trump owns a oh it was one\nOne thousand twenty fourth of one million I run the number he always maybe most a thousand dollars\nIf he's going to pay a percentage\nOf the million dollars that equals her percentage of Native American that means he will do just a little over a thousand dollars if he wants to pay it let's go to the audio soundbites we have we have Elizabeth Warren herself this morning\nUh let's see this is on her website she released a video in titled Elizabeth Warren's family story\nIsn't that queen\nElizabeth Warren's family's story in one part of the video focused on us here talks to Stanford University professor of genetics Dr Carlos\nBustamante and here is a portion of their conversation\nDocuments to Montana please\nHundreds genome we didn't find vibes segments of Native American ancestry with very high confidence where we believe the error rate is less than what I found\nNow president like to call my mom a liar\nWhat is the fact that we have a Native American ancestry and you're just casual reader needed\nFor the nation violence for generations and Trump can say whatever he wants to mocking Native Americans or any in order to try to get me [noise]\nOkay\nNow I understand why Jim Messina and the rest of the gang it'll after all you have a Twitter here because she is making at about her on a\nBasically non story I mean this is the ... election coming up isn't there isn't a single vote that has anything to do with her she hasn't even announce for\nThe president in fact she said just the opposite she says she's not going to run so given that why is she intruding here I'll tell you she thinks\nLike all the others on the left do they think if they can be the one to destroy Trump if they can be the one to illustrate that whatever they think of Trump is true that they will be heroes heroines are heroes they think they will be loves it adored that's there are so Trump focused their so Trump obsessed\nThat it is taking them off of their game again reminder New York times Elizabeth Warren is only possibly one one thousand twenty fourth point zero nine percent Indian the average European American is zero point one a person that other words\nShe is less than half\nAs much Native American as your average European American is\n\nSo here's Moore this is a again on her website she was released this new video and titled Elizabeth Warren's family story in another part of this exciting video\nWe have a number of university professors talking about whether her Native American heritage came up when they were considering hiring her as a professor and we've got a University of Texas at Austin law professor Jay Westbrook another professor from the same place Doug\nLake Koch people's names fascinate me Doug lake Koch Harvard law school professor Randy Kennedy a\nUniversity of Houston law professor John ... mix and and the University of Pennsylvania law professor\nHank Gutman right and so here they are\nNo bearing on our higher\nPeriod I was sharing the committee that your fitness even part of the discussion I would've known about it and her name with respect to racial minorities hired\nNo never that's nonsense we decided to hire the best there was on the ...\nWait a minute the story is not these guys are stories Harvard why is there anybody from Harvard harbored as winter she used to get hired as a process [noise]\nLet's see if we wanted list to get him to the University of Texas Texas ... there is a Harvard law I'm Sorry Randy Kennedy her name with respect to racial minorities hires no never [noise]\nWell [noise] I don't know if he was the one that did the hiring but she used it they're here is this is kind of funny to this will see it in his new day to day they co host Jon Berman they co host at Allison ... talking about Warren's video which\nShe says shows that she does have high cheekbones because she is Native American\nA scientist or whose name is Carlos deep boost my day from Stanford University says she somewhere between one thirty second Native American and won five hundred and twelve Native American interests ways in there somewhere they believe that it's her great great great grandmother was Native American\nGreat great great great grandmother they got the percentage raw gets double the won five hundred and twelve it's it's one one thousand\nTwenty fourth [noise] anyway this my friends will not be settled\nUntil of course we get to the Democratic presidential debates\n\nAnd I have a story coming up later on the ... told me from [noise] here we go CNN itself went out there and did a poll\nOf potential democratic candidates for president and their popularity\nWho people would be most inclined to support today for the Democrat Party nomination number one\nJoe Biden\nHigh Jerry Lewis I'm here with Michael from Connecticut water he sold me my system and I love getting fresh delicious water right out of my tap\nYour did you notice before you got the system your water maybe had a smell to it yeah it was disgusting yeah during the Korean in the water growing does its job but after the job is done you don't want to be drinking swimming pool of water in Connecticut ... fire drinking station will remove their Korean\nTell me more about this case five drinking station there is no other system certified to remove more contaminants\nIt even removed bacteria and viruses from your water ... the real deal we've been in business since Nineteen Seventy and all of our products are made in America and now you can save twenty percent up a key part of drinking water station which happens to be rated number one by Consumer Reports you can take advantage of this twenty percent off special\nBut calling my office to nine three\nSixty six maybe seven and tell them you on the twenty percent geared and Michael special that's to nine three sixty six eighty seven\nYears thousands dollars now why do you wonder if you're going to let me introduce her radio in the state of data to find these kind of money to do you want to [noise]\nOkay that's a set up to our Lesley Stahl Donald Trump sixty minutes interview I Want to go back\nIn April twenty nine two thousand twelve of them over six years ago this is Leslie stall interviewing CIA interrogator hosts say about this she says\nSome college ... Mohammed was subject to waterboarding specifically one hundred eighty three pouring water about a half dozen separate sessions Jose Rodriguez said the average pouring lasted ten seconds\nWe not have somebody twenty five\n\n[noise] do we have a number twenty six the soundbite number twenty six play just\nGive it okay well so much for that um what\nJose Rodriguez says ... can I say something about college like Mohammed he's the one that was responsible for the death of Danny Pearl the wall street reporter he slit his throat in front of a camera I don't know what type of man it takes to cut the throat of somebody in front of you like that but I can tell you this is an individual probably they were rats rear end about having waterboarding his base\nHe never believed for a second year we're going to kill him know and let me tell ya he will use his fingers to count the number of seconds because he knew that in all likelihood we would stop at ten it's doesn't sound like a person Who's Afraid of dying Lesley Stahl says so what happens he\nBreakdown does he cried dizzy fall apart no he gets a good night's sleep you get to ensure by the way it was very heavy when he came to watch the last fifty pounds Lesley Stahl what he's ensure you mean like people in the hospital drink that stuff yes dietary manipulation was part of our dire techniques\nYou totally mocking her Leslie stall so sleep\nDeprivation dietary manipulation I mean this is overwhelming steps the U.S doesn't do that\nWill say Rodriguez well we do it would've been a perfect\nSet up for Leslie stall and Donald Trump or going to get to that coming out of the break here at the bottom of the hour hang on\nWill listen to it together because as I say I didn't see it last night [noise]\nMy sister are OCD way too early to most plumbers work on commission that means the more you spend more than a main summer she worked on commission are incentivized to sell you more than you really mean I hate that and we don't do that in the sunny farmers\nAre guys that exists salary and they're paid bonuses for efficiency sunny summers incentivized to get here quickly when you need them and then do whatever you need done quickly and quietly and affordable\nSunny summers and not the queen how much you use them to leave you with\n\nYour ... anything about here since\n... going to say I like tomorrow morning starting in ... the [noise]\n\nReadings are welcome back my friends ... Russia ... behind the golden the ivy a microphone great to have you here [noise]\nYeah we're going to be discussing them in terms of the media is now flooding the zone with polling data showing that it's hopeless for Republicans just\nBugs steel yourself for this this is predictable it was going to happen and they're also going to say that it's all based around Trump it's all based on Trump hatred it's all based on people rip regretting their vote for Trump a re reading the direction America is going in all of that I just saw it happen on CNN a\nIndependent voter is switching math in ways that Democrats in the run up to the mid term elections\nAnd if I were you I've I hold off on on believing it and as we get closer here I Know there's early voting going on we're going to tackle some of this I you know in an added to it in a way\nI Can't wait until the week before the election for a full court press because of the\nEarly voting that that is uh that that's happening out there so\nIt's just it's an ongoing effort to try to dispel people of popular myth that the left bands together you don't well I think one of the most effective ways\nOf getting people to think about this how many people have you heard people say this is the most important election of our lives and that's why it's not\nThis is not the most important election of our lives to thousands sixteen was\nIf Hillary had one in two thousand six that that's what we need to focus that's the kind of stuff we need to ask people to consider what would be happening in America right now in the past two years of Hillary had one\nWho would be running various cabinet posts and agencies what do we know today that we would not know if Hillary had one\nIncluding names of people and what they've been doing if you have people between the eyes with\nWhat would America be today if Hillary had one\nIt's a different way of getting people to focus on the importance of the elections\nUh the the drive by us have their formula\nAnd it's rooted in the desire they have an everybody hate Trump\nAnd so that desire becomes narrative and then that narrative becomes the result\nPolling data and since the media so have strong they want everybody else to therefore the trend is pro Democrat in the mid terms in their polling data because people have a wake up and realize what a mistake they made voting for Trump none of that is true\nExcept on the hard left where it's always been true there is nothing new about it and it's not confined to Trump patronage hatred of everybody that isn't\nThem\nLike I said just based on the last two weeks in the Capitol hearing the Democrat Party today as constant deserves to lose in the biggest landslide in a history of landslides the Democrat Party deserves to get Bob on the actions taken by their lunatic and paid supporters\nAre just outrageous the kinds of things that they are engaging in and then the decent world and in a sand society they wouldn't be punished gravely\nIn the midterms I still hold out hope that they could be my point is we will get to all of this as the day is unfold\nIn this weekend in coming weeks but here we go with Donald Trump and Leslie stall on sixty minutes provide providers that are soundbites work I'm not confident now so the only way to know is to give it a shot the first one is\nLeslie stall talking to Trump about the supposedly the hostility that he has created\nBetween the European Union allies and us\nWell I I mean once ally we have wonderful relationships with a lot of people but we don't want to teach us much worse than the European Union the European Union on line was formed in order to take advantage of us on trade and that's what they've done this is hot and yet they it's not hostile sounds hobby you know some of the way they treat us\nWhat somebody can't in daily within within this country for so many years I knew willing to get rid of that western alliance now I like they don't then aside\nBut you know why we shouldn't be paying almost the entire cost of NATO to protect you up and then on top of that they take advantage of us on trade and not going to do it any more they understand okay\n[noise] so\nWhat once again we have here the concept but just so hostile de ... ... it sounds so hostile it sounds so mean eight pounds so it sounds so it's this it's confrontational and of course in the eyes of the left we\nWant to be Europe they want us to be Europe they want us to be westerns\nSocialists they think still functioning at a democracy but but that's that's what they want us so we should be forthcoming and tolerant we should be welcoming we should be in ... ourselves\nAnd this by the way this is just Donald Trump keeping a number of promises\nWhich say what you want this guy has kept more promises probably all politicians in history combined\nKinetic who's been in business is Nineteen Seventy a rosy\n\nNasty on my heart radio yeah I enjoy the stimulation\n\nHaving a minor correction it's a it's a variety in which the\nEffort by Leslie stall this ripped to shreds not Vanity Fair it's six of one and a half dozen the variety is not so much a celebrity focused ran against Vanity Fair is a but they are both left wing entertainment oriented and they do comments on left wing entertainers actors\nActresses\nTV so called journalist and so forth and and it it's just a a little minor correction I get them confused occasionally here is that just another sample from last night Trump and Leslie stall\nAs it you know General Mattis that to you the reason for NATO and the reason for all these alliances in St prevent World War three no it's not true but frankly I like General Mattis I think I Know more about it than he does and I know more about it from the standpoint of fairness that I can tell you one more time\nOkay I Know unless you have to try again I Know how am I ... the answer is this I Will always be there\nWith NATO but they have to pay their way I'm fully in favor of NATO but I don't want to be taken advantage of\nWhite in general manager so I think I Know more about it than he does I Know more about it from the standpoint of fairness that I can tell you he's talking about the fairness of do is the fairness of all the NATO members paying their own way\nHe's also talking about people like Angela Merkel making a side deal with Russia and potent for natural gas shipments\nExplosively into Germany ignoring other NATO allies and you'll notice a sixty minutes isn't going to Angela Merkel and asking her why she is undermining NATO\nTrump\nAlready called her out on it for doing this the Trump supposedly in the pockets of the of the Russians but Trump knows what sixty minutes or less me still trying to do here that's what they don't get\nThey can sneak up on people anymore particularly Trump he knows\nYou know in fact you know one thing he says I don't know if we've got an a roster coming up probably do he said something to her that is as as honest and true is anything he's ever said because I Know Donald Trump I've known him a long time I play golf and I've known him a long time before he ran for office\nAnd he would ask me about various Democrats asked me about Obama and I can tell that sometimes when I told him what I think he didn't agree especially when discussions in the media came up\nHe thought I was maybe just a little bit over the top exaggerated in some of the things I Would tell him but my opinions with the media he said to her\nI had no idea and I'm being really serious with you Leslie I had no idea how dishonest media is until I ran for president I had no idea I being really serious with you he said\n\nAnd I I think that's probably true as a New Yorker and immersed in New York media where he was a star\nWhen he wasn't running for office it was a local New York's but you know he made fun of him and they laugh but but he was a big get he appeared everywhere and they loved him and he was great front cover back cover of the tabloids the daily news and the post\nWhen he ran for president that's when all of the good vibes about trauma there were some bad things too I mean he didn't get universally loved praised coverage but it all vanished when he ran\nAnd he was surprised in a way kind of like McCain was\n\nSo when he said to her last night I had no idea I really telling you Leslie I'm really shocked that was really surprised about this\nOn us that's the word he uses instead of biased\nAnd I can tell you that that's true now what else has he learned that he didn't know but he knew\nBefore he ran for office and I think a lot about the left a lot about Democrats particularly liberal Democrats but he hadn't thought of in ways you and I did but now since he suffered the treatment is fully\nRush Limbaugh\n\nShiite fees Mitt working pretty smart Russia is on CNN [noise]\nFolks the IRS does not mess around you know this they have the power to take

payers paid more than the bottom Seventy percent\nIn two thousand one in the bottom fifty percent paid nearly five percent of the top one thousand percent pay to point three so the burden of paying taxes is increasing on the rich\nNot decreasing it is not true to say they are not\nPaying their fair share\nNow this is as it's supposed to be by the way when there are marginal rate tax reductions when you reduce\nIncome tax rates you generate more tax revenue\n\nBecause people shelter last they avoid if if if you if you tell people they're going to be able to keep say Seventy cents of every dollar as opposed to keeping\nForty cents or fifty cents of every dollar then they'll work much less hard at sheltering it and she'll it'd be more inclined to ...\nPlus you have more tax payers because all these people end up hiring more people as the economy grows so the fact that the rich are paying more is actually part and parcel with the theories behind supply side economics supply side\nPolicy but the bottom line is does anybody think it's fair that fourteen hundred people for\nGene hungry people out of three ... some odd million is it fair to fourteen hundred people one thousand four hundred people are paying more money in taxes than the bottom Seventy percent\nCombined\nAnd yet we never stop hearing how unfair\nIt\nThe rich are not paying their fair share it's a constant refrain and I doubt that it's ever gonna change\nBecause if you get the votes of all fourteen hundred people you're not going to win anything you need the votes of the people in the bottom Seventy percent\nSo you need to pander to them you need to constantly tell them how they're getting ripped off you didn't tell them how people aren't paying their fair share the left is very very good at this and what the lived ends up doing is telling people\nWere going to punish those rich we're going to punish them for you it's not fair didn't fair to have so much more money than you or is not fair to not paying your fair share and their fair share of taxes that we're going to ... the bottom Seventy physical yeah baby punish them\n[noise]\nCNN's Chris Cuomo the son of Mario the pious\nSaid

same as the Obama law you know Obama had the same time it was on the books but he didn't enforce that line for them were launched that the zero tolerance policy [noise]\nDeter families with children now and then everybody decided and the courts don't want separation and frankly when you don't do separate when you\nAllow the parents to stay together okay when you allow that\nThen what happens is people are going to pour into our console you gonna go back to that last is Leslie for coming into our country\nIllegally and part of the I mean part of the reason that I have to blame myself the

she's she misspoke there\nThis law on the ...

savings\nI agree with that look a intersection out it comes straight out of Marxism march said that at every one is either on oppressor or oppressed they're either bourgeois or Pearl a target\nAt its later it's now being adopted to the idea of being able to declare ... so what you are how oppressed and how much of an approach where you are it's called intersection nowadays because instead of just being one camp or the other\nIt spread across race gender sexual preference and other variables\nYes okay that's it intersection out it'll be for me\nGreat honor to wash your you're talking you're you're\nSpeaking in language of uh people formerly educated on Marxism many people aren't that's why it's so successful um yes any intersection adult aid is basically something that has been constructed by these marches\nJust saying that all of these different leftist organizations meet somewhere they all intersect with each other the feminist have this strain about them that that that uh\nUh cohabitation with that with militant Islam is that then with illegal immigrants and their activist and we're all of these people intersect is where they unified\nWell yes but it also applies to the individual because of these let's say five different dimensions\nYou you are on a different scale and all of those and they intersect into a single number quantifiable says that this is how much of an oppressor or oppressed you are this is where you're on the scale\nOf course this is the root of all this recent white privilege stuff pops ... absolutely\nSo now Elizabeth Warren because she wants to uh justify her cultural appropriation of a Harvard professor ... has to claim a particular percentage of intersection now with the oppression\nTo speak their language so she is saying that
