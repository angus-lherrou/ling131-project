tomorrow somebody Sally for answering the call on short notice it was twenty minutes I guess when you don't want to censor the message to which he answered which is fantastic she was in another event but it just goes to show you that hey\nThis is the one individual in politics to answer the call when you need it and that's what we need in order to be a property represented within our government take the time go out there and vote to the research do what needs to be done um make sure that law abiding\nPoliticians in positions make sure that the ridicule\nOf law enforcement stops and we get the right folks there follow us on Facebook Instagram and Twitter\nTo next week stay safe and God Bless\nTheir views and opinions expressed in this episode are solely those of the host and guess they do not necessarily reflect the positions or policies of the national border patrol council the United states border patrol any other government agency or this station\nFor regionals unions do you do not\nFrom the region will studio your local areas where you will dot com is in a CD in southern Louisiana high art radio station [noise]\nKeeping up his campaign blimps this is Fox News President Trump hits the road again this week going to bat for Republicans in a sprint to the mid term elections\nIs out there encouraging it Mazie Hirono was out there and get your Mazie Hirono Mazie Hirono says people are totally justified in harassing Republicans in public in restaurants and even in their homes\nAnd forcing them out because they're white racist white supremacist totally totally justified so there's a part of me that knows the Democrats are promoting this there's another part I think some Democrats do not think that this dirt range psychological upset\nIs tied to them\nWell let me put it this way if we had people on our side behaving like this it would worry me to death it would worry me to death that voters are going to think\nThat conservatism is made up of deranged lunatics like this the Democrats don't seem to be concerned about that at all some of them like Nate Silver here don't even think\nThat that behavior is assumed by voters\nTo be the behavior of mainstream Democrats\nAnd I I Wonder if that's true and if it is true how can they be ... to ... if it isn't true and if they are aware of it and are proud of it and are encouraging it\nThen the question becomes this when you get into turn out for the November elections in the midterms by the you know what people are now saying Mr certainly ... the Democrats some of the people on TV are saying well I I don't think that we know yet what issues are going to determine the vote in a bit [laughter]\nI Wonder where they heard that I Wonder where they heard that idea of what we don't\nKnow yet of the issues are actually going to determine turn out and vote of happened yet they're still among think oh it for the midterm elections\nIt is a interesting question though will any of the passion fade away on either or both sides\nOf this and that's on the Democrats' side it's not going to fade away and I think everybody needs to notice on the Democratic side this deranged lunacy has become the defining characteristic of today's Democratic Party and the American left\nYou have to remember these people have been off their rocker since November of two thousand sixteen\nThey have been mad\nInsane crazy percolating compounding come pressing all of this ever since they haven't been loaded for bear ever since\nElection day and the day after a two thousand sixteen and this ... situation comes up\nAnd I don't think on the Democrats' side they can get any more hysterical and I don't think they can get any more motivated than they are I think they're at their peak right now\n\nI mean they're still talking about investigating Kevin off for under ... wants to see\nThe F. B. I. documents released\nShe wants a full fledged investigation of Kevin all the Democrats are fucking you're talking about Gerald ... House Judiciary committee ranking member of the Democrats promising if the Democrats win the house and they're going to impeach cabinet they're going to investigate him getting thrown off the\nCourt they're not\nThey're not going to let this side this cabinet thing is not over and they're going to continue to rile their side up and motivate them and encourage them to continue engaging in\nWhat you and I would call this massive civil disobedience although it's more than that it is it is genuine child like I don't even try like ... ... we're just we're dealing with a complete emotional breakdown\nAnd a group of people I don't care whether they're paid or not ... I don't I don't want to fall back on that to suggest that this anger they feel is not legitimate is legitimate whether they're being paid or not I don't think that means that the real enthusiasm a Democrat voters is less than what we think it is\n\nJust because some people have announced that they accept the money to go do this stuff I don't I don't think that they would sit around and do nothing in twiddle their thumbs all weekend long if they weren't being paid I think the Democrat rages real and it's been a real sense election night\nTwo thousand sixty and they thought they are going to win that aren't they going to land so they haven't been able to come to grips with that even now the capital of the thing is just further evidence that the election and consequences they censor themselves losing control and losing and losing and they can't deal with it\nThey simply cannot deal with it and rather than do what's necessary to put themselves back together and become a winning\nEnterprise they continue with their primary strategy of trying to tear down and destroy the opposition and eliminate it\nRather than do what's necessary to reach a broad swath of the majority of the American people which they cannot do in their current makeup which is why I ask\nOver and over if the Democrats ab large elected Democrats really are unaware of the impression these people are creating about them\n\nAnd when these are mad in saying this gusting Democrats protesters they are identified with the Democratic party and I don't know if some elected Democrats really get that I can be all wet that could totally get it and they could be promoting it and which is probably closer\nTo the to the truth than not but for those that don't get it it amazes me that it is possible that these professional\nDemocrats are like Nate Silver do not consider these protesters to be members of their party and representative of\nThe uh the party at large here's J Christian Adams writing it PJ Media Kavanaugh photos fills Senate gallery was sounds of the insane\nSo but it was any doubt that the opposition to Kevin always on hinged on civil disruptive rooted borderline nuts my experience in the gallery made it clear I have visited this is Chris Adams riding I visited the hospitals for the seriously mentally\nIll and the shrieks from this woman in the Senate gallery were as odd and on earth weight as anything I ever heard in side and a mental hospital they echoed off the halls and ceilings outside the gallery and decreasing but astonishing with dude\nAnd then the role was called it sounded like the gates of hell opened up nearly a dozen women erupted in unison shouting how willing screaming in an unrecognizable venomous whale and they wouldn't stop this was jewelry was rage was he\nIt was poison in the noise\nThey were the sounds of a group of people tinkering with discord ... madness and they were the sounds of irrational on their hands down on more word limit lunatics\nThese were the people who oppose Kavanaugh's nomination they weren't an embarrassment to themselves and their rights pay attention that's what the left sounds like yeah it is in the Democratic party doesn't seem to least bit concerned about it\nThe Democratic party doesn't seem to be the least bit embarrassed by it the Democratic party at large doesn't seem to worry at all that this kind of discord madness is going to negatively impact them in the elections\n\nIn fact they may think the opposite they may think that this is what's going to further inspire more discordant madness\nWhich will result in massive turnout\nThey believe it's going to frighten Republicans in tune not confronting them and basically letting them have their way because who wants to deal with lunatics\nEnvy insane face to face but what it means to me is I don't know that they can get\nMore rapid\nI don't know that there's anything else it can happen to get the more fired up than they are\nSteven cold there\nAs a writer on his staff that show couldn't the curb without writers very proud to say here no writers on the Rush Limbaugh and every time I see this I don't care if it's Carson Carson had writer's Letterman had writers\nThe Daily Show had writer's a lot of them twelve to fourteen of them out there every one of these late night shows has writers we don't have any writers here now\nGranted we all do monologue standup jokes here but we do delve into exquisite comedy and humor frequently but there aren't any writers here\nAnd it just I mean some professional thing with me how much credit you these hosts get when they don't even write most of their own material\nAnd the people who do write are not ever supposed to be known they're supposed to do the fleet willingly be invisible\nStand or sit in the background and never let it be said that they provide the material for the host of the Navy's late night shows\nWell there are no producers here and there are no writer here and there are no segments here and there are no story born there is no segment lay out or any of that the show just happens but one of the writers\nMaybe I had reported none of that
