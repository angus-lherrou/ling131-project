to the election who's thinks this is going to help Democrats how what it does help Democrats\n\nIt's not just Trump separating him as Trump not letting them in either there has to be what it is these people actually are figuring that a massive care they don't understand that\nThis kind of thing is why Donald Trump was elected Donald Trump was elected to stop this kind of thing to stop this invasion and that's what this is this is an organized bought and paid for invasion\nImage growing so obviously the plan is for this group of people including the children to arrive here\nVery close to the election and for Trump just sick ice on them and the border patrol on them and to deny them entry or\nTo separate the children from the adult so that's a drive by media can then kick into gear with stories that are already written that are all ready taped\nInterviews with people on the caravan already in McCann where these people will say they're shocked they came to America to save their lives were their children and do improve their latest they won't let them in this is like anything they ever heard about\nThe cuts of pictures of Trump smiling as people are denied entry Democrats think this\nYou know I I Would think that if somebody politically did this it'd be a conservative group might do this\nTo promote Republican turnout\nThat we don't have anybody on our side who thinks that way but it makes more sense that way\nOr am I missing something\nA massive group of four thousand people is growing including kids marching toward the United states with no attempt to making patently obvious what it is\nAre not people fleeing anything these are not people fleeing the Saudi Government they're not fleeing torture not fleeing will they be fleeing poverty but that happens every day for thousands of illnesses aren't just treated it's planned it's walking paper somehow this is supposed to end up making\nThe night in states look bad that\nAh I'm not ... that's the way these people are figuring it going to play out then we have the Mueller report\nThat\nWill not be released before the election but we're being told that it is nearing completion and then it is ready to go\nI went through yesterday what the what the hope here is uh the hope here is to revive the Trump colluded with Russia narrative and to make people think that we're just days or weeks away from proof being released\nWhether we can't do it before the election because of regulations and decency and so we're not going to influence the outcome of elections but Muller is ready to go at once in a while I've been doing well Mueller has been looking for evidence of tropical to go to Russia so if Mueller's ready to go Mahler must have found the but this is what they want everybody to think\n\nAbout the fact of the matter is it's probably the exact opposite I'll let me find the that if they find these sounds I hear\nThat puts this in perspective hang on and when I look at this at won't take long hair folks I as I say I'm having a compressed everything here it is not pretend audio soundbite number ten and this is this is deep\nState ranking member Phil Mudd he is a former intelligence official now works as a commentator on CNN last night Wolf Blitzer show the situation room\nIs a counterterrorism center specials what he is and Blitzer said do you think that Mueller is preparing new indictments\nThe really interesting part of this is a potential report a draft report a narrative if you will from Mali going over Rosenstein let me play this out Washington Rosenstein gets the narrative that says not only\nThis is what we found that my violate the law this is my picture of what happened during the investigation there is going to be some dirt in there so in addition to the diamond I really want to see what's in that narrative report\nHey so this\nIs wearing mission is going to Mueller report is going to be full of supposedly horrible stuff Trump is\nNone none of which is probably going to be indicted all none of which is going to be impeachable although the Democrats win the house they're going to make moves in that direction anyway um but he says the important point of the smaller report will be the dirt dirt nothing in\nWhich there is nothing less they make it up there never has been any Trump collusion and there never has been the evidence or less they make it up so the smart money is that it's going to be filled with things that are accusatory that blamed Trump's\nIncompetence ineptitude essentially blame Trump for being sold in over his head that it looked like the Russians had worked with him to steal the election despite the fact that there is any hard evidence\nIt's hard to refute the idea of going to make it look like Trump is in over his head doesn't know what he's doing threatens the country with his presidency because of his incompetence\nThat's what it's going to be but let's take a look at an alternative view from Sydney Powell\nWho is work we have referenced many times\nOn this program she has written a book chronicling they deception and the abuse of power but corruption in the department of justice traced all the way back to the Enron task force many of the same lawyers here we're working with Mahler\nEnter headline she published this up yesterday at the Daily Caller Mahler Xinjiang is up but that's not enough\nMeaning\nTrump still ... of the country something here despite the fact Muller hasn't found anything\nThe boiler witch hunt is effectively over writes ms Powell not because Mahler and not plan to drag this out until they could contact the crime against Trump for a member of his family but rather because the ... up\nHave you noticed how long it's been since anybody even suggested that the president's sit down with the special counsel for an interview\nMueller's reason for existing was the outrageous purposefully propagandize per verification as the Trump campaign and even Trump himself colluded with Russia to ring\nThe twenty sixteen presidential election against Hillary Clinton the Democrats who perpetrated this fraud or not only masters of rejection and deception they took their play book of personal destruction to a whole new level\n\nTalked about this whole thing with ah with handled in the interview the out the genuine out rage is this that this is the ... the literal criminal acts committed by Hillary Clinton and all of the people on her team of the Obama the OJ\nThe FBI and none of that ever investigate it and the the purpose of Mueller's investigation is to actually provide cover\nFor the real criminality that was going on\nThere is a story here from CNBC it's it's another story about the economy here and I'm frankly done that anybody in the dry visors reporting this as accurately as they are us seeing ... was rise in household well this is according to the\nCredits we uh you know we now have we have the news yesterday that we have seven million job openings and six million unemployed\nBut we're we have one million more jobs open than there are people to fill them\nWhich means it's a it's a workers market we've had a a boy's market is a story

why should I tell you because it's not going to air anyway it wasn't profane it wasn't insulting or anything it just took it out to different Fox rush okay fine but I'm\nI'm just saying folks you have to watch it yourself what about you rushed I never thought I'd never like myself on TV it's one of the reason I don't want to do it\nEvery time I watch myself on TV all I say is damaged I should've said acts are should've added this or did it I never have that reaction after a radio show every time on TV\n[noise] damn I should've said oh darn it why didn't I keep that train of thought going or whatever [noise]\nSo I Want to show you something of a digital camera I got an email here this is about yard signs you know what I've been hearing\nIs that people all over the country are afraid to put yard signs out because literally afraid leftist knobs coming to their homes and not just ripping the signs out but doing damage to their houses\nAnd so people who are tending to vote Republican are not putting yard signs that remember we had a call here I just maybe\nThree weeks ago now from a caller who said\nRussia I'm worried I'm not seeing any yard signs we saw Trump the yard signs everywhere in two thousand\nSection you know I'm not seeing any yard signs at all I said well back camp that can't that looked into it and I found out that there is the leftist scaring the hell out of a lot of people and if that frightened\nAlso includes scaring them not to go vote there are a lot of people scared to death with these maniacs and that's why\nYard signs without being put out I I was part of me understands it another part of me she's afraid of yard signs are you kidding [laughter] from the country that storm the beaches in Normandy we're afraid of a yard sign\nBlocked it's a different era and these people on the left her crazed or making doing good job of making themselves look that way\nSo I have a video taken by it Ted Cruz worker I Can't I'm not going to show your video on the digital camera so I put it\nTook a still shot that what a pup a pop up here just second this picture you're going to see us from a video taken by cruise worker who was putting up crews campaign signs in uh Houston neighborhood Montrose and there was this guy\nDemonic looking guy following the Cruz supporter around ripping up every yard sign ripping it out of the ground and then they're ripping it to shreds\nAnd at one point he stormed the Cruz supporter who was a video showing him on his camera and got this demonic threatening look on his face\nStarts shouting till the cruise support or how much she hates cruise despises grows\nAnd I've taken still shut up put it up there this is the guy that was running around taking cruise lines down ripping up out of yards\nAnd this still shot he is storming the Cruz supporter who is holding the camera he actually got within two inches of the camera I didn't know shot that point 'cause all you see is the guy's flaring nostrils\nBut this guy is out there following cruise people around taken a cruise yard signs out and then threatening\nCruise supporters who have videotape him doing this by the way this guy so long haired maggot infested rock and roll type you can see that and he's a he's wearing mustard yellow\nToo real so I'm trying to wonder why even the ... what's the purpose of this piece the left turns not that illusion they want you to know\nThey want readers to know this western is by golly by gosh for real\n\nThe sub had like many overnight sensations in has been years in the making what we know this to like go back to the Nineteen twenties in the Soviet Union if you want to trace the beginnings of this\n\nOver the past eight years begins and Mr Thomas Bee and sold the Democrat electorate has moved steadily to the left as liberals have displaced moderates self identified the liberals of all races and ethnicities now command a majority in the Democratic party\nRaising the possibility that view is once confined mainly the party elite\nHave spread to the rank and ... on [noise]\nOn up the Democrat Party elite sad to say we're never these radical left is now I'm going back free Clinton\nThe Democrat Party moderate elite has been overtaken by the left wing radicals and that's why some are scratching their heads anyway\nFrom two thousand one to two thousand eight team to share a Democrat voters would describe themselves as liberal has grown from thirty to fifty percent yeah well you don't want to know something else the percentage of Americans that call themselves liberal is shrinking now into the high mid thirties\nThirty five percent tops the American people identify themselves as liberal he doesn't say that [noise]\nI'm adding that the percentage of Democrats who say they are moderate has fallen from forty four to thirty five percent percentage of self identified conservative Democrats has gone from twenty five to Thirteen percent that here we go now this is a long piece but this next graph assist them money\nCrafts ready well educated whites especially white women\nAre pushing the Democrat Party this they simply leftward\nAccording to Gallup the share of white Democrats calling themselves liberal on social issues has grown\nSince two thousand and one from thirty nine sixty one percent of because of this growth white liberals are now roughly forty percent of all democratic voters\nWhile a substantial percentage of Democrat minorities identifies liberals those percentages have not\nBeen growing it anywhere near the rate they have for white Democrat\nWait a minute in two thousand to Lebanon white working class was totally go to hell now all of a sudden the white women are the majority of the party ended the percentage of the Democrats represented by\nMinorities is not growing\nYou mean\nI guess that's why Trump's approval number amongst Hispanics Latinos and African Americans is at a record high\nFor Republican candidates\nWhile a substantial percentage of Democrat minorities identify as liberals those percentages have not been growing anywhere near the rates that they had been for white Democrat so blacks and Hispanics have not contributed significantly\nTo the rising percentage of self identified Democrats liberals\nIn fact says Mr Thomas Bee ends all white liberals are well to the left of the black electorate on some social issues take the issue of discrimination\nAs a factor holding back African American advancement white liberals are to the left of black Democrats\n\nWasting a much stronger emphasis then African Americans\nNow wait because earlier this week we had a story but the Republican Party Owens white suburban women right we did so who is who is white\nWomen making up the majority of Democrats liberalism\nWho are but back in a minute [noise] shrimp boat Rochelle may be missed word [laughter]\nOn CNN\nWide your old brutalized\nLaw enforcement officers gunned down\nThese are the victims of illegal immigration American Life destroy our broken immigration laws\nRather than fighting back\nAnd conservative congressman Kevin McCarthy is leading the fight\nKevin McCarthy ... and did force the low back fully funds President Trump's border wall expands caseload to utilize criminal legal immigrants and insurers only American citizens have the right to vote\nConservative solution America deserves the leadership of President Trump's nice\n\nRepublican history teacher is Liz mayor said yeah yeah it's just another Trump tweet in an on going pattern\nWhen you constantly behave in an outrageous fashion people get immunized and numb to it\nAnd in fact [noise] [noise]\nRight on cue I have a piece in the wall Street Journal they're written it was just certainly this the name of Lance tomorrow ring a bell\nTo you [noise] [noise] Lance Morrow used to practically run time magazine back in this I mean he was the premier journalists not was not an executive buddy practically ran the place\n\nI met him at Mr ... home he ... you were a good buds but land tomorrow was a a\nTypical criminalist which means means left in so far he's got a piece in the wall Street Journal\nThat is the headline is we've grown accustomed to Trump always concern is that Trump's\nOutrageousness no longer fuels anger on the left as it should give people just got used to it\n\nAnd then the the anger subsides it's bad because that's the only thing that Democrats have to get their people to the polls\n\nAnd here comes ... mayor a Republican strategist making the same point but she's not doing it in a positive way yeah you know what this guy's miner ripper bay for so long and just people who have gotten used to it\nShe says\nI don't believe the headline Trump attacks fuel Republican that maybe the headline is true the Republicans fearful about losing suburban women but I don't think Trump's comments stop and think\nFor a minute here there may be an isolated case of a\nSuburban woman [noise] thinking that I Can't support this guy he just called a porn star a horse race\n\nBut this election is really important and people that are involved in this election now how important it is and people that have voted for Trump in the past and have voted Republican know how important\nI just don't I don't think the media's learned his lesson yet this is not the kind of thing that is going to cause Trump to lose an election you mean in a few votes here\n\nIt may it may have caused other Republican candidates to you know lose maybe hold elections but but but not Trump\nI just think it's all part of the equation in which Trump critics still don't get it they don't get the bond between Trump and his supporters they never will understand it because they're not curious to understand that\nAnd so they take these things that they think are just outrageous insults just so totally permissible in American politics\nAnd they assume this has it dead zip Trump's finished this has to be it and not even the Access Hollywood video in it\nThis isn't going to do it\nFrom the fuel dot com Trump threatens military action of Mexico does not stop this immigration onslaught\nPresident Trump today warned that he may take military action to stop immigrants from crossing the southern border into the U.S may just not take action to stop the onslaught this is the caravan that's headed our way\nTrump railed against Guatemala Honduras and el ... saying that they have almost no control over their population\nI'm watching the Democratic party land because they want to open borders and existing week laws I'm watching a Democrat Party whether salt on our country by Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador leaders are doing little to stop this large flow of people including many criminals entering from Mexico to the U.S [noise]\nThese people I don't I was talking earlier I'm ... I Know that that the Democrats somebody has to be paying for this there is somebody out there and maybe a lot of them who really think that somehow this is going to help the Democrats get votes\n\nBy sending a caravan of four thousand illegal non citizen Americans on a caravan all the way up from Guatemala and Honduras through Mexico\n\nRight before the midterm elections as we discuss somebody's paying\nFor this that somebody they have to eat they have to be drinking things they've got to be using\nFacilities\nSomebody has to be buying the gasoline to transport vehicles to power the vehicles that are being used here\nI guarantee you these people are not walking every step of this thousands of miles journey\nSo who\nThinks that this caravan arriving within a week say\nOf the mid term election date\nHelps Democrats by itself how does this help that this is what got Donald Trump elected\nThis is what turned out the giant Trump coalition the invasion at the southern border that neither political party took one step to stop\nSo what's the calculation here well we had a caller earlier suggesting that the calculation may well be that there has to be something go wrong and you put four thousand people on a track there's gotta be somebody gets sick\nThere has to be some fights break out somewhere somebody on this gang of people got to have a gun all it's going to take is one little incident of violence\nMaybe an allegation of sexual abuse\nAnd maybe started by Trump well enforcement personnel\nI wouldn't put it past them if that's the that's the game plan but I'm struggling to see\nOther than just the general chaos it's creating them and maybe the Democrats things that people want to stop this chaos into this chaos is only because of the Trump that Trump weren't there are none of this will be happening and so let's get rid of the Republicans Republicans are the reason we have to put up with chaos every day\nIf that's the calculation they are going to blow this white they haven't blown much else in politics that's not at all what the conclusion average Americans are going to have if this caravan getting closer and closer to the border\nUp letting him back to the phones got time to work some in here to make up for the first hour where we didn't get any in and this is Andrew in Cleveland thank you for waiting so you're up next\nThat afternoon rush hey I'm\nAs for the Hannity interviewed I'm sure being broadcast professionally knocked it out of the park\nUm if you didn't do than just a second I'd like to say I love it to my wife Kym who's always told me to call you I should call your call you will finally I got through rush my my point is all these illegals coming up in South America nobody's talking about the fact of the diseases they bring along with them if they're not immunized and\nIf you've been low reform reports recently yeah the new diseases out called will not a new disease is a disease out that's had an outfit called ... and it's a polio like oh yeah it's the same length and also killing American\nChildren back twenty fourteen and twenty sixteen there was an outbreak ... let me say that the CDC right as of now has not said they're not sure where it came\nFrom yeah twenty fourteen twenty sixteen we had a similar outbreak yeah\nAnd I'm hiding a tough time finding the leaks out of the Internet because it's just the beginning scrubbed but on January fourth to twenty six key on a website called natural news\nThe headline read tarot virus the sixty eight linked to illegal immigration behind fatal polio like illness killing America's Choice right right right now the CDC is not coming out and people aren't coming out because it leads to much crazy to Trump's call for a while\nIf somebody was actually telling the truth and the drive by media don't you think that this would have some effect on those moms with small children\nUh yeah I Do I this is another really good point the news it's it's amazing how\nThese things remain isolated we are here in the midst of an invasion of\nPeople from various backgrounds various countries in Central America and South America\nAnd just independent leaves some days separation of part there's a story of a shockingly unforeseen increasing polio cases in the United states\nAnd the stories feature medical professionals who are stumped they can't figure out why this was happening\nThey they they can't they can't even make educated guesses as to what might be the origins of this a couple of days go\nBy and there's another story of a mass numbers of people from various parts of the country a world South America Central America there's no question these things are related well I said there's no question common sense tells you there's\nA relationship here but you're you're absolutely right there cannot be any official ... if you have the CDC or anybody else I ... the fact that the new cases of polio or other diseases that we have previously Georgian stamped out another showing up again\nInto really really weird stuff like feminist theology not only do they have ... they are terrified\n\nThat in a nutshell Mr Limbaugh is the voter who was driving

for ... on October second and had another constantly died in a car crash in ... but\nFew details of a merger newspapers report in adding and his role in the murder was not clear\n\nThey learned how to do what Arkansas side uh\nOh oh you're talking about people in mysteriously died in in Arkansas\n... yeah yeah yeah Arkansas either I'd not heard that term [noise] Trump was asked for audio video evidence from the show he investigation\nIf somebody tells him that it's from an apple watch 'em ... they're still pushing it and I know I Know you people think of I'm just talking about this 'cause I like tech stuff I'm not I'm I'm literally trying\nTo inform everybody it's simply the odds that this man's apple watch were able to record anything and then they\nHaven't transferred to the cloud is is is\nNext to impossible and the fact that this is still being pushed raises a red flag to me about this whole thing anyway getting back to the\nPhones here ah Detroit and Mike your next and I'm really glad you waited high\nRush what an honor to speak yeah I've been listening to you for twenty seven years from the hundred and ten degrees son when I was in the marine corps [laughter]\nThat would be over in Iraq\nI was over in Kuwait\nKuwait famously Desert Storm yes appreciate thank you very much\nI Am a call in fact going back to the ... referrals I have a different theory on what is going on and why they're waiting I don't think they're ... they're not action and all I think if the Democrats for somehow take the house that\nMore will have a scathing report if the Republicans hold it\nLowers report will be much of nothing\nThat's really suspicious of you\nI mean what must do you think of the institutions have your government that there's this big long report that just waiting to be written based on the outcome of the electorate\nWell I think they're already written and I'm just I think he's waiting to see which one is you've got to re release\nAll you think you know you think they're both written it just determines the election outcomes determines which one he turns in\nAbsolutely more is the swap [laughter] [laughter] oh he is absolutely everything he's there to
