the kind of thing Republicans do in\nFact you remember when Steve ... got shot by a deranged Democrat at congressional baseball practice you know what our side said\nWe did not make a political the Republicans in Congress said this speaks to all of us we join everybody in condemning this the Republicans did not attempt to make that part is in any way or to try to make hay out of it I'm not kidding go back and look at it if you've forgotten is\nThe Republicans did not make a point of singling out the guy as a Democrat and condemning the Democrats centrally said that this is about\nAll of us Republicans just don't have a behavioral history\nLike this so it was a political staunch who is behind it and for what purpose\nWell the capital of thing was a set up but it looked real for a while the Kevin was saying was set up from the get go we of course here at the network knew that\nBut a lot of people thought it was real on ... it was exposed as a fraud the Democrats couldn't

election and I mean these are all things don't we know and it wasn't just a handful of rogue FBI agents involved it was the top tier leadership\n\nThe one thing that we know to be true that Democrats are pulling out all the stops they see this election as their last best chance to take down Trump and his agenda\nIt's October another way of looking at this\nFor the last few weeks the Democrats have had all of that horrible PR all of these angry mobs and I don't care what anybody thinks\nThose angry moms are not good for the Democratic party those angry mobs are not going to stop turnout those angry mobs are not sending a signal joined us\nMuch as the media would like to portray about her was and much of the Democrats would like to portray of otherwise the people of this country do not want to spend all day and all night every day enraged and angry\nThat's not what life is to most people and they don't want it to be that but that's what life is where your average Democrat today enraged angry upset certainly unhappy\nNot content\nAnd they were hoping to win elections based on that there hasn't been a single that I've heard a single statement of condemnation for any of these acts\nCommitted against Republicans by Democrats mobs people who have been caught on tape threatening Republicans' in restaurants\nPeople who I've been caught on tape for ...

likely insane lunatics are also on the Republican side disorder cancel out the impact of lunacy on your side as average American voters perceive it\nOkay let's get some of the election analysis them in terms are Thirteen Days away two weeks ago from yesterday\nTom ... who was cofounded real clear politics and it is a it's a website that many political scientists political operatives\nA political experts cite constantly what what real clear politics does among many other things is average all of the so called response civil polls out there into something called a real clear politics average of polls\nAnd political experts from across the aisle site real clear politics and trusted as an unassailable source so Tom ... co founder of this place was on ah the Fox\nBusiness Network today\nHe said that if there was a blue wave that it would be cresting at this point me it'd be building ... we'd be seeing the\nTop of it here and Tom Bevan sat in all of polling data that they have it real clear politics\nAnd analyzing it's not there is no crafting there is no blue wave if a wave was coming it would be building he says and it isn't but on the other hand the generic ballot is holding meaning the\nDemocrats are not running away with it they still have a ... depending on three to five point lead in the generic ballot but they're not expanding it there's no growth there is no Democrats pulling away as what happened with a blue wave Trump's job approval is rising\nDemocrats are in the advantage ... but they're not building on anything there's no way that's got to wash everything away and leave only Democrats standing\nHe says the house races are really tight they are race by race real battles hand to hand combat is how he described it\nHe forecast that Democrats might win the house that they do have an advantage right now because they have a range of Seventy competitive races\nAnd the range of pick up as they look at polling data now\nIs anywhere from Democrats picking up tend to forty one seats\nThey're projecting a democratic pickup of twenty five and a half seats which give him a slight a bed Democrats need to pick up twenty three that's the magic number anything above that Democrats have an advantage in the house the range of the pick up according to the polling data real clear politics takes a look Savage anywhere from ten to forty one seats\nThey project a pick up a twenty five seats twenty five an hour or two and a half seats more than they need\nBut with even a tiny shift in just a couple of races there GOP can hold the house so all of this synthesizer\nAnd stripped away which bear essence there isn't a blue wave\nThere isn't this blue wave that's going to sweep every Republican away and leave only Democrats stamping\nThe generic ballot is not moving in Democrats' favor Trump's approval numbers are rising over on the Senate side ... and real clear politics project the Republicans are going to gain two seats two weeks ago they were predicting no change\nRepublicans wouldn't gain or lose any two weeks before that the Democrats were going to pick up seats in the Senate so in the past month we've gone from Democrats picking up a couple two Republicans gaining a couple and that's the momentum and that's the trend and he made the point that it's a whole new world with Trump\n\nGender gap education gap the rural urban gap all of these things don't mean mean nearly as much as they have in the past the cause of Trump neutralizing much of it\n[noise]\nAnd Trump is a great unknown as these rallies\nContinue now another retired

Republicans [noise] 'cause we have the Clintons or Obama on their radar\n\nNo no I mean ... or ... or the Clintons an obstacle to the upcoming mid terms of the ... no ... is Obama an obstacle in the you know I mean what the Clintons and Obama are not even on the radar except they are today\nI mean the Clintons announced yet this Clinton's announced this nationwide stadium chore third team locations stadium tour they're gonna charge admission for people to come in and spend some time listening to bill and Hillary reminisce and talk about\nPolitics what\nWhat if there isn't a whole lot of interest in that [noise] what if a lot of people aren't yet\nMy tickets\nI don't know that they're on sale with every venue yet but I mean the Clintons aren't anybody's radar right now\nI mean the closest that happens is you know when Trump goes to a rally and they start talking about the deep state and Hillary and her ... and the FBI trend the shaft Trump on his phony collusion story the lock her up lock her up but I mean the Clintons are not considered political opponents right now and Obama certainly is and\n\nI don't know I ... and and now with so many leftist tweeting this is typical this is Donald Trump has engendered so much hatred in so much anger the wife and a mirror here's not sick I just just to pet it it's just it's it it it's too obvious it is becoming what\nIn form ... and a educated suspicion about this would tell you that it is uh we'll see we'll let time on\nFor here in the meantime we go back to the phones Andrew in Cleveland it's great to have you with us or hello\nHey Russia or within the ah riding around in the car with my father it's a pleasure speaking\nWell thank you I appreciate that you very\nMuch rush you know if you're talking about this passing the smell 'cause I'm I'm sure the drive by spin on it\nThat uh we have a dangerous dreams right we're out there putting these bombs in the mail\nYou know if that really were the case where it is a redneck right wing hillbilly which I'm sure that's how this will be run by the media where do they go about getting a mailing address is I mean George Soros Hillary Clinton Iraq saying oh\nYou know that that information out there for the masses to obtain you know quite being there were never any attempt for these devices to make their way to their intended target whoever put them in the mail and I don't know if it's right on me to point fingers and certainty but my gut is telling me this is a left wing smokescreen\nWanted for them to be discovered the\nDemocrat they've proven time and time again there's simply no load that they won't do everything from they've tried to do to derail Trump or the hot and might video that came out during his presidential campaign to Russia to even gone so far as to try to ruin the wife of judge Kavanaugh nothing has worked\nWhat makes you think that they wouldn't do something that will tell\nGoing along along those lines if you want to look at it that way\n\nIt doesn't make any sense for a Republican or conservative to do this if they really care about winning these elections just makes no sense to do\nThis is going to be instant fodder for the Democrats in the media to blame it on Trump and his supporters and or his uh there's there's ... it doesn't make any sense for a Republican or conservative to do this if they care about the elections none whatsoever but flip that\nFlip that around would it make a lot of sense for a democratic operative or Democrat in cocaine and a lunatic to do it because things are not\nWorking out the way\nThey thought do not forget this is why I'm spent so much time dwelling on this today and the psychology that's that that's attached to this\nThis is not going the way they have assured us but the last nine months it was going to go more importantly it's not going the way they believed it was going to go they believe their lives remember they believe their pollsters\nIf the pollsters telling there is a big way based on the generic ballot they believe that they get it in their heads and they believe it\nAnd they start reporting it and they just compounds itself and it becomes even more intensely believed it becomes gospel\nAnd then it doesn't\nAnd then the things that are supposed to cement it like the Kavanaugh trek backfires and these mobs are backfiring they are not achieving their objectives\nSo if you flipped this around you've got this you've got this this this mob of people flooding the border by intention\nThere's no way that helps the Democrats don't and the Democrats as I said let me grab the let me grab the uh the tweets here is really strange ah ladies and gentlemen I'm going to quote the creepy porn star a lawyer but Here's Michael ...\nThere is too much at stake in the mid term shut the Democrats do allow the Republicans to use this caravan which is so obviously is set up\nAs a wedge issue it is time for the Democrats to step up and be strong on border security we cannot once again be painted as weak and then lose\nThese are all deep state leaders that these quote unquote bombs are going to Hillary and and you know and and Cuomo and all these guys and then Brennan\nThat it's all deep state and this is right out of the play the Clinton playbook if you ah go back in time to I Believe it was two thousand eight when Hillary was going against uh Hussein Obama\nThe uh iron my shirts folk started coming out I don't know if you recall that or not I'm sure you do with your memory\nOh yeah and I think I'm responsible for that because of a joke I used to ...\nYeah and so Michele milk and you know put that to bed as far as it was you know it was a plant\nOr tell people what it was ... celebrate cause I stepped on it tell people what it is\nOh sure sure so back in two thousand and eight or in order to garner sympathy and empathy for the ... um there was a gentleman or series of gentleman that were walking around the Hillary camp for president campaign of two thousand and eight\nWith signs saying iron my shirts iron my shirts of course because we can't have a woman for president those you know those sexist Republicans\nRight and your watch or we're going to do Hillary and be a domestic beer housewife an iron my shirts didn't fix dinner I get my slippers that kind of thing right\nIt was a point it was a plant in it and it was all it was all nonsense to garner apathy in\nSeparate it was already planning to go to waste it was Hillary's plant there was nobody legitimately anti Hillary doing that\nRight correct that's in the San Antonio I gave them the idea but anyway I don't want to step on it keep going with the story\nSo so anyway Michelle milk and came up with a good piece and basically quit it's a bad from a follow up that this was a plan and it was all a facade like everything is with the Clintons a great professor called the ... rush he taught me one time with the ... there are no coincidences\nAnd there are no ah you there's nothing that's set in stone with these people ... everything is manufactured everything is made up\nAnd so I don't trust them look at Nancy Pelosi down in Miami for someone who was quote unquote running for her life millionaire Nancy was taking her time walking down the stairs or somebody was open the door for her while she's being shouted that I Believe that's a set up I don't want to sound like in conspiracy theorist here but take a look at it it's a bunch of nonsense\nAnd I don't trust the Democrats never have you never let a good conspiracy theory go the way I could never let a good crisis\nGo exactly rush no you're you're you're right about the Clintons there are no coincidence is with them this is a this was a philosophy that I have stalled for four years on this program asking people to\nNever forget there are no coincidence and ... and the fact you know you say these are all deep state players a Soros bill and Hillary a Obama and so forth\nUm if it is curious they're they're they're not even on the radar in in the midterms when you get down to it other than trying to get themselves on the radar but\nSee that's I think they're trying to get noticed the Clintons desperately need to be noticed all the time and Obama is trying to recapture some glory trying to show everybody thinks he can still move the needle\nIn working now the reason I think I'm responsible for the\nWhat was it iron my shirts I used to the rush to excellent store open up you know with some funny jokes line stories and so forth and I would tell people that I just met Mrs Clinton a week before\nAnd that it was the strangest strangest thing and we ended up in ...\nThe elevator together and just the two of us she said you know I could never say this outside this elevator

Republicans always ... in the media Republicans pounds Democrats David but Republicans ... ...\nIt's now abundantly clear goes ... statement that the Andrew Gillum has repeatedly lied about taking a

I think it was this morning he was on on Fox and he very calmly and very simply outlined a pattern or corruption by Andrew Gillum\nHe pointed out the FBI as had yellow monitor radar for years because they said an undercover agents to catch him breaking all kinds of laws and accepting bribes in return for development deals pay to play so to speak\n\n... graduated from college was given awards by
