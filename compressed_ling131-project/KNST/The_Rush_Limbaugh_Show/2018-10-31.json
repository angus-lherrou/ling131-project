here Mr President\nWe don't want you we don't want your wife we don't want your Jewish pretend daughter we don't want your joints son in law we don't want any of you here go away but\nTrump goes to the hospital where the professionals treated the wounded and it gets very very warm welcome you don't see that report it\nOr\nThey continue to try to lay the blame on Trump for this\nAnd it just wears you out I Know people are telling me it just wears you out every day you get it the same thing different degrees of intensity different details in the story but it's the same thing\nAnd people say Russia's gonna win them in terms folks there is a soul out there who knows who's going to win the midterms\nThere isn't a single person out there who has the slightest idea I don't care what Paul you look at I don't care what professional you talk to I don't care what great really an analyst there is there isn't anybody who knows\nWho's going to win the mid term but you have all kinds of people who want to impress you and how smart they are and how analytical they are but it's like anything else in the future nobody knows and that's because there are so many races according to the polling data can break either way\nThere are so many that are so close but then when you say that okay do we trust the polling data the polling data versus two thousand sixty and not all that ... nobody knows bottom\nLine\nNate Silver or given exam Nate Silver is considered a good word you know why\nI think it was was it two thousand fourteen two thousand twelve was one of those two elections were ...\nOvert lucked into calling every state on the money\nAnd that feet won the election of go in the past whenever it was gave him this reputation that he's in the\nSense that one election where he was an infallible he hasn't come close doesn't matter because he came closer was dead on the money when Democrats were victorious he's become a guru\nHe's become a shrink he's become a psychiatrist or psychologist Democrats tuned to Nate Silver to stay sane when the information they're hearing doesn't go the way they want it to go\nHeard pat ... can I say this silver guy nice guy but he's never run a campaign he's never taken a single poll only does this analyze them\nHe's never participated\nIn a poll either the polling company he's never run a campaign ... or ... point was you need to temper all these so called experts with some reality to the guy hits it on one election that happened to be exactly what the Democrats wanted to hear turned out to be\nTrue and so it becomes a group and the media continues to cite this light Nate Silver is out there saying eighty six percent now chances Democrats when the house nobody knows\n\nSo you can't you can't succumb to the temptation here to go blob lay and become flat line\nAnd it's hard I I look I Will admit it's hard as I say the human emotional reservoir can only hold\nSo much and at some point it's going to get depleted and maintaining fever pitch energy becomes a challenging thing to do precisely when the news every day is Ninety eight percent slanted Ninety two percent slanted against you and what you believe in and what you want to happen\n\nThe Trump threat to end the or the birthright citizenship\nToday the Dems are still mad about it\nAll kinds of experts being trotted out it's unconstitutional no it's totally constitution no it isn't and you got Republican leaders that we don't want to go down this road is a silly we're all in favor of his many people getting in the countries that can't Democrats saying the same thing but it's out there it's a conversation starter\nNothing is going to happen anytime soon the leftist saying yeah conversation started as all of this Trump doesn't really mean it is trying to rile up the base that's where you're wrong Trump\nDoes made it it is about time this was changed we have a crisis brewing\nWe have a crisis growing in terms of what kind of country we're going to be what kind of culture is going to dominate in this country and we are under assault by people who don't like the United states of America the way it was founded\nIn the snow complicated mystery that this is just what it is that's who the opponents are hell bent\nAnd they're not going to stop until they until they went another Mahler investigate looking at all of us in the lower investigation trying to come back to life\nRemember had told yesterday I made a leftist were convinced that Mueller by now was going to have issued a report proving trumping colluded with Russia\nYou know how many people on the left believed that\nAnd how many have been thinking all this time that Mahler was timing this release for right before the election and it was going to happen and if it didn't happen to that would be a leak wanted there would be some kind of indication and yet ... zeroes not at the latest from Muller is it somebody is running a scam on him a sex scandal of some ... ... ... it's\nSo boring to me I haven't even delved into the details but Muller is saying that people are trying to run a sex scam on him up some kind\nOr tried to or what have you all\nAll I Know is that that's the last thing that the left was counting on Robert Mueller having to say in the days and weeks leading up to election it was a big deal psychologically until you these people really thought you you wouldn't be amazed at how many people\nThat drive by media the American leftist propagandize significant portion of this population they have believed from the first day that Trump the first day they herded the Trump stole the election they have believed that Mueller has found they believe Mahler was going to find it and didn't find it in his holding it is going to release of the most opportune time\nDespite the fact that in any evidence more there never has been any evidence for because it didn't happen\nIt did happen between Hillary the Democrats but it didn't happen with Trump there is a ... read there will not be a shred of evidence and yet\nThey're still holding out hope Mueller and his people trying to remain relevant\nRising from the dead looking like Trump may answer some questions after the election remember the news stories about that how many months maybe over a year now\nHave there been stories about Trump will or won't submit the questioning by Mahler lawyers thinking showed lawyers making sure the Trump wants to set the story is but his lawyers say no way\nMeanwhile the conversations never happen Trump never met with mother never answered written questions they weren't submitted a total non story that both sides were participating in\nThe news now is the Trump might speak with smaller after the election might answer some questions after the election\nTake away is that the primary weapon the Democrats thought they had to get rid of Trump and when the house and Senate has fizzled\nIt's not there so they're turning they always do do other things\nWe also have the usual parade of celebrities\nBrain dead idiots celebrities vomiting their opinions throwing away their money we have proven that we really are not motivated to do anything celebrities advise\nIt has been a long established the celebrities do not move public opinion when nobody is worried about celebrities think or do in that sense because they don't and yet they persist\nWe now have the Oprah we're told the Oprah is going to go into Georgia and campaign for the Democrat governor for Georgia Stacey what his name Abrams what is the last time the Oprah was a factor in an election can anybody telling me\nYou think Obama's first victory was was when was time to to to the Oprah\nYou think she was helpful why ... I Will admit that she didn't hurt me you think if Oprah hadn't been out there doing what the offer was doing an Obama would not have won\nOkay Obama what is still won despite what the Oprah was doing ... Barbara Streisand Barbra Streisand's\nOut so she's trying to gin up anti Republican vote by promising people to move to Canada if the Republicans\nHold the house the anybody cares about that other than the people say go head move it's going to motivate me to vote Republican\nAnd how many people on the Democrat oh my God we can't lose bathrooms oh no we can't ever move to Canada we got to vote number it how many people think that\nThat's going to be the way people take their vote and yet it makes the news\nIt's a big deal that Barbara Streisand who nobody cares about might move to Canada how many Democrats over the years have threatened to leave the United states if they lose the next election and after they lose the next election\nThey stay and nobody ever does this story Barbra Streisand promise to move to Canada after Republicans held a house decided to stay and her Malibu compound it no explanation given how many times you see\nIs going to be arrested\nSeven Ninety three

country maybe use videos my page ... dot com [noise]\nOkay listen to it again this is Monday Night on CNN steak in a couple of days for this to reach the mainstream [noise]\n[laughter] ... lemon says it on Monday Night on CNN\nAnd its noticed today and again he's talking the freight Cuomo\nAbout all the recent shootings in mailed the pipe bombs and ... says there was another have filled criminal just last week in Kentucky and other white man in custody for shooting and killing two African Americans in a grocery store we barely had time to cover\nWe have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terror threat in this country is white men most of them radicalized to the right and we have to start doing something about them there is no travel ban on them you know they have a Muslim ban there is no white guy ban\nNow Don Lemon ah what is your reaction to this I mean this folks I'm telling you this is not a one off this is I mean the specifics of a white guy Bannon but that may be something that he individually holes but the idea that the opposition\nAs far as the leftist concerned is white men predominantly white Christian man that's that's got on the money that's right exactly where they are aimed in the perverted view the American left is white men who created this racist and bigoted\nUnfair unjust immoral country do not consider me to be exaggerating here\nThat is what we are up against and this all of this from the from the uh Lenski days all the way up through the Obama administration and a real objective has been to transform America away from the\nTraditions in institutions of the founding based on the fact that it's all racist and it's all bigoted and it's all unjust an unfair they continue to point to slavery\nAs the primary\nEvidence the primary example are exhibit\nOf their claim that America is unjust or unfair they of course pay no attention to the\nSteps America took to end racism that gets no credit gets mentioned whatsoever as far as they're concerned racism and slavery still exist in prisons on the caravan in immigration policy you name it\nAnd so this is what's animated and this is certainly what has energized and Phil ... of women all over this country with rage leftist women it's being utilized\nTo what to great effect but that's the single organizing purpose is racial or I was gonna say racist but it's racial in uh in its origins now it covers much more ground than that in terms of its objective but that's their target that's what they're using and had been for a while to energize\nEverybody who is not a white man they're using a victim of allergy and victimhood to a tea they\nAre making people think that they have no chance in America as long as white men continue to run it and be a white men or continue to be the majority\nAnd they just continually enraged people they ratchet up the anger there has to be an outlet for it I think they are if you if you want to start attaching if you want to start attaching\nMedia responsibility to the actions of people you notice how quickly they want to do that\nNotice how quickly on the left the people who commit crimes are not really responsible for them they're always the result of environmental things\nAnd so on the left telling us that these guys are being motivated by Trump they eat or love Trump or they hate Trump but whatever Trump is making them do these things\nI think it's day if you're going to if we're going to go down that road never going to start attaching blame the people who don't really have any responsibility for making the bombs or pulling the trigger on the guns who is it that doesn't raging them like I say you cannot turn on the news today and find a single thing positive about anything\n\nYou can't you you cannot find any reinforcement\nAnywhere in public media for the good innocent decency of America it's quite the exact opposite\n\nAnd since these people are the vast majority immediate you know they exempt themselves from having any role in all of this while they are eager to try to find anybody else in media who might be to blame for this\n\nDon Lemon said let's to Monday Night also that he doesn't see Democrats killing people over politics\n\nYou mean Don like the followers of black lives matter are the Republicans in that group look in the number of police officers have been murdered Mr lemon by black lives matter supporters and look at how many of those cops murders had\nBeen defended and explained away by people like you\nIn the sense well they're cops and they missed reading their racist they deserve it\nBut don't try to tell me that Democrats are killing people yeah how about the guy that shut up the Republican baseball practice I think he was intending to wound people Steve ... is almost did die it's amazing these people the way they talk in the things they conveniently forget or don't even register maybe in the first place\n\nFive cops in Dallas two thousand sixteen\nOr the Muslims in this country who have committed murder or are they Republicans nope many of them are very loyal Democrats voting bloc\nWas great longer hear it again someday but I just wonder are your thoughts on why we haven't seen or heard of any reporting on\nAnd this airline went down two days ago and I recall the last plane went down in Malaysia CNN was all over for about a month and a half a non stop the and we haven't seen anything about this this brand new plane that went that\nYeah where do they go down\nIn ... Taiwan there but a hundred and eighty nine people died it was a brand new I Believe is going I'm not exactly sure\nWell there's no way to link that the Trump a good point\nThere is no way to link it to the mid term elections there's no way to use that crash to gin up anti Republican anti Trump no I'm not joking\nDay how I'm not I'm not joking and all they don't care about it because it has no impact it has no usage they can see in affecting the outcome they want in the mid term elections\nDon't worry they'll get to it when their side of the time to attack a\nCorporation like bowling or whoever made the plane they'll get to it after they've done what they can do on the midterms\nMuch appreciate it\nYou do you do you do you do doubt me on this\nPersonally no but uh just uh remember CNN go when wall to wall on that last plane that went down\nWell of course because that's CNN CNN they were there were there was there was sucking hot or they were in the last place out there and ah this was that was pre Trump and the belief in media is the airline airplane crashes\nAirliner crashed as a lot of passengers is white glow eyeballs are glued to TV so they believe and then he had a mystery where it is a damn thing\nWhere is it Don Lemon even asked a former director of National Transportation Safety Board could it have been swallowed by a black hole\nRemember that you remember that\n... certainly remember that Americans are pro\nOkay ... ... ... they had a mystery on their hands and indeed you're right they went wall to wall with it and it became\nA standing joke you know that the the best way to make anything or do a success is to lose it and and have CNN try to find it for you\nI just haven't seen it on any media outlet whether it's Yahoo\nGoogle CNN NBC none of the nightly news show one picture from what ... wait a minute how do you know about it then\nWell I saw it on a headline news\nMaybe where Monday morning well more than the headline news\nHeadline news they just announced they're getting out of the news headline news just announced they're going to go eighty percent uh uh uh advertising or something like what do you ever uh forget what you call that program but\nI just found that the kill your that that was not one little usually anytime the plane goes to show them that many people especially it was a brand new plan that oh\nWhen are you such a brand new playing what kind of play it was he was bullied will you remember the model number\nBut since it's brand new it's got to be the one of the um you know somewhat but uh and that's what made me think even more that we would see news is still a brand new plan going down is unusual and ah we went out\nTo the sea sucked into it I'll tell you what it was a bowling seven thirty seven max which is the latest uh upgrade of the seven ... seven thirty seven is a double wide\nBody and\nNot as white of course is a jumbo jet wide body but it's stuffy and they have a extended a damn thing to try to make a whole more passengers went down\nBut it didn't go down in America a Donald Trump had nothing to do with it going down that they could they make a case uh they they could not say that the pilot was angry at Trump and decided to take everybody out in his ... so\nThere's no way to link this I'm not I'm not joking\nI Wish I was there is no way to link that crash to the mid term elections

the news\nMedia has a habit that it was is assuming an operating on the assumption that whatever they think and wherever they\nCare about is what everybody thinks or everybody cares about well I'm not so sure that all that momentum got interrupted if the momentum was interrupted effect imaging level decline that wire Trump's rallies still ... over to he's got one in Fort Myers like it's Fort Myers yeah Ford\nMurder thousands of people already wind up Trump's got six rallies\nPlan between now and election day you've got all the way up to ...\nBefore the election\nAnd he's pumping a series of themes and one of the themes is how great these past two years have been for the U.S economy reviving moribund industry is bringing back employment bringing back wage increases bringing back a economic confidence\nConsumer confidence in the economy\nUh he's talking about how all the things he wants to do to slow down the illegal immigration but he was having to deal with obstacles put on his way by both parties always messages\nAnd he remains is upbeat and optimistic as anybody ever has in circumstances like this\nSo whatever is out there in the daily news media's not affecting Trump doesn't affect his mood doesn't affect his uh\nAttitude or anything of the sorts I think a lot of it as wishful thinking I got a lot of this idea that all of this momentum that the Republicans had has been kinda stopped because of the pipe bomb and the synagogue shooting\n\nThis was you know I I circled back to I really don't know what's going to happen on election day and I don't believe in Rio's

I'll tell you what's frustrating to me there is all kinds of great news in this country economic news all kinds of a rebirth and there's evidence of it everywhere and the Republican Party itself is not even getting that message out\nI don't know about individual candidates an individual races but the national Republican Party apparatus\nIf it weren't for Trump and his tweets\nAnd his his rallies the American people wouldn't have anywhere near the idea of the decent good things going on out there because Trump's own party is not joining the PR parade on this\n\nThat's one of the reasons I'm never going to join this crowd of people thinks Trump should stop tweeting and Trump should stop all these uh incendiary things he says why let me ask you some people it's horrible what Trump said about ... why\nIs it why is it why isn't it\nA problem the Paul Ryan took the first chance he had\nTo disagree with his own president about this and by the way all this this is a conversation starter right now\n\nIt's it's mandatory it's necessary that we have a conversation as we don't get a handle on this immigration problem you can say goodbye to America is you know it\nWhich is the design that's one of the reasons why the supporters are what they are Mollie Hemingway as a great piece today speaking of cabin on it's just right on the money and let me ask you a question during the Kavanaugh hearings\nRemember all the Democrats question and Kevin I remember all of the allegations we had balls e forward with her allegations of whatever capital I did that led to the fact that Kevin all the spiking punch with drugs to set women up for serial rape we had all of these women that were dragging forward\nClaiming they had evidence of it none of them ever present as any but\nThe media and the Democratic party were hell bent on convincing everybody that Kevin was such a rotten guy that his life and career deserve to be destroyed\nSo\nAfter Kavanaugh's named to the Supreme Court he is he passes it gets ... ... the confirmation vote and has been sworn in why did the media drop it\n\nIf Kavanaugh was such a rotten S. O. B. Y. has the media stopped its investigation\nRemember all the Democrats are yeah yeah I would've Kavanaugh's confirmed we're going to a piece you were going to throw him out of there we're going to get rid of those guys are represented serial rapist where is all that just it's going on is it not\n\nMollie Hemingway if the media and other Democrat leaders wanted to have any credibility of all that the post tearing release of multiple allegations was not a pure political dont\nFor which they were willing to destroy a man why they continue to fight for justice everyday wouldn't they they'd still be out there trying to nail Kevin all if all of that was legit\nIf if everything capital was accused of being was actually true as they would not have stopped at him being confirmed on the Supreme Court they would still be out there right because of justice\n\nThey would be out there asking every democratic candidate whether he believes Ford and supported impeaching Kevin why are they doing that there's a big campaign going Kevin always will be rallying point Kevin always a reason to deny the Republicans continued leadership in the house\nSo why isn't the media asking every Democrat candidate running for office\nTheir opinion if Kavanaugh did you believe ball Z forward and if you did do you still support impeaching capital where are these questions\nThe reason those questions aren't being asked are the reason why the media isn't doing is just because it was all trumped up it was manufactured none of it was true it was a classic Democrat operation like every damn one of these is\nNone of what they were saying about Kevin always true it was all manufactured they didn't bring balls the Ford up until the very end as a Hail Mary if Woolsey Ford were actually telling the truth she would have been\nOne of the first witnesses she would have been one of the primary ways the Democrats ought to get rid of capital but they had this little requests from her not Jimmy made public thing I did I Do here and so they had a built in excuse not to use it that was convenient\nThis whole thing was manufactured the whole thing was made up\nYour Republicans running for office have you have any debates left you need to start asking\nA Democrat opponents they still opposed Kevin all don't let them get away with dying they ask you ask them if they still support Kevin ... or oppose Kevin I asked them if they are going to demand that he'd be impeached if they win reelection or election\nIf this Kevin all thing is going to work it's going to have to be turned back on the Democrats the Republicans running for office are going to have to keep bringing this up either in campaign and we've got a week it's not to wait to include this in any ad campaign if if it's been decided to leave it out\nNot too late to cut some new ads and re inserted\nPeople need to be reminded\nLet's pretend that some of the momentum was lost and okay we've got plenty of time we got the E R B network got all kinds of ways to remind people what happened to Brett Kavanaugh\nWho did it what its purpose was and the proof that it was a series of lies and made up charges as evidenced by the fact that now there's not a single story about it\nBecause the media lost the Democrats lost in their effort to destroy Kevin ... they lost in their attempt to use Kavanaugh they're hurting Democrats hurt Republicans in the in the mid term elections\n\nHere's another one if the cabinet confirmations circus we're about justice for his alleged victims the women instead of about killing his nomination by any means\nYou knew or and younger country then and we had an entirely different attitude about immigration and growth and it was required that immigrants assimilate and it was required that they be healthy we we're not going to open the borders to illness\nWe we're not going to expose the American people to things through accidents or or design but more importantly the immigrants who were allowed\nIn had to demonstrate that they wanted to be Americans they had to demonstrate that they love America\nIt wasn't enough to be fleeing war it wasn't enough to be fleeing discomfort it wasn't enough to be fleeing poverty you had to want to be an American\nThe young people in that\nIn that room erupted into a game standing ovation\nAnd I said to myself well it's over the environmentalist wackos with this age group have one\nMore than any technical advanced what're achievement more than any cool aspect to movies because most of the fact that it was a hundred percent recycled\nIt just these kids have been told that climate change is destroying the habitat that there may not be a way for a life to be sustained when they hit sixty five you'd be amazed at the number of young people have been brainwashed and propagandize to believe that and so the fact of Apple's\nIntroduced a little bitty computer here and it's made a one hundred percent recycled aluminum was the big news of the day\nHoly smokes now let's go to the audio sound like this this folks\nI talked about this earlier here's the evidence first up Jake Tapper CNN with Erin Burnett last\nNight the president of the United states making a controversial visit to Pittsburgh today after the deadliest attack on Jews in American history president was greeted by hundreds of protesters singing this land\nIs your land protesters with signs saying the president's not welcome until he saw what they perceived to be his assault on immigration and refugee the protests are not surprising\nOf course not after you protests are not so ... what what does immigration refugees have to do with this event anyway why are these protesters there okay so here's Jake Tapper\nThe protests are not surprising it's totally understandable nobody wanted Trump here Trump is hated Trump is reviled everybody wishes Trump would not have come and that three did come they wish they would just leave\nSo now we go to the University of Pittsburgh Medical center President Trump first lady\nYou mock a Trump Jared Kushner walking through the halls to visit people wounded in the synagogue shit like\nThat\nNow they reach\nDrinker and again thank you so much [laughter] thank you for having a chance\nYou will not see this on any network newscast you will not see that video on any news channel anywhere thank

you thank you can I shake your hand serve thanks so much thanks so much thank you so much thank you President Trump\n\nBut wait a minute Jake Tapper said the protests are not surprising nobody wanted to president there and it's not just Jake Tapper everybody in a drive by Mr President your sham trip and I thought this was not to replace you know business going they don't want you to forty thousand people signed a petition asking him not to come\nOh wait we're not through we stay at the University of Pittsburgh Medical center and\nNow I'm a lawyer you're the first lady and if Monica Trump gets to love to\nThank you very rainy summer is thank you very much anger and her name is John John you hear me yeah [noise] ... [laughter]\n\nThat was a male employee looking at Jerry cushion nursing nobody ever heard of you laughing at his wife was a bigger star that's fine no problem everybody laughing about it but what is you're not going to see this anywhere I mentioned it to you in the opening our of the program that this is what happened\nThere are thousands of people already in line in Fort Myers waving a Trump rally there later tonight [noise] but nobody wants Donald Trump anywhere she everybody hates ... everybody's ... everybody regrets that they voted for everybody can't wait to vote for Democrats so the\nTrump can't do anything and everybody wants to Democrats back in power so they can start investigating Trump and get rid of it that your drive by media\n\nThey don't show you get a reaction to real people you will not see those videos you will not here that audio anywhere\nOther than we did the number one of your personality appalled by Rush Limbaugh muggy like\nCold\nHere on CNN\nA five year old brutalized law enforcement officers gunned down these are the victims of illegal immigration American Life destroy our broken immigration laws\nPresident Trump is fighting back\nAnd conservative congressman Kevin McCarthy is leading the fight [noise]\nKevin McCarthy ... ended for so long back fully funds President Trump's border wall\nExpands caseload people lives in Brooklyn\nAnd insurers only of American citizens have the right to vote\nConservatives illusion of America deserves the leadership of President Trump's nice\nThat's conservative guy was like\nBuild the wall headed for the law\nSo health President Trump's visit time for the wall dot com\nAnd tell Congress to pass Kevin McCarthy is built the wall and enforce the law\nPay for my safety for the express [noise]\nHi Jerry Lewis said mad at me homes it's your home your way and now for a limited time when you buy a new Miami home get fifty percent off of design options and upgrade with saving up to Fifteen thousand dollars\nFor the ... homes built by you sales have been from creating your dream kitchen with beautiful granite countertops just selecting the perfect flooring the choice is yours making your madam you home perfect in every way to look at all\nYou have everybody in the world out there disagreeing with him but the purpose of it is to start the conversation Trump has done that that's what conservatism was as a form of movement back in Nineteen sixty four\nA and there are those examples where were you know that that somebody's going to lose either at a local race or a presidential race but in mid term elections I can\nI can show your countless in two thousand ten when the Republicans picked up sixty three seats nobody forecast that the closest I remember to anybody forecasting a massive Republican takeover was none other\nThan the prince of darkness in himself Robert Novak back in Nineteen Ninety four predicted I think to within two seats the Republican takeover of a house in those elections I think we one fifty four seats are forty some Adam he predicted was off by two\nBut nobody predicted the Republicans are going to pick up sixty three seats in two thousand ten\nI mean the media didn't want to think anything was even possible because of so much love and devotion respect for Obama and then when it happened you should've seen in if you remember the bottom fell out the window and it just totally came out of their sales\nIn two thousand two everybody thought\nEverybody that Democrats were going to walk away with the house of representatives because everybody hated\nBush Bush was not duly elected Bush stole the election in the Florida recount with the help of a twisted Supreme Court\nAnd Democrats did the Wellstone memorial and that was going to galvanize Democrats all over the country to show up and vote and it was no way and what happened Republicans gained ... seats\nThe left was done to the drive by media couldn't believe it so there are examples even when people are dams certain what's gonna happen\nThey end up being surprised the brightest minds the greatest go rose the most heralded analysts\nAnd it's all about presenting an image of making it look like you know what you're talking about more than anybody else does\nI have here a piece from a ... a real clear politics by one of the written down the whole\nAnalyst and data analyst there is Sean ... day and I got to read the whole thing it prints out there for pages bought the headline here on certain days in the womb as men terms and her final\nStretch\nI'm going to tell you what this long piece says I can do this long piece in three words we know nothing\nCertain days alone is midterms that her final stretch the twenty eight\nTen midterms are working their way toward a conclusion in a week we should find Leno who will control the house although at the outcomes close it could take weeks to finish counting ballots in California\nThe consensus view is that the Democrats are favored to take the house of representatives analyst disagree on just how large the majority they're going to win is\nAnd how likely that majority is if you split the real clear politics toss ups in half\nThat's much polls it results in Democrats gaining about twenty five seats\nFor a narrow two hundred and twenty to two hundred and fifty majority\nI tend to think says Mr trend that the toss ups will break disproportionally toward Democrats and see something more on the order of a two twenty five to two hundred and ten Democrat majority\nBut this is here splitting to a certain degree okay so here he says and the second paragraph it's all over and it's a Democrat's two hundred and twenty five seats the Republicans with two hundred and ten\nNext paragraph at the same time\nThis isn't the only way to read that thing the Democrats pick ups could be larger but they could also be smaller here are some things that\nShouldn't bother any sober minded elections analyst in the final week of the election why we just concluded here and as the Democrats are gonna end up with two hundred and twenty five seats the Republicans two hundred and ten so why do we analyze any bird because the truth is we don't know\nThose are my words not in this trend days [noise] his words resume here will there be a late break\nAs we learned in two thousand sixteen and in a less dramatic fashion and two thousand fourteen a late breaking the races can altered the landscape substantially this year there are a lot of undecided voters remaining look at the most recent house polling from the New York times Sienna in some racism good that the ... ship numbers\nThis adds up to a situation where a slight break in the undecideds toward one party or the other could be the difference between a healthy Democratic majority and a slim Republican but wait he's are these are predicted to twenty five to ... I'm not harping on Mr trend day here\nIs we don't know he's given you his best gas but now he's giving you every reason in the world is ... ... do you can think of where it might their talent that way\nGiven the closeness of many races and the president's improving overall job approval is also unclear\nHow about your weight all of this in the current cycle\nWell then how did you get to to twenty five to ten if it's really unclear how to evaluate all this\n[laughter] but that's just me you know being smart alec\nOr in New York's twenty second congressional district Sienna college places the president's job approval at fifty three percent so Republican representative Claudia Tenney as possibly in better shape than her polling numbers suggest\nBut what about the Nineteen representative John Faso is up by a point but the president's job approval is at a forty six forty nine split that suggested very close race and there are likely a lot so Trump's on the ballot or he isn't\nIs it going to matter what Trump's approval number is in some of these house races or is it not\nAnybody who thinks Trump's not on the ballot here needs to reexamine things\nAnd then the next burger about how many votes are Democrats wasting one of the biggest news stories this cycle has been a massive influx of money\nIn to Democrats campaigns this initially showed up and marquee races like Beto O'Rourke\nChallenge of Ted Cruz but it has since filtered down into more marginal races like Indiana's nines or California's first or a outer Mongolia of seven\nAnd all of this is relevant because Democrats right now have a roughly seven and a half point lead and the generic ballot\nWhich asks which party would you prefer to have control of Congress now normally this would be enough to flip the majority but it's never craft run up the score in districts that are unlikely to win suddenly that seven point margin translates into way closer than expected seat but then there's another consideration and that's how correlated army errors\nMeaning cover liable aren't on the state and then the next ... are we're relying too much on one pollster oh that's a pretty straightforward concern and then the next ... what is it\nEarly voting telling us well the pet response is nothing but that's too simple early voting returns usually tell us something but unfortunately they can only be deciphered in retrospect meaning we don't know the early voting is still\nIt's over we're not counting votes yet so all we know is party turnout but we don't know how these people that voted nobody does the only way you can determine early voting is after the election is over but yet we're still going to talk about so the final paragraph\nBut al ... is lurking out there and this is probably the biggest concern and the what else is lurking what yet to happen that hasn't happened that could swing a bunch of boats\nBut Google is a\nMan and get those are the kinds of things that people are up against and if there's a journalist David ... who ah who writes and [noise] a quote on his work here a bunch of times and he's out saying something that I have\nMentioned on this program countless times and then of course the Democrat Party\nIs the drive by media and vice versa drive by media is the Democratic\nParty they are they in fact I I think the drive by media is actually the organizing power\nA behind the Democratic party to Mr ... you're saying this but he's he's saying that in his opinion a growing number of the American people are aware of it now\nThe federalist that's right that's right he was an Mollie Hemingway in a gang and his his opinion is that a more and more Americans are six sink fully aware\nOf the unfairness the imbalance and by the way beyond by us if if that's\nTrue if a number of these things are true then they're convert will be a major\nSurprise and shock in store for the media and the Democrats on election day too\n'cause it's a parent now they think they've got this and the thing [noise]\nKind of ... dot com slash real\nLewis CNN really wonders why everybody can't stand them well one of the rangers said the biggest threat in the country maybe you might have fantasy dot com [noise]\n\nYou know my friends just like you protect the contents on your ... your purse [noise] these days you have to protect your online identities as well and you do that with a company you can trust that it's called life look at life locks on line of identity theft protection is\nThe best in the business and they're pretty much alone in this field I mean that other people to try to do this but nobody is as thorough as is has competent and reliable trustworthy as life lock is they are protecting\nOnline identities are more people than ever before in their company history their services include sifting through billions of daily online transactions in bank account charge account openings on behalf of their members to make sure that no one is using

want there in touch with your twenty four seven when they think something is up on your account\nIf you're not the person that is responsible for the aberrations in your account and there was evidence of fraud they are quick to help you determine this and then shut down this evidence of fraud as quickly as they can\nBe objective is sometimes actually catch it while it's happening sometimes they can do that\nMost times not but sometimes they can in any event\nYou'll learn when you have been defrauded in much of cybercrime you don't know it for a while you certainly don't know it when it happens but life lock\nWill get you in touch with his fraudulent behavior faster than anything and that's when you can take steps that they've got a restoration team of people staffed right here in the United

... one of\nMy pre Shiite that thank you same here\nI Am kind of talked about it all into why I and our apartment so God awful\nYou know it's an interesting question up there is there's an average there just something that people believe\nAs a as a practitioner of the spoken word form of mass communications one thing I have to deal with is that if people see it written\nIt could be in a rag tabloid it can be in an obscure website if you'd be the New York ... if they see it written they automatically think it's true it's just it's it's I don't know if it's it's a\nLifetime generational conditioning I don't know if it's psychological but if you see it it's true if you see it on TV you tend to believe that if there's a picture a company in the words then you really believe it\nHoping fair why don't they don't they are on\nA doubt how many people now wait a second now wait a second though how many people\nWhat is your advice do you have time to do that every day do you have time you hear something in your immediately skeptical view that run down everything you hear and confirm it yourself\nI can appreciate that now now they have that kind of right nobody has that kind of time\nMost people's lives are are chaos chaos and some days crisis to crisis and many many days people don't even care what's on the news they have things going on in their lives at take much more\nImportant to them have much more relevant so they're a lot of people are casual observers and they believe pretty much everything they see or hear [noise]\nBut I'm telling you it's a good question it's just it's it to me it has been a frustrating and no end as a practitioner of the spoken word how people believe if they read it no matter where it's published if it's on paper it's on a
