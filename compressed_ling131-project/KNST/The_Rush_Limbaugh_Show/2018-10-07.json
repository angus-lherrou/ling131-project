McNamara who we've had before on a show and I was listening to what he had said today and I follow him on his social media and he said something very cool this morning where\nHe is very intense individual as people that you've heard him on the show ... he says\nYou gotta wake up every morning\nWith the mentality that you have to do something to make yourself better than you were yesterday absolutely particularly when it comes to the violence that there is in this world because you can show to yourself and say there is no way that you can try to stop you could shelter your kids\nBut it's we live in a wider world and she said you have to wake up to the\nTrain in something so you could be able to kick your butt from yesterday yeah\nAnd he and and crushed says now the same thing is twice I've heard it in one day which is that's when it comes down to ... Chris we'll train you so\nSix months from now you can beat yourself up today [laughter] you know what I mean right I mean and that's what it comes down to it I think it's important\nIn the mirror everyday tied to start graying beard yeah yeah I Do with the beard [laughter] ah but do you know what I mean I think it's fantastic to see that and to hear that in in to see what options he gives agents it's another tool\nYou look at agents to carry their gun their their ass their old sea spray that ... different things here's another tool that\nYou don't have to worry about I'm a pouch to carry on your belt and it's a tool that you can carry for the rest of your life and that's what's important so I'm\nReally happy I was able to have him on I think it was fantastic\nThere's there's ... we had a ... a lot of other things planned on the show we wanted to talk about the issues of ice and all kinds of stuff I had some notes that I wrote down a on the incompetence of some leaders\nUm and I won't be able to get to those either or but it was just I I've been going through some issues were trying to deal with sector on some things and it always bothers me when\nI talk to these managers and they say well wait for an email response or I'll Wait for it and it's like your show\nWhere they are wrong and they know the wrong and you can have an another leader in that room that's\nHigher ranking that debt than them that tells them hey you're wrong right and they'll say okay that are still waiting for your email and that thing is just frustrating I've been dealing with that or they said and get your email right it's because they're scared to be responsible they're not responsible individuals\nAnd like I said before\nNot everyone but unfortunately\nUnited States border patrol continues to promote mediocrity and and I think now they're even lowering the bar and they're promoting failure which is angering me but we have a lot of good leaders to and and I'm hoping that there'll be some promotions here soon on on some leaders that I think are great leaders\nCool I Can't talk about who they are but that's I might leave it at that rented my seed folks we've come to the

me I wouldn't jeopardize but the things I Want to get to hear a and I can just as easily relate what the president said he just laying the Democrats out he was laying them out for the lying\nTrickster isn't skunks that they are he is linking the media to the Democrat Party which uh\nWe do with all the time here but uh you don't really hear the president or make it that direct about\nMe as he has just even Mr rated the credibility of all of these accusing Democrats Cory Spartacus Booker to Richard Blumenthal Dianne Feinstein or what have you with Feinstein if you'll recall\nToward the tail end of the hearing on friday before the vote came\nSomebody raised the question of how when the world that Christine ... forge a letter to Dianne Feinstein week\nBecause it was it ... we're made to understand that the letter said that she didn't want anybody to know her name and she didn't want to come forward yet the woman had written in the Washington\nPost she called the Washington Post tip line in the New York times she has an op ed published in the Washington Post but all along we're told she don't want to go public so people\nWere trying to claim you know for all this talk about what Kevin O's none of this poor woman it's the Democrat Party and the Democrats on this committee that have put her for a busy you most a note ringer it's so unfair it starts button light\nAnd it became\nObvious that there could be only three sources for the week because of limited possession of low water one would be Senator Feinstein end or her staff\nThe other would have to be a somebody in the media or the lawyers for Christine Blasey Ford who had seen the letter\nAnd so some senators began to say that it could well be Senator Feinstein and she sat there and filmed while this was happening and that was all the other possibilities\nWere mentioned she eventually asked for point of order the German Grassley and and said uh\nInteresting I I Need to react I Need to respond to this outrageous allegations that I or my staff had lead\nThis letter or just for the record I just asked my staff I just asked my staff in any of that Lisa and they have a short me that they didn't\n[laughter]\nBut what we saw when she was she turned around to her staff sitting behind her\nAnd she starts now that we can't hear what she said because it's off Mike but she's obviously asking them at anybody here in a leak it she turns or did you look at the ... she turns back to the camera we need to make it\nThis is a German we didn't leak it and Trump made fun of this and mocked it in his West Virginia appearance on Saturday Night\nBy say always this how we're going to determine who leak something she gets so turned her staff and asked them and they deny it and that it meanwhile Kavanaugh sits over here and has to undergo his seventh FBI background check\nHis accuser has no corroboration and no evidence and he's presumed to have done it\nAnd Dianne Feinstein gets to turn around and ask her staff hey did any of your leaked this letter and like oh no I don't know what was the last one to ... she turns back around so we we didn't do it and listen to him and as the case closed it wasn't us they had done it it was strategic just like what happened on friday was to teach it\nStrategic ladies and gentlemen I became aware yesterday\nOf a transcript\nOf a conference call that have occurred last week among and between Democrat activists who were planning exactly what happened on friday it's laid out in this thing now unfortunately I Can't reproduce this and put it at Rush Limbaugh dot com because I don't legally habit\nBut I've got it I'm not going to mention any names but the names of the Democratic front groups in organizations are here and the strategies that they use and it makes it crystal clear that they were going to target Jeff Flake\nThat he was seen as the most malleable and the easiest to intimidate the elevator\nIncident where it just happens\nThat to nearly insane anti Kavanaugh pro democratic activist ended up there in flakes elevator with us CNN camera right there to catch what happened and they started shouting they started accusing and they started pointing fingers he got scared to death\nIt was all part of the strategy to turn him\nAnd it was there was there was a three point strategies a flake strategy was number
