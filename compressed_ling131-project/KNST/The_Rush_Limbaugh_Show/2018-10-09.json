to everybody what I think the real\nThreats that we face are so that's coming up as the program unfolds\nBack however to the ceremony at the White House last night with the president first off apologizing to the nation\nApologizing to cabinet shop on behalf of everybody in America for what was done to him for what happened to him and the cabinet episode caught a size exactly what I think we're up against\nAnd it illustrates something else that I think a lot of people are having trouble understanding we're not in a battle\n\nOf ideas\nThe left is not interested in our ideas we're up again we're battling people who do not want us to exist they have no desire to coexist with us they have no desire for the ongoing\nPolitical arguments over the best way to do things for the majority of people that's not their interests their interest is the elimination of opposition\nHowever it can happen\nHave no limit on how low they will go on how deprived and perverted they will be in seeking their reality in all I Am convinced started on America's college campus well tracing where it started I mean to go back to the twenties so\nThe influence of communist influence but\nFor the purposes of my being able to explain this the most recent starting point\nWould be the most compelling I think was the best way to get people's attention with it because most people's historical perspective begins with a day they were born or and so ancient history is if they've not been taught it uh they don't know it\nSo the the closer to the present you can trace the beginnings of current problems the more effective persuasion will be it's always been my feeling on\nThis I thought but they don't ... folks we are not legitimate in their eyes ideas are not legitimate our existence is not legitimate and not even worthy of discussion or acknowledge\n\nAnd they don't even look at the United states the way we do\nDon't accept the founding of the country the principles in our founding documents they accept none of that none of that is relevant ... all of that is part of the discrimination\nThat was founded as part of this country as far as they're concerned\nAnd it was all on display in a capital hearings everything that we are up against the absence a presumption of innocence cabinet was guilty because he's a conservative Kavanaugh was guilty not because they had any evidence Kavanaugh was guilty because in their minds he's got no business being a judge\nAnd he's got no business being a judge because he's not one of them it's no more complicated than that how they get rid of him that's another story\nBut his illegitimacy is born of a simple fact that he's not on their team that he's not one of them\nSo anything that can get rid of him and directly in their world is entirely non just permissible but it's required if you have to deny him the presumption of innocence then that's what we'll do\nIf you bring forward a woman who can't prove what she says but his believable saying it then that's fine that's what we'll do\n\nIf it takes the Democrats and Chuck Schumer and Dianne Feinstein strategizing together for a month coming up with this\nAnd that's what we'll do\nIt has

close enough attention and those are the names being bandied about might be\nBut they're going to do it on principle they're going to do it because they think it'll be a political advantage headed in

ground but in their generic Paul the Democrat advantages widening out a plus for team that I I just I maybe it's my desire\nMaybe it's my hope but I just doesn't make any sense that the generic ballot would be plus an west the sample is so warped\nAnd so out of kilter and out of balance that it makes sense that way\nI just I I find it really hard to believe that after the last\nTwo to four weeks a majority of Americans Thirteen percent want the Democrats to start taking over Congress asked representatives\nI Know what drives a lot of that is the formula\nThe first midterm elections after a new president is sworn in the president's party takes it on the Jim this is standard operating procedure it's been proven in Ninety percent of auto elections there are exceptions to it I think Nineteen Ninety six was that election certainly to the exception two thousand two as well\nBut I don't I don't look at what's going on here the last two weeks\nEspecially I and even the last four I don't see where there's this massive realization that the Democrats are they answered a what ails America\nNow the dry buys want everybody to see it that way so they report it that way but in their generic polled the Democrats have their back to a plus Thirteen\nMargin advantage but then you look at individual races and they're nowhere near a Democrat Thirteen points up [noise]\nAnd then it elsewhere in their poll Trump's approval rating has gone up since the Kavanaugh confirmation fight came to a conclusion with independents disapproving of the Democrats' handling of the capital nomination by twenty eight point margin\n\nEven though the Democrats on the surface would seem to have public opinion on their side and\nSays the Washington Examiner just thirty six percent approved of how they handle the nomination compared to fifty six percent who disapproved of further breakdown finds that fifty eight percent of independence disapproved of the way Democrats handled everything compare to thirty percent who approved other\n\nIndependence also disapproved of Republicans handling of the matter but by and narrower fifty three of the thirty two percent [noise] so what does that mean independence disapproved of every body of it you know big ... [noise] I Can't prove anything all I have to go on a\nExperience guided by intelligence and intelligence guided by experience an instinct I'd just died down everybody believes is blue wave it doesn't matter where you go every story that drudge for example links\nLinks to on his page is a story of the Democrats with a massive landslide retaking the house of representatives and there are stories\nWhere Republicans supposedly think the same thing is going to happen certainly you you've talked to swamp lowers your I mean you you hear from a lot of Republicans who think their toast big march you do you think they're toast big margin toast in the house of representatives\nWell what I Know what what what what\n[noise] yeah well\nYeah I'd like to get an individual polls visual nine percent in nine seed advantage even after the worst happens of all that that's getting into the into the new show I'm I'm just talking about over all the national\nAttitude um and I look I'll be honest I'm always having to dial myself back um I I'm One of these people you probably are too I'm only ... people are thinking everybody agreed with me we would have the best country in the history of countries\nIf everybody looked at life the way I Do and looked at other people a way I Do it looked at issues and everybody looked at American the way I Do nobody would ever stop us\nAnd I'm sure you feel that way now and then but we have to\nTemper that with reality this is a lot of loony tunes out they're incapable of seeing the country the\nWay we do for a host of reasons have you heard ladies and gentleman that the Clintons are going to start a massive stadium tour\n\nBill and Hillary won again in want to get in on all of this Trump action\nNow I\nI'm I've been wondering how long it was going to be until somebody in the Democratic party tried this\nTrump's rallies dating back to the two thousand sixty in campaign\n\nAnd do not doubt me on this either the Democrats in the media publicly acted on concerned on an interest in and would always say a variation\nOf you can't judge voter interest on the basis of rallies you can't predict how people are going to vote simply because of the size of crowds at political rallies these Trump rallies are not telling us that it doesn't mean anything\nHe's or just rabbit people upset with their lives and they think Trump is going to kick all of people out of the country they don't like it it's not saying it's not anywhere near representative\nOf the population this is what they all said that every Trump rally\nPrivately do not doubt me privately they were jealous as they could be and they were the thing\nBecause there's not a one of them on the Democrats' side who could come anywhere close to eat willing that kind of excitement that kind of loyalty and knows sized crowds\nObama couldn't do it not in two thousand sixteen Hillary couldn't do it ever but certainly not in two thousand she couldn't she couldn't she couldn't draw flies to her book signing ceremonies\nHillary Clinton who couldn't draw a crowd anywhere good people knew she might not be able to stand up for a full twenty five minutes\nWithout some aid coming out the proper up by the elbows\nBut seriously I guarantee you they were looking at those crowds they were looking at those Trump rallies and they would never say so publicly but they were scared to death by him they would never say so publicly they would never admit it publicly they would say just the opposite but they're human\nBeings in any kind any any time anybody in politics has that kind of popularity and that kind of loyalty that equals jealousy envy and anger and all things that attached to jealousy envy\nThey have the Trump to begin with and the fact that Trump was turning everything they believed in upside down the fact that Trump was being able to accomplish things they couldn't\nJust in terms of average Americans being interested in the campaign interested in the candidacy and those rallies twenty thousand Fifteen twenty five thousand as many people lined up outside who couldn't get in wanted to get in\nTrump with his airplane perfectly placed so that Trump in giant letters in the fuselage was behind him at every stop when he made his speech except for those events that took place inside actual arenas so I I've been wondering\nHow long it's going to be before somebody on the Democrats' side tries to get in on this action and I always thought you know who I thought it would be that would make the first Abbott trying it Joe Biden\nI really thought that Joe Biden would be the first guy that try to replicate this\nThen I thought maybe Michelle my bell Obama but then I thought no they've got too much to lose if it doesn't work\n\nMaybe Kamala Harris maybe some of these ... that somebody's going to do this somebody's got to try if they've got\nTo be able to show\nThe Democrats thinking they've got to show that there's as much excitement as much loyalty as much\nAttention as Trump and draw up till now nobody on the Democratic side has even given it\nA prayer until the Clintons\nThe daily wire has the story Washington Power couple bill and Hillary Clinton announced yesterday that they are embarking on a nationwide stadium toured\nTaking the Clintons stage show to Thirteen cities this ball it's going to be called an evening with President Bill Clinton and former secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton that the actual title of the show\nIt'll feature the Clintons sharing stories and inspiring anecdotes that shape their historic careers in public service while also discussing issues\nOf the day and looking toward the future the tour is being sponsored by live nation by nation also hosting a stadium tour for Michelle my bell the Clinton turtle started\nIt is their blood and water and food polling data it's how they get through the day every day pulling anything and if the Democrats are publishing stories to each other that two thirds nine seats are leading their way and if there is no blue wave\nI don't think there's gonna be an Alan ... sanity anywhere to be found on the Democrats' side of the Iowa or in the media\nTo hundred nine seats firmly or leaning\nIn the Democratic column let me ask you a question what could be causing this let's let's assume for a moment just as a as a hypothetical exercise let's assume this is true can you tell me what it is anything\nOne thing a series of things that have American voters [noise] so so ticked off at Republicans\nThat they cannot wait to go out and vote Democrat so that the Democrats run the house what is it what have the Republicans done or not done that would warrant this kind of nation wide disgust with the party\nNow the left will tell you the answer to that question is Trump\nThat the people of this country despise Donald Trump and some people in this country have been poised to send Trump packing ever since election night\nTwo thousand sixteen they can't wait to get out there and showed their ... for Trump and the only way they can do it has to vote against Republicans All right well as I say we're hypothetically pretending this is true what has Trump done to generate that\nKind of disgust other than be alive and be president what has he done no no I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm being serious what you want to take it\nAll started when he said he separated families at the border I'm Glad you reminded me of that\nIt's getting harder and harder to watch television shows what was I watching the other you know this this last week was premier awake for all the new network prime time shows I think it was law and order in yeah law and order and you're SUV or something and and\nUh the show started out focusing\nOn a bad guy who had little kids in his basement in a cage and the SVU\nCops are running around trying to prove this guy's a rubber band of the first order and you\nKnow officer you know\nOur government money is separating the two parents that are born or and I am having them\nAnd the cops we bought everything oh wow we don't have a pervert here we have a hero this guy and I watch this that well that's it for the show\nThe level of idiocy and stupidity and ignorance that just permeates places in this country\nWhere it ought not be there are people ought to be more educated more informed smarter\nBut that's gone we have replaced\nInformed

says Anders ... look in your memoir you talk about an experience for a sitting Senator John tower basically try to sexually assault you in the back of a tax\nFolks John Tower would never be in a taxi that would be such a demeaning kind of car to be in the Senate or you don't drive around and yellow cabs\n[noise] you have a car service a limo driver ... well anyway she asserts that happened in a cab\nThat John Tower tried to sexually assault you in the back of the tax you didn't come forward them and you didn't come forward when the senator was nominated for ... that's what it was they nominated the guy for secretary of defense and that's when all this came out but\nSally Quinn didn't didn't Anderson Cooper wants to know why she didn't say anything\nDragnet rid of this nightclub and

a cab driver would lie about Ninety miles an hour because he realized what was happening in the back of the car then senator screech to a halt in\nFront of our quarter is and I think than tower got
