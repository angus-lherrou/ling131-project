sanity and Trump knows that and he's trying to send your over the edge with this stuff to make sure you go vote\nIt's again a classic expression or illustration of how they haven't the slightest idea who the people are voting for Donald Trump who remains supportive of Donald Trump but that will get to more details on I ... back to my little test so I rented of these people at the event last\nNight it's going to\nBe a red wave Russia and listen to you every day and I'm telling you it's going to be a red wave but I said I Hope you're right but let me\nLet me tell you what we're up against forty five Republicans have announced their resignations forty five I mean that is a huge number many of them are\nCommittee chairmen not all but many of them are committee chairman and they are resigning are retiring because they don't want to go back to being jumps you know just regular house members it's a it's a big come down so we want to try to parlay their years in the house\nInto private sector success I spent forty five seats incumbency has has incredible power reelection\nPower certainly old back me up on the season students viewed the incumbent in house races windows Ninety eight percent of the time well we've got forty five Republicans who are not incumbents we've got forty five Republicans will never run before\nNobody knows I mean there are districts they're known but they're not as known as incumbents\nAre known as well known so that that makes some of this somewhat iffy I and and then there is the traditional statistical aspect which says that the party\nThat holds the White House in the first mint terms after a presidential election all ways Lewis's\nSeats so forty five seats they cave and\nTough to defend\nAs opposed to if those forty five had not resigned and we're still in the house you can count on a lot of those is reelect that you can't count now Israel legs\nAnd this is what the left and the drive by as are counting on\nIs that many of those forty five of flip\n\nAnd then you've got a contest of all races are in in other parts Senate of course another thing now I mentioned this to all of these people they didn't care and they said they're aware of this they knew about the resigned resigning members of Congress retiring they ... they didn't know the number of them did\nBut their attitude was and it doesn't matter it doesn't matter uh the American people are fed up and\nThey are sophisticated and the people who are elected Trump and know exactly what's at stake they're not gonna sit home they're not going to twiddling their thumbs they're not confident they're not sitting there thinking that job was done when they went and voted in two thousand sixty and it was kind of pleasant to um\nTo what the here although there was a lot of emotion and I'm like I Can't deny that night interestingly I ran across a piece today have a website called America dot com and it's by Dr Gerard Francisco slum arrow expert on the forecast models\nI'm I'm not familiar with his work by his headline is rent wave coming in the house and the Senate\n\nMy forecast for the twenty Eighteen congressional elections he says there will be a conservative red wave in the house with two hundred and twenty five a two hundred and twenty eight Republicans elected\nTo office and in the Senate with fifty eight to sixty Republicans elected to office let's look at some of the reasons that went into my forecast Dr ... and Merrill rights\n\nAs you remember from my book great news for [laughter]\n... member of my great book grading the presidential election of two thousand sixteen was both an historic and critical election that ushered in a new American constitutional era that I called the conservative era long range trans as well as short range trends came together to cause a fundamental shift\nIn ah in each of our two major political parties in addition the other major changes took places well those were predicted unexplained uh in addition to lower Democrat voter intensity\nAmong democratic voters Democrats have another major problem there are movements of democratic voters that are abandoning their party and voting for conservatives\n\nAnd it's all being ignored he says by the drive by media these free movements of democratic voters abandoning their party are the walk away movement the reading\nPill movements and the great awakening movement\nAnd he goes on to describe what these what these are I've I'm no I'm unfamiliar with the red still\nA movement but\n... says he's got eight productions here that'll happen in the near future and they appear to be happening as we approach the mid term elections\nWe've witnessed a series of fall surprises including the capital hearings October surprises caravan of crisis mail bombs to some Democrats synagogue mass shooting we've seen outstanding economy tempered by considerable volatility a Wall Street we have seen extreme by it but that's another thing you know what the consumer confidence numbers are over the top\n\nConference board consumer confidence numbers over the top these numbers are not the kind of numbers you see in the ... electorate thats unhappy and angry and looking for radical change\nAt least that has been the case or in in the past question comes down to just how important a factor is\nThe economy in elections of um [noise] candidates in this in this climate or the dry buys would like you to believe the economy doesn't matter hill of beans but they always say that when the economy is going great with Republican administrations uh\nThe effort to give credit to Obama the attempt by Obama to take credit for the economy however would argue that Democrats in the media think it is a problem\n\nThere's talk all over Twitter that Hollywood leftist are promising blood in the streets if Democrats do not win the house\n\nAnyway back to our production here from this doctor Dr Gerard Francisco alum arrow what has been the impact of these false surprises and the other events this is his personal thinking and again these\nThese events these false surprises he calls them we call them October surprises that Kavanaugh hearings that was that we know what that was the I mean that was totally trumped up\nMade up charges to derail Trump's Supreme Court nominee along the way it toward the railing Trump or we have the October surprises the usual the caravan of crisis mail bomb to some Democrats synagogue mass shooting what's what's been the impact of these calls are prizes and other events\nWhile intended to hurt President Trump and keep Republicans from holding the house all of the above surprises in advance\nHave worked to enhance the conservative red wave according to this guy instead of creating a building a blue wave of the red wave continues Republican voter intensity exceeds the much heralded\nAnd that's one of the reasons they retired I Would be remiss if I didn't mention is there were a lot of them I don't know about the total number forty five but a lot of them quip because they were just\nFed up that Trump won and that Trump was leading the Republican\nParty and they don't want anything to do with it some of them are committee chairmen and decided they wouldn't go to go back just being regular house bozos because it's such a come down you know to have been a committee germ and then go back to being just a regular venture or back venture\nIn their place and this this orders\nWell in their place many of the Republicans who got the primary\nNominations to replace these never Trump hers were retiring are Trump supporters\nThey were Trump yet\nAnd so the the total number forty five resigning is not in and of itself a completely negative\nCharacteristic the power of incumbency still can't be denied it's an amazing thing I think it's still true house races in Ninety eight percent of them the incumbent wins\nEvery year year and year out regardless there might be a year or two where there's a larger wider variants than that but that's the overall stat\nBuddy it could well be that\nThe never Trump or is that retired knew they had no prayer anyway in their districts and so they quote unquote took the high road of the the the\nStomach Trump Trump's before when I don't I don't want to be partners potentially split the scene and they're\nReplaced by a ... and Trump supporters so that could end up being a net positive okay when we come back the drive by media all over now blaming me we're back\nFirst it was the Oklahoma City bombing and now me and others in conservative media being blamed for

anymore and it's\nIt's it's really pathetic of these people on the left because they all started with me being blamed the Oklahoma City bombing by Bill Clinton and it's just ratcheted up from there and it's all an attempt to suppress political speech the left doesn't want to hear [noise]\nAnd now even though the gunman at the synagogue on Saturday in Pittsburgh was\nA guy hated Trump the drive

I I have at times I marveled that this country is held together the way it has for many years as if has\nGiven the only thing that really holds us all together as a piece of paper or a series of pieces of paper the U.S constitution the honor system and the reverence the respect for that document is what's held us together\nIn all of our years we have never elected a desperate or a tyrant who want to literally rip it up throw it away and establishes on tyrannical dictatorship but it's amazing\nBut we're getting dangerously close to the same thing happening when one of our political parties refuses to accept\nElection results for whatever reason it make it up well it was stolen the Russians this or that if it doesn't matter when they refused to accept\nIt means that there really isn't any unity around the premise of our country\nAnd we may not unify issue to issue the issue\nBut we always have been unified about the premise of America as founded that's what's under assault today and that is what is in my mind a profoundly dangerous and we are raising him have been since the seventies\nGeneration after generation of students who have been taught things that have nothing\nIn common with the founding of the country we have not taught children we've we've ... you go back to the days when we learned that I'm a\n... in junior high intramural football and soccer ball that nobody won that there were no outs in baseball you know no kid ever struck out the kidney hit until they hit the ball put it in play there were no losers there were no winners\nOutcome based education two plus two was five if you thought it was by we weren't going to humiliate people were wrong the people who are really smart in school in a slow them down we're not going to service their superior ability to learn or going to slow them down so it was not to offend anybody else\nAnd we've not gotten to this point where kids have been raised cobbled\nThey had been taught phony notions of self esteem self esteem today does not derive from achievement an accomplishment it derives from I have a right to help self esteem parents have been\nTeaching little kids your perfect little Johnny you're perfect little Suzie I'm In it and not prepared for adversity and so when nobody has been raised to deal with adversity which in this case is losing an election we have temper tantrums and we have a child light snowflake behavior on college campuses\nAnd we have a political party that's behind all of this\n\nRight now it's rooted in the failure to accept the results\nOf an election\nThat is on going and now on Twitter as I said you can find posts Hollywood people promising that there will be blood if the Democrats do not win\nThe house back there will be blood so people are being threatened if not directly but in a generic sense all of it is designed to limit turn out\nI think it's having the exact opposite impact on people I think the left and the drive by media continue to understand misunderstand who Democrats are Trump voters are why they are Trump voters and why they aren't going anywhere [noise]\nUh let's see if we were also here being being told that we need a new kinds of civility that the Trump\nPresidency and all of his supporters are promoting all this in ... and the violence and so forth when it could be said that it's the exact opposite I ...\nI think reasonable I'm harping on the fact people refused to accept election results it's profoundly indicative of who they are and it's a large explanation of why they're behaving as they as they do\nAnd it's ... refusal to accept this not just because Trump one it's not just because they hate Trump it's more than that it's because they lost they were fully expecting to win and they didn't and so they simply refuse it because\nIt's not a matter of thinking it's a matter of feeling they don't feel happy I don't feel good and when they feel bad and something's not right and that's also been part of the education system\n\nSo we'll get some headlines Tom ...

phones week oh this is Dan in Manchester, Connecticut welcome sir great to have you here\nThat get Russia I wanted to thank you for telling people about the truth intent of section one an amendment for team because I've been trying to do the same thing for years and people are on in the midst impression that it simply means if a child born to illegal aliens in this country automatically becomes an American citizen\nYou can't blame 'em it's been the case since the sixties and it's it's it's a\n... ... ... it it it's your we're we're dealing with mass ill education that's taken place on a lot of things in this country and that's why it's so important that we've got a president willing to push back on it yet right what's causing this is causing any discussion of it this is how it happens I've told everybody\nThat this is what pushing back is going to look like so\nWhile you were talking about Dred Scott as a reason why the fourteenth amendment was ratified which was actually on July night they teach sixty eight but\nAnother reason why it was ratified is because it goes back to the thirteenth amendment that abolish slavery well the southern states work though accept that so they pass laws are codes that were so restrictive the plaques\nThat essentially made them slaves once again and they were called the black codes so then Congress said okay you want to play that game then we're going to formally recognize former slaves of citizens which will make them subject to all the privileges or immunities to the citizens in several strays ... article for section two claws one\nSo after that the ... were abolished and that's why we have a ... you know the fourteenth amendment\nAnd matter of fact you know the one of the ... the the guy is considered the founding father to the fourteenth amendment was represented by the name of John Bingham from Ohio and he made some remarks about the fourteenth amendment if you're a few years later and you can find that in a house report number twenty two dated Eighteen Seventy one January thirtieth\nSo all explains how this joint committee passed the fourteenth amendment so President Trump with all due respect to him he wouldn't be not be ending birthright citizenship because it never happened he would be upholding the U.S constitution\nWell that's the point that is exactly the point that I made is why he should do this and that's his\nPoint people have looked into this\nMay have found different rationale than you did but the point is if you look at the original intent of people who were involved in writing the fourteenth amendment all Trump is doing is enforcing the constitution and taking it back to its original intent the fourteenth amendment was never intended\nTo confer citizenship on people here illegally or the sons and daughters of ambassadors are foreign agents\nIt was expressly written\nLooking first citizenship on slaves and now it has been expanded and again that you can trace it back to the Nineteen sixties when this began which coincides with the Democratic party wanting to re open immigration you know I still run into people who do not believe me when I tell them\nThat as a nation we suspended for the most part I mean ... there's always been\nA people being rapid citizenship but we suspended mass immigration\nFrom the mid Nineteen twenties to the mid sixties pretty express reason of allowing all of those who would emigrated starting in the late Eighteen hundreds all the way through the Nineteen twenties to assimilate\nThat's what immigration was people were coming here to become Americans and they wanted to be Americans\nThey didn't have to give up their birthright they didn't happen and they they settled in uh in neighborhoods\nIrish have their neighborhoods in New York and Philadelphia the Italians ... ditto but they wanted to become Americans they learned English and they became part of American culture of which there is a distinct in unique American culture which is rooted in western civilization\nThat's what's different now there is no interest in that we don't even make a serious effort at assimilating we're Balkan icing\nThis term tribal but we're more organizing our population because modern arrivals don't all seek to become Americans people trying to get them on the on the legal immigration side of course are\nBut this this mass illegal immigration has an entirely different purpose behind it and political support is in ...\nThe different for it and for standard uh immigration so what Trump is doing is simply with his executive order if he does this\nWill be reestablishing the constitution and re asserting it so yeah no you're exactly right about that so two calls to great points but the guy who from Pittsburgh who asked a question he lives there and he watches the news and he's been blamed\nFor the Senate God surely [noise]\nWe've got a tone it down and we got a company gotta we gotta do this we've got to do that\nAnd if it's being\nSet up as being said in the media you know it's all aimed at Trump and his supporters appreciate the call again Southampton in New York build your next great to have you with us or Hi\nThank you Russian thanks for all that you do for us yesterday about ... with the ... um with regard to the fourteenth amendment why not take it to the Supreme Court or is that where this is going to end up actually show that they can decide oh it'll be their language says it'll get there and I'll get there okay yeah it'll\nIt'll have to get there that no Senator Graham is going to offer legislation that the Senate uh [noise] look we're way way far away from this we're just getting the conversation started here which has to happen\nMan I don't think the solution to this is enterprise zones and it was on my door or Guatemala\nUh maybe long term a economic relief for any nation having problem is a greater dose of capitalism but there isn't the political climate for that and many of these countries there their dictatorships one degree or another and\nThis is an immediate problem that's going to have to be dealt because if it's not they're just going to keep coming\nAnd it's ...\nWe're not going to stop these caravans if we start implementing a tax free enterprise zones nominees nations where American companies can relocate and hire them there instead of hiring them here\nBecause that's these people aren't capable being hired anywhere yet\nBut I understand is if you want to talk of political theory and economic theory it makes all\nSince in the world and otherwise you know quote unquote normal circumstances but this is a short term political movement here this caravan\nI Know has a George Soros I think George Soros his name has become a like a bogeyman for everything people mean far left wing radicals when they mentioned George Soros I don't know who's behind but somebody is and their purpose is to destabilize the United states\nThe purpose is not to improve life from these people\nThis caravan whoever's behind this is not really trying to do something for these people to make their lives better this is being done to to invoke damage on the United states protect generally Trump and to advance the political advantages and notions of a particular political party\nWhich wants to welcome these people in as dependent voters a\nJam in

five when Bill Clinton blamed Rush Limbaugh and talk radio or for the Oklahoma City bombing you have to be very careful that you don't start to tell people that their political speech isn't allowed

radicalizing the guy that shot up\nThe Republican baseball practice we never hear about the whoever was radicalized\n\nAny of these leftists and Hillary Clinton rats always this one way street there's always you don't want is rooted in bugs it's rooted in the belief that not a single conservative can make up his or her mind but what\nAbout anything one of the first criticisms of this program dating back to Nineteen eighty eight was that you are a bunch of mind numbed robots and I am your spend golly and I\nAm telling you what to think every day because you're too stupid to make up your mind on your own I'm telling you what to think I'm telling you what to do I'm telling you how to vote I'm telling you want to go that has been the criticism and what does that rooted in rooted in\nThe presumption of superior intellect to people on the left and the belief that you are literal idiots\nWho cannot make up your mind on anything what they never understood and they made no effort to understand that and the fact that they make no effort to understand it or understand Trump and his voters is what's largely doing them in\nThey never understood that you already believe what you believe you already thought what you thought when I came along all I did was repeat what all of you had been saying to each other\nBut you ... you were not hearing it anywhere in national media what you believed was always laughed\nAt or criticize made fun of mocked but you were never\nGiven any respect whatsoever than this program came along and it reflected what you think and what you say well you were talking about with your friends and that's why you're glom onto what\nNot because you were sitting out there in your relative ignorance stay in and out all of a sudden started learning things so the presumption is that you're so stupid and your soul mindless\nThat's been golly you can tell you how do you think or tell you when to start blowing things up or window started shooting people\nAnd that we've even got never Trump conservatives or out saying this kind of thing\nAnd it all boils down you know what I keep the essence of things that these\nWorries they're real anger at directed at you think it's Trump and it is but the real anger is for you voted for him\nThat is where they are fed up beyond their ability to express it and the fact that they can't talk you out of supporting Trump there seems to be tied\n\nYour is the reason that this was all going because you have the stupidity of voting for the guy and now\nYou're blowing things up and you're shooting people

and welcome happy to have you here with us so\nThank you so much for taking my call today ration thank you for all you do you bet I could find to make a quick point that's a hard left and the media and the specially Hollywood and I think things have been engaging in gas sliding out the right\nWould you expect when you define that I hear so many people use that word [noise] okay would you tell me how your impending it to be defined\nOkay gas lighting and they're not common example is when I'm In a family they cripple usually been nice this trial in the family to take care of all of that they can ...\nAnd what they do is say ridicule that person they talk about and they snare at then and especially when people aren't looking and then at that person dares to get angry oh look look look at look at how bad you are and\nThen they tell everyone they know how bad this person is and they make this entire narrative and what they believe Russia that that person is an idiot ... they're not evil\nNow I'm not seeing it all that every I'm liberal person in like that I think that they're these kinds of people exist on both sides but I think that a lack elevate people like this and I think the right type that shut them up\nUm and that's really all you can do I mean you can't always control he's on your side but you can control the you elevate\nAnd I'm lying is perfectly fine if your gas lighting um and especially the dog whistle because you just imagine what the person says oh well clearly that with race well they use the word the oh why don't you know what the the dog was with someone on the right uses that\nTrying to use the word the that that kind of watch it what\nWhat look what word ... the T H ...\nOh gee I'm suffering [noise]\nBiting off the project ... years of of watch the video and listen to my interview with James off again if you don't [noise]\n\nKnow let me explain what I meant I'm suffering here I'm In the last two callers have been speaking a mile a minute and I've been unable to hear enough of what they were saying [noise] to comprehend so I had to put it together after they hung up the most\nRecent caller I lost her when she just how families\nWill gas light a the weakest number of the family I've I've never seen that so I'm rolling it back and forth on my head but then I finally heard when she was talking about her definition of gas light a I got\nAn ... her point was that the Democrats the media and get to define everything\nThey get to define that get to decide everything what they say is is what is in anybody isn't that then of course those abnormal or what have you and that that that has been my point it's just a different way of saying that\nIt irritates the hell out of me too I watch the media that my my favorite example of it and I'm Sorry for being redundant here Indiana and there are countless examples here Indiana pastoral religious freedom Restoration Act the media hated it\nIt was in response to people not being allowed to tell gay couples no I'm not going to bake a cake for your reception I my religion doesn't allow me to do that so these gay couples would then they would target these places hoping for that reaction and they'd file a lawsuit strength to put these bakeries and photo shop businesses out of business\nAnd the media would come right along and act like that was entirely justified\nThat these bigots would refuse to bake a\nCake or take photos at a gay wedding reception or what have you uh so when someone when when Indiana passes along Pence has the governor the media was outraged and they began\nTo report on this as though the whole country was outraged that Indiana was somehow a loan out post of racism and bigotry and homophobia\nAnd it's this this this\nAttitude and all things that they do wear what they report in the way they report it what they say is what is normal and they get to decide who the big gets are and who the uh the racist are and once that happens your tag you're it and then they ran around and they started knocking on doors\nAsking businesses\nWould you bake a pizza when you when you make a piece of ... and they found a little girl Twenty one year old woman a running a pizza shop for her family you know we wouldn't it would be against them so they zeroed in on this Twenty one year old woman and they wanted to make her out\nTo be the typical Indiana bitch it\nAnd she was just answering their questions naive really an immensely she was just trying to be honest with them she bought that they were really interested in what\nWere asking about they were looking for a victim they were looking for a target and she fit the bill and so for however long the reporting of that went on Indiana was uh the people in it are odd weird racist beget sexist ... I Know exactly what the caller ... Democrats get to decide well let me tell you something folks\nNot true anymore that may be the way they report it and they met that may be what they try to create but people rebelled against they've called Donald\nTrump people rebelled against that the Democrats since Obama had been losing elections don't lose sight of this starting in two thousand than the Democrats have lost over a thousand\nMaybe it's closer to twelve hundred electoral seats at federal state local level\nAnd there's a reason for this they are being rejected and the media is being rejected as as well and so gas if if if what the media did to the state of Indiana is\nGas lighting is if that's what the definition is now heartily endorse it\nAnd er and accepted and it's this arrogance and supremacy of superiority that goes along with that kind of coverage and it's it's everywhere it's\nYou have a synagogue shooting the obvious the obvious explanation\nIs that Donald Trump and his conservative media policy are radicalizing and this becomes the narrative this becomes just the way it is and everybody thinks this\nIs crucial for me to the weather report these things to make it look like they are the majority and they are what's normal went increasingly they aren't\nAnd what really is happening here is that people who knows they are not by definition\nThe numbers normal are trying to turn everything upside down so that what they are is normal and what everybody else is is the one that's odd ball abnormal the media is right in their facilitating them I'm telling you\nIt isn't it used to work like a charm\nOn many people still does we still have a lot of people in our side still want to couch out of the media still wanted to find whether or not\nConservatives or Republicans are succeeding by virtue of whether the media as being nice to them or not it's frustrating to know when when I run into people like that and they're out there\nBut\nThe electoral results just in the past two years indicate that people are more and more aware of this and pushing back\nAgainst that uh to see what [noise]\nI didn't see this I didn't watch Fox News Sunday on Sunday but apparently Chris ...
