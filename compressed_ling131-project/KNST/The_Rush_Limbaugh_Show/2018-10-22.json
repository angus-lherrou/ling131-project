out amazing how honest it is in terms of what people who do journalism think its purpose is\nDestroying people both of these papers in this in this miniseries end up targeting the same targets the same powerful people some of them in government some of them out\nOr some of them not but it makes it clear that journalists think their job is to destroy the\nBig people powerful people rich people there obviously has\nTo be something they're doing with breaking the rules and the gun suits breaking the rules there has to be something air mistreating people they are sexually abusing people they are stealing from the public Dole they're doing something and the purpose of journalists ... call 'em out and\nAnd and ruin them which many many years ago when I first began to encounter the media as a target I was never\nI had a little taste of it when I was in Sacramento there were a couple of reporters at that paper that that that that have me and their crosshairs simply it was it was liberal versus conservatism but I mean I I didn't really get a full dose of it until this program started and I remember sitting talking to us and people about it\nAnd they said you have to understand what journalism is\nI said you mean the bias well there's that but that it it's it's more than that said it's about ruining people it's about targeting and destroying people how do you think resumes are built\nJournalists are these little medium size markets are small markets don't target somebody and they if they run a profile or a or a a a piece on somebody\nThat can be made to look accurate that nails them as guilty of this transgression or that transgression particularly against the little people in that report or is going to get noticed and that's how that's how that reporter climbed a ladder if you go back to the early days of sixty\nMinutes it was all about that and it remains so today it's just it's it's evolved to adapt to the current climate which the only person they want to destroy the day now is Donald Trump\nAnd any Republican who gets in the way like Kevin all it's all about destroying people the thing about this series is it makes no bones about it I I don't recognize the names of the writer\nOr writers I don't recognize the stars I've never seen them in and things for I don't recognize the names of the producers\nAnd I haven't taken the time to Google that many of them but I watched this I've seen two episodes so far out of the ...\nAnd I catch myself my mouth is wide open it's agape a couple of times watching this thing at how raising early on is

only an inch away from the word ... to file\nYet the story is not about the prime minister being Pete if I was about somebody else the prime minister is limited and outrage calls the guy in in the

Trump what do you think that does the Democrat turned out\n\nA couple of weeks from now three ... what do you think that does that's why I don't think there's anything in here on collusion\nI don't think there's anything in it on obstruction because folks didn't want to read the sixteen never Trump anti Trump paid mongers on Mueller's team if they had the guns yeah what a week and it would be leaking right now and it would be used to guarantee a blue wave\nIf Mueller doesn't have any of that there is no way they want this released before the midterms that's why\nSo nobody said this stupid\nBut it's bad for our country but they're going to vote Democrat no matter what we do they will be voting Democrat and they understand that that's why Democrats support programs like catch and

almost eighty percent of their time on the show ...\n\nEighty percent may have even if it's just sixty percent of their time on your show again they're not focusing on the care of him\nThat tells me\nThat if the caravan weren't a Democrat idea designed to embarrass Trump that they would\nBe covering it and building it up and with people down there interviewing these people creating sob stories there'd be there'd be man on the street interviews with a mean guy Trump is are they just want to come to America and that may yet happen down the road but CNN\nIs is not wall to wall but they are predominantly focusing on the show gave and of course whenever CNN does just to try to damage Trump let's look and see wife CNN is so ticked off because Trump's approval numbers are higher than they've ever been now\nAnd there are higher than Obama's war at this stage in the ah in his mid terms of the same point in his presidency after two years there just beside themselves none of this\nIs happening the way it was supposed to happen now there's more and more stories about how the blue wave may not happen hint hint it never was going to happen I don't I don't think anybody has ever known whether it's going to be a blue wave they've been relying on polling data but nobody knows for sure that was a media narrative\nIt was a meeting that was not born of any evidence there could be any evidence for a blue wave or a red wave the electric hasn't happened yet nobody wants to rely on polling data to suggest is going to happen but the polling data hasn't been accurate either starting in two thousand six dean of the presidential race\n\nSo we've got this caravan chugging north and I think you know put some things in perspective on this again the way to look at it is is as a a microcosm\nOf what's\nHappening every day and our border every day this is what's happening\n\nNot seven thousand a day but but but every day this is what's been going on for decades and it needs to stop\nAnd Donald Trump is the only person that's ever talked about working to make it stop\nNow the Democrats\nIf there are behind this one of the strategic ... besides getting somebody hurt\nAnd blaming that on Trump maybe what they're hoping is a Trump actually won't do anything about it\nMaybe they're hoping that Trump will be all huff and puff talk about sending the military down they're talking about setting a National Guard but not actually doing anything they might be rolling the dice that Trump isn't going to do anything because they think they've rattled Trump\nWith their stories earlier this year about how he separated families the board and how Trump didn't like the narrative and didn't want it but last so he did what he could change it I\nI Do know this despite everything that you think you would know but common sense there are still Republicans\nElected Republicans look at this caravan and their solution is to let them in\n\nAs elected still they are so you're about peace yesterday they are so scared of this issue they are so scared\nThat when ever the subject to legal immigration comes up Democrats automatically when Republicans think they've got their show they're not cold hearted mean spirited and all that let them if they're not publicly saying this but I Know that there\nMay be the Democratic\nGambling is too is is is a wild guess at Trump's actually not gonna do anything after huffing and puffing and I'll tell ya if Trump doesn't do anything if this caravans allowed to get to the border and come into the country what do you think that would do to Trump\nThere's one issue that could separate Trump from his voters or at least make his belt voters begin to\nI don't doubt is the right where they would be my totally disappointed particularly after Trump has said over and over again that this caravan is not going to get him\nIf if if if some\nRepublicans are behind this than than it is obvious uh but I just somebody has to be\nSomebody has to be making this happen folks we're talking we we've got how many\nTwo thousand miles stop and think of this from Honduras to the southern\nBorder of the United states assistance Arizona is around two thousand miles\n\nSeven thousand people one day just decided\nTo start walking to the United states\nTo thousands of miles\nI also think if you're looking for people behind this you have to look at the drug cartels and if you want to start trying to analyze will what their politics in this be that opens up a whole new can of worms but I don't doubt that they are playing a major role in transportation\nBut there has to be political involvement here too because money has to be available there has to be money being spent on this\nSo you've got seven thousand people who all of a sudden it aside all of a sudden because nobody saw this coming and there was no advance word of it seven thousand people to sign to start walking to a thousand miles\nWe don't see pictures of of of where they're using the bathroom we don't see pictures of them gathering or getting food and eating it\nI mean look at random video you might you might see some people chewing things I mean we don't see how this is being handled we don't see the port a potties we don't see and are they just urinating and rivers and streams that what would the environmentalist wackos think about that if that's happening\n\nWell I guess you you may have a point welcome to San Francisco they could order\nCustoms with especially the ... in the street and they get maps in San Francisco for tourists can wipe the piles of human PC\n\nSo how long would it take to walk two thousand miles along with a tech\nRemember they're vowing altogether I just hit the southern border of Mexico they're vowing to get here by mid term election day\nSo I don't walk enough to know\nHow many miles a day you could walk if you just start walking and you take a periodic break and after twelve or Eighteen or whatever you just stop or slow down and rest for the next\nDay that people tell me that they would have to be walking something like twenty miles a day\nFor one hundred days I mean it makes sense to a thousand miles twenty miles a day for a hundred days without any rest a hundred days for those are real Linda that's over three months\n\nAnd the objective is to show up right\nAs the polls open on mid term election day so if they had been walking for what two and a half months\nHave we seen video of the walk and it's beginning\nRemember the caravan was originally thirty five hundred or four thousand people now it's swollen just seven thousand and the word is it may become ten thousand [noise] and then of course a ladies and gentlemen the caravan now has been\nJoined by a second the caravan that we are just hearing about Fox News ... ... S P report that a second the caravan of illegal immigrants has formed in Honduras\nAnd has already crossed into Guatemala they're hoping to catch up to the main group\nAnd Louis continued to\nClose the border you gotta stop bogus asylum claims\nAnd basically have those claims for asylum only be allowed at our embassy or consulate in the home country where these people are coming from and also we need to\nRemember that asylum claims are not legitimate if they're not made and if we're not the first country they come to after leaving their country so ... El Salvador Honduras they can't make a legitimate asylum claim and Jeff Sessions is going to let that happen\nNow Louis knows Jeff Sessions he keeps the I talked to Louis he'll talk about Jeffrey is talk of the Jeff and I won't even know who is part of who you're talking about Jeff Sessions with Jeff Sessions or big buddies that means he's talked ... about this but these are all great points\nThey already qualified for asylum in the first country free country they find themselves in after a gaping\nTheir own country\nAnd if they don't apply for asylum in the first place that they can then they're not technically allowed to apply for asylum here but of course none of this matters the objective is to get to the United states and the objectives are multi faceted\nAnd it's what leads me to believe that the primary movers behind this are the left\nI think it's it's no doubt a leftist operation from beginning to end it may well be a Hail Mary type of October surprises it's adventure waiting but I think this was the left behind it\nFor a host of reasons every one of which we should uphold [noise]\nHave found me ... dot com slash real\nNineteen eighty one the doctors have ... in Arizona here it was pretty big issues with theory on this family own practice specializes in comprehensive evaluations\nWith personalized scare they understand the importance of your hearing what it means for you and your loved ones you trust your hearing held to Arizona hearing specialist voted Arizona Daily Star readers choice winter twenty eight requires an appointment Arizona here\n\n[noise]\nAnd now the heart radio we can sport time capsule\nFellow sports fans is any west that I'm here to take you on a journey back\nTo this week in sports history are back in Nineteen sixty four for the famous wrong wave run the Vikings Jim Marshall picks up a fumble and runs sixty six yards\nIn the wrong direction for safety still to this day it is the NFL's number one blue for this week in Nineteen Seventy the NBA's Cleveland Cavaliers plead their first home game losing to the San Diego rockets one ten Ninety nine\nThis week in Nineteen Seventy one Texas Stadium opened the Dallas Cowboys beat the New England patriots forty four to Twenty one stadiums unique root structure covers all of a cease unless the playing field exposed to the elements it was often says it's a whole on the roof was designed to allows got to watch his team play\nLike God's the cowboys fan this week in Nineteen Ninety event or Holyfield knocked out James ... list for the heavyweight boxing title if we can Nineteen Ninety three the NFL announced the new ... the Carolina Panthers\nWill be in Charlotte and they will begin playing in Nineteen Ninety five and this week in the year two thousand the Monday Night miracle occurred down thirty seven at the end of the third quarter the New York\nJets pull together and improbable comeback with for touchdowns in a field goal in the fourth quarter eventually defeating the Miami Dolphins forty thirty seven overtime at your heart radio weekends for a time\nCapsule and how he might use aboard over interfering with his job interview somebody ... dot com [noise]\n\nEm robot great to have your Rush Limbaugh kicking off a brand new week a broadcast excellence here an eight hundred to eight two to eight\nEight to ... [noise] one\nMore with Louie Gohmert he is from Texas she's on with the bill hammer and Sandra's with this morning bill cameras says Mike Pompeo was in Mexico city over the weekend said we're concerned that these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who would exploit them are also deeply concerned with the violence provoked by some members\nOf the group as well as the apparent political motivation of some organizes the care of it by the way the the details on that story are from the uh\nOh here's one from NBC and they are literally outraged over what ... saying sectarian state pump pale raised the stakes last night as thousands of Central American migrants\nInvaders\nHeaded for the United states as they marched into Michael claiming they were inciting violence palm pay also they're inciting violence under the influence of politically motivated the leaders\nHow was your raising the stakes\nTo point out what is happening what is the secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes Sunday night how is it raising mistakes to point out what's happening\nEspecially when we have a\nParty a political party that believes in open borders a media and the party that believes in open borders they will never report anything negative about these invaders\nRight mind would want this\nWho when their right mind would want any of this illegal immigration who in their right mind would promote this it wants this who wouldn't want a mob an invasion of seven thousand now eight thousand people to storm the border in the world would want that and why\n\nIt makes no commonsense under the umbrella of what's good for\nAmerica what\nEver motivation for the people who want this to happen it's not for the good of America it's got to be for something else so Pompeo goes down and promptly identifies what's happening here NBC says raising mistake which takes\n\nHave somebody finally pushing back on this because remember of the Republican Party up until Trump never didn't push back on this they they came up with their own reasons for wanting\nAmnesty for illegals and form you know having a fall push on securing the border on Sunday night pump pale who met with the Mexican president went on the offensive alleging at a state\nBut that many of the migrants were criminals themselves by definition they are if they intend to cross the border illegally they're all criminals\nPolitical world is so damn hard to understand about this I think it's a classic illustration of house off this country is getting\nIn one of the reasons this country is getting soft just because the elderly or senior generations are turning over everything to the young who haven't lived long enough to know what's\nBest for being driven solely by emotion govern solely by a motion not any ... any kind of common sense and because of some odd Kirk that's happened in our sociology adults today seem unwilling to teach young people\nRight and wrong or to helping benefit from the wisdom comes from having lived a bunch of life and having a may I ask a bunch of experiences\n\nThere is no way under the sun this makes any sense what so ever\n\nWe may as well not have any border if this is something that people want to advocate for permitting and allowing males will just to raise the border and said to the world come\nOn in because that's in essence the impact of this if it's not stopped if it's not dealt with the people of the world do not have an entitlement to the United states taxpayers back pocket\nBut the Democratic party assumes or seems to think that they do\nThe Democratic party is calculating that there are more people who want to get in to the American taxpayers back pocket then there are American taxpayers\nAnd saw the Democrat Party is siding with the people around the world who have nothing who think that because the United states has a lot they should just be able to come in and get whatever they want\nAlmost as an entitlement we have a political party pushing this we have a political party promoting this this political party ought to be no where near winning anything\nIn the next elections\nThere is not a single reason to vote for these people under any real breakup commonsense\n\nTake a look at the things they advocate take a look at the people they try to destroy take a look at the things they are promoting\nIt defies common sense to support this\n\nAnd frankly I don't think they have as much support as the media narratives would indicate I don't want somebody to tell you right now I don't believe\nAnd I haven't believe for a long time that there has been this slam dunk blue wave what we're being told right now is that six months ago nine months ago all the way back to December when the first generic ballots were taking them for a generic polls\nOr be to use on dude I was hoping they should go to the radio dot com parking is free scare Lewis believe it or not fully is writer\n\nAnd as the on my heart radio enjoyed the stimulation [noise]\nI'm going to get to that CNN [noise]\nCNN playing an impartial ... invited me to make it look like I was trying to make the case of a shell game\nDeserve to get killed because he was an ally of Osama bin Laden I never said any such thing I said that in fact the exact opposite so yeah\nYeah a lot of people worked up about that here on the other side of the glass I'm going to get to it or in due course same thing on this transgender business the Trump Administration is attempting to eliminate the whole classification and I'm going to tell you why I agree with that but all of that coming up here's the final Louie Gohmert by again bill hammer\nOutward concerned these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who would exploit them were also concerned\nOr is this pump pales saying this we're concerned about violence promote by some members of this group\nAll of these people trying to force their way and it's called an invasion\nAnd thank God we have a president that will stand up to an invasion like this but I don't know our constitution that Governor thing call out military troops to stop and invasion\nAnd I've heard people on TV so called experts say where you can use the military because a positive comments out of ... that normally prevents military from being used against its own citizens it has nothing to do with using the military to stop an invasion from another country so\nThere's nothing unconstitutional illegal about the president knowing what Woodrow Wilson did put tens of thousands of people on the border and make sure nobody forces their way and you know\nIt's a no brainer folks it is a number of the president can do that and has committed to it\nYou did you you you he may not send the military and I may call as a as a congressman Gilbert says there but there's no law says he can't this isn't about what is one of seven thousand Russians\nWere about to force their way into the okay\nWhat uh seven thousand Russians are about to force their way for the southern border\nTo try to affect the mid term elections [laughter]\nWhat if we could make that case what do you think that people would eat demanding Trump do stand aside and let the seven thousand Russians in so they can hack our computers and make sure the Republicans win them in terms of it's a joke folks at the junk you never know who's listening I'm just asking you what if it's seven thousand Russian communists thank God I was trying to get in\nAn invasion either way you look at here is Mike in Youngstown, Ohio getting a call in here in the first hour welcome sir how are you\nGood good Russian I Hope you and your family's all doing good listen I I think this has all the makings of a bad set up for Trump\nBecause of the optics I don't care if you're militarized is the border if they bomb rush the border like ... down in the southern side of Mexico where they tried to stop what's our military is supposed to break out the times or water hoses or\nTear gas that's just going to look so bad that Trump is going to take the brunt of it but he needs to do is call a\nA house and the Senate back in the emergency session and do a national address and put everybody on the line not just try to deal with this self\nSo bring him back in for a special session or do what pass legislation specifically saying that this mob is seven thousand can't come in\nSomething though that sort\nDo you think Trump needs to share the burden of providing the obstacle that if Trump sends a military down and they started cracking the heads and it looks bad\nFor Trump exactly so you think that's what the actual intention here is by the people who planned this thing\nExactly and that's where it can try to deal with this on his own needs to what everybody else or but on the line good I'm On bond film or whatever what should we do what what do you like to do if they come across\nActually like that in a way I like making Schumer and Pelosi stand up for letting these people in\nAny way it's a good point it's a it's it's it's a hell of a dangerous situation but it isn't a whole lot of different ways will be back my friends that we will continue as we always\nLike to get off\nTo Russia and by be Mitt\nWork pretty smart Russia is on CNN [noise]\nVoters have a choice on election day liberals want open

about evil just talking about Florida as a collective go that's communist ... she was talking about Florida\nAs law or a collective he hid it would be a disaster for Florida right now to elect anybody

moving here from other areas of the country it's about tax policy\nFlorida and Texas have no state income tax as such people are moving here in droves and businesses in Florida are growing left and

people\nWho want to put the brakes on what is happening in this country right now we've got more job openings than there are people to fill them we have people getting raises getting bonuses

Can't I Can't imagine people who are engaged and thinking about this and living lives actively involved with ... in any way want to put the brakes on this and for what reason because they don't like Trump\nTweeting because it'll like Trump's manners because they think Trump is goldfish or whatever some of the silliest stupidest reasons that's not why Trump is supported\n\nTrump to support it because he's in the last line\nTo hold off on this attempt at transforming America into being something that it was never found it to be if you want if you want America to actually be determined by shaped by like this this mob seven thousand\nPeople demanding entry into the United states and demanding benefits from the United states because they are deserved because America is responsible for what's going on in their home countries if that's what you want America to be then you've got to vote Democrat\nBecause that's what the Democrat Party of today wants to happen successful America needs to be punished\nWhatever else is going on it's still boils down to an age is old argument over philosophy and it's this\nAre you better at running your life or is the government better at running your life\nThe Democratic party believes your not capable of running your life and they don't want you to learn that you can they don't want you to learn that you can be self reliant and achieve great things they don't want you to realize that you can be happy and content\nOn your own the Democrat Party wants people to believe all of that is only possible\nIf government makes have happened or let's have happened but more and more what leftist actually want government to do is punish\nThe Democratic party has become a party of groups\nOf victims and these victims have turned over their own futures to the Democratic party they have decided that life is too unfair and to me in and they can't overcome any adversity without the Democrats running interference without the government running interference and so more and more what they want\nBy voting for Democrats they want Democrats to punish\nThe successful or anybody that these people believe is responsible for their unhappiness the Democratic party has become a party of mean spirited\nExtremism the Democratic party has become the home of people sadly with psychological disorders who are demanding that the political system of the country address those disorders\nAnd normalize them and that's not the purpose of the United states government and it can't succeed anyway\nI mean this is just hands down at this Andrew Gillum
