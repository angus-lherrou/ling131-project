fourth Colombian industry trace maybe to the drug cartels in Columbia\n\nWhy is there a dearth of empty and DNA why is there not much Indian DNA out there\nOr was the problem bustamante couldn't find any matches for Warren using only Indian DNA so he felt the need to expand it\nTo include in South America\nWhen other reason there isn't much in the DNA is because they are very very wary of this the Indians themselves the Cherokee\nTribe the leaders will tell you you don't use DNA to determine the limit injured they use junior logical trace\n\nYou know who has one of the best junior logical trace apparatus was in this country in the Mormon church\nOut in Salt Lake City has one of the most advanced respected\nDocumented genial logical praise organizations that you'll find\nI have I've seen their work and it is [laughter] it's amazing and that story\nI get is that many Native Americans have been very leery of granting DNA because they're leery of how it's going to be used\nThey already feel like they were discriminated bunch of people but I'm the same token there are some benefits that have been extended to them as a result of this and they just don't want to upset the apple cart so they don't even realize or utilize DNA\nIf any of this but\n... the media of course has a role here because everything they reported about this turns out to be an abject lie except British inclusion by the Boston Globe that there wasn't any Native American DNA\nBy the way this is not what Trump that her anyway Trump that her that she would have to take a test for little kids but the wandering around you can you can ah do a very rudimentary DNA test\nAnd he wanted to present her ... take the kids take the take the test of this kid using it in a debate a future debate and that's what he\nMeant that she wouldn't do any better that she wouldn't show up at the Indian if she did do it\nBut you talk about talk about a meltdown and its Trump that is causing this\nTrump is literally causing these people lose their cookies Trump is causing them to go in the same and I think it's happening throughout the Democratic party ... out in the American left and I have I have developed\nAn even greater reason for it and it all in all relies on things that I have previously known and told you about\nAnd most of it is related to my curiosity here and my suspicion\nAnd my my dubious a nature when it comes to this blue wave business\n\nWe've been hearing for the past how many months that there's going to be a blue wave\nThere's no question about it there has been no question about it\nThe Democratic party is poised to retake everything they can and this next election why\nWell the media tells us the American people are fed up\nAfter two years of Donald Trump they realize the mistake they made they wish they could do it do it over maybe take back their vote for Trump and this was going to be the first chance they've had to actually do that until the Democrats are going to retake the house and a massive landslide and at one point that we are going to take the Senate but then if you look at\nThe reality\nOf voting patterns just in the past eight years let's say ten there's nothing in the world using common sense that orders for a Democrat sweep or blue wave\nThe trend in the past ten years is Democrats losing elections left and right and it all started with Iraq who's saying all in two thousand ten\nDo you remember how many times I reminded you that during the\nFirst six years of Obama go through the two thousand fourteen midterms\nThe Democrat Party who lost over twelve hundred seats nationwide seats in the U.S house seats in the U.S Senate state houses a governorships\nA you even go to a local often like mayor or town councilman if you if you factor all of those races nationwide the Democrats after six years of Obama had lost well\nOver a hundred seats they were losing everything after the two thousand sixteen election\nThey continue to lose even more and the and the dead and sat lock to women in a landslide Hillary Clinton got beat in ... near electoral landslide electoral college landslide\nAnother election where they were going to sweep big never going to wipe out the Republican Party once and for all Hillary Clinton was going to be this winter they had it they couldn't they had it any better this guy Trump won the Republican nomination\nSomebody did know when he was doing a gigantic buffoon a walking set a gaffe they thought this guy would be easily swept away they believed all our polling data\nAnd we know what happened they continue to lose to the point that after the two thousand sixty eight elections\nThe Democratic party had the least amount of power\nIn terms of elected office is held in Washington DC since the Nineteen twenties now the two thousand sixteen election was only two years ago so from two thousand\nTend the first chance people had to vote after having stomach two years of the Obama administration which you want to talk about people wanting to get their votes back you want to talk about people wishing they can do it over you want to talk about people wishing they haven't voted the way they had go take a look at the two thousand ten midterms\nObama singlehandedly my friends has destroyed the electoral prowess of the Democratic party nobody knows it because of the things I just told you are never reported instead what people hear every day is this coming blow away this gigantic Democrat landslide on what\nEvidence is this going to happen what is it that has stopped the trend\nThe people in this country have been voting against Democrats in ways unprecedented I mean to have with the fewest number of electoral seats since the Nineteen twenties is pretty astounding it means a lot of people had been voting against you so what is it the Tampa and\nThat is going to cause this gigantic one hundred eighty degree shift\nMake people stop voting against Democrats and vote for them why it's none other than Donald Trump so says the media so says the Democratic party\nWell on the basis of what if you take a look at Trump's agenda and the economy and policies and so forth there's no reason to vote against it\nIn common sense there is no re Trump hasn't done anything to worsen anybody's lives quite the contrary\nAnd in fact there's a story from CNBC today that you're not gonna see widely reported\nLet's see if the [noise] probably put yes see and be ... survey soaring economic optimism points to no blue wave in two thousand Eighteen is this the CNBC polar survey\nAmerica is experiencing a record breaking era of good feelings economically speaking optimism about the ... do you know that there are seven million jobs open in America today actual number seven million one hundred thirty six thousand job openings in America\nFor context the U.S never had even six million vacant jobs open until April of two thousand Seventeen\nNow we have an historic seven point one million jobs open that means employers are looking to hire that many people\nYou will say roaring economy that equals no problem getting a job if you want one with that many job openings it is an employee ease market if there's that much demand for employees the employees can set the\nTerms based on their level of expertise and experience or whatever it is they're applying\nFor none of this in the world of common sense suggests that people would\nBe unhappy by it or about it and want to reject it and yet that's exactly what we're being told that the American people are sick and tired day have Trump they despise Trump they're embarrassed by Trump they were barest by their vote\nAnd yet\nThere isn't a federal Lincoln bit of evidence that people have turned around and want to vote Democrat including the two thousand sixteen presidential election\n\nOr those of you shouting at me ... ... ... ... ... food so we won the popular vote by three but\nPeople still think an education from northern Virginia community colleges just\nSettling but when you think about it\nAt nova their faculty rock stars we're talking best selling author Fulbright Scholars and professionals with the industry experience company the most around here there's a shortage of nurses computer engineers in cybersecurity experts guess who's filling these John\nWhat's really settling is graduating college with\nRushing didn't loan payment but do you have your green\nYou know the channel much start up here for patients will a cyber attack I\nDon't think you're settling with no education [noise]\nIn fact many often get to pick from multiple job offers they'll think you're settling with no education\nSave you a ton of college and I\nDon't think you're pedaling with no education\nMorning at seven tend to talk about it on ... the [noise]\nI don't even think [noise]\nAnd I didn't hear about it I don't think any of the women have JFK I make the money all went away from having to them but here comes Donald Trump and the prostitute\nPays him the four women\nThese four women have one thing in common Dianne Feinstein Hillary Clinton Stormy Daniels she's the one I couldn't think of that Elizabeth Warren\nAll four of them\nOrchestrated damaging October surprise backfires for the Democratic party Elizabeth Warren tweeted when the different times yesterday about this\n\nThe Stanford University researcher who studies to focus on us this DNA\nDid not actually use samples of Native American DNA the Boston Globe quote to make up for the dearth of Native American DNA Dr\nCarlos ... use samples from may go ... in Columbia to stand in\nFor Native Americans now she's out there touting that it's true is she's an empty you got one one thousand twenty fourth\nAnd there wasn't even any Indian or Native American DNA tested in which she could be said to have in common or compared to I mean it's laughable it is the static and I think\nThis is what Trump is doing to all these people Hillary Clinton's making a fool of herself each and every day out there saying that what Bill Clinton did with Monica ... no no no no no no it was not abuse that doesn't qualifies me too because she was an adult\n\nSo Hillary Clinton is making the answer herself an absolute fool of herself in the midst of the me too movement she's on you're cutting it\nAnd selling it out\nIn order to save both herself and her husband who are assumed to be barking on what\nA stadium chore Oh yes bill and Hillary are going to mark a nationwide stadium to or where they're going to go and hopefully draw crowds at twenty and twenty five thousand to do the bill and Hillary show onstage\nBecause of course they can't let Trump upstaged white is I mean if Trump can do what they can do it if Trump can do it anybody can do it they're going to try to get in on it\nThere's one thing missing one key ingredient missing nobody cares what they have to say\nNot like people care what Trump has to say there is no interest in what Bill or Hillary Clinton are going to say\nThere is\nAll kinds of interest in what Trump is going to say there's just\nIt factor\nThat Trump has that Hillary certainly doesn't have a never has had you could argue that Bill Clinton to an extent habits\nAnd I'm Talking about this type of charisma back in the nineties when he was running for president in shortly after the first term maybe he had a number of the the or I was expanded a bit by the fact that he was president but neither of these two are anywhere near\nThe wake of Donald Trump is it like it was it like the Democrats trying to come up with an answer to me in the first ten years in the spring and Gary Hart parents\nSome ... some ... the state treasurer of Texas they gave a radio show Mario the pious they gave a radio show and the media highlighted every one of these Democrats radio talk show who'd never done it before as the rush killer\nEvery one of them was anointed end inaugurated as the Democrat that was going to steal the limelight away from this program than Air America came along and uh and they did the same thing and it never has happened\nEvery attempt to supplant\nTake over relegate this program ... already has failed abysmally and just like the bill and Hillary stadium tour is going to fail abysmally\nThey're going to end up having to pay people to show up\nTo get the kind of crowds that they want you may think rushed enough rabbit Democrats out there that will show up just to create the image that there's all kinds of interest\nFolks you may think that what we're going to find out common sense will tell you\nHillary Clinton could withdraw fly just do a book selling party she couldn't draw applies to a campaign appearance that's why she didn't do very many of them it would have been embarrassing how few people showed up the ones there were big crowds they did in fact most people\nIn the country's not clamoring to hear from the Clintons companies not waiting\nWith bated breath for what they have to say but look I Want to I Want to return just for a brief moment to this this notion of the of the blue wave and go to a couple of audio soundbites Nate Silver this is the guru David analyst on the left who used to be the New York times and then he went to ESPN\nAnd then he went to five thirty eight and then he went to vox back to five or five thirty eight is his company and he took it to various places and the Democrats\nThis is the biggest keen on most ... is the key events lined up for the week got off lining the run and then we are getting the minutes from the fed meeting that's coming out on Wednesday and we're also going to keep up with watching the China GDP number that's going to come out during the week\nThanks day officers then there's people stock market report\nBy media nothing has gotten rid of Donald Trump nothing hasn't turned the American people against Donald Trump can you imagine the frustration these are people who get their way every single time they target somebody for destruction\nWhenever they want to take a Republican out they are guaranteed a Ninety percent chance of success\nBecause they have the drive by media working right alongside with them and if they set their their crosshairs an somebody there as good as gone already damaged beyond repair they haven't lay the glove on Donald Trump\nThey're running out of weapons and then the process of running out of weapons they're losing their minds they're losing their rational sanity I Believe\nAnd this latest debacle over Kavanaugh\nDon't doubt for a minute that this thing was orchestrated unplanned from the get go as a late breaking\nUse only if necessary event they didn't lead with this because they knew it was flimsy they didn't lead with it because they knew they couldn't prove it they didn't leave with and it was it a central part of the Kavanaugh hearings because\nThey knew there wasn't any evidence for it and they knew that ball Z for good not pull this off under pressure\n\nI'm Still in shock the balls he showed up to testify I I think that took everything they had to persuade her to get there 'cause I don't think she ever intend to do and I don't think when they pitched her on this whole thing was every part of the plan that she would ever actually have to testify\nAnd does anybody believe that uh fifty one every year old woman literally talks against human she talks that way in her classroom teaching students if she does\nThat mean that just\nAnd I guess it's possible I guess she does but I I I don't believe that either\nI don't believe that's how you talk to the Baltimore and you're running around the beach Santa Cruz that's not how she's going to be talking you're running around the beach out there uh and she's not going to be talking to you like he's in perpetual fear of being hit or damaged or harmed or yelled at or whatever\nUh anyway the point is none of it has worked and by work I mean do two things the the real objective\nFrom the get go from all of this the cleanest way for this to happen and would have been able to turn the American people particularly Trump voters against him if\nThey have been able to do that get Trump's approval numbers ... to the thirties and into the twenties then they could get rid of him\nThey failed at that all they did was cement Trump's supporters to him even more firmly\nAnd then the process Kavanaugh saying they actually turns to the people who were sympathetic to them and the Trump supporters because people in the same portion of this country simply do not feel comfortable with watching\nThe most powerful apparatus of government unified at a line and for the purpose of destroying a human being and a life when there isn't any evidence\nThat would warrant such a thing but the Democrats didn't care that there wasn't any evidence because they never have any they always relied on the seriousness of the charge working with the media\nTo create a daily image that whoever the Democrats are targeting is worse\nThan poison and must be dealt with as though he or she is poison well none of it has worked\n\nAnd even in their own pulse Trump's approval numbers hover in the mid forties Rasmussen Trump's at fifty\nOne they see the approval numbers for Trump of the African American community they see the economy ... I I'm telling you that they are teetering on the brink\nOf being hold it altogether being able to hold it all together and it's in this universe framework contacts I just\nI don't see this Massey blue wave that they do and I'm not sure they even see it and if you're hoping I think it's a birthright to them it's the way things ought to be should be\nAnd I got to do everything they can to make it reality but\nThese are massive elections all over the country and it's going to be a challenge for them\nWe'll see I mean look it's possible that I I'm like Nate Silver I have no idea what's going to happen only difference between that silver and me is that I make no pretense of knowing what's going to happen all I'm doing with you today are sharing how I break this now and using common sense\nI've got\n... two thousand twelve to six years of on the ground actual experience of Democrats losing elections of people turning against them Democrats having fewer seats electoral seats in Washington\nThan they've had since the Nineteen twenties and I don't see anything is going to reverse that Iraq who's saying oh\nSinglehandedly made this happen for rock Obama's presidency is what turned to people against the Democratic party\nAnd it was based on substance because Obama was a likeable guy and he was African American you check off a box I'm not racist look at this I voted for Obama and still when people had the chance they voted against every aspect of the Obama agenda they could\n\nWhereas Obama by the white campaigning for all these Democrats trying to retake the house and Senate\nWhere is the worst plugs\nBeto O'Rourke heard about this Beto O'Rourke is following the Obama a mold Beto O'Rourke\nRaise thirty eight million dollars in the third quarter\nHe has been asked by Democrats to share some of that money for other races which are close in battle has told them to go pound sand\nThat tone has told them if you're a lecture that important when you go raise the money yourself I'm going to ... been this way I Want to use this the way I was not my job to raise money for you exactly what Obama's Obama\nPeople remember this he resented the hell out of having to GO Campaign for house races he thought it was sold but nice him he had he wanted no\nPart of campaigning for house races and very little to do with campaigning for Senate races\nBecause it was nice the office of the presidency didn't go that low real reason he didn't want to do with his mom it didn't have confidence of coat tails and\nAnd that ... is not going to want to share any of his money not being good socialist got all this money it's not fair to back to oh who is by the way what does he down seven or eight points not only the ...\nAh not fair that Beto has more than he needs and won't share it with other needy Democrats but that's what he's saying that he won't do 'em yeah outlook also have the um the ... situation\nAnd there's some things about this guy but I don't think are being widely reported exactly who he is Dr ...\nLet me just tell you what the drive by purpose here is again\nThe drive by as are trying as hard as they can to link Donald Trump to ... murder might

no arming treat them with Joel levy talking about his new album and of course some discussion about a little band called the Beatles were when\nBox that ah the\nMedia in the United states is trying to say to report\nThey're trying to say that there is a record that the evidence of the interrogation and murder because Joe ... show he was wearing an apple why\nHis fiance was outside in the family says Dan she had his iPhone\nIn the family sedan she had instructions to call a man I've got his name here I'm not going to bottom look ended up she had instructions to call somebody if he didn't come back out he was going to get you know divorce officially recognized so we can marry they fiance that's waiting outside in the family sedan\nAnd she had instructions to identify mutual friend if he didn't emerge meaning he thought\nHe was lord and married bought something could happen there reporting that his ...\nWas recording everything that happened functions not possible in the first place an apple watch is a slave to the phone\nAnd\nApple does and even if if we had a new watch the series for which he didn't because it hasn't been out long enough\n... but even if he did if he if he bought it in the United states and had it it's still not capable of L T E operation in Turkey apple has not yet brought\nLT each service to the to the I watch the apple watch in Turkey which means that there is no way his watch could have worked independently of his phone\nNow there is an app there are a number of apps\nOne of the best ones is called just press record and on your watch it's just a giant red button that you press it and it starts voice recording and it ends up saving the recording on your paired iPhone but the phone has to be within range\nAnd I'm I'm here to tell you with the fiance and the iPhone in the car outside of the concept was no way\nYou know its its maximum twenty yards is Bluetooth that that connects watches the phones twenty yards twenty five hours I'm trying to think on the golf course when I lose the\nRange of phone stops talking to the watch\nIt's maybe twenty or twenty five yards and most of that which would be Seventy five feet on the tops on the outside sixty feet more like it there is no way his watch\nWas recording anything and transmitting it anywhere so there there can't be a recording of what happened to it besides that the Saudis would have seen the watched by taking it off\nA and they would have needed the fiance is iPhone to find out what was on it\n\nThe watch is still not an independent piece of tech even watches that can operate under guilty they still need to be fair to the phone there's not enough storage capacity on the watch distort the data of a recording it doesn't start yeah it can store I think up to a\nHundred songs maybe more now but for the most part has to stream them it's not an independent device so the there probably is no evidence on the guys watch\nOr even on the phone it\n\nWell the [noise] except for his heartbeat stopping not even that the phone will still have to be at some point put back in ranging connected to the fun to watch would need to be back into close proximity to the phone for his heart rate data to show up on the phone\nIt's simply ... it's simply not possible what they're saying\nThe way they're saying it's it's not possible to watch is not independently capable of doing what\nThey're reporting it needs an iPhone and Android remain paired to the iPhone you can't be more than\n[noise] wish I knew this exactly I'm I'm I Know when I lose my connection when I'm On the golf course and it's\n[noise] thirty yards Ninety feet at the tops\nTops and this guy had walls to deal with inside the consulate or he couldn't have been that close to the phone which is in the car the family so Dan with the with the fiance now uh [noise] I've got\nThe audio here of James okay for the secret audio taken of Claire McCaskill and her campaign aide Rob meals\nI this is\nThis is important because there's no is just not being reported in Missouri\nWhich is Claire McCaskill state it also happens to be my home state\nNow what we did hear we went and we did a Google Search\nFor new laws of the secret video from project beret toxic Claire McCaskill and we wanted to see where this\nThere are times news have been reported so we got Washington Times the Daily Caller Daley wire Russia Today a PJ Media Breitbart News you know your report there's no way piece here\nWhy there's no New York times here there's no St Louis Post Dispatch here there was no Saint Louis globe Democrat or even though they publish here in fifty years there's no Saint Louis penny saver here\nThere is no Saint Louis TV station mention I don't know about Kim election St Louis but we're covering that by me doing it now\nUm there's nothing Yahoo News nothing not one\nDrive by or mainstream media outlets shows up in a Google Search when you Google Claire McCaskill and project ferrets us every site running this\nWould be a conservative side or a conservative bloc there's not one mention of St Louis papers or TV stations here\nAnd what it basically is is McCaskill recorded on secret video admitting that she cannot tell Missouri voters and the truth\nWhat she really thinks about things like gun control because she might not get elected\nWe can't\nOpenly said that says one of her age we got to soundbites here the first one is McCaskill herself and her staff talking to the on identified project beret toss secret journalist and in this particular song by Senator McCaskill\nAre talking about in the end the project baritone us secret journalist are talking about the second amendment\nFamously here I mean I think we can actually see them on the floor and then it's awkward in all those who are in\nThe room and\nWere you able to hear that are you able to understand what she was being asked in her aunt okay All right let me go let me read to you because I couldn't if it were I Would not be able\nTo make sense of that or even though I've got a direct audio feed that just sounded like noise to me but here's the transcript she said if we have\nThe kind of the year I think we might have any Democrats winning big we could actually be in a position we can get my son this gun stuff on the floor and we can get sixty and McConnell knows he just doesn't want to put it on the floor because then it goes to the house and then it's awkward 'cause all those house members are total NRA folks\nVera times journalist so you wouldn't be on board with bump stock oh of course\n\nI voted for getting rid of ... what what about high capacity magazine I have voted for most of those they absolutely get rid of high capacity bags of what what about for an outright ban oh yeah and not right now oh yeah\nYou'll never hear Claire McCaskill campaign this way she'll say in fact that she's\nVery open to the idea of bump stocks yeah might have to get rid of the everybody's on board with the getting rid of bump stocks but start talking about limiting bags and banning things are against they might lose votes in the Boot Hill but you know what she said about that she said if we can really sweep up in St Louis\nIf we can clean up in Missouri I could I could lose some votes in the boot heel\nSo you people in the boot heel of Missouri and that's where my mom when my mom was born in Arkansas but she grew up in Kennett\nMissouri which is in the boot heel Missouri and I remember\nGoing there frequently as a kid in his little subtle towns down there I knew people in the boat we own the Boot Hill of Missouri here on the ... I'd be ... every radio station worth its salt carries us for it and I'm telling you Claire McCaskill senator Missouri's the loss of both Neal boats if we can clean up in St Louis\nNow St Louis is majority Democrats a heavily minority populated and she basically saying if I can sleep up with the African American vote in St Louis I ever really clean up the big turnout there then I can stand to lose some of the boats or the boot heel\nSo you in the Boot Hill a Missouri Claire McCaskill throwaways\nIf she can just really clean up in St Louis here is a campaign ad for McCaskill a explaining to the project Vera ... secrets journalist\nFloors to walls are family does it all\nMy says number R.

[noise] [noise] [noise]\nAnd welcome back okay somebody asked me a good question about they watch the apple watch worn by July August Shelby crush what about why fight a good question [noise]\nThe way why fine on the apple\nWatch works is this and it's it's not as simple as you think I've learned all this by user experience\nThe the watch is always a slave to the phone so the the way it works your phone is with you and you're wearing a watch your watch is you can activity is determined by your phone so if your phone is using ... to connect\nOr even an L. P. E. or cellular to connect your watch is connected to it by Bluetooth\nIf the to get separated let's say your watch your your phone is on the wife I network the watch is capable of why but only if\nThe iPhone that it's paired June knows that why fight network\nFor example when I'm at home uh I leave my phone in the library when I go walk the dogs the state has a massive yard so I'm Out of range so my phone is not with me but my watch connects via why\nBecause my phone is connected to wipe by on the watch learns it but I still I have to manually answer the why fi password on my watch\nFor it to work it did not automatically translate transmit the password from the phone to watch\nIt took me a while to figure that I'm Out there walking the dogs and the watches connecting on al ... I've got a wife ... state what the hell's going on so I checked that I found out that I had not edited the password for my wife I find that work on my watch what I doubt\nThat your mouth to show these phone had why fi connection to the Saudi consulate\nIf it's password required and his wife is sitting outside with the phone she might be able to see the wife fi network in there but if she doesn't know the password the phone's not going to connect to the Saudi wife I end up the phone doesn't connect to what the watch will not\n\nNow if he had a history of going into that consulate with this phone and if I Want a previous visit he had logged into their wife I work with a password then his watch would connect to be a wife fight\nIf he had also entered the wife I network password on his watch that's just the phone is not\nNearby I just don't think any of that happened I don't know how proficient this guy was with tech ...\nIt is possible that his watch could have recorded everything on why fight if he had actually answered the consulates why fi network password independently on his watch just because the the phone has has been logged on what the password does not mean that the watch as\n\nEvery device connecting your wife I'm at work half to go through the password nothing is automatic now Apple's got really simplified here you know you'll people may not notice it may have happened to you to know what I'm saying let's say that you are going over to uncles eats house\nAnd uncles IQ as a wife I network and you're going over there and when you get the uncles weeks house you ask ... for the password to his wife you don't have to do that anymore all you have to do is make sure uncles IQ is in the room with you in whatever room you are in the house\nAnd then on your phone you go and turn on the wife I network find a wife I network at the minute you do that oh goals each phone will get it alerts saying do you want to share your wife I network with others in your house and my uncles equal click yes\nAnd that will send the password for his wife I network to your phone you are the guest and his will do this automatically that way hosts do not have to remember their passwords and do not have to give them the gas that happens automatically as I O s eleven\nYou should try to see if you don't notice\nIt's fascinating it's it's uh it's amazing how apple has continued to idiot proof and simplify all this\nBut I'm just telling you that ... would have had entered the wife I network password to the Saudi consulates ... on his watch\nEven if it was already done on his phone even if needed to do it on his watch in order to activate the wife ... network or access that if he done that if his watch worked on why fight in that conflict than he wanted to have been able to record everything that happened on the watch if he had done it on the map\n\nOne of the car had wife I Know it it it it it because he's probably been out of range for it but but it would still need the password\nYou don't need\nA [laughter] [noise] well I don't know if they would say no we're not I mean he's a he's a journalist up until this visit was probably will find devotee okay who knows\nBut I doubt that his car had a wife or that would require you to have a hot spot\nFrom whatever cell carry over their offers them but even even if that were the case um look\nInto their example to try to explain that you go to a city and you get an a car picks you up at the airport or whatever and the car service has wife I it it it's just a hot spot\nThe driver gives you the password if you're not sort of your log into it you're watching is not logging on to the network your ... your watch is connecting to the phone the phone controls your watch as long as the Turin range\nThe phone determines everything that watch does when they are separated when the watches out a range of the phone that's when you have to know how the watch can independently connect the networks and I've just got through telling you how difficult it is", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "city": "Tucson", "day": "16"}
