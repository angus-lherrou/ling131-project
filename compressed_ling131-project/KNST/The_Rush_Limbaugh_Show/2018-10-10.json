about the American left and the Democratic party\nShe went out there and get her best Maxine Waters impersonation was encouraging people to be an civil\nAnd she was saying that it was justified being on civil given the opposition the Republicans and if they win the house then they can go back to being civil if they win the Senate then they can return to civility\n\nI mean they're making the case they're proving the point and there isn't I don't see in all of this in all of this crazy deranged unhinged behavior of left wing activist I\nHaven't heard one elected Democrat did announce it I haven't heard one the elected Democrats attempt to distance himself or herself or the party from it\nI haven't heard one be elected Democrats suggest to these ... protesters to dial it back\nI haven't heard one they're all encouraging it my point is this is who they\nAll are\nAnd what Hillary Clinton now advocating this incivility what did I tell you yesterday were\nNot in a battle of ideas anymore we're not in an argument over ideas they don't they don't they're not even looking at any of this is about ideas\n\nThey see America today as flawed and illegitimate and therefore in need of a new set of defining values that will serve to unify\nThe people who want to be part of American not anything to do with our founding not the constitution not the declaration that's out the window because all that's tainted all of that was written by a bunch of privileged white guys who were setting up a system for themselves and their families\nAnd their descendants and they didn't care about minorities

they do this you know how they take the um the radar and they attach different colors to it\nNow what I'm looking at is sheer solid black surrounding me I Will and most of the black is on the south and the west side\nAnd then it gets a little lighter there's some great then ... then then bright red and yellow and then can and then orange and green and blue on the edges\nOut these colors do not represent rain and intensity they represent cloud tops they represent the temperatures at the cloud tops which determines condensation and can determine the intensity of rainfall but most people watching this have\nNo idea they think oh my God look at that may look like it must be raining a hundred miles an hour a look at that black black or white or run in a dark right it's\nDesigned to ski area is designed to get your attention it's cloud top temperatures but my point is is solid around the eyeball\nThe looks like the most intense area of this is due west of the eye wall which is where the population centers are based on where the eye wall looks like it's going to hit now but even on the east side eastern northeast squadrons are where\nThe strongest winds are and those are going to be low like offshore toward offshore once they hit land on the eastern side of the wall but it's a solid eye wall and it's a large wall\nSo it's it's it's a very very intense storm and the next forty

these thinks they're so desperate\nFor good news they're desperate for you know for a bunch of people that are brimming with confidence over the fact they're going to be running the world than three weeks I'm finding a lot of evidence in security for example I have a story here what is this is in the hill dot com and it's a column by somebody named Brent Butowsky\nWho sounds like the captain of a bowling team\n... says he thinks this guy was a legislative aide to who who\nDo you think this guy worked for the lord benefit a former senator in Texas I knew Jack Kennedy Kennedy was a friend of mine and you quail you're no Jack Kennedy that lord Benson right okay [noise]\nWell whether he did or not he still writes pieces for the for they hold uptown Butowsky code red alert to Democrats\nWhat are the Democrats were smoking I bought the Democrats are going to win everything like the hill got\nKind of had a story yesterday I mean it looked like two hundred nine seats are going to convert to the Democratic party\n\nFormer first lady Michelle Obama wildly most popular respected public figures in America should spend the day taping personal endorsements for democratic candidates for the

America such as Michelle my bell Obama to lead the charge for all hands on deck at a critical moment for America and democracy\nIn my view writes Butowsky there is a twenty five percent chance are Democrats and the mid terms with a nightmare scenario what twenty five percent chance of a nightmare wife what you guys had it all locked up\nI thought you're pretty much had the house already done\nAlthough she's already talking about being speaker you guys are already planning to impeach investigate cabin on then Trump or verse by so\nNow there is a twenty five percent\nChance that Democrats and the midterms in a nightmare scenario that's that's not quite the same as a Ninety three percent chance Hillary wins the presidency at five pm on election night ...\n... ... ... why are these people panicking\nMr Butowsky says this is not a moment for complacency or easy talk of blue waves it's a moment for balding maximum action and turnout based on a powerful look urgent sense of opportunity in danger\nSays it's possible the Democrats win the house by a significant number of seats\nHow ever it is\nAlso possible of Democrats again only ... seats falling short\nOf winning control that would leave the Republicans nominate\nWith a smaller but even more right wing majority of the leading loser\nIs in the house midterms are comparatively moderate GOP house members

nightmare scenario for Democrats and America if it unfolds a vindictive and try I'm front Trump having won a victory for the politics of hatred and fear and should don't show up [laughter] [noise]

code red alert right to vote ... warns about the danger of so much unchecked power concentrated in the hands of a president who tried to criminalize his opponent [laughter]\nMy point is again do not fall for any of this hype that it is over and that the Republicans have no prayer and that there's going to be this gigantic blue wave because not even the Democrats\nIn their private selves when they talk to each other in private and not even they\nReally believe that\nThey want you to think they do they want you to be dispiriting hand or depressed\nThey are very alarmed in fact that the latest polls that show the cabinet effect on the Republican side is ... up turnout ... up interest\nAnd they're really ... and ticked off at a bunch of polling data\nThere is an NPR poll out there there was a Fox News pull a couple of others but show some bourbon Republican women\nAre saying in polling data that they have a renewed interest and increased energy and intense desire to go vote this is not what we're supposed to happen\nThat's why all of these attacks lately in leftist media ripping in two white conservative suburban\nWomen and do we need them or not and we don't they say\nSo this is not as we sit here today this is not developing as they want you to think it is\n\nBack in two thousand six soon as you remember any pieces before the presidential race\nAnywhere in democratic media warning people hey hey you know what there is a nightmare scenario here where Trump good when you got a diamond back we've got to be very careful you remember any of that\nThere was none\nThey were so solid sure they were definitely of of uh convinced that they weren't going to win every Hillary was going to win and the biggest landslide\nI mean they had Trump's chances three percent seven percent ten percent\nBut nobody gave Trump a chance in fact some of the news even said Trump never thought he was going to win Trump never even wanted to win Trump was the most surprising guy in election night in the world when he won he didn't want to when they were all depressed that Trump quarters that's what they want you to believe\n\nNow they've started out saying the same thing is no power is a birthright that every American realizes that Democrats have to be put back in power\nEvery American realizes the mistake of voted for Trump every Trump voter can't wait to apologize every Trump voter realizes embarrassed wants to fix the mistake can't wait to vote for the next Democrat on their ballot\nNow all of a sudden it's not just Butowsky by the way either there are others\nWho are raising red flags out there that this might not be developing as they wish\nAlso from Fox News the homeland security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen\nSaid yesterday that the ... are engaged in an unprecedented influence campaign leading up to the midterms this is the Trump administration's latest warning that the ... are attempting to sway American opinion I have the elections\nSort of a ... watt swim

history of America\nOn a test\nAnd they had to swear and plan their loyalty and devotion to the United states and they were eager to do it and they were happy to do it now they they maintain their ethnicity\nThe Irish the Italians unit but they wanted to become Americans and they did and it took a number of years to assimilate them all well\nNineteen sixty five is when Ted Kennedy led the charge to reopen the immigration floodgates which\nThen of course went to once that happened illegal immigration ramped up in an uncontrollable way\nAnd that wave of immigrants starting in Nineteen sixty five came from third world socialist countries Democrats\nRealized they could only when the White House if they changed the population of America they were losing presidential elections with the Native American population because they were losing\nWhite women and Mrs Clinton just admitted in here to Christian I'm for up seeing that it never occurred to them to change their policies what they have to do in order to attract white voters what they had to do was\nChange America so back to Hillary she said what was done last night in the White House meeting Trump apologizing\nFor the nation to Kavanaugh\nWhat was done in the White House last night she said was a political rally it further undermine the image and integrity of the court\nAnd that troubles me greatly Christie on I'm for it saddens me because our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillar of our constitution looking at\nThe judicial system has been viewed by you as he lectured insurance the judicial system has been viewed by you and Mrs Clinton the rest of the Democrats as your private refuge\nYou have looked at the court as a place you can stock like minded leftist activists\nTo make sure things that you believe in which never could pass legislation somehow become law in America\nThat's why they want the courts if you want to really get frustrated you've heard me say this and you've probably heard a lot of other people\nBut stop and think about this outside of Obamacare practically every liberal\n... the steak every liberal idea and belief that now is the law in this country would not have become law in Congress because it never would have passed liberalism and the Democratic party's ideas have never been mass popular the only way\nThat we have bastard ice pop culture the laws of the reality today is because\nDemocrats activist judges have been essentially writing law when they take cases and interpret them and then pronounce decisions roe versus Wade is the most thoroughly example of this\nBut there are countless others the simple fact of the matter is the Democratic party has never been capable of winning\nLegislation to implement the ideas they believe in because most of the American people when they know what's at stake don't want them that's the value of judges and that's the value of courts to the Democrats when Mrs Clinton says\nThat what happened in the White House the other night saddens her\n\nBecause our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitutional got\nB. S. not by you\nIn fact to Hillary Clinton and people like her the Constitution's an obstacle is well\nIt's certainly not something to revere\n\n... did you see any way even a conservative state college when I was speaking to yesterday said the only way to repair America is to try to get back to some civility to try to make it that even if we had political disagreements we're not going to go to war with each\nOther we're not going to destroy each other Hillary Clinton well certainly I Would love to see us returned disability Christianity on for listening to one another working on our differences but\nThat is not the Republican Party that exist today that is certainly not the administration that we haven't power right now when the Republican Senate denied the rights of President Obama to have his nominee for the Supreme Court Merrick Garland here we go off to the races again missed characterizing that\nYou're blue in the face\nThat's a Joe Biden rule the Democrats invented that rule that presidents don't get the name Supreme Court justices during vacancies that happened in the last year of their term that's a Democrat inspired instituted rule and she knows it\nBut the Republicans didn't destroy Merrick Garland the Democrats didn't have to fight battles defending his character and his life because the Republicans were not trying to destroy them as they did\nKavanaugh anyway the upshot of this is that Hillary Clinton says it's it's a time for incivility is it time for this kind of extremism because that's what we're up against Steve ...\nWho was shot by one of the believers of Hillary Clinton that that Republican baseball practice\nCannot believe that Bill Cassidy senator from Louisiana responded to Hillary at a time when the Republicans are being shot stabbed docks beaten\nRun out of restaurants and sent death threats Hillary Clinton urges Democrats to be even more uncivil\nWhat an irresponsible statement every Democrats should denounce they're not going to denounce or they privately publicly encourage ruined by applauded they supported that is who they are this is the party by the way that has been railing against all this and civility\n... I don't know how long this is why\nI look at average American voters paying attention to this and I don't understand how any of them can want to side\nWith what the Democratic Party is doing how they're doing it\nI Know what happens but it's it's a mystery to me and my hope is my faith is that this incivility this insanity this on the hinge Democrat behavior is negatively impacting the Democrats that the Kavanaugh effect\nPro Republican I Know that's real the polling data indicates that that's real if you want to believe polling data\nWho put your interests first joined us it flemings in Tucson on October sixteenth and the twenty fifth straight in wealth is hosting educational seminars that can help spaces limited call today to return receipt three two one forty one hundred are good at ... dot com advisory services officer ... el Sisi Richard ...\nWords\nI'm rich Dennison hurricane Michael making landfall a short time ago near Mexico Beach Florida as a category ... storm with maximum sustained winds of one hundred and fifty five miles an hour\nIs one of the most powerful storms ever to hit the U.S mainland more than three hundred and Seventy five thousand people along the Gulf Coast words to evacuate the national Hurricane Center director ... says for those who chose to stay behind\nStay safe stay sheltered as a very dangerous situation\nThat the White House President Trump says federal resources already everybody that's going to be here we have covered Michael's pushing a storm surge of up to fourteen feet and could jump up to a foot of rain in the region storm also expected to bring hurricane force winds into Georgia\nInvestor concerns over high bond yields and Wall Street so called fear and sending stock spiraling today the Dow is down more than five hundred points at one time this afternoon [noise]\nThis is a Fox is worth [noise]\nUsed on his love of the city's most at risk for cancer specialist shortage Greg faulty and as the\nNews ... says Tucson his number six on the list because of its high percentage of oncologist or over sixty five and likely to retire within the next few years\nStudy authors say a national shortage of cancer specialist could lay diagnosis and treatment for patients the study putting Phoenix among the cities with the lowest percentage of oncologist over the age of sixty five\nAnd a Phoenix attorney with democratic political ties is being accused of sexual assault\nPolice records show Sal Riviera was thrown out of an August twenty eighth Democratic primary victory party a woman who agreed to drive Riviera Holmes says he groped her inmates sexual demands Riviera is facing charges a felony sexual abuse in misdemeanor assault\nDemocratic candidates who received campaign contributions from ... and his wife said they have returned or donated the money to charity\nI'm Greg ...

to answer your question are we can't divulge members I wouldn't tell anybody you remember\nCan we don't want to interfere with anybody want to go as soon as possible you have seen a right nearby we have thousands of people going tonight and they've already many they're already\nKnow a lot of people I just got some emails from this stuff happened you know you're falling for Russia just proves what a suck up you are Trump's not doing this for any other reason that he just wants to brag he's just doing this for PR no\nFriends you may think that and I'm not going to try to just abuse you of it but the president's doing this because if he didn't\nCan you imagine the stories that would be published Trump doesn't care Trump didn't convened a meeting Trump didn't ask very many questions Trump didn't seem curious Trump seemed to have any real interest and she doesn't have a home they're all this kind of stuff that they would say about him\nHe does this for a host of reasons but most importantly I Believe\nDonald Trump likes himself and he's very proud of the job he's doing and he wants people to see it and he knows that the primary conveyor is of information in this country do not convey proper information about him is is only smart here's here's Kennan Oklahoma City we're back to the phones great to have your er Hi\nHey it's great to be on Russia I'm not only argue el rush but but you are the lead voice with the mainstream media you should have the best happened podcast or should have\nThe one path and pop [laughter] hey my point is a today a with Hillary's comments that are basically liberals don't need to be civil to conservatives anymore it reminded me\nOf a profound quote it came across years ago and maybe even used it a but here's the quote a society is either moving toward stability or barbarism and I see Trump trying to apply civil law and order to our society\nAnd it's apparent that the liberal left is embarrassing barbarism again just wanted to get your thoughts\nAre so the but the question is do I do I agree that uh our society has always trending toward a barber is what what barbarism in a\nSociety barbarism\nOr civilly were trending one where we're not in the middle of the ... eater trending toward civility or barbarism\nOff the clocks\nAnd the oh it's a constant flocks and so what what what what is your question more Trump isn't it\nWell it seems as if a Republican conservatives are taking the side of civility and working uh you know towards the law and order a restoring it and it seems like the Democrats have just outright embraced barbarism\nRight ah with all of their a character assassination attempt on Trump Kavanaugh anti a violent shooting\nYeah there's no there's no question about that it's an active choice I mean Hillary Clinton's endorsing it\nYeah absolutely and uh it's it's sad to see because this is not the Democrat Party of my uh mother and father and I remember so well you know the conservatism here in Oklahoma where I live uh in fact most of the state\nWell let me ask you this was the Democratic party the Democratic party ... what was it when that was all button fine and dandy one more thing that\nI think it was a before the Nineteen forties\nNot all one word or whatnot when what were they what were they like when the Democrats were in the Democratic party over your dad or your grandpa what they want but they're doing\nWell um the Democrats at at that time the basic uh\nIssue was a labor laws and a win for what purpose\nMy part of the Democratic party hasn't changed that much is my point the Democratic party has always been rooted in the modern\nEra in our lifetimes of this century in the previous at the Democratic party has been rooted\nSo my point is that that not as many people are seeing them and and the last night this is such a contrast I have to tell you folks and I this was the kind of thing that you just if you have any observational powers at all\nYou can't miss this these people at Trump rallies they're non violent\nThey are not threatening their not intimidating and and then they're not dangerous\nAnd they don't make anybody feel in danger or threatened these are people having a great time these are people that are up beat him happy they are excited to be wherever they are\nThey are part of something that matters greatly to them\nThey want to be involved and they are the contrast to the the makeup of people and their behavior a Trump rally in your average ordinary democratic protest is striking\nYou contrast the people at this rally last night it was it was a Council Bluffs Iowa you contrast that with with that on for ... picture to me of these kids slowing and the front door\nOf the Supreme Court Saturday afternoon\nRight I think being banging on the door and clawing at the door trying to\nGet him I didn't know if I was watching the wicked witch of the west army or what but it was it was\nCertainly nothing was inspiring or promoted wanting to be part of the Trump rallies\nOr the exact opposite\nAnd I don't mean that people at Trump rallies or a bunch of nerds and dry balls don't misunderstand or just wholesome people in there and they're having a good time and there is nothing threatening or intimidating and there's a lot of laughter\nAnd just general happiness and you never see that at any Democrat sponsored event\nAnd even if you do have some happy people with the Democrats sponsor the audience isn't gonna last long because a Democrat on stage is going to get mad and outraged and get everybody else checked off\n\nAnd I want you to hear a little bit of a Trump rally last night this is it's about a minutes' worth the Trump rally crowd has find a way that found a way to recycle and keep lock her up relevant and current\nAbout Senator Feinstein this another [noise]\n[noise] the documents wow oh\nGod [noise]\n[noise] no [noise] no no we [noise]\n\nAnd I think talking about five cent genuinely [noise] it was\nWorst body language in other words did she get a hundred percent hand match during our son is and you don't give power to an angry left wing mob and that's what the Democrats [noise]\n\nYou don't hand mattress do an arsonist you don't get power do an angry oh by the way that word mob the left is is in synch that Trump is calling their supporters the mob and so now there are left wing stories defining the word mob\nBoss the on dictionaries in the wake of PBS and trying to make the case that it's Republican crowds that are the mob and not Democrats they're really a bunch of Democrats elected Democrats aren't just in didn't end up and did that Trump is daring that call their supporters a mob\n[noise] they're just they're so on you used to having it thrown right back at him with the same force they'd dish it out they are so on you used to having their ideas and behavior being criticized\nAnd they really can't stand being laughed at\nAll\nSo now Dianne Feinstein lock her up I Want to go back to two thousand\nSixty to two years ago two years exactly October tenth eleventh we have a montage fear\nOf people from ABC CNN PMS NBC PBS ABC\nNBC talking about the election October attempt to thousands sixteen the election was over Hillary in a landslide Trump had no chance\nNobody has ever come back from this far down and one of the presidential race and unprecedented implosion on the Republican side Clinton is most likely the next president you know who's going to live\nHe's losing it probably has lost the election already this isn't a\nWinnable lecturing by Donald Trump the election ended today\nThe selections already lost the civil war in the Republican Party of flooding GOP lawmakers abandoning their nominee\nThe worst maybe yet to come with Trump they may be staring at\nA total collapse of the party by election day the cumulative effect has finally caught up to a Hillary when when big\nYou want to hear the names of their their names are Matthew Dowd he used to be a Bush adviser who's not just gone\nI don't know where you're gone total left total ABC total off the reservation\nJeff ... who's an ... university graduate and yet he ended up in the west wing drive by media New York times now he's at CNN\nIt was in the coal ... of the Bush communications shop who said the Hillary Clinton is most likely the next president you know he's going to lose but this was right after\nThe Access Hollywood video was released by the way it's very close\nHeilemann hazel losing in probably has lost the election or rummy sexual harassment Charlie Rose this isn't on when the ... election but I'm from\nJonathan Karl this elections or reading laws Lester Holt of NBC the civil war in the Republican Party a flood of GOP lawmakers abandoning their nominee F Chuck Todd of NBC at all\nFirst maybe up to come with Trump they may be staring at a total collapse of the party do we just saw that headline yesterday at the hill dot com the Republican House is in collapse\nThat's the story that I had the headline that if you didn't know how to read it you would think that two hundred nine house seats are all of a sudden switching to the Democrats' side\n\nAnd that story predicted didn't predict it said we are in the midst of a Republican collapse in the house\nThey\nDo not change everything is so formulaic they are so predictable\nAnd predictably wrong they're doing it all over again and they're doing it on the same basis that everybody hates Trump\nThat whereas in two thousand sixteen it's impossible people are not going to vote for this guy that has become people regret voting for this guy they can't believe they voted for this guy and they can't wait to show up and apologize to America for voting for this guy so they're going to do and the only thing they can do and vote Democrat\n\nEver wrong in two thousand sixteen some of them as we mentioned earlier this ah this is a budget boot couch gay warning

Ronan Farrow reported on Deborah Ramirez on corroborated allegations of misconduct by Kavanaugh out of eagerness to show a pattern of such behavior\nMayor told Elle magazine\nAnd her recollection of the Thomas hearings as James yeah so having watched this before I knew that key issues would be whether the judge had a pattern of similar behaviors since that helps establish was telling the truth when there's a standoff\nThere wasn't a pattern this is amazing she ran uncorroborated story to illustrate a pattern I\nI'm almost speechless\nIn my attempt to explain this the first story but was run about Deborah Ramirez nobody could corroborate her story kept changing there was no evidence for it the New York times found that so bad that they wouldn't they wouldn't allude to it much less reprint aspects of it\nAnd so Jane Mayer and Ronan Farrow run a second story that isn't true just to establish a pattern in other words we're going to lie twice we're going to run a false stories first that has no backup and then we're going to run a second story to show a pattern\nBecause I remember that was Clarence Thomas other women came forward it showed a pattern and it helped us persuade people at Thomas was guilty and so we wanted to show a pattern of behavior with Kavanaugh a pattern\nA beat you couldn't even substantiate uh single allegation be it from both the Ford or be it for Ramirez or from Amman ... client was her name sweat Nick\nI mean this is a flat out admitting yeah we made up a second story well didn't use those words but we wanted to show a pattern\nSo essentially they're saying we believe we can convince people that something happen just by writing a story alleging it\nAnd of course their buddies in the left one gladly accept an allegation is fact and an act on it you know we needed to show a pattern here is Krista Smith of Ohio your next I'm Glad you waited high\nHigh right very very cold and talk to you [laughter] thank you\nUm so I was just wondering I was concerned and wanting to get your thoughts you mentioned that final day yesterday but with this novel as it is and Hillary claiming that they're partying needs now civility right now I'm\nI just get worried with the mom and the left and the ...\nAnd then fattening or if they begin to help people um it just hadn't have worried about provoking violent and um you know to the point where we don't do anything ... on fire but Trump stickers and our yard on our cars", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "city": "Tucson", "day": "10"}
