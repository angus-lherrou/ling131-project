doesn't even nobody's talking but he goes to the next us database and he figured\nOh Rush Limbaugh those are leaving climate change do people a little bit north but just rank amateur on professionalism but the reason I played this is is not not to mention this guy but because while this guy is jumping all in my chili\nListened to this story this is from the federalist papers liberal professor says hurricane victims deserve to what thank God because they support Republicans\nNow do you think these clowns in Boston with zero in on something genuinely deranged like this\nYou know they're going to make up the fact that a bunch of people like me who know or the climate change man made climate change as a whole are somehow responsible for people having lost everything and clothing risking their lives\nDoes University of St Thomas engineering school in Minnesota thermal and fluids scientists professor Dr\nJohn Abraham he's a professor actually\nBelieve the Florida Panhandle residents deserve to get hit\nBy a catastrophic hurricane because they elected climate deniers here's the headline\nIn an article written by this guy was published in the guardian not some of your little rag\nOr penny saver this was published in the guardian on Thursday victims of hurricane Michael voted for climate deniers elections have consequences denying science has consequences and we're reaping what we so\n\nPeople just like this are teaching your kids and they're being paid a lot of money to do it\nThis is the ... reasoning that he is teaching these engineering school the guy is still range this is this is hyper political partisanship disguised as science\nHe thinks that voting for Republicans causes hurricanes to hit red states and the people in red states who voted Republicans deserved to get wiped out by hurricanes for voting for Republicans\nAnd his name is Dr John Abraham a University of St Thomas engineering school in Minnesota despite the lack of science to support his case doctor\nAbraham blames Michaels in tends to be on manmade global warming there isn't any evidence for it it's not the most intense hurricane to ever hit the panhandle\n\nYet he blames the intensity or manmade global warming are needing to his subsequent claim that southern voters brought this upon themselves\nBy voting Republicans into office\nYou tell one or the other states like Florida which will get pummeled by Michael couldn't vote for somebody that denies climate change this doctor wrote\nPointing to governor Rick Scott andme to Senator Marco Rubio and his argument is that in the last Republican climate deniers or voted out of office that more hurricanes will bring more death and destruction dissolve so this clown\nWho is disguised as a as an engineering professor literally is saying that if you want to stop\nDestructive hurricanes striking where you live vote Democrat he literally there's one that's what he said in an unrelated story a bunch of which is somewhere are putting a tax on Brett Kavanaugh this week and I'm not making that up\nAnd they are disguised as Democratic Party activists are hacks on Capitol I'd I'd I don't know what the nature of the ...\n\nI mean this [laughter] if it if it weren't so irresponsible that would be funny meanwhile you have the entire left now attempting to destroy Kanye West\nAnd what Kanye West Dan is simply venture off the liberal Democrats plan to shoot and that is a no no if you're African American you venture off the Democrat plantation they are going to destroy your meanwhile idiots like this professor\n\nA professor of engineering literally tells people\nThat if you want to stop hurricanes from blowing up where you live vote Democrat it's because you're voting Republican and and denying climate change that these hurricanes are coming after you know do you remember after Hurricane Katrina you people might have thought that I was joking\nThere were people\nIn the leftist medium who literally we're trying to tell people in New Orleans that George Bush wanted that hurricane to strike Louisiana\nHe wanted it specifically the strike New Orleans this is why there weren't any warnings it wanted it to strike New Orleans because Bush knew that residents of New Orleans would have to abandon the city\nAnd go to Texas where as Democrats they would be absorbed and wouldn't affect any political outcomes but in Louisiana you can turn the state Republican if you get rid of a bunch of New Orleans Democrats and so whatever people out there saying that Bush\nActually wanted to hurricane to wipe out New Orleans so that residents will have\nTo leave would have to go to Houston\nThere were some even saying that Bush was doing what he couldn't just steer the hurricane that Bush was responsible for it because Bush told the weather service to downplay the warnings\n\nWell I didn't want to mention it but I'll go ahead and mentioned there were some that now these were not mainstream media people but they did repeat this there were people out there\nTalking maybe ... on the Internet Hoover claiming that Bush was steering the hurricane\nRemember that\nThat Bush was tearing that hurricane Bush himself the president was nearing the hurry and and what this guy\n\nIs professor at the University of St Thomas's no different\nBy claiming that simply the way people vote determines where a hurricane goes how stronger hurricanes going to be\nAnd whether or not the hurricanes gonna wipe you out and he doesn't know yeah it's the redneck\nRiviera and yeah traditionally the panhandle of Florida bloat both Republican but he doesn't know there might have been some democratic voters got wiped out the odds are there were\nBecause so many people didn't get wiped out you know we we we looked at these events are these people do as one wants to political events some of these people who had been wiped out you you look at that devastation and usually how are they ever gonna come back\nThey didn't have much to begin with\nI mean it's just some of these photos that you see from that area do look like they have been leveled with explosives\nOr it is it's just heartbreaking to see what happens and the only upside as it was not\nYou know a densely populated area but that doesn't change\nThe impact on the people lived there in yeah there were some who didn't evacuate and they made up their minds themselves in the media found them talk to them they want to stay they wanted to hang in they wanted to see what it was all like every hurricane has\nThose people who are hell bent they either want to protect the homestead or they're curious to hear how devastating and how big and how rock is the Starman storms I Want to see it\nAnd they roll the dice thinking that they'll survive it or what have you takes all kinds of people but this one I when I saw this today I thought it had to make sure this is not you know some satire sight and it isn't climate deniers\nMaking these storms worse by stopping action on climate change so see\nIf we hadn't just not gotten out of the Paris climate accord and if if Trump would stop ... stop making fun of the UN's ... plant mental whatever it is on climate change\nThen the hurricanes and get their message in a hurricane to go somewhere else they're hurricanes wouldn't get so strong but the hurricanes no\nHurricanes know that they're attacking Republican voters who therefore don't believe in climate change their hurricanes are targeting people for destruction of wiping them out\nAnd these people need to know that they're making it happen because of the way they vote\nHow absurd how stupidity how\nHonored a leap politically partisan by the way it was it was it may look on it like clockwork\nJust today here come more

just me speculating let me continue\nMy husband did not defend his remark he did not defend men he sat hunched and hurt and he listened to me\nFor a moment it occurred to me to be grateful that I'm married to a man who will listen to a woman\nThe wins calmed ever so slightly in that moment when I realized he was okay and then the storm surge wild up in me as I realized the pathetic and buttons of nice men's planned to rebuild the wreckage by listening to women\n[noise] guys you really hopeless does he has this guy get anything right and he blew it he\nListened to everything and his wife still well up and exploded because what he was doing there wasn't enough\nAnd yet there's nothing else he could have done\nAs my range rushed through the streets of my mind and I'll guarantee of most of them are one way folks toppling every memory of every good thing my husband has ever done and there are scores that you really just want to say she's gotten mad hear her husband is not responsible

from the archives today just since you brought it up\nThat still all areas beyond description uh I Hope of that for science degree what NPR graffiti and we used to talk about uh what is the optimal cap when you hear these are people with the UN and wherever talking\nAbout well the climate change when everything burning up or they never tell us what the optimal temperature is a but every time the temperature goes up a few degrees\nYou have large swaths of Canada Russia China that are you know on job will turn into a better agricultural areas and we end up feeding more people okay some point\nOr a mayor ten thousand years ago here in upper Midwest we have this giant oil a shirt sitting over most of the country and then this wonderful thing where the climate warmed up and we have\nThis area that's suddenly feeding the world so every time the temperature goes up a\nLittle bit ah we feed more people so I don't know what the problem is I mean\nLike Oh yes it does ... the problem is they're trying to scare everybody into signing on to this because it's it's classic if you sign on to agreeing on the whole premise of climate change your dream do a lot you're agreeing you are to blame\nAnd that's a big one\nBecause when you agree that you are to blame then they hit you with but you can fix it you you you can make demands and how do you do that you agree to pay higher taxes you agree to become an activist you you agreed to start criticizing everybody else so they get you to accept blame\nThen you also admit that gigantic\nOrganizations are the only way to structure our lives and to protect everybody so it's it's simply a way the guilt people into accepting\nWhen they don't even know this is being done to them the premise decent socialism communism\nUnder the guise of saving the planet but your point about the optimal temperature I've expressed that in a different way over the years how do we know from that climate conditions right now in the entire

insanity of the left I mean and I'm not using the term loosely here's another one Susan Glasser staff writer at the New Yorker she writes a weekly column on life in Trump's Washington\nShe writes a weekly column on life in Washington in Trump's ... what life in Washington has become because of Trump once a week\nThis piece the headline I listen to all six Trump rallies in October and you should to sub had it's not a reality show it's real it's a long piece but do not misunderstand\n\nThis lady Susan B. Glasser listed in didn't watched six Trump rallies and she is up set that they're only on CSPAN she's mad that\nFox has stopped covering them that CNN is stopped covering them that pie MSNBC uh stopped covering them because she thinks\nThey are damaging to Trump\nShe thinks\nIf the people of this country saw these rallies that it would be the end of Trump She points out how Trump lie all the time how Trump exaggerates all the time\n\nShe totally miss understands the purpose of the rally she does not exactly yes I predict that she does not get the connection or the bond between Trump attendees after rallies Trump supporters and Trump\nShe totally does not get this\nShe does not know how to listen to the Trump She does not know how to uh emphasize with Trump rally attendees she has no ability to relate to Trump has his supporters do she watches these things and she is\nAppalled at Trump personally politically he lives all the time\nHe ... he mocks people he makes fun of people he's mean meanwhile\nPeople at these rallies or having the best time of their lives it's the highlight of their week to go to a Trump rally and this woman is studying and she's watching six of them so far this month and totally does not\nGet it she is\nMissing the purpose of the rally she does not see that this is Trump's mechanism for getting past the media she does not see that this is how Trump net gates\nAnd goes over the drive by me something Reagan also master\n\nTheir masterful they are formulaic even though everybody thinks they're improv and off script they are formulaic there are segments in every Trump rally and he follows them to achieve what\nHe says differs in some cases but the point is here's a drive by media specialist ... and totally doesn't get it\nAt what she doesn't even know Stephen Miller [noise] she's just been told a bunch of stuff about it but maybe what he's doing now [noise] so I don't know what the big deal is saying he ate glue um [noise] well [noise] but she put it out there and of course the media\nRan with it and they've had to withdraw it because she had to withdraw because it wasn't true and it's it's fairly common that these people on the left\nEngage in this kind of storytelling insult mongering here it is John ... never Trump ... the Democrats and blue wave is drying up oh that's not to be a disappointment\nDon't count your elections before they're hatch that's the lesson of the past couple of weeks or so called fundamentals that supposedly govern the twenty eighth team mid terms\nStill point to a good a great night for Democrats they are the out party the out party generally does better than the party in power\nBut\nTo generic polling question this week have Democrats up twelve and Thirteen points respectively that would suggest a so called blue wave in which most house and Senate seats in play will likely tilt Democrat and it's in line with the twenty ten of Republican numbers around now\nYet yet and we pointed out\nThat all of these national generic polls show this gigantic way but if you go race by race\nIf you go into the state's district by district you don't see this way but you don't see the evidence in the\nPolling and people have been asked well how can this how could this disparity be how can you have a generic ballots\nThat shows that Democrats plus proper plus Thirteen but then you don't find any single congressional race that shows Democrats plus twelve or Thirteen well it must be in the generic ballot doesn't mean much Muslim ...\nHow could a generic ballot dilemma name on it by this time when you start pulling people a month three weeks away from the election you start asking questions about how they're going to vote\nWithout a name in the question what do you think could result is going to be\nState level polls over the past two weeks showed no blue wave certainly not in the Senate\nThey suggested Democrats appear to have almost no serious chance of winning the majority in the Senate that would require them to pick up three Republican seats and the whole day every other state that they have\nThey held by incumbents that at this moment it's far more likely Republicans are going to pick up one of their seats\nSo\nIt's and it goes state by state the show where this is all happening and ... the evidence against a blue wave is primarily in the Senate\nBut\nThe conventional wisdom here is not rooted in specifics but conventional wisdom is rooted in just that conventional wisdom and hope\nThe left hope that this is a\nTraditional gear party out of power wins big that's what they're hoping they've got their generic ballot polls would say that's exactly what's going to happen then you go into the state's state by state race by race and you don't see it see why to close races some that could go either way\n\nBut they're still hanging on to hope they are reporting the hope they're reporting the hoping hoping that reporting the hulk will turn the hope into reality\nNow before we get too much in the hour I Need to tell you a little bit about a movie that is a opening tonight it probably has opened in some cities or running in certain theatres it's guys and now\nThe trial of America's\nBiggest serial killer now ... is an abortion doctor who got away with the ... murders in Philadelphia got away with the wanted murder of\nThousands\nNobody can get the media interested in the story even after he was charged and convicted and put on trial\nAnd the reason is that correct guys know was the worst thing that ever happened to people who want to keep abortion\nThought of and categorized as something other than what it is\n\nThe media wouldn't cover it and nor the trials very much there have been a lot of people who didn't covered Michele market was one of the leaders also people at the end Morsi an hot\nAir was was hot on the trail of guys and I think they rolled over a hundred and sixty different articles so that trend has been how do you do a movie about this\nHow do you get it made me in movie equals Hollywood how'd he get stars had to get people to start it how do you get money to finance it how do you get it made and how do you get a distributed in how do you find the theaters\nThat will exhibits that thing how do you do all and they they ran into every predictable problem that you can imagine\nBut they ... and they got it done and the way they got this ... this is a movie\nAbout the trial of ... guys now it's it's it's a\nIt's a procedural moving like a procedural crop cop show crime in a cop show on TV meaning it follows a formula\nIt doesn't get overtly political it doesn't it doesn't want to limit the audience by getting political even with a trial this movie has a rating of PG Thirteen and it's about wanting abortion murder there is not a lot of\nHardly any\nAbhorrent Gore and violence\nIn the movie it's it's ... picked him in a in other ways it's not meant to shock it's meant to entertain and educate it's an attempt to use a movie\nIn a responsible way to do things that movies are supposed to do entertain entertain entertain enlighten may be informed it's not the political movie that the left would make\nAbout a story like this it can avoid the politics but\nIs exceptionally well done for the subject matter your your\nI'm not going to be if you go see it you're not going to be watching people advocating for a cause\nYou're not going to see a movie designed to separate you from your money in terms of political fundraising you're gonna see Hollywood professionals who happens to be pro life producing a movie about something that really happened a mass murder\nHe was a mass murderer of people in the womb\nThat nobody on the left wanted anybody to know about what he did Kermit guys now was\nDespicable but he was a charming guy even engaging smile and laugh and even and his trial it was said that he was charming people now are oh buddy Nick Searcy\nDirected this\nAnd I don't know anything about directing movies but I can imagine some of the challenges in in a movie like this you don't want to preach and you don't want to make your movie target but you want to be truthful about it and you want\nThe message to be delivered\nBut you don't want to turn people off you don't want people to think you're being they're they're they're being preached or any of that and so the\nWay I looked at it I didn't I didn't see Nick Searcy you as a bunch of special effects or other things to distract you just let the story tell itself and it's basically the trial there some set up\nThe story itself is all anybody needs to know the number one mass murder in America which he was never referred to as as because of course the left\nAbortion is not even human it's a Bible tissue mass or what have you ah it's got\nStars people that you know people put their careers on the line to star in this movie the odds are that they're going to have trouble getting cast and other movies having been identified with is dean Cain has won\nThe uh the actor who plays a guy's now himself as a as an actor and I think ... commercials name is Earl Billings\nAnd for somebody that's only widely known as an actor in TV commercial this guy does one heck\nOf a job it's probably the finest\nRole that he's played for the best performance that he's had a I Would guess or as an actor but\nI just want to let you know that if it if you're thinking about going to it's PG Thirteen we're not talking ... we're not we're not even talking ours here so you're not\nGonna be immersed in a bunch of repulsive Gore and again it's it's thought\nThat they don't need to do that tell this story the story itself tells itself\nThe trial of America's biggest serial killer there are a lot of people who have put everything in their careers on the line to get the movie made they got it made a lot of people to put their careers in the line agreeing to appear in star even Searcy\nA directing the film [noise] ah\nIs said to have made Mohammed bin ... comfortable with the fact that he could get away with murder and journalist because Donald Trump made him think it'd be okay this is what the American media is now [noise]\nBeginning district of this was just a tweet from a Yahoo guy holding his or cough but this don't be surprised if\nThere starts blowing up\nFrom this point forward right now [noise]\nTo the funny thing is to really do have old calf ... he'll have to do and I think every yeah sunny office semi nighttime check to any kind of pumpkin pie without coffee ...\n... ... plus I Would say the
