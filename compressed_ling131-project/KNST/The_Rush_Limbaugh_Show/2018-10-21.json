{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KNST", "content": "So some of these residents are very angry that the administration decided to waive environmental and other regulations halfway through a two month comment period\nIt's crazy but as you've ... you've heard some of our guests today obviously Steve for running for district nine seen firsthand the issues out there and knowing the importance of a better barrier\nMarks Spencer sharing his experience and the death of law enforcement officers at the hands of illegals that come into the into the states we know it's important\nIt's important to build a better barrier\nMy problem a little bit is that we have areas here in Arizona namely over sixty linear miles on the town of ... them reservation where not only is the barrier less than than what we need it the leaves a lot to be desired right let's say\nBut also there's certain technologies it's hard for us to work because of all these regulations and and the holy land and what's not hold in I mean I don't want to get into that because that's not the religious aspect but obviously we need to start taking the security of our country serious\nWell you know the other thing too it seems to me agents need the technology that is available because right now there was a story that just came out last week about a one of the tunnels they found those solar equipped right solar eclipse that means you're getting this technology and they get they can't have better technology than our agents on the ground it should not be that way\nThis is where it it upsets me that we have representatives and I know Steve for our talk about it border security and securing your family is an American citizens\nIt it has nothing to do with party it has everything to do with just your secure in your country and if you run for a position\nOf political office within the United states shooting regardless of party shouldn't your priorities be towards the American citizens that you are representing me 'cause it's pretty simple I mean it just it's just it's not hard to figure that one out\nRepresentative been sitting Gonzales he's a congressman or down in ... called the plan to build the wall and I want to call him\nA monument to waste of money that's what he said how [noise]\nI mean it's just insane uh and he said we look at it in terms of common sense does it work he says is it offensive to our friends and neighbors to the south that's when it comes down to\nA Vincent Gonzales Vinnie let me tell you it works look at\nA Frances ... your buddy his home town is a prime example down in El Paso areas where we've put better barriers or prime examples that it decreases in Detroit as the people that are entering in those areas\nWhy should we even care that it's offensive to our neighbors I'm not offended that my neighbor has a fence between his home in mine that's the dumbest argument you can think of I'm not offended or you know that my neighbor has a pool and I don't have a pool that doesn't offend me\nI take care of my family and make sure that my people are secure like I said earlier I don't hate my neighbor\nBut I Love my people in my house and that's what it comes down to it's ridiculous to have that argument of it it doesn't make sense of we're gonna have set our neighbors to the south you know what I'm sick and tired of being told that we need to set the example people need to start paying attention that no one's following our example that's the reality\nUm lots of things that we do to not upset her neighbors to the south one of the issues that humongous here and it's it's very it's going to be\nHard for the list is understand this but there's actual firearms training that are agents have received that has been cut down because of funding yet that same firearms training that should've been given to our agents is now being given to the Mexican federal police\nWell how ridiculous is that to cut the training of our own men and women that are defending our borders but you're going to give it to another country and oh well we want to maintain a real good relationship\nYou know what is that that old saying Andy big fences make good neighbors yeah\nThat's the reality when you just start taking care of our own people first\nAnd whatever's leftover we can help out that's the reality folks thank you so much for another edition I Hope you enjoyed it I think it was huge it was it's been a long day along busy day we've been out on the border we had Steve Ferrara don't forget them marks Spencer my friend\n... a council chaplain\nAnd he had on the sidelines jokes or we'll talk about him and his other issues later but it's always a pleasure to have all of you guys hear Andy another fantastic job ladies are huge shout out to Lee thank you for the notes\nAnd a big heart felt shout out to all the agents up Wilcox station and of course\nThe never forgotten and always remembered ... border patrol agents in the northern border I Love you guys all thank you for listening to the green line until next time stay safe\nViews and opinions expressed in this episode are solely those of the hosts and can they do not necessarily reflect the positions or policies of the national border patrol council the United states border patrol any other government agency or this station\nI mean it just it's just it's not hard to figure that one out representative been sitting Gonzales he's a congressman or down in ... called the plan to build the wall and I'm going to quote him a monument to waste of money that is what he said\nHow I mean it's just insane uh and he said we look at it in terms of common sense does it work\nHe says is it offensive to our friends and neighbors to the south that's what it comes down to\nA Vincent Gonzales Vinnie let me tell you it works look at\n... Frances ... your buddy his home town is a prime example down in El Paso areas where we put better barriers or prime examples that it decreases\n\nSo she is one one thousand twenty fourth Mexican one one thousand twenty fourth Peruvian\nOne one thousand twenty fourth Colombian and mushy trace maybe to the drug cartels in Columbia\nWhy\nIs there a dearth of empty and DNA\nWhy is there not much in the DNA out there\nOr was the problem that most of the month they couldn't find any matches for Warren using only Indian DNA so he felt the need to expand it doing clue in South America when other reason there isn't much in the DNA is\nBecause they are very very wary of this the Indians themselves the Cherokee tribe the leaders will tell you they don't use DNA to determine the limit engine they use junior logical trace\n\nYou know who has one of the best junior logical trace apparatus us in this country in the Mormon church out in Salt Lake City has one of the most advanced respected\nDocumented genial logical praise organizations that you'll find\nI have I've seen their work and it is [laughter] it's amazing and that\nStory I get is that many Native Americans have been very leery of granting DNA because they're leery of how it's going to be used\nThey already feel like they were discriminated bunch of people but I'm the same token there are some benefits that had been extended to them as a result of this and they just don't want to upset the apple cart so they don't even realize or utilize DNA\nIn any of this but\n... the media of course has a role here because everything they've reported about this turns out to be an abject lie except for this inclusion by the Boston Globe that there wasn't\nAny Native American DNA and by the way this is not what Trump that her anyway Trump that her that she wouldn't have to take a test from little kept wandering around you can you can do a very rudimentary DNA test\nAnd he wanted to present her ... have or take the kids take the take the test of this kid using it in a debate future debate and\nThat's what he meant that she wouldn't do and he bet that she wouldn't show up as the Indian if she did do it\nBut you talk about talk about a meltdown and its Trump that is causing this\nTrump is literally causing these people lose their cookies Trump is causing them to go in the same and I think it's happening throughout the Democratic party and threw out the American left and I have I have developed\nAn even greater reason for it and it all in all relies on things that I have previously known and told you about\nAnd most of it is related to my curiosity here and my suspicion and my my dubious a nature when it comes to this blue wave business\n\nWe've been hearing for the past how many months that there's going to be a blue wave there's no question about it there has been no question about the Democratic party is poised to retake everything they can in this next election why well the media tells us the American people are fed up\nAfter two years of Donald Trump they realize the mistake they made they wish they could do it and go do it over maybe take back their vote for Trump and this is going to be the first chance they've had to actually do that until the Democrats are going to retake the house and a massive landslide and at one point we're going to take the Senate but then if you look at\nThe reality\n\nOf voting patterns just in the past eight years let's say ten there's nothing in the world\nUsing common sense that orders for a Democrat sweep or blue wave\nThe trend in the past ten years is Democrats losing elections left and right\nAnd it all started with Iraq Hussein all in two thousand ten do you remember how many times I reminded you that during the first six years of Obama you go through the two thousand fourteen midterms\nThe Democrat Party glossed over twelve hundred seats nationwide\nSeats in the U.S house seats in the U.S Senate state houses\nA governorships are you even go to a local often like mayor or town councilman if you if you factor all of those races nationwide the Democrats after six years of Obama had lost well over a hundred seats\nThey were losing everything after the two thousand sixteen election\nThey continue to lose even more and the and the damage that lock to women in a landslide Hillary Clinton got beat in ... near electoral landslide electoral college landslide\nAnother robot shouldn't where they were going to sweep big never going to wipe out the Republican Party once and for all Hillary Clinton was going to be this winter they had they couldn't they had it any better this guy Trump won the Republican nomination\nSomebody didn't know when he was doing a gigantic buffoon a walking set a gaffe they thought this guy would be easily swept away they believed all our polling data\nAnd we know what happened they continue to lose to the point that after the two thousand sixty eight elections\nThe Democratic party had the least amount of power in terms of elected office is held in Washington DC since the Nineteen twenties\n\nNow the two thousand sixteen election was only two years ago so from two thousand\nTen the first chance people had to vote after having stomach two years of the Obama administration which you want to talk about people wanting to get their votes back you want to talk about people wishing they can do it over you want to talk about people wishing they haven't voted the way they had go take a look at the two thousand ten midterms\nFor Iraq Obama singlehandedly my friends has destroyed the electoral prowess of the Democratic party\nNobody knows it because of the things I just told you are never reported instead what people hear every day is this coming blow away this gigantic Democrat landslide on what evidence is this going to happen\nWhat is it that has stopped the trend\nPeople in this country have been voting against Democrats in ways unprecedented I mean the having the fewest number of electoral seats since the Nineteen twenties is pretty astounding it means a lot of people had been voting against you so what is it that's happened\nThat is going to cause this gigantic one hundred eighty degree shift make people stop voting against Democrats and vote for them why it's none other than Donald Trump so says the media so says the Democrat Party\n... on the basis of what if you take a look\nAt Trump's agenda and the economy and policies and so forth there is no reason\nTo vote against it in common sense there is no read Trump hasn't done anything to worsen anybody's lives quite the contrary\nAnd in fact there's a story from a CNBC today that you're not going to see widely reported that the ... [noise] probably put CNBC ... survey soaring economic optimism points to no\nBlue wave in two thousand Eighteen is this the CNBC polar survey\nAmerica is experiencing a record breaking era of good feelings economically speaking optimism about the ... do you know that there are seven million jobs open in America today actual number seven million one hundred thirty six thousand job openings in America\nFor context the U.S never had even six million vacant jobs open until April of two thousand Seventeen\nNow we have an historic seven point one million jobs open that means employers are looking to hire that many people\nThat you will say roaring economy that equals no problem getting a job if you want one with that many job openings it is an employee ease market if there's that much demand for employees the employees can\nSet the terms based on their level of expertise and experience or whatever it is they're applying\nFor none of this in the world of common sense suggests that people would be unhappy by or about it and want to reject it and yet that's exactly what we're being told that the American people are sick and tired day hey Trump they despise Trump they're embarrassed by Trump they were barest by their vote\nAnd yet\nThere isn't a bit a little Lincoln bit of evidence that people have turned around and want to vote Democrat including the two thousand six game presidential election\n\nFrom them anything coming up [noise]\nHey remember nothing negative comes from stimulation can as the AMC been Ninety two sons most stimulating talk [noise]\nNow by somebody who am I trying to squeeze it in here somebody to do some thinking I'm going to expand on his of course but but I I'm thinking nothing is chances for rock Obama ruined the Democrat Party ...\nIs the reason that they lost well hundreds each nationwide there hasn't been anything to change that they lost the Supreme Court they lost Kavanaugh they did everything they could\nHave mounted October surprise they tried to destroy the life the career of the past the future of Brett Kavanaugh to save the court nothing\nIs going their way they're not winning meanwhile what's happening on the Republican side many of you may hate earring it's something you'd never Trump per se but the fact the matter is the Republican Party is unified and what made that happen the Democrats attempt on cabinet\nOr a Republican but Mitch McConnell Mitch McConnell Trump brought him on stage at a rally in Kentucky Mitch McConnell got a hero's welcome Mitch McConnell got a standing all probably the first standing in his career\nIn front of us or other stadium or arena sized crowds I guarantee\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n\n[laughter] you're from county to county I don't know if I were Coney\n...
