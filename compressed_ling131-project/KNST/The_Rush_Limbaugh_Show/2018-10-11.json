they're the ones that run around claiming that ever they must be attached to climate change when it is a weather event anyway\nI said eventually do don't get so upset by this this is nothing I mean this is this is I'm actually flattered or be mentioned in the piece here but he certainly was mad because he doesn't know what\nTo do when confronted with abject ignorance like this how do you fight abject ignorance and prejudice and so forth [noise]\nAnd you don't you defeat it\nYou don't try to reason with it because it's impossible you defeat it I've got a chart here doesn't go well on the radio but it demonstrates that since Nineteen hundred you can find that with all the chart and hurricanes since Nineteen hundred you can find you know significant trend in either the frequency\nOr the intensity of major hurricanes striking Florida there simply is no evidence\nThat climate change manmade even exist and there certainly is no evidence that it has anything to do with hurricanes either the number of them are the intensity but that doesn't matter to the New York times and the rest of the dry bones are offered a running cause they are hell bent\n\nOn getting people to Rio and takes it why what is the purpose because this promotes big government it promotes the notion of gigantic autocratic\nTyrannical government control over everything once you of the American citizens are blamed and can be blamed for everything that's wrong then you can be controlled to make sure that you start doing things right and don't keep doing things wrong that's what they want\nThis ... in the process they don't even know what they're talking about this guy this no hurricanes from thunderstorms\nHe doesn't know cloud tops ... temperature it doesn't matter\n\nI Want to thank Mr surgery for being so sensitive in so concerned about it but I Wonder was shortly you that these kinds of things no longer\nBother me other than the I I I Do get concerned that there's so much genuine ignorance existing now in positions that influence the thinking of other people I mean feminist studies\nAt universities I firmly believe\nHas destroyed the futures of way too many women\nIt has just distorted the life it's distorted gender differences has distorted the concept of happiness victim ... it has just started the whole concept of America the greatest place to live and grow up and seek opportunity in the world\n\nAnd it's to and feminism is just one of many elements of liberalism that is doing the same thing to which other constituency groups\nFor example let me ask a generic question we had Eric Holder out there\nWho is campaigning for somebody to be governor of Georgia holders supposedly going to run for president himself at twenty funny or Eric Holder the attorney general for Iraq who same\nAll involved in many scandals himself and I'm seeing a lot\nOf people on our side than these so called conservative intelligentsia shock\nEric Holder was saying what he said you know Michelle my bell Obama's out there saying no no my motto is when they go low we go high and holder said screw in that when they go low meeting Republicans when they go low we get them\n\nSo people's mind God these out their inciting violence and he said no no no no I didn't mean it literally I was saying\nThat we can't take it anymore we have to stop being a nice guys and stopped taking any he didn't mean it\nObama met him when he said they bring a knife we bring a gun Obama met at soldiers Maxine Waters when they're both encouraging people would get in our faces they mean that\nThey are already inciting violence they inciting violence inside Capitol Hill buildings and elevators they're engaging in bullying tactics my question is why\nWhy are the Democrats doing all this why are they inciting violence let's look at the things\nThat they think\nAre supposedly on their side things that are helpful to them we start with the fact that they are convinced that they're going to win control of the house\nIt's already done the blue wave it's just a matter of the day is on the calendar passing by until we get to a ... day where we can confirm that the Democrats already won that remember we had a poll from CNN a sound bite John King couple of weeks ago\nHe resigned the poll indicated the house races are over there are poll said the Democrats are likely\nWinners of the house of representatives over in their minds they won the house in their minds they've almost won the Senate they have the Mueller report and the mother report is going to link Trump to Russia right\nThey know that Mueller's got the goods all they can taste it all they can scratch their bags with it they just can't they know that Mahler secretly collected the good and they know that Mueller is going to issue a report and it's going to tie Trump and Russia and it's going to prove the trumps stolen the election\nFrom Hillary Hillary shouldn't be president that should make them happy right\nWhy all the desperation CNN\nEngaging in full fledged one thousand percent racism and directed at Kanye West\n\nYeah Kanye West is what happens to one negro when he stops reading that's what they said on CNN with Don Lemon laughing in New York you can get all up wasn't that long ago the cover of time magazine\nWhen was this a\nTwo thousand five the drive by media proclaimed Kanye West the smartest man in pop\nMusic hip hop's class act\nThe firing the rules of rap Kanye West goes his own way so what would that be Thirteen Years ago Kanye West was in the future\nKanye West was the hero but now Kanye West is having lunch at the White House today with Trump as his Jim Brown\nBy\nThe way Trump is funny that Trump Trump photos and why did you do that rally why did you do that rally with a hurricane coming and climate change destroying and why did you can Trump said you know what\nYou have a point but there were people that have been a lined up for a day and a half to get in to see her I couldn't disappoint them I had to go and it was a great time\nTrump to slam dunked him on a number of things in a short little press availability at the White House\nSo now\nA CNN panel calls Kanye West a token negro\n\nListened black folks are about to trade Kanye West and the ratio draft okay they've had it with him and\nThey said all of a sudden cognac because he's put on a ... hat and he is he's\nAn attention horror like the president he's all of a sudden now the modeled spokesperson he's a token negro the Trump Administration is a ridiculous\nSays the CNN panel wider so mad folks\nWhy all the desperation they're going to win the house are going to win the Senate Muller is going to prove that Trump colluded with Russia\n\nBetween inciting violence is launching a racist attacks we're witnessing an attempt to bully the American population of surrender that is what's happening\nHere they're soft coup failed\nNow it's time for the second phase the soft coup that swear Rosen staying in the rest of the guys are going to wiretapped Trump and going to wire Trump wear a wire and get Trump indicting himself for certain things he was saying they're going to get rid of Trump the FBI the deal Jay the Clinton Administration is soft coup it didn't work\n\nRemaining silent about the skill lease\nShooting should've been a clue of the Democrats depress the intentions of what I mean by that\nThere was actually a shooting of Republicans and baseball practice in preparation of a joint Republican Democrat baseball game it's a traditional annual thing\nAnd a lunatic deranged Democrat fundraiser donors supporter from Illinois shows up starts firing him almost kills stitched elite and the Democrats didn't say anything about\nThe media didn't condemn it there wasn't any condemnation there was there was an overwhelming silence that shouldn't have been and it was to me a clue\n\nTo the Democratic depravity ameritech was and now we've got Hillary now we've got Maxine Waters Eric Holder it's what is the lead directing Democrats\nTo physically attacked\nRepublicans with CNN going full racist on a prominent black Trump supporter by the way they can see the polls Trump approval

she wanted their videos on my fantasy dot com saga continues\nMan and ... the old way of what [noise]\nWhat do I get most of it because I'm ticked off [noise]\nI've been expecting a delivery of things for over a week and UPS hasn't moved um from the customs center over in Shanghai and I'm getting ticked off about it\nThat's why I keep looking at the phone I keep waiting for movement from UPS and it's been over there for a week\nI guess I sometimes I get obsessed with this stuff I'll get an alert when there's any changes the delivery zap it's a great that don't don't get confused my beef with UPS I I Know this stuff has lost that's what it is and they're just trying to cover up for it\nAnyway you people are observing out there I got another email rush could you explain to me this journalist named ... show gee\nWhat its ... and I'll be ... if you I'll be glad if tell you what I Know about this and it is it is somewhat there's somewhat fascinates name as ... that the president of the United states involved in this now Trump is being openly asked about it\nAnd it has to do in many ways with with our new found relationship with Saudi Arabia based on the fact we no longer depend on them for oil\nNow ... is Saudi I don't know if he's related they add nan is Yogi\nNot common ... is is a as a Saudi or Arab name and then they show he was a famous arms runner made famous as a celebrity\nBy a a\nLifestyles are the rich and famous but the guy was an arms merchant he was an arms dealer and that the source of his wealth which is made to look like a jet setting party animal\nBy Robin Leach so whether whether Jamal casualties related to him and I couldn't even find outages habit Jamal ... as a critic\nOf Mohammed bin selmont Mohammed bin some on as the crown prince\nIn Saudi Arabia his father is the king king Solomon he is the brother of the late deceased king king of double their\nFather grandfather uh start at the house of Saud they are the royal family\nThe crown prince the each of these guys have many sons\nThere are constant battle for power with in the royal family the crown prince is the chosen son he is the air\nNow Mohammed bin Salman is not the oldest son of king Solomon but he hasn't been designated the crown prince meaning he will be the next king\nAs such Mohammed bin ... mom has been trying theoretically to reform the some of the the Saudi economy and to take it away from being strictly petrol and oil\nFocused\nBecause the world is expanding in ways that the Saudis are not involved in one of the things that Mohammed bin Salman has been doing has been traveling the world and making\nFriends in the United states you spend a lot of time in Silicon Valley he's gotten to know he's winding dying the Google guys he's winding dined Facebook guys spend a lot of time an apple\nHe wants to build a brand new city out of nothing in Saudi Arabia and make it a tech center he's thirty two\nIf he takes off the Arab garbage he looks just like your average run to the middle guy a very attractive short little stocky\nBut he represents if he is\nBeing truthful major reforms he is the guy who has opened up driving to Saudi women\nHe is the guy who wants to relax\nAll kinds of cultural rules on an saw each to them all but not being able to drive a go places on their own without male a company that is made him quite controversial he also last summer not this past them last night I think it was this past summer\nHe arrested the elite of the elite\nOf Saudi well some of them even among the royal family and took over\nThe Ritz Carlton hotel in Riyadh and that became a giant jail and he put all these guys in jail demanding a certain percentage of their wealth on the basis they had stolen it do the corruption and connections and soon as he made a lot of enemies\nWell Jamal ...\nHas as a journalist doesn't buy any of this and has been running around openly criticizing Mohammed bin Salman\nEven running stories suggesting that Mohammed bin ... father ... king has grown so upset with his son the crown prince that he's taking toys and power away from it\nThis reportedly has not set well with the crown prince Mohammed bin selmont\nDespite the reforms in Saudi Arabia you still don't get to run around and criticizing the government and keep your head you don't get to run around and criticize the government and keep your knees\nFor example\nYour mom ... wanted to get married he had to get a wedding like a marriage license he was in Turkey\nIn order to do that by the end it before the he had supposedly had been targeted by the crown prince and others in the Saudi\nRoyal family because of his open criticism of these reforms and other things so he goes into the Saudi consulate or embassy in Istanbul\nAnd hasn't been seen since\nAbout the country's direction now who do you think this guy's going to vote for\nGuys obviously going to vote for the nearest democratic and find that this is how they're being inspired and further evidence that the Democrats are not about ideas and not about inspiring people to vote for them because of the great improvements it'll happen in their lives Nancy Pelosi [noise] right here\nNancy below\nSee Trump's tax returns a top priority if Democrats win the house now how is that going to benefit your average Democrat voter well I'll tell you how the Democrats have so poison\nTheir voters democratic voters want revenge\nNot a job not raise not a bonus they want room ... eight\nTrump and so anything that Democrats can do to harm Trump why the Democrats will vote for who ever will promised to make Trump suffer\nYou think that's a majority of people you think that's the kind of stuff that creates a blue wave I don't\nI don't believe that the country is that it ranged\nBut the Democrats are counting on the fact they think it is okay to the phones ban in Fresno Europe first today great to have you with us or high\nThey rash thanks for having me on Yes sir I\nSo I was there I was in the uh for the three days of the nonsense last week I saw the the them screaming and yelling and attacking us and and the folks and and so what I felt was\nThis is all they have the reason that they continue the reason that John Lennon saying the nonsense he said on CNN the reason that they just continue with this game plan is it the only game plan they have\nAnd they're hoping that the American people are dumb enough to still buy it but I Believe that the American people even in California where I'm at the American people are seeing this crap and they're like this little game we don't find any more\nAnd and and they have nothing else to play there's nothing else for them to do but they just keep doing the same market and the cooking are either it was like they know they're losing they know that we're not buying it anymore but they've got nothing else to say\nNow that hold on you know that's an interesting point because if they do have the maturity of the presence of mind\nThey do have to realize they're losing Trump one Trump is getting elements of agenda his agenda a pastor implemented Kavanaugh was confirmed everything they've done to stop Trump\nEverything from the judges to the court's travel but not much has worked and so I think you're right they do realize they're losing\nAnd you think they're in a fit of desperation that they've got nothing else to do that's why they're not proposing any ideas to counter Trump's that's why they're not proposing a new policies to counter Trump's because they don't have any\nAbsolutely they let loose when they're both the right mood when we're filing and they they for so long they've expected us to just shut up and go away it\nWell that's true too I I think they have become accustomed to Republicans caving and Republican voters will certainly conservative media uh well so conservative caving as well I think they've they've gotten accustomed to bullying working the rats lying\nYup threats lying all of that and and and they're hoping that it's going to work together and the only way it works\nIs that we don't go up that's why that's why you see the polling data still showing them winning that's why it showed Hillary was going to win a landslide because they know that if they can to sway does that they can discouraging us enough to make it not show up that's the only way they win but if Republicans conservative stand up\nWhen every single time we just have to show up we have to convince other people to show up and convince them to convince other people to show\nYou say you were in Washington for three days what did you actually see what kind of activities where they engage like you saw that was\nI was right in the middle of it I Would live streaming

[noise]\n\nNew York magazine and look at this Obama had a secret plan in case Trump rejected the twenties sixteen election results\nIs this not aware of just looking back watch what's retrace steps it was the last debate\nBetween the Trump stir and the hill the beast and Chris Wallace was the moderator and Wallace asked Trump if she writes them which where pledge to accept the election results and Trump said no\nI'm not gonna sit here and tell you right now but I Will accept the results of the election I'm not going to do that until the election columns that we've counted the boats\nThey want it\nI think what was the objective was\nTo be able to create a soundbite Trump acknowledges he thinks he will lose elections\nThat's what they were hoping for\nThe Trump have you with knowledge what you'll accept the results of the election oh of course I'm a great American ... that go sit at that time everybody thought that Hillary was going to win a landslide than they the soundbite would be the headline we trumpet knowledge is likely defeat in upcoming election but\nTrump crossed them up and said no\nI don't know what kind of shenanigans if people are gonna play I'm not going to concede anything tonight\nHillary Clinton gets in gear\nIs the biggest threat to our democracy when you're a member\nThere will be saying there's there's a ... sold them Obama though we didn't know until\nRecently devised a secret plan in case Trump rejected the election results and guess what the plan was the plan was if Trump Williams to steal the election away from him\n\nOctober two thousand sixteens senior staff and the Obama\nIt was\nDiscussed what they should do if Hillary Clinton won the election and Trump refused\nTo accept the results they had cause to be worried at that time Trump had openly speculated that the election might be read during his final debate was Clinton on October the nineteenth you said that his opponent should never have been allowed to run and declined to answer the question of whether he would conceded\nI'll keep you in suspense Trump said it wasn't a hypothetical Ben Rhodes Obama senior aide and speech writer told the intelligence New York magazine column Trump was all ready to hang it on the campaign trail\nBen Rhodes seems to have a problem with English Trump was asked a hypothetical question what will you do if Hillary wins to which he gave an answer based on a hypothetical premise\nThe Obama White house plan according to interviews with Ben Rhodes and Jen Psaki\nObama's communications director called for congressional Republicans former presidents when former cabinet level officials including colon colonel Powell and Congolese are rice to try an forestall a political crisis by validating be election results so\nThis is not funny looking by their hell bent on making sure the Trump concedes despite being dead certain Hillary was going to win and if Trump refused to concede that we're going to call Colin Powell and Congolese are\nRice and a bunch of ex presidents\nAnd they were going to get them to validate the election result\nIn addition to the official count state by state in addition to the U.S Congress certifying the election that apparently it wasn't going to be enough they had to go get colon Powell income the loser rice\nIn the event the Trump tried to dispute that Clinton victory they would have been resolved as well as the conclusions arranged by the U.S intelligence community that\nRussian interference in the election sought to favor Trump so we're now learning\nNot we're not learning anything we're having our suspicions\nConfirmed they hatch this Russia plot way before the election even took place and no matter what happen no matter what the outcome was they're going to use it you're pro last they were still going to use it to say that even though Trump last he tried to steal the selection of Hillary and it was\nThat was going to validate her election even more that was going to make her an even bigger star an even bigger hero she overcame not just Trump She overcame ... she overcame the Olive Garden she overcame Russia and that's what their plan was\nAnd then it got turned upside down Hillary last and she refused to concede river\nShe refused to go away they refused to acknowledge the Trump and one in immediately became Trump didn't win the Russians stole it\nTo this day there's no evidence for it but there is Obama this\nTo hide Gerald Lewis believe it or not it's fall we're going to need the heat soon you can get a furnace and heater tuna for just forty nine dollars

questions if you want to take one that's fine uh during the judges hearing all I heard was yeah\nI only investigates they do not come up with conclusions or oh pinion or anything I heard that too but Fox\nNews and the president have both bought in to the fact that honors did\nThe opposite he was judge jury and not executioner but a probation officer for Hillary gay did he violated all of it so why did he get away with it and nobody else can I don't understand I really don't\nUh who is ... ... you mean call me go ... go ahead I'm Sorry [noise]\nYeah I'm I made the same point when I heard they don't drunk and ... call me exonerated her before even interviewing her\nJudge jury and probation officer\nRight and and we all know the reason why she was a Democrat nominee their jobs and futures end the shenanigans they haven't pulled\nRequired her to win burned them to stay employed in front of the tricks they had pulled on Trump to remain unknown\nSo she had to be exonerated she had to be found not guilty and not even charged in relation to the emails and the ... and the trafficking in class divide data and so forth [noise] see I have the same reaction you do what do you mean it'll come out in ...\nI Am I understand that that she had to get off but he did not have the right to he was not a judge it was never an trial\nIt was all we know wait wait wait wait he claimed that he did because\nLoretta Lynch ended up having to her she didn't officially recused but because she met was slick willy on the plane on the tarmac\nOut in Phoenix ... said she's compromise so he basically took over the gang of eight gee for the purposes of exonerated Hillary and he went out there on July fifth did that press conference under\nThe auspices of making the decisions because the Loretta Lynch couldn't\nThere why can't we just ... open it and say it didn't have the legal right to make the decision so let's start over from where he just gave that speech\nI agree with you and this is why you're not the only one Devon newness and a bunch of his um other house members that are on the house Judiciary Committee\nAre hell bent on getting to the bottom of this\nAnd not letting these people get away with it they have been on the investigated that's not the right word they haven't even been invest they haven't been looked at you've got the special counsel what you're saying nor ring the real crimes and criminality that's taken place while spending all of this time trying to find the\nCrime that they can lay on Trump and they haven't been able to it's frustrating this is why by the way there isn't cruising frustration that the president for not deep classifying these documents that will answer the question you're asking\nDon't understand why why the president is protecting Rosen stain the guy who end up meeting suggested wearing a wire in his next meeting with Trump to try to get incriminating evidence that Trump's unfit\nThey were going to gather the cabinet after Rosen's dean had\nHad a conversation with Trump which supposedly was going to show that Trump is insane and unfit and they were going to play that for the cabinet to try to invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment Rosen stance I'm just kidding I just it was the people in the ... they say he was not getting none of us were\nAnd I believe that I Believe these people back then were hell bent on getting rid of Trump\nI think they still are I I think I think official Washington the political media complex of washing it is still\nInside out and upside down over Trump and I think what every success and every smile on Trump's space with every\nPiece of evidence that Trump is enjoying this I think they go a little further insane each and every time\nThe Trump succeeds it something that Trump is not damaged by saying every effort everything they've done to take Trump out I think they are beyond frustrated that it hasn't worked\nAnd I don't think they are giving up on it I don't think they will give up on it now the Rosenstein Rosenstein however pronounces it hurt it both ways\nThis is really curious Trump Pan Am\nA on the air force one people thought that roses you know why he's got to be fired after this after credibly being discovered\nSuggesting wearing a wire to win trap the president if he got to go but Trump says I got a great relationship with the guy I'm not let them go I'm not doing anything about that now and I'm not declassify those documents yet\nThat people are scratching their heads\nA as to as to why\nSome are saying it's just the election rush ... not going to do any of this still after the midterms doesn't want any of this to become an election issue well he classifying some of these documents the newness wants that would", "year": "2018",
