I I understand Republican senators saying what they're saying oh my God this is only acceptable I don't know why president that he did it for some reason\nEverybody's pointing out that the Trump just last week was saying she was very credible yeah he did and we knew when he said that why he said it\nHe had to everybody has to\nBefore all this is a investigated and put it but you can't run out there and start ripping on her even if it's deserve even if it's warranted last week it could not rip on Christine balls before there was nothing there is no upside to doing it no matter if you were right\nEven if she was lying through her teeth and you can demonstrate all last week was not the time to do it so Trump joined the chorus\nI find a compelling I find her very credible will now\nShe's not so credible she never was but now she's not so credible is all kinds of holes in Trump just pointed amount all Trump did is pointing out the flaws in her story which should have happened\nDuring the hearing last Thursday but the Republicans were not going to go there they were not going to challenge or because it\nJust wasn't smart\nEspecially with that voice that she was affecting the go after her in any way that would seem like an attack or like you didn't believe her\nWhether or not been politically useful but in a in a normal congressional hearing to many hearing her allegations wouldn't be challenged in tested they were not that's all Trump did\nTrump pointed out the mistakes or the ... or the difference is the prevailing occasions she can't remember where when who the people she says we're there says they weren't that's all they did Republican senators should have done that last week but they put\nSo Trump's given them covered Trump's writing shade for them and let them go out and rip him for doing it if they want to understand that by this time we have to assume Trump knows what he's doing when he goes off script he doesn't step and it\nIt may look like it but he doesn't but that's not the big take away the big take away from me as this one year the New York times and it's been investigating the trumps for forty years they've got tax returns going back who knows how long\nAnd guess what's not part of the story guess what\nIs not part of any income tax story on Donald Trump guess what one word you do not see in the report anybody want to take a guess\nWhat pay off then you say no that's not the word what one word is not in this entire New York times story I'll give you a hint it was the sole reason the last one I didn't get their hands on Trump's tax returns\nRussia at ten for that yet\nThey want in Trump's tax returns because their tax returns they said\nWould prove Trump polluted because his money came from Russia because his wealth was because and due to Russian connections that's what everybody on the left was convinced was true and now here's the New York times story\nYear long investigation Trump's taxes going back more than forty years and they're not able to find any Russian mommy\n\nSo now they didn't find any Russian money and I guarantee you they expected to\n\nThey're the ones that said this they're the ones that said I'm Talking about everybody on MSNBC CNN go back a year ago back to the two thousand sixteen campaign when everybody was hell bent on proving\nThat Trump was they put in storage\nTrump wasn't totally Trump was compromised by Russia because it was Russia that enable Trump to get rich\nAnd his tax returns would prove it they said so I guarantee you when the New York times got these documents for the first thing they did\nWas make up the line key word search however they search it looking for Russia Russia and Russian names answer big fat zilch zeroed not so now they're on to something else now they're back to what's always been said about Trump and he got rich from is that\nActually a reference to something somebody said and changes are seen mostly are too young to remember this a bottom line and I know what had happened to a woman comes for political environment\nNow what grams point is there's a lot of young people this audience just don't remember the Clinton years in Nineteen Ninety two when James Carville was trying to destroy all of John's\nYou never know what you got to do when you're grabbing got about ... what you want to come up with you but you're not going to you're going to come up by women like New Hampshire gray\nThe ... not a Bill Clinton and that's Hillary Clinton was right and they're trying to help destroy those women and Lindsey Graham was referring to these people in the audience didn't know what they thought he was talking about Ford\nAnd that's when he stopped and said I see\nActually a reference to something somebody said James Carville most of you are too young to remember this so not only do they live in denial that it ever happened now they're trying to shut down anybody who brings it up you know the Clinton years in what they did the women supposed to go down the memory hall\nNow I have a transcript and anti Kavanaugh protester with confronted I'm a Republican senator and he pushed back\nThis was an attack or a confrontation walking down the hall or any Kevin all protesters have flooded Capitol Hill and they've been allowed to get into the hallways of the offices\nIn Senate office buildings how does that happen\nBut what we all know about what happens but they're they're one of these protesters approached Republican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana on his way through a Senate building walkway Monday\nAnd she said why are you supporting Kevin up where are you supporting capital Cassidy did not ignore her he took the chance to push back he asked her if she would like it if her loved ones were destroyed by uncorroborated charges\nCassidy why wouldn't I support Kavanaugh protester because rapist or bad Cassidy wait a second everybody there said it didn't happen either rape anybody so why am I gonna so you're gonna you're gonna believe mark judge over a woman no I'm going to believe her best friend\nWho says it didn't happen she wasn't there her best friend didn't say didn't happen her best friend said she wasn't told about it\nHer best friend said she didn't remember it\nProtester so you're okay as a doctor do harm a woman Cassidy wait a second are you OK as a person to go ahead and do accept the non corroborated charge to destroy somebody's life\nIf you destroy your wife your son's life or your husband's wages I can answer that question if it was your husband your son your father whose life has been destroyed by uncorroborated would you like that protester I Would support a full FBI investigation we're dealing with appropriate robots I'm Glad Cassidy pushed back but it's a lost cause on the protester\nThe protesters not even hearing what he says she's got program dancers bought and paid for by George Soros\nAnd she hears key words and what he says knee jerk reaction causing things replies accordingly\nCastle you know no would you like an on corroborated charged destroyed I wouldn't marry somebody that was a drunk said the protestor oh wait a minute uncorroborated answer the question I don't think you're able to because you know it's unfair protester I Would stand up\nCassidy you know it's unfair protester I Would fight it would make sure women or heard clearly you're all care for rapist goes on the Supreme Court Cassie no not\nBut then on the other hand clearly you're okay the absence of evidence obviously means nothing view protest you know there is evidence look at the standard how many people are in jail for ...\nSo what this ... unless somebody like me gets hold of a transcript of something like this and help people understand that it's a total waste of time to engage these protesters especially if you're trying to persuade them you can't persuade them I just like you can't persuade the media\nYou know I I've told this story when I was first at this\nVery young wet behind the ears naive and the media would want to talk I thought just because they're really interested I Know nobody's ever heard\nOf me a radio shows taking off I thought they were legitimately curious\nAnd that's how I went into early interviews I found out that not all they weren't curious about anything they were simply there to discredit me\nMake fun of me to raise doubts it took me\nLonger than I Want to admit to figure this out you cannot persuade these people you can't change their minds and debate it's why I say the only option is

Democrats announced her and stayed at her to be credible\nShe's above and beyond reproach you cannot challenge or she is the accuser so the Republicans they've\nThey they they played ride along and without a head ritual Mitchell ask her some questions which now turned out to be brilliant but at the time\nWe were all kind of curious what what the purpose was a\nAll Trump is doing is reminding everybody what\nShe said she doesn't know she doesn't know the people she says we're there say they weren't there\nThis is not mocking her and this is a sign of what really is wrong in this country and accuser comes forward and you can poke holes in obvious places\nYou can't point out obvious discrepancies you cannot reference or make mention of the differences in her story from depending on the day she's telling it whatever it is is it is not mocking\nChristine ball the Ford now\nTrump has a lot of people say this is crazy rush makers last week Trump was saying that she was credible and her testimony was compelling\nI have explained this before and I'm going to explain it again Trump all ways eventually will tell you what he really thinks about anything\nAnd he may not do that out of the batter's box I have a name for this I call it pacing\nTrump will the new surely go out with a general opinion like on gun control after a shooting or the dreamers or in this case doctor both before and your caller credible testimony compelling and he'll even go so far to say that yeah if if she's telling the truth yeah they're my nomination might be in trouble yeah I'll agree with that\n\nThat gives him credibility it makes people kind of cock their head they don't think Trump could be that fit or I'm Talking about the media and the left the Democrats they don't think Trump can be that that's a reasonable\nBut he does it to them every time it gives them the credibility later to be\nCritical and to step away he said yeah I found a credible I found her compelling then as we learn more and then as events play out Trump is able\nTo parlay his original statements into what he really thinks based on\nWhat is not a knee jerk reaction if Trump were to heaven sent initially when he said last night at the rally\nWhy there would have been held up pay but now he can back it up now there's all kinds of evidence that her timeline doesn't make any sense we've got an ex boyfriend claiming she is a polygraph expert and has taught people how to beat them\nWe have people challenging her account we didn't have that last week it is perfectly fine for Trump to do what he did\nGives him a credibility later to be critical to step away it's a common technique you use as he does it on everything\nIt's why I've always told you don't take his first draft statement or his first tweet as a sign that he's caving or flipping you people you I'm sure you remember there have been many instances in fact I may have fallen for one myself that's how I learned\nThat Trump will read something or say something it'll make you look like he's about late ... before he pulled out above the Paris climate accord what did he say\nClimate change very serious thing to do with a look at it than we are looking at it than moving to the rights\nOh so he's on record as being open about then later on when he's learned when he needs to learn comes up tells you what do you think's really thinks it's a pattern it's a technique if\nThey trumped developed I don't even open developed or it's just how he does it naturally and instinctively\nBut I call it pacing now Republicans have not built up this reputation Senate Republicans habits Trump has Trump has established\nThat after he makes it an initial statement on somebody and he can make fun\nOf things and what really irritates ... he gets away with it I cannot tell you what helped me irritates them to he shouldn't have survived the Access Hollywood video he shouldn't have survived anything they've thrown at him the fact that he has an just continue to prosper in triumph I cannot tell you how the winds Lee insane\nIt has made them with rage\nOther Republicans have not developed the golden adds to do this\nAnd pull it off\nTrump hasn't been attacked so much we're now if you go back to two thousand Fifteen when this campaign started this has to do so they did just three years\n\nIn fact it's if it's three years in three months Trump gets in in June of two thousand Fifteen Trump has been attacked so much he doesn't care anymore\nIt doesn't bother him anymore is my point he's not willing to take the arrows he's willing to take the hits for everybody else that's why he is needed smokes he is willing to do what he did last night\nI Know Murkowski in Collins or shorter ringing cowering in the corner with the vapors\nOh my God it was horrible it was the one the horrible everything he said is true\nIt was not mocking her the actress video audio we played mocked mostly for Trump didn't\n\nJust said we probably she she can't back up she cannot corroborate there isn't any cooperation\nWhat she said why is that not relevant\nWhy does that not matter\nWhy have we gotten to a point where any woman can come forward and accuse any man of anything and it's gospel\nAnd then be joined by a so called movement called me to wear all women can join ... can you imagine if there was something going on they can you imagine if men organized for the express purpose\nOf destroying women\nYou can't even imagine that can you\n\nYou can't even imagine the organized movement the male version of meat to\n\nWill rush or a million women or nor do there should we do well yeah that does happen but that's not the point this is not about even Bannon set it this is not just about sexual abuse this is about Raul power this is about female rage\nBecause of things that have happened to them the leftist women\nAnd they have organized all of these disorders into a giant political movement I'm just asking you to think can you ever can you envision\nA movement of men\nIf if such a group existed\nAnd Oprah Winfrey had invited the leader on her show he'd been thrown off for the first ten minutes and have been ridiculed and made up for the

this\nKnows even the Democrats are Democrats know all kinds of holes in her story\n\nTrump doing what he's doing provides a lot to cover for a lot of people as one of the many reasons why he's

about\nPolitics at all these people are actually struggling with personal psychological issues and projecting them under the world of politics mango I've been searching for that description for years I have no problem\nAdmitting that I was unable to put this together it's one of the rare moments I was unable to\nThis is exactly right we're dealing with people who have suffered some kinds of psychological disorder they've turned to politics\nFor the solution or the ribs bandages actually what they're looking for and they don't just want revenge against who ever did whatever to them they

Wall street movement to look at black lives matter I take take any left wing group that you want it's made up of people\nWho for some reason I think they have been unjustly mistreated by somebody\nAnd instead of dealing with that in their lives they enter politics and they demand that the Democratic party take up the cause of the Democratic party willingly has the Democratic party has become the party\nOf all of these disparate constituency groups\nWith their singular causes because the Democratic party realizes that they can combine all these things into a singular assault on the concept of America that America is responsible for what happened to these people\nThey capitalism is responsible that the power structure that the founding is responsible\nAnd so people with psychological disorders are being granted the status of normalcy\nAnd then the big donors come along and under write them and fund their efforts and they become political movements\nAnd then they become victims and then of course allows them to blame everybody for what has gone wrong in their lives and then they demand reciprocity or revenge or what have you and I can tend to do that most people in our side have no idea how to deal with\nThis no idea whatsoever so we ended up in debates about whether boys want to pretend to be girls so they can go on the girls' bathrooms and becomes legitimate sick\nIt ... it

them these women we do know that are out there watching this it did happen to them and by God somebody's going to pay for it in this case I mean capital that's how they're going to be heard\nRather than just deal with the specific incident that happened to them it's the same thing I think\nWith black lives matter or the NFL players kneeling\nFor the anthem a\nAll cops are bad every white cop as

said exactly\nWhat I said if I don't mind saying so she said Trump didn't mock anybody last night he simply recites did the facts\nAnd he said all of this can be laid at the feet of the Democrats they are to blame for this none of this needed to have happened in public they had ... forge email or in a letter ... way back in July they could have done everything that's been done to investigate her claim\nOff record behind the scenes nobody knowing about it but they didn't do that they waited\nTo use it as a Hail Mary\n\nShe dispute the idea that Trump mocked she said all he was doing was reciting the facts here it is again this is what the press the media everybody is out now ripping Trump claiming that he mocked Christine balls before\nAnd here it is that ... is is that they've been even the Connecticut Senator who himself has been targeted attacks from Trump the target of attention from the guy was flat out why or what do you mean the target\nOf attacks from Trump Trump didn't attack anybody told everybody who the guy is\nAnd here is Sarah Sanders from the press briefing just now exactly as I said she got a question from John Roberts\nAnd it was all about do you think that maybe the rosy for the other marking her like that because you get Collins and Murkowski it'd be the way they bowed means horrible you'd think the president for maybe should have not done it\nThe

B. I. D. O. J. people that were doing this\nAnd I think the objective of Christine balls before this whole thing not her specific maybe I look I think she's an activist and then on it but that's neither here to there the objective of this was to get Kavanaugh to withdraw his nomination\nOr to have Trump pull it\nNow that that hasn't happened this case is beginning to collapse you see stories all over the media about how all this so called evidence just isn't fair\nThey thought that the mere allegation that that Kevin I Would not sit there and let his life me destroyed like this they fought Trump wouldn't sit there\nAnd let his nominee need be destroyed like that because they think Trump's ego is such that he will not be allowed to be made to look bad because of what somebody else did or didn't do so they thought there would be a giant cave on this and there hasn't been so now it is panic and scramble time\nSo the zero in on flake\nAnd Trump couldn't hold it in any more last night at the rally he just on ... on the fact that Christie and Ford doesn't have any evidence is changing her story\nAnd the media is all over the place now saying well you know there's just many screwed it Murkowski and Collins they both think that Trump was horrible and they both now might not vote for Kavanaugh\nOkay well ladies and gentleman I told you some things yesterday but I'm sure people have forgotten but they're no different today than they were yesterday\nDemocrats senators in red states are in heat being ... reelection trouble in fact there was news yesterday polling data late polling that we may be looking at a red wave and the Senate not a blue wave\nIn North Dakota which Trump carried by thirty six points Heidi Heitkamp is in deep doo doo after having come out against capital of the latest poll taken after the\nDemocrats began smearing Kavanaugh but before that committee fiasco last week showed that Kevin Cramer the Republican opponent to hike camp has opened the ten point lead\nOver hype camp\nJoe Donnelly in Indiana and similarly nervous Claire McCaskill in Missouri is losing their her challenger Josh\nHawley Joe Manchin of West Virginia they've all been hoping that McConnell when wimp out\nOr that some Republican senators would wimp out and not vote for Kavanaugh so that they would be off the hook and not have to other words these three Heitkamp Donnelly market what's actually for Donnell a McCaskill mansion in Heitkamp have all been hoping\nThat Collins caves that maybe even McConnell what came and the Murkowski would cave and that flake will continue to flake and Cape\n\nBut in their states there's held the pay in their states people want Kavanaugh confirmed\nIn fact in North Dakota voters back Kavanaugh's sixty to twenty seven polling has been gun\nHeading the wrong way for Heidi Heitkamp so my point is it may not it may not matters or matter what happens to Collins and Murkowski but if they if they actually don't vote for Kavanaugh simply based on what Trump said last night\nWell that would be embarrassing for them\nNow\nSince Trump's on the record as questioning the veracity of Dr Ford I Want to share something with you I found today a power line\nScott Johnson one of the contributors a power line writes that a reader of theirs noted the changes in the timeline that Dr Ford herself presented the power and wind\nReader refers to himself calls himself an engineer with especially in data visualization\nAnd he made a graphic he created a chart in essence based on public sources based on the Washington Post and other legal documents and\nIt is the dates to varying dates the different dates of the ... event Dr ... says happened\n\nAnd the dates float she's not even consistent with the so the timeline of her story doesn't even add up\n\nThe reader notes the sudden story changed correlating with the time progression in the story date column I'll get that isn't just a second his question why the sudden change\nWithin a few weeks after July six of two thousand Eighteen the answer is that's when Dr Ford came into the Democrat or bits of Anna Eshoo Democrat California and Feinstein and their staffs\nAnd the highly partisan Democrat lawyer Deborah cats recommended by Feinstein right after that it forward and changed her story two more times in two months\nShe grew more specific after she began consulting with Democrat activists\nAs they conspired to destroy Kavanaugh\n\nSalt the charge here and try not to try to serve a difficult to convey but this is a text charge there is some\nUh some bars in this thing but it isn't title Dr Christine Blasey Ford's ever changing story multiple inconsistent stories of the date of the alleged incidents\nIn the therapists notes the incident is said to have occurred and the men the Nineteen eighties when she was in couples therapy\nThe therapist notes from when she was an individual therapy say that the story occur in not in the mid eighties but the late eighties in her text message to the Washington Post she's back to saying that it happened in\nThe mid eighties in her letter to Dianne Feinstein she said the incident happened in the early eighties\n\nIn the hand written statement at the time she took her polygraph high school summer in the eighties and early is crossed out\n\nEarly eighties could have been eighty eighty one\nIf the Senate Judiciary committee hearings she said it happened in the summer I'm Nineteen eighty two she had never said that before she had said mid eighties late eighties mid eighties early eighties highschool summer early eighties she specified summer Nineteen eighty to\nThese changes occur as she is in consultation with all these Democrat activists the staff of Feinstein and an Anna Eshoo and Deborah cats the lawyer\n\nAnd hurt changing story leaves her short on credibility put aside her emotional performance\n\nHer testimony reveals her as a witness was memories change at her convenience\n\nThe problem for Dr Ford is not that she doesn't remember everything if the everything she remembers changes that her convenience first Ford's testimony the assault occurred in the summer of eighty two when she would just
