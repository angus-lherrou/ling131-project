government they said members of the migrant\nCaribbean wanting to enter Mexico would have to request a visa through their consulate and bold immigration law they don't do that there'll be turned back wow oh about that maybe this is part of the year we got a trade deal with Mexico\nAll of a sudden all of a sudden uh Mexico wants to work with us this new president you know he's a socialist whatever they elected it it it is what it is a again I Can't see the snuff though a freaking wall would work well wouldn't it would work very well\nNow the guy that organized this whole situation is a a former Honduran a lawmaker\nAndy with three thousand people left Honduras cross the border illegally to Guatemala when Trump threatened to withdraw the money that we're going to cut off your funding all of a sudden Guatemalan officials sent their law enforcement out and they arrested this guy\nThey woke yeah [laughter] they arrested him and they said you got to stop doing this they said he didn't comply with Guatemalan immigration rules and he was deported back to Honduras is that racist\nWhy when we get called that for for doing that I mean come on and up as enough you exactly thank you very much but\nThe only thing you gotta worry about is China China is trying to get in there\nOr the Honduran president said last month's cuts in us support for Central America would only under the country's ability to stimulate the immigration basically we're bribing you give us your money you welcome China's growing diplomatic presence in the region as an opportunity that's one thing we need to watch more of them are rush continues every day\nFrom the region will studio your local area reason well darn calm day in the yard radio station [noise]\nHe hopes they didn't know I mean ... is President Trump suggesting Saudi Arabia's leaders shouldn't be guilty until proven innocent\nAnd the suspected murder of a journalist so we insists he's not giving cover to the king and the crown prince other although I just want to find out what's happening with turkey reportedly has recorded evidence we've asked for it if it exists expects a full report from the secretary of state she was on his way back to Washington\nBut they didn't care because Obama was hip they didn't care because Obama was cool they didn't care because Obama was wiping out the Republicans except the one Obama was enabling the Republicans wipe out the Democrats as we discussed in great detail yesterday\nAnd ... came to me today he said you know what you don't even know what you did yesterday I said well yeah I have a good memory and I I remember what I did know you don't know you don't remember what you did with your with your watch\nStory I said you mean about ... said yeah I said well what do you mean\nYou blew up\nThe entire intelligence community excuse or story\nOr having evidence of how your shoulders died they were out there saying that there were probably going to get proof of his interrogation and murder because it does apple watching here you come blowing up the whole thing pointing out how it's technologically not possible\nYou blow it up and you wouldn't even know it did I said well no because I wasn't aware of they were using the watch as that central ... elements\nProving their case but then when ... said this to me I have the pause I had to constantly and then I have to consider he has a point\nBut there was one of these things I wasn't contemplating or calculating at the time I just know it's impossible there is no way that Jamal ... watch could have recorded anything can happen to him and there's no way it could have\nTransmitted or transferred it\nTo his iPhone which was in the possession of his fiance in the car in the parking lot of the consulate there's just no way especially since apple has yet to activate L T\nE service\nOn watches sold them operated in Turkey so unless ... had entered the password for the consulate wife my network on his watch which I Know he didn't do\nBecause most people don't even know they have to do that most people don't even have a watch don't even know there watch will work on why\nMost people think they got to have the phone right next to watch in Ninety nine percent of the time it right\nBut if you're a watch learns a y find enough work like at your home that your phone logs into regularly on the phone to watch can access that I find that work independently of the phone if you're not\nClose together but\nOnly if you have entered that why ... works password into your\nI watch why five settings [laughter] I Know that this guy didn't do that [noise]\nI myself didn't learn you had to do this until a couple of years after I got my first one I mean that's how old's your a setting that it is anyway certainly says you just blew\nUp you blew up\nThe reason all these intelligence people were giving for knowing how he died you blow it up now they have to come up with something else\nI said well I was totally unaware he said well you should be aware because they're mad after [noise]\nNobody's most that they they say the show was recorded the event and have to record on watching their base will say wow that's cool and then you come along and say no it's not\nPossible another headline you probably have seen this so she added pressed Trump tells the a P he will not accept blame if the Republicans lose the house\nThe truth of the matter here is there are more stories today two or three more about the dissipating\nBlue wave including none other than they do I am\nA Democrat National Committee cheating and election rigging\nDown to Brazil\nWho strangely enough showed up on Fox that I should shut up a bill hammer down to Brazil did not go to CNN did they get rid of her because they found out she was sending answers to Hillary [noise]\nThat's right so see and I got her so Fox willingly open our mid to late ... had done in Brazil on an hammer was asking are all about the blue wave and other Democrats are planning to do this and that's well you know twenty days is a long time in ...\nBill and I don't scramble my eggs before my chickens hatch I said who is listening to hear Dan Rather I don't scramble my eggs until my chickens hatch\nShe said meaning there's so much she left it couldn't happen that we don't know that could affect the outcome here exactly my point the impact of\nThe election the events are they going to do that may not have happened including cabinet although although\nThere is even more survey data now that the Kavanaugh story was a one way benefit to the Republicans that he has not benefited the Democrats and the Democrats are seen as the angry party\nAnd that the Kavanaugh scenario as it played out benefited and continues to benefit Republican\nSo the media is getting a little worried the Elizabeth Warren focused on this thing blows up to the point they can't continue to carry the water for her it's dead\nBut rock Obama is refusing to hit the campaign trail the drive by Senate Democrats are stunning shocked where is Bert rock where is our savior they're asking for Iraq's nowhere because you know what ... knows he doesn't help people on the campaign trail\nYou think Obama's going to put his reputation on the line here the only way Obama wouldn't put his reputation on the line here started campaigning as if this blue wave weren't a\nDeadlock if the blue waiver at why are you still hear me [noise]\nOh yeah I got a ... couple of stories Democrats are upset whereas Obama they're asking where's Iraq at least villain Hillary are going on a stadium tour nobody wants that\nThey can't find mama I'm telling you Obama is not going to GO Campaign and the situation because of the blue wave is not a walk and that's the only way he would show up for Rocco mama doesn't help Democrats go take a look he doesn't have a coat tails\nIt's during Obama the Democrats lost those twelve hundred seats and in right he campaigned for Hillary\nTwo thousand sixteen remember how he did it\nDo you want a third term of mud brick if you want me since we continue you know do you vote for Hillary at what happened\nDid and all this Trump was it match it late at night Hillary Rodham running them and so\nHe's not there\nSo it's all falling apart and these two or three stories here on this on this dissipating blue wave and Donald Brazil's Enron now I'm not sure you know it's a long time twenty days\nSo the AP pulling out all the stops Trump tells a piece he won't accept blame a GOP loses this is not what he said and this is why\nTrump is in the media all day it's the only way he can counter the fake news in the lives that they\nTell about it here's how the story begins facing the prospect of bruising electoral defeat in congressional elections\nPresident Donald horse faced Trump said Tuesday that he will not accept the blame if his party loses control of the house in November and a wide ranging and is there any other kind of interview than wide ranging\nYou think that's not a cut and paste job in every media is how about a narrow scope interview we ever had one of those you\nKnow they're always in a wide ranging interview with three weeks before election day Trump dismiss suggestions that he might take responsibility as his predecessor did for midterm losses\nOr view of the outcome as a referendum on his presidency said no I think I'm helping people\nI don't believe anybody has ever had this kind of impact that's what he said he never stand it don't blame me\n\nAnd I read the transcript of the interview this is CNN's transcript of the AP interview and their headline\nTrump tells a piece he won't accept blame a GOP loses house ready [noise] three two one hey\nPete reporter okay so my question is if Republicans were to lose control of the house in November sixth or a couple of days later depending on how long it takes count the votes do you believe that you'll bear some responsibility for that no I think I'm helping people\nLook I'm forty eight and one in the primaries actually it's much higher than that because I endorsed a lot of people that were successful\nThat people don't even talk about but many of those for the aid is you know where people that had no chance in some cases we look at Florida you look at Donovan in Staten Island he was losing by ten points I endorsed him he won I can give you a long list of names look at Georgia governor\nMany many racist and I will say that we have a very big impact I don't believe anybody's ever had this kind of impact that I'm having they would say that in the old days and if you got the support of a president or if you got the supporters somebody it would be nice to have but it meant nothing zero like literally zero\nHave you with your performance it maybe because of all the hidden fees with these like this you may be doing a better job paying your broker than yourself my name is Jeff junior

to eight eight to look at this\nIs headlines I'm doomed bird knows Mahler ready to deliver key findings\nIn his Trump pro ... sources say\nDo they think that we are idiots\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller is expected to issue findings encore aspects of this Russia probe soon after the November midterm elections as he faces in and sit by and pressure\nTo produce more indictments or shut down his investigation according to chew as usual anonymous unnamed but we don't even know if they're alive U.S officials\n\nAnd I can imagine the pressure from Democrats to produce something anything it has got to be in tents\nEverything has blown up autumn folks Kavanaugh has blown up on them focus on us in her latest blew up on I'm Hillary blow up on 'em Stormy Daniels blew up on them every attempt in October surprise this year alone previous October's is blown up and now\nYou know they've thought all along the mother is going to get the goods on how Trump's Foley electrician by cheating including what the Russians\nAnd when this story broke that Muller is not going to deliver a key findings until after the election you man Jimmy anger and the frustration not so much with all the Democrats 'cause they know the they know the game here but\nThey're they're lured attack\nThe reins\nPsychologically screwed up\nBase\nIs probably beside itself because this is really ballgame for this is what they have been counting on they have been they bought it they drank the Kool Aid that Mueller has the goods that Trump treated with Russia mother has got it he's going to announce it trumps finished\nAfter them in terms wait a minute why\nNow there are two things about this books\nThe rules of this game which are going to be a baby here\nInclude that air report such as this from a special counsel will not be released\nWithin this close proximity to mid term elections it's an unstated rural India and say it it's an establishment or deep state rural and frankly I'm I'm surprised that it survived\nI Would not have been surprise surprise to me it's a it's a it's one of these unwritten rules of gentlemanly Washington procedure\nThat a bombshell report if any nature will be held until after the elections I thought that would blow up I thought that they would somehow find a way to release this thing or if not that leak it if it's got things in it that they like\nWhich the latter is still possible\n\nSo Mueller and his buddies in the drive by media\nRather than break the rules and released a report prior to the election they're going to do the next best thing\nThey're going to start talking about it all the time such as this story Muller ready to deliver key findings in his Trump pro\nSources say\nSo each day we're going to get references to the fact that mom Liz Dunn rollers wrapped up his mother is gonna be releasing at\nAny moment they're going to be talking about before\nThe midterms in hopes in the hopes this was what they're hoping they're hoping that the acknowledgement that Mueller's report is done\nWe'll be perceived by voters as the proof that Trump stole the election is imminent that\nIs what they're hoping they're hoping that you and well I don't think they think you're going to fall for it but they were hoping that the great on washed up near the ill educated under educated on educated miss educated are going to believe\nThat it's only a matter of time before this report is made public proving that Trump colluded with Russia and that well then he influenced the way they vote that means they will vote Democrat that's what the effort here is they\nWill create this cloud of suspicion this cloud of\nDanger\nThat port handles disaster for Trump they'll referenced this each day leading up to the mid term elections\n\nAnd you'll hear people in the media speculate oh it could be Trump will be removed after the midterms\nWouldn't blow it releases this report it could well be Trump's going to have to be removed to report might all of this is going to happen to one degree or another the second thing\nThis tells me is that Mahler himself is waiting to see who will be running Congress before he decides to really end\nThis because his report goes to Rosenstein who is technically is boss at the department of justice and to Congress and there is decided whether or not that it is made public\nIt was early warning systems or emergency services warning so we know we saw it immediately it was down and the only thing we can think of was that I blow it out with the energy level here of the content of the program ... booted it were up and running now\nSo the downtime was minimal\nSorry for that if it affected you here's Tom in Morris county New Jersey we had to the phones readings are great to have you here\nThanks rash thanks for doing everything that you do Russian I had two quick points a one on a a lifelong Democrat I was a teacher I just retired and I have been the biggest Trump supporter out there\nFor for my when does your support for Trump again\nDuring the campaign OK okay or the campaign one of the reasons that I see\nA during the primaries are during the day after he won the nomination\nPrimary primary okay against a seven anyway he um I became a\nTrump supporter one of the reasons was because she's got to be so good for the country is and I'm ashamed that Democrat my whole life\nThat these people aren't happy to see the country doing well that's what amazes me the most I mean I was always brought up the Democrats for fair and my dad was a Democrat my mom and that they sort of the country\nWhat you thought the Democrats for for the little guy looking out for the little guy and try to help the little guy make it economically and overcome obstacles Republicans put it in a way\nExactly and so so I'm very proud to be a Trump supporter but I'm about to pack it in I'm going to tell you what frustration is so high right now for not only my shelf people in the neighborhood because you said it before with Stuart gardening\nUm he said the Trump ... and he says he's the only reason the only way I can get my message out well his choice to good but not that many people really hear it and I can't understand why he does not address the nation I don't understand ...\nWait a minute when you say when you say package you mean you're about to abandon from\nThat advantage Trump but I'm going to really losing a lot of energy and frustration I really am because so many people don't know the good things that are happening they're not gonna learn preaching to the choir which treat tweak most of the time and the press conference they ... they skew anyway\nSo if he addresses the nation and he should it should be proud of what he's done\nThe greatest time economically that I can never remembered I'm sixty six\nI can never remember anything like this\nIt is amazing in it but you know you said something here very by I Want to I Want to circle back to something you said\nAn observation you've made of the modern day Democratic Party that they don't seem to be happy right now the country's doing well they don't they don't seem to be encouraged or want to be included in it they don't want to even try to get some of the credit\nFor the country doing well and that shocked you write\n[noise] you know not any more at a ... year and a half ago but I'm starting to realize they don't care about the country\nThey they really don't care about social issues they care about taking this guy down who I think the strongest guy since Reagan I've ever seen or we can take the bullets day after day I mean he's just one guy\nYour frustration is noted and I think it's shared by a lot of people what you're you're really\nYou you made it sound like your frustration is with us from because he won't do a national address and try to reach people that his tweets don't rich or\nAudience that he that he doesn't reach but your real frustration of the U.S is with a news media and many people in the same boat who were doing their best to hide all of that and make sure people don't know it's\nIt's a joke amazed the frustration I've never been so frustrated in my life I Can't do it ... me it was me out of the country so it was so well and so many people are going to go out and vote and they have no idea here newscast and they\nWhy do you think you are well why do you think you're one of the few people that led realize how great the country's doing if you think about why why do you think more people have\nListed do you read\nThem but the economy you you said you've never seen anything like this in your life you don't need me to tell you the economy's doing well you see this on your own\nThree point seven unemployment are you kidding me with all the jobs and all of them a wage is going up on my machine aging\nMy point is I think you can be a little confidence that you're not alone in seeing all\nOf this and that more people are aware of it than you may know and of course you could be a it'd be understandable if you fear people don't know because the media is doing everything they can hide it or even worse lie about it\nAnd you are of the impression that most people get their knowledge information from the media but\nI think what happened with a lizard Warren here they could not carry this October surprise they could not cover for the fact that she's bogus they used to be able to do that they're not able to there's a reason for that and I think it's also helping get the truth out about Trump's achievement\nWe take a break for that has to have to say Russia's probably ... being met work\nPretty smart rushing is on [noise]\nAll right to all of our listeners out there who are aged Seventy five are older and only one hundred thousand dollar life

missing after visiting the Saudi conflict turkey accuses the Saudis\nAnd it's amazing how honest it is about what journalism is now this\nIs not about contemporary events there is nothing in this series about Donald Trump or Theresa May or anything current in either country it is a modern era I'm generic piece in other words the storylines or all fictional all made up\nAnd it is\nAbout two competing newspaper is one of them's big one of them small one of them is very serious take them to feel very seriously don't do tabloid anything [noise]\nDon't focus on celebrities and the other one is nothing more than pure trash and it's the one that wins it's the one with the biggest building is the one with the more employees they're reporters are stars and so forth but you know what this does it's flat out amazing how honest it is\nIn terms of what people who do journalism think its purpose is destroying people both of these papers in this in this miniseries\nEnd up targeting the same targets the same powerful people some of them in government some of them out or some of them not but it makes it clear that journalists think their job is to destroy the\nBig people powerful people rich people there obviously\nHas to be something they're doing with breaking the rules in the gun suits breaking the rules there has to be something air mistreating people they are sexually abusing people they are stealing from the public Dole they're doing something and the purpose of journalists ... call 'em out and and and ruin them\nWhich many many years ago when I first began to encounter the media as a target\nI was never I had a little taste of it when I was in Sacramento there were a couple of reporters at that paper that that that that have me and their crosshairs simply it was it was liberal versus conservatism\nBut I mean I I didn't really get a full dose of it until this program started and I remember sitting talking to us and people about it and they said you have to understand what journalism is\nI said you mean the bias well there's that but that it's it's it's more than that ... it's about ruining people it's about targeting and destroying people how do you think resumes are built\nJournalists in these little medium size markets are small markets don't target somebody and they if they run a profile or or a a a piece on somebody\nThat can be made to look accurate that nails them as guilty of this transgression or that transgression particularly against the little people in that report or is going to get noticed and that's how that's how that reporter climbed a ladder if you go back to the early days of sixty minutes it was all about that\n\nAnd it remains so today it's just it's it's evolved\nTo adapt to the current climate which the only person they want to destroy the day now is Donald Trump and any Republican who gets in the way like Kevin on it's all about destroying people the thing about this series is it makes no bones about it\nI I don't recognize the names of the writer\nOr writers I don't recognize the stars I've never seen them in and things for I don't recognize the names of the producers\nAnd I haven't taken the time to Google any of them but I watched\nThis I've seen two episodes so far out of the ...\nAnd I catch myself my mouth is wide open it's agape a couple of times watching this thing at how brave similarly on is this is one of the the editor the head honcho of the of the tabloid paper is one of the most is fixable human beings I've ever seen portrayed\nWho is not set up as a criminal who's not establish he's he's just two years and he is totally on affected\nBy life to him everybody's a bad guy you just have to find out why\nHis favorite his philosophy in life\nAnd the way he guides his journalists is the world has no solutions I'll stop what what if that were your world view of the world has no solutions\nAnd he's telling you it's not your job to fix things it's not your job to feel bad about who you destroy it's not your job to try to solve problems because the world is not about solutions it's your job to sell this paper it's your job he one episode\n\nWent to great lengths to show how this just sleaze editor\nWho has some kind of a secret relationship with the prime minister the u._k. no no no no not sexual just up there that they have some kind of a relationship not pretending like each other but they owe each other from way back before the series began\nAnd the editor\nRanges a cover story about appear to file and then puts a picture of the prime minister on the cover with his his picture only an inch away from the word ... to file\nYet the story is not about the prime minister being Pete if I was about somebody else for the prime minister is limited and outrage calls the guy in in the editor says you don't run me you don't control me and it was a mistake I I'm Sorry well then you wish you would have ... I'm not apologizing for anything you don't like it went with it\nAnd the private ... I didn't want to do the story in the first place I didn't want to pursue the pictures and the editor says you did I mean this guy has no empathy or feeling for anybody\nHe doesn't [noise] it's just it's ... it's it's perfect if the kind of personality you wouldn't have to be if your job is destroying people\nNo conscience the belief\nThat everybody is law that everybody's a dirt bag that everybody is a rapper ... and at some point their time to be called out is going to happen\n\nNobody is decent nobody's white [laughter]\nIt's amazing how this in the eyes of a journalist an editor\n\nNow I imagine real journalists are going to look at this thing some of them are going to marvel at it and think it's wonderful others are going to have it because it's\nIt exposes too much uh\nPeople who have never had encounters with reporters have never been targets I don't know how they're going to react to it other than the entertained by it it it starts kind of slow but it picks up speed\nOr\nMany of the primary characters are women\nThe competing editor of the clean paper or the above board and paper is a woman who gets out smarter than tricked into not publishing one day because she can't confirm the pita file story while the other paper puts it on the cover having confirmed it\nBecause the editor at the other members doesn't care whether it's true or not wondering calls that got us will be the ... just get it up there and get it on the news stands whereas the female editor didn't have the guts\nTo run it and sell the paper doesn't rot and I'm thinking they obviously are not worried about the me too movement here ever put this thing together so the name of this press\nI have no idea it's it's I think it just completed airing 'cause I've got all six of them so I just competed completed it's um it's runs cycle in the u._k. which means it's going to be on Netflix Amazon Prime wherever I don't know where it's going to be but it won't be long\nTo stop to hide their agenda of identity politics until they get into power she's telling you guys have got to put the masks back on your Democrats have got to read camouflage yourself she's warning the Democrats to hide the identity politics agenda\nOf course we should fight massage and racism whether or not it's politically expedient these are important but the country faces lots of important moral questions Democrats can't attribute without first getting into power\nShe's saying nice to have a shot up stop your your your everything's backfiring until you Democrats shut\nLooking brand is coming over and smack dab in the middle of London they\nHave their\nFriends are also voice\nIs going to be arrested two\nOr three and seven Ninety two sons\nMost stimulating talk now with the saving forecast taco bar and say momma just Bob smiling\nForecast for today is selling more continued saving up to forty percent on all your favorite ... brought up like a big ones of savings up to twenty dollars in any of the sales tax is continuing because they're on the reservation what's the five day for gas more savings up to another five dollars with a coupon for backup ought to zone dot com\nAlso a tobacco bar Caesar complete line of the cigarettes right now get a complete bake unit including three oils and two thirty milligram bottles of juice or jazz sixty dollars while supplies\nLab savings over forty for saving the funny thing is the sales that savings up to five dollar bonus of orange juice on dot com handy\nActual weather forecasts\nFoster hey I'm a save all it is not a meteorologist Arizona\nBack of our where today's forecast for no kind of way just south of all and we can't tobacco bar in Tucson dot com\nSee no del sol sol by empathy or Tucson premier entertainment venue where the hottest concerts all summer long the unmistakable country sounds of rascal comes to the casino novels operating theaters Thursday November first get your tickets now what to do no soul dot com casino del sol the soul of Tucson\nIt's officially fall and that ... many homeowners begin home improvement project and those plants should include kinetic awash\nConnecticut protects your plumbing appliances in pictures it can help your water heater last longer than work more efficiently saving you money and lose flurries it makes your skin dry ...

pretty good or not well let's play the game what's hypothetically say that that pressure is brought to bear it's not up the Mahler it's going to be up to Rosenstein and the president to an extent Congress that's who gets the report what yes\n[laughter]\nI Can't see this happening but what if\nThere is a lot of pressure brought to bear on mother to rebuild this release it are are Rosenstein whoever\nAnd somebody like Trump says well okay All right if you want to see it go and they release it and there's nothing that indicates Trump what do you think that does the Democrat turned out\n\nA couple of weeks from now three ... what do you think that does that's why I don't think there's anything in here on collusion\nI don't think there's anything in it on obstruction because folks at one

unilaterally suggest to you that it couldn't it couldn't happen a and particularly the areas you mentioned they would love to be able to discredit Trump's tax cuts they would love to be able uh to\nDiscredit a whole bunch of like the tariffs and what it's doing to trade the problem is\nReality reality on the ground if the if if if the if the numbers are a ring to that extent it just isn't gonna jibe with reality\nAnd it's it's it wouldn't be I don't think nearly as effective as something as personal but I think you have to you have to look at the history of these October surprises they've tried October surprise in October they've tried them in September\nThey've thrown everything they've got at Trump including during the campaign the Access Hollywood video and that didn't work\nNow he's out they're calling the orange star who by the way is a back stabbing black mailing double crossing porn star he's out there combing her horse race and there are shutters\nThat drive by me the s U D D who my gun presidents doesn't is you know what I find interesting about this\nAll of these so called ... and virtue on the left we're wandering perversion has become normal in their

doubled crossing\nBack\nStabbing woman who has tried to destroy the guy with her third rate lawyer\nShe's not just an innocent ordinary everyday woman the Trump decided to call one name\nShe is a woman who attempted to him but for these liberal Democrats these people in the media to act like\nPeople don't talk to sweat presidents don't come on\nPeople talk this way this is what ... what I resent about this the idea that they are cleaning shores the wind driven snow and they don't think this way they don't talk this way what an absolute crock simply look at the things they say about us during the course of your average political day\nFrom your Hitler through your Nazis to Europe this or that they make fun of people's appearances they make fun of people I mean they're they're comedy has become literally hate\n\nAnd then they act like one of the greatest social trends question your history of humanity has occurred when Donald Trump uses the term horror\nSpace or when he did not mark balls the Ford but simply ... feet in\nThe truth about her allegations I just I just find it to just a little bit hollow as low take your pick ticket that take your pick any left wing or on media\nGriping about Trump's using the word horse race and ask yourself if that media reporter\nNever talk that way and the answer but Russia these people are president and he is and this has been nice the dignity the presidency\nWell I Know they look at it and think of it that way my point is they\nCan try all day long that's not going to separate Trump from his voters that some of his voters Mike Shanahan that\nThere's so much good going on here and focus on that don't don't need to distract every body with that stuff\nBut you do\nThere are also going to they're not going to give up trying to link Donald Trump to the murder\nOf the uh of the journalists is in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul\nA dramatic a shaggy they're still working on that\nBut I think they're frustrated to no end that nothing they do works\nAnd now I have a story I have to print I haven't had the chance to printed yep just cleared the transom here uh it's about Trump's approval numbers are probably much better and much higher than anybody on the left and the media wants to admit\nThe gold rush is on\nAnd as you miss work if you're concerned about your heart health or know someone who it then you can

radios inside the studio by cat check it out now\nTalk I Gerald Lewis Jessica Vaughan Center for Immigration Studies thoughts about what is going to have to stop that migrate caravan from getting here what Trump can do as well interviews at my age ... dot com\nI'm Persian ski\nAnd she\nHas now gone back to the twenty Fifth Amendment we we need to use a twenty of a member to get rid of\nTrump he's not he's not that there's ... ... ... not\nThat she didn't know anything about the event she couldn't tell anybody where it happened when it happened she couldn't describe the house where it was she wasn't even sure of the year much less of the month she\nIdentified for people over there all four said they were not there she did not have any answer for how she got home what she said to the person she first met after this happened none of it all Trump dead was remind everybody of this or actually inform them because the drive buys have not\nAnd that then cause the meat eater run the story of Donald Trump saying this because they hadn't been hiding it\nThey hid it because it was not helpful to their ... their claws which was getting rid of Cavanaugh\nI mean it's a central part of the story that the person making the charge doesn't have any evidence places people there who deny there were there and can't remember anything about the event other than she had one beer the media not reporting that Trump does the media falls for the trap and reports\nOver and over Trump saying it while accusing him of mocking her mocking is not what he did\nTo my career he would've had to attempt to impersonate her and he did not try to impersonator he simply reminded everybody and real world language that she had no evidence and it was the turning point\nIn the outcome of those hearings make no mistake\nOnce Trump did that and caused the media to end up reporting what they had been ignoring\nThan\nA lot of support that was their instinctively fur balls the Ford man is jihad no evidence there was nothing to support\n\nPeople with common sense there was nothing to you you believe her yeah the basis of what well it does have one but she doesn't know when she doesn't know where the poor people she said there were there to say they weren't\nShe became impossible to support and defend other than by partisans and that was the turning point in Kavanaugh came in and of course he has his re testimony has re appearance was a subtle factor now the whole thing is happening again\n\nThe story was that the porn stars defamation lawsuit a Trump got thrown out\nIt was a nothing burger\nForum on ... drive by media reported that Stormy Daniels and the creepy lawyer that she hired ever not we're going to destroy Donald Trump they were going to prove that Trump had violated campaign finance laws to remember all of this\nAnd there was Michael Cohen in the mix and he'd paid are often Michael Cohen's slipped and has now become a Democrat and he's offering to testify against Trump that's how was he is\nBut the media\nInvested a lot in stormy Daniels' where ever she went to perform whatever poll she was slithering around that Dr buyers were they're making a hero out of her\n\nStormy Daniels became a cause ... even before balls the Ford did\nAnd then that fell apart a judge in Los Angeles threw out the porn stars defamation lawsuit of Trump claiming it was bogus it had no merit so in one decision\nThe porn stars entire reason for existing vanished political and so did the lifespan of her creepy porn warrior who had already shot himself in a couple of feet by bringing forth some charges it that Kavanaugh had arranged gang rapes in high school and college\nSo all Trump did\nBy calling her horse face was call attention to a news story that the drive by as we're trying to ignore the news story was her lawsuit was drunk Trump was not guilty of whatever she was ... he had done to her\nIn fact\nShe had been found guilty the judge it through the lawsuit out demanded that she pay his legal fees\nI said this makes Trump a big winner again here the the the prostitute porn star is paying\nTrump who among us can arrange it that way folks but Donald Trump can\n\nThey also ignoring that part of it\nIgnoring that the stripper porn star and been ordered to pay Trump's legal fees but when Trump called her horse race in a tweet all of the media were forced to run the story of his victory so you can sit there and say that Trump is embarrassing\nGuys they were just stopped talking about people that way it makes it so hard to\nRemember what I told you about the white Trump operates and pacing how he his original take or opinion on any issue might make you think he's selling out but he gets that first take\nOn the record media says well if you were reasonable you said that Dr Balt the Ford was very credible very compelling shakedowns surprising then after the passage of time with Dr balls the Ford clearly has no evidence Trump says you've got no evidence and here's the evidence that she knows no evidence\nBlah blah by the Trump gets his news covered\nThe media was not reporting this lawsuit a bit from the media was not reporting and she had to pay his legal fees the media was not reporting of being\nTrump win\nAnd remember what was this woman and her lawyer we're trying to ruin\nTrump campaign finance violations and all that so you can say you may not like the methodology but it ends up working as an email friend of mine said this is a genius\nAt work [noise] trust Trump\nYou me too but he thinks it calling or horse race was genius somebody [noise] you know an email that I have here let's see what the Democrats try this headline this is\nFrom the hill dot com Democrats damp down hopes for climate change agenda what what is this uh\nDemocrats are on the likely to pursue a major climate change legislation even if they win the house majority despite a growing body of evidence suggesting time is running out to address the\nIssue is represent a shift in strict the jury for when House Democrats last control the chamber in two thousand nine they they're not going to pursue it even if they win the house majority they are not going to pursue it's\nA wonder why\nCould it be that in the span of forty years we've now have the force ten year warning\n\nAt least the fourth warning that we only have ten years and in the midst of these forty years we've also had reports that we're beyond the point of no return that there really is nothing we can do\nThey've tried everything now they're even saying that climate change is going to destroy beer and there's nothing we can do you know why is\nClimate change going to ruin barley it's going to ruin the ability to harvest and grow barely barely won the primary ingredients and beer\nBad news for judge Kevin alright\nInvestors business daily Trump's approval rating is better than you think\nSome pull quotes as a matter of fact Trump's approval rating is now higher than are tied with three of the past six presidents at the same point in their first terms he is currently tied with Obama at forty four percent\nIs above Clinton at forty one percent Reagan at forty two percent at this time in his presidency\nBut there's a broader point here\nDemocrats in the media keep describing Trump as a hugely divisive figure but the polls showed that his approval is starting to wind up with previous presidents and what's more Trump's low numbers are almost entirely because Democrats are universally opposed to one\nAnother poll quote\nAt this point than Obama's presidency ten percent of Republicans approved for the job he was doing\nAnd that was after the failed pork you it was it was\nAfter the signing of Obamacare in after the signing of Dodd Frank another policies highly antagonistic\nTo Republicans Trump on the other hand gets her approval\nFrom only five percent of Republicans and that's where it's been throughout his presidency so Republicans in other words were far more forgiving of Obama the Democrats have been if Trump\nSo who actually is being divisive\nTrump with a GOP or the Democrats who will hate Trump no matter what he does I have to think that the drive by are fully\nAware of this may not want to admit that Trump's approval numbers really much stronger than it's being reported and is a much higher here's that story certainly you didn't believe it Daily Beast Democrats fear Obama going soft for the midterms\nI kind of ... when I look at vote turnout a in an election like this I I like to assume that's why I asked me why why to assume that the audience at this program\nIs fully aware and up just like you are I think your typical of people in this audience there are here because you're concerned you here because you're educated than warm and involved and invest in in an outcome\nI most of the people in this in this audience are exceptions obviously\nSo I I I worry that it's somehow talking down to people to\nNot remember you're talking about their vote you know you don't want the Democrats running out there are people already know that other words I'm looking for\nDifferent ways to accomplish the same motivation\nTime have

listen to the interview on my fantasy dot com [noise]\nPleases jobs and I have a\nQuestion I continue to get emails about the [noise]\nThe so called Washington Post journalist or jump off you're showing\nMy question is are really rather simple one where was this concern for our ambassador and three other men brutally murdered in Benghazi\nSomebody explain that to me you realize how much attention is being paid\nTo what\nHas it been confirmed if something happened since this program ... has it been confirmed that ... was murdered by the Fifteen hit men from Saudi Arabia hasn't been confirmed not confirmed so it's still Whiteclay or thought to end the story is that\nTook him seven minutes to die that they dismembered him alive at some point gave him drugs to knock him out and then they listen to music\nWhile they did all of this\nAnd of course until I blew up the theory and at the apple watch contain the evidence they ever going to try to make it look like\nProof existed in the form of audio recordings to show ... knew what was in store for him and he had an ego is apple watching the recording this stuff and uh somehow is iPhone that very very unlikely\nBecause of it being technologically impossible barring a ... just only two exceptions that I have a tough time believing she'll be even knew to do or how to do but\n\nAll of this concern and remember\nHillary Clinton when repeated questions were asked about how in the world for Americans were allowed to be murdered in Ben gossipy\nWith no assistance and Hillary Clinton's reaction what difference does it make now she said in frustration is is anybody see\nA a disparity here in proportion\nNow of course we all understand why the Democrats seriously believe they have a way of blaming Donald Trump for this CNN all afternoon has tried to make it look like the Trump knows the Saudis did it and is trying to provide them cover\nThat's it's despicable graphics that they were using to try to make that case\nBut I think there's a lot of a proportionality missing here and again I don't think the media realizes how obvious\nThere's subterfuge is that people now anyway you know every uh every home has a a front door with a lock on it Dr balls the Fords home had two ... two doors did you know that\n\nDr balls the foreign had two doors that something to do with a claustrophobia and fear\n\nAnd handed over to Google employees reading this\n\nWait a minute it was a five hundred square foot plates and two front door is it the\n\nOther Google employees going back and they have their own separate front door oh well that's that's a big difference than meeting at four claustrophobia and ... D like being afraid Kevin always going to show up at any moment in the last thirty five years well anyway\nEverybody has a home with a front door and the lock on most people have one front door for some people that's all they need to feel secure for others securing every door in every\nWindow is what's important to feel safe in the side now how you go about securing all of those entry points now that's another thing early home security system providers gave you one solution and it was his name was fairly expensive\nAnd then simply say palm security came along offering a solution to protect all of your doors and windows in the most effective ways for far less money\nThey get that done by using states will be our technology and the systems they make\nThey use wife ... folks to connect all of these components together the sensors on the doors and windows the age the cameras the motion detectors the glass break sensors all of that they communicate with the primary base station in the house my wife I certainly wires to run that is so\nSo important so crucial in making this\nLast complex less of a problem and it makes it much harder to get I mean cutting wires is easy but disrupting wife I connections takes a little bit more work\nThey use ... and they use computer chips in their centers in an detectors in the age the cameras that come with every system that sends signals when doors and windows are open\nAnd if you arm just simply save system as you've left the home you get a notification when there is activity I e somebody tried to break in or are there is a fire or something simply safe pays attention to every detail of their home security system so that when you do the installation it's\nSimple and actually fun to do when you finish\nYou will have an intimate knowledge and awareness of your system it comes pre tested in pre configured\nAll you have to do is installed or get somebody there to help me as no big deal you can do it in less than an hour but don't let that make you believe it's not serious it's deadly serious it is serious serious it is just as effective in justice comprehensive as any other security system you would get that uses wires", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Tucson", "day": "17"}
