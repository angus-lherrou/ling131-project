he was I'm a firm evidence\nTour a and a member of the Green Party but what I don't see anything on\nHere that says he is all there it is about political party Green Party birthday march seventeenth Nineteen sixty two\nAh income information pending what is this site can't tell what this site is it it's um [noise]\nAnyway identifies it as a member of the Green Party uh he's got pictures of Trump and he's got GOP stickers all over the of the window so law enforcement has a press conference slated for two thirty this afternoon they don't know if any more pipe bombs out there or if he has sent everything\nThat he had the latest to recipients by the way our Cory Booker the New Jersey senator and the former director of national intelligence James Clapper ruby recipients that I also saw Fox News is reporting that law enforcement is telling them\nThat some of these bombs none of them have gone off but some of them have been detonated because they were judged to be so unstable that they couldn't even transport them to a Quantico, Virginia FBI lab\nTo study them they had to go ahead and detonate of a blow 'em up because they might have blown up in transit although none of them have gone off\nNone of them if they were ever intended to then there's still a lot that isn't known here and a lot of people are rushing in trying to fill in blanks and this is typical during events like this ... everybody becomes a journalist and everybody wants to have the first\nNews on every everybody wants to be the first to learn something the first to pass it on\nAnd on to law enforcement says what they're going to say about this at all is a speculation our law enforcement so I'm definitely going to be leaking between now and two thirty to various members of the media that they light trust or what have you\nSo there's going to be a daily use of information on what happens during these periods is that the first thing people here is what they ended up tending to believe\nThe first thing they hear the first thing they see is that it makes the first impression\nAnd that is why during this whole week some of the some people have been concerned that the media without waiting just went ahead and signed this guy as a pro Trump anti Democrat guy\nIdentifying the people as Trump targets they make America Again a great again bomber the mad go bomber\nBecause it creates first impressions it it created this worldwide presumption that the bomber was an angry Trump supporter\nSet up at the people Trump is that this is this is the uh [noise]\nThe narrative if you will drive by as attempted to establish before anybody knew anything because everybody knows first impressions are\nWhat\nAre matters of same thing is happening\nToday with the economic news we have the GDP report today the growth was three and a half percent but that's below what was expected\nAnd so the drive by reporting that economic activity has slowed down it's not nearly what people thought it would be trying to create that first impression among the people in their audiences that there's something wrong with the economy\nThere's nothing wrong with three point five percent growth the reason why the economic\nGrowth is it didn't come into the at the British in three point eight to four percent is guess what the tech stock sector is taking a bath\nSpecifically Google also notice alphabet and Amazon have reported earnings and every dish stunningly disappointing\nAnd it's causing sell off it's causing a big problem on the NASDAQ which is where many of the tech stocks report where they listed in\nAnd saw the same thing is happening now and with intensity because we are now at a period of time or less than two weeks before the midterm elections and what better time for the drive by us to report that the economy is slowing down\nEven though it's shocking to ride along jobs are still being created everything's my three and a half percent growth nobody ever saw that in the last eight years of Iraq Obama we didn't see that much before Obama when he had very often this economy still struggling right along with the Dr wiser reporting that day\nThat it has slowed down there could be trouble on the horizon and then there is this from the media light\nA headline Trump unfortunately the bombs stuff is slowing Republican momentum going into the midterms\nAre we talking about this yesterday this was a I've thought a left wing media narrative that had been created\nBut apparently Trump has signed onto what President Trump today complained about the pipe bombs being sent a prominent Democrats lamenting the scare has distracted\nFrom news about the midterms and even slowed Republican momentum\nRepublicans are doing so well in early voting and at the polls and now there's bombs stuff happens in the momentum greatly slows news is not talking politics very unfortunate\nYou know what's going on Republicans to go out and vote that this week\nI did my own little informal survey and I asked people if they've seen any signs of slow down or loss of momentum or all that and then nobody nobody has\nYou don't like this is I sadly I Wish it wasn't the case I think Trump is half right here I think it is a reflection of what's in the news\nAnd what is it and\nIf there isn't any news about the Republican early voting dwarfing Democrats than the perception is that it isn't happening or and then it just stopped\nOr it's not newsworthy enough anymore so the bomb thing has come along I mean it dwarfs the caravan that news stopped being reported but more and more importantly\nAll of the news about the heavy Republican turnout dwarfing the Democrats late Republicans pulling ... I've got a pool here today from strategic good strategic strategic [noise]\nIn the poll run their Santa's has pulled ahead of Andrew Gillum by a point it's a respectable poll it's a big deal\nAnd so ... this is the kind of news that is not being widely reported and therefore people in Florida are not being told this and it's one of these a sad reality is that the daily reporting the news\nDoes affect what people think their perceptions of ah of what's going on and I think that's what Trump is ah is talking about here complains that bombs have slowed Republican momentum\nUm\nIn fact here is not as I say it's a media story I don't know who wrote this but listen to the next paragraph Trump's tweet while somewhat nonsensical\nSuggests the president might be falling from a false flag theory being pushed on Fox News this week that the bombs or a Democrat operation to get out the vote for the midterms\nIs sweet comes moments after police intercepted two more devices sent to Cory Booker and James Clapper what Trump's tweet well somewhat nonsensical\nReally help to know who wrote this uh suggest the president might be falling for the false flag theory being pushed on Fox News the bombs or a Democrat operation to get out the vote\nIf the bombs or a false flag operation they're designed to do to cover up any news or anything good maybe have favorable the Republicans at Trump for being reported\n\nIt's a false flag operation it'd be designed to to um make it make it appear like the Democrats are\nBehind it it will just have to let time unfold on this is a little frustrating to try to get all this information coming in and not be able to share it with you because I Can't confirm it myself and I don't want to be out on a limb so we're just going to be patient was just going to wait and as I learn things that I can personally confirming vouch for\nAnd what have no trouble explaining if somebody question about that I'll pass subtlety let's take a brief time out we will continue after\nThe rash of Mickey I mean we're\nIn Russia is on\nThere is still a college in America where students can debate ideas openly and honestly where they can work with their professors and respectful ways it's Hillsdale College every student in Hillsdale lives by an honor code and it's not all listed do's and don'ts it's a simple pledge and this is it\nA Hillsdale College student as honorable and conduct honest in word envied due to fall in studying service and respectful of the rights of others through education the student rises to solve government\nI mean the Green Party would be all in on CNN the Green Party would be all in on a\nA bunch of things that are anti Trump so some of this that we are being sent and seeing doesn't make a whole lot of sense so we're still in the process of trying to track it all down\nNow in the midst of this there continues to be news reported about the mid term elections and there's some other news that was reported the discussion about the bombs before today when people were told the identity of the bomber and showing pictures of the bombers a van\nA down in in uh in plantation Florida and one of the\nThings that I had intended to share with you today as Chuck Todd was on the MSNBC yesterday we every audio I lifted the ban on MSNBC to report this that Chuck\nTodd said that he was afraid the Russians were behind this scare\nChuck Todd said that he theory the Russians couldn't be responsible for the mail bomb scare of that has targeted top officials in the Democratic party as well as CNN and Robert De Niro quote I have this fear it could be some Russian operation out there are designed to do what's happening\nNow and that is so all of this confusion\nChuck Todd added that we shouldn't rule out the possibility the Russians are behind this and the mail bomb scare is dividing the country and that's what its purpose is this is on his show called meet the press daily\nNow I the reason that I [laughter] the Russians what is not worry about that is that here you have the moderator of meet the press F Chuck Todd\nWho don't believe despite the fact that we haven't seen any evidence despite the fact that there isn't any evidence Chuck Todd still operating under the belief the Russians stole the two thousand sixty electric\nSomebody whose mind may be closed and made up about something that did not happen and ... and in fact the exact opposite is what happens is we all know Hillary and her team\nWere doing the colluded with Russia but that doesn't matter the director of the moderator of meet the press like the Russians could be behind it because it just struck tons of view of this whole thing was bound and determined to help\nA President Trump which means the Russians would have been just\nThe way people think amazes me is always the\nHealing comfort zone and he smiles any grave touch for kids things all three families with children with special medical mean hospital treatments can be scary\nEspecially French homey any great for kids from from the front room inhaling therapies in community programs reach over thirty five hundred people actually providing the minimizing offering free of charge\nMore about how you can help in any way to catch that no I work on my own three ... sixty five\n\nYear two thousand [noise] George Michael paid one point five million pounds\nPer the Steinway piano which John Lennon road imagine George said I Know that when my fingers touch the keys of that same way I Will feel truly blessed and partying with my money has never been much of a problem just asked my

[noise]\nOkay so\nThat is the sound of\nAn identifiable website identify this guy in the Green Party being ripped to shreds [noise] I'm\nNot be because of the stickers all over ... stylish white van the a drive by media are concluding that he has a right winger\n\nHe's a right winger and he is a Trump loving a deranged individual\nNow according to Florida voting records he has a registered Republican full name says are ... and his party affiliation as of march for two thousand sixteen was Republican Party\nAnd he's a been active as a registered Republican since March fourth of two thousand sixteen um and as his voters status is um\nIs also active now that information is from heavy dot com to claim they got it from the Florida voters search site which they might have done but they would have had to know his birthday to get it\nOr we don't know his birthday so we can't double check the claim here so this this stuff\nJust happened to happen right as the program is beginning I have a lot of data you know is a highly and from what drove a major media figure I have all kinds of people trying to influence me with what I'm saying flooding lose on with things they want me to repeat\nA now say oc is a Philippine name the guy's family seems to have come from the Philippines but they're calling him Native American\nI\nAnd again flooding the zone here with the with the information for you that as as Irish Steve it's a and whether or not any of this stuff is true keep in mind that what's making first impressions\nAgain I Can't emphasize that uh [noise] enough\nThere Dr buys have stopped their coverage and haven't joined President Trump there is in fact let's listen to it a little bit of ourselves he's got a big powwow headed up there\nYeah I did for the media thank you very much uh I thought I'd do that and uh we feel very strongly a again congratulations to all law enforcement we have the best in the world and they just showed and thank you very much\nFor young black leaders of the White House [noise]\nNow to the subject at hand [noise]\nTo be with so many brilliant and that's what you are greedy and courageous alright yeah they can proud of them are so much\nAbout it is because he's not getting on to this the the real meaning the reason for the meeting there which is unprecedented by the way up state leadership committee or hundreds of young black leaders are in America that are gathering at the White House has been a lot of ... about this\nI guess the president made and acknowledgement to law enforcement for their rate work and tracking down the bomber and bringing that story to a to a conclusion\nAnd we were rolling on it and whatever he said that was relevant we will pass that I don't say I Want to grab the phones get started berets open on friday and I know you want to weigh in on this\nAh so are we going to start a just to do we have the ability you don't have the ability to give them okay Jimmy in Omaha Nebraska we're experimenting with a bunch of things here today folks bear with us Jimmy and Omaha great to have you how you doing sir\nThanks for having me on rush 'em I Want to run my theory value um and I'm going to say in advance if I had this thought process in my mind even two years ago I'd have to look in the mirror and say what's wrong with you but I've become so cynical or the media and the radical left in this country\nThat I'm just thinking this way nowadays okay but this this whole thing with a package bombs to me reeks of deep state and I truly believe you've been talking about\nHow you don't think there's going to be a red wave\nOr a blue wave I'm Sorry ... and I think I think these folks know that there's no red ... I think they know they're in trouble with these elections I honestly beginning to think that the Republicans are going to gain seats in the house or or you are not nearly going to lose as many as people are thinking they are\nAnd I think it's all goes back to what like Jordan saying about that ...\nYou know and this and this whole cover up\nBut if they don't we take that house\nOnce the elections are over I think the real investigation is going to move forward on that Feisal document and that dot CA and I think these people are terrified the deep state I mean they cannot let that happen and I think the I think these package bombs are means of disrupted in these elections to the point where they can then say\nBetween ... between these crazy right these these national rights groups planting bombs and the Russians conspiring we cannot legitimize the win in this election for the for the Republicans and I think they're going to try to throw the whole thing into turmoil I really do\nI so you think that as we sit here today the deep state thinks they're going to lose their not an American to win the house back Democrats in the in the deep state thing not going to win the house back not going to win the Senate back\nSo all of this is designed to create so much chaos that whatever the result is if the Democrats in the deep state Lewis as they can say election invalid too much was going on we can't we get our democracy can't function this way you ... and you really think that the\nThe deep state here set this guy or prevent he's part of a flag operation designed to make it look like a Trump supporters gone nuts hearing hates the left\nWhen in fact they orchestrated you think that\n[noise] do you do for the FBI and CIA and the Justice Department could've been corrupted to the extent that been corrupted over the past four or five years\nI mean like I said rush three years ago I Would have said I'm Crazy I mean I I I can put nothing pass them of course when you think about what the repercussions could be for them if they don't I mean you're talking about some very high profile people being in a lot of trouble\nThe entire time made it there in record time well you you're drugged along\nYeah I actually bought mine Ryan I I couldn't believe it watch little trained go by like we can get on that he goes no let's keep going so we survive in an airport on hard surfaces\nIn as the on high hard radio yeah enjoyed the stimulation [noise]\n\n\nBreathing talking back Rush Limbaugh to cutting edge of societal\nTo Alex Henry, Virginia this is Tammy Ron open line friday welcome great to have you with us hot\nOh my God what a privilege I could imagine if I can remember that the privilege for me to have you here too so what's shaking\n[laughter] um well I wanted to let you know I've been listening since Nineteen Ninety One when the federal judge I was working for introduced me to your program um and so it's so great to be on here so many years later I wanted to\nAdd and I love that pedigree look at where you come from you come for you you\nHave a federal judge was working and that's who recommend that you are so that that that that's a wonderful pedigree as a as a like a great resume that we've got you into the Institute\n[laughter] there you go and by the way I recently gave him a guess of a twenty four seven subscription [laughter] I'm sure he's listening today\nOh that's awesome that that is that well I Can't tell you how sweet that is\nYou know what you bring that up I have to tell you we we we are ...

you are it also\nGives you the opportunity is no no I didn't fall I'm fine I'm OK this thing goes off on me twice the show while I'm sitting here\nMy wild Jess ... my expression field manner of speaking as drinking my watch triggering my watch into thinking that I Am boiling the bike and got up\n\nIt starts vibrating no you know what this is a great help me through that a lot of people are buying this watch for grandma and grandpa because it does it work they've ... they've tested this watch on Hollywood stumped actors\nAnd stunt men and women and it works but it's also it shows it nothing wrong with is comes back with false positives\nBut I'm ... my hand than even hit the table it does it just wildly just sticky waving around to her in my fall\nAlert has been triggered him to watch that is what just interrupted me but my my point is that this guy\nHere has been screaming notice me and now here comes Dana Bash from CNN\nJustice after the CNN sucks sticker on this van [noise] CNN sucks [noise] here we go\nThat image than and sacks\nOf course the president and direct us he is not technically of responsible for that but he is responsible for not just allowing the chat than on south at his rally but stoking\nMaking clear that he likes and all you need is one forgive me crock pot\nAnd we've been saying this for two years\nAnd looks like one may have emerged and that is the danger and that is the reason why leadership is the way it is and you can have an enemy you can have a political discussion you can have political discourse\nBut when you cross the line it is extremely dangerous and that has what has been a giant mission and everything we've heard from anybody at the White House\nOkay so in CNN's ... that's Trump's van and its Trump's bombs and you know in a in a vacuum and in uh\nDarryl world what Dana Bash just sent here would be perfectly fine\nBut the thing that really irritates me about CNN and the rest of these people in the leftist ... is that they permit themselves to say all of these incendiary things about anybody they want\nThey permit themselves to attack the character and the intentions and the decency and the honesty of any of their targets\nAnd they can call every president Hitler like they did George W. Bush like they do Donald Trump\nThey can accuse these people in some of the most outrageous things in the world and of course there's never any danger that at one of their crackpot ... going to take action except the theory is\nCrock pot CNN viewers shot up a Republican baseball practice crock pot CNN viewers storm buildings where there are Family Research council members and think about letting loose with gunfire\nWe have example after example\nOf attempt in violence against conservatives and right wing of the in fact one of the one of the central elements of Democrats strategy in this campaign is the public threatening and the public bullying and the public harassment\nOf Republican elected officials in restaurants in public places and these are genuinely for ... ... people\n\nAnd they are confronting people and demanding that they leave\n\nAnd and there's not there's never any condemnation of the ... you never hear CNN condemning any of this kind of\nBehavior they chalk it up well you know this is what Donald Trump has Raj is just what Donald Trump's presidency is meant there says what Donald Trump is doing to people he's making them insane is creating all that so it's it's a one way street with these people\n\nThat I Believe Donald Trump is reacting by the way\nCNN starts this with their unfair bias coverage and unlike other Republicans who just sit there and take it\nAnd spout the stuff well this is politics you know it's hard wall you got to be able to take it and I'm sure the people to the inter find people's data that Trump fires back at them\nAnd that's what hasn't been done before Trump fires back at him\nAnd a lot of Republicans are very excited about this fighting back because for ... for too many years we've had to sit here and watch\nPowerless late as CNN and others in the media have taken potshots at us and our issues they have lied about them if they miss characterize them damn attempt to do with you and the character in honor of conservative\nPeople spokesman policy people and so forth now all of a sudden\nWhen an actual Republican get shot by a gun and a bullet there is no ringing of hands over what's happening to our policy because the shooter was a Bernie Sanders supporter\nSo chalk it up where of course yeah I was ah mentally unstable Trump wouldn't do that to anybody else comes down to ... a lot of people say but Russia or something like two wrongs make her I'm not talking about two wrongs make a right I'm simply ... and I'm Talking about who started it I'm Talking about\nThese people that want to sit here and high judgment over everybody else while exempting themselves\n\nWhereas they said Donald Trump is turkey perfectly capable and responsible for any behavior on the part of his supporters CNN is it they're not responsible for how many of their viewers act or how any of the people on their side of the ... act\nAnd then there's this demand that they have for insulation\n\nAnd to be exam from having any impact on people that frankly offends me but this van I mean if you if you want it to\nDecorate and dress up a van that says notice me and if you wanted everybody in the world to know that you are a Trump supporter who is unstable and a little over the top are major over to stop\nThis is what you would do\nSo [noise] my two cents for now here's President Trump at the White House today as he convened a meeting black Leadership Conference a young black\nLeaders from all over the country this has not been done before in in this in this manner\nUm [noise] and he's talking about the

S. A.\nWe didn't uh let's see there'll be yesterday that the presidential approval rating has hit forty seven percent of his highest yet I don't need it inside the poll I'll guarantee you it's not a CNN poll\nAnd it probably is it an ABC Washington Post poll or even NBC Wall Street Journal maybe Rasmussen but is forty seven percent in whatever pull it is is Trump's highest\nAnd also forty seven percent is three points higher than Obama's approval rating twenty ten midterms does anybody remember what happened is plenty ten midterms\nThis you're certainly a little pop quiz on history now admittedly this is eight years ago\nIt seemed like eight years ago that Obama was president and mid term but how many seats the Republicans win in the two thousand ten in terms of the\n... the ...\nThe Republicans one sick the three now in those terms conventional wisdom one out conventional wisdom is the party out of power makes big gains in the house and Senate primarily the house in the first election after a president is inaugurated well\nThat's what we have coming up here but but kirks point is that Obama was sitting at forty four forty five percent back then trumpet forty seven percent and rising and therefore we uh we could be looking here at a and a bit\nOf an upset there's also polling Davis here in Florida and let me let me find this it it yeah here we go\nBarely two days after Democrats Andrew Gillum was leading in most polls for governor of Florida a strategic Research Associates Paul conducted for gray television\nAnd released a couple of days ago shows Ron this Santas pulling into the lead forty eight forty five margin of error plus or minus three and a half\nSo statistically tied the poll is the first since the primaries last month to put the Santa Fe head of Bernie Sanders supporter Andrew Gillum\nNow there's all kinds of controversy about Gillum uh caught in this thing operate do I am reading by the way\nThat it is possible that the FBI is going to indict Gillum at some ... regardless of the election that he's going to be indicted for some of the corrupt practices have been investigated\nFor a we had the news that he had he paid an Under Cover ... the money to buy Hamilton tickets in New York\nBeyond that emails in tax raise questions on Gillum trips with lobbyist records show Gillum new well in advance that he was out of state meetings with Adam Curry could help him network with power for developers businessmen and lawyers\nI mean this is incredible that a newspaper is doing investigative journalism on a Democrat but the Miami Herald\nIs a it's a it's not so we'll see how that plays out there is a Politico story today I actually saw it last night that Trump fears a Florida wipe out\nThat Donald Trump fear is that we're going to lose everything in Florida the socialist in Florida are going to win\nEverything and so Trump is scheduling even more rallies and more effort in Florida to try to save the day here it is a political started that's the word is being used the Trump fears a Florida wipe out\nThere are other news stories that suggest drugs drugs has links to them that are the socialists of America

Democrats with Democrat US Senator Heidi Heitkamp\nHeading for defeat in North Dakota Democrats now need a net gain of three seats to win the majority be one way would be the whole the five Democrats

bottom lines of this story is that New Jersey has\nBeen moved to toss up in the cook report New Jersey has been moved to toss New Jersey ought to be dead and walk Democrat any day of the year that you look at it New Jersey being in in toss up\nAnd Florida remains a coin toss although Democrats see a path to victory for US Senator Bill Nelson well they better he's the incumbent he wouldn't have the

there's so much that we don't know yet and we don't know what we're going to be told we don't know how credible what we're going to be told is despite all of that there is enough information gleaned simply by exposing yourself to that which is reported so far today you add that to\nWhat you know or think you know about all of the various political players involved here and do you think for example that the\nThe deep state not ... the Democrat Party see I Can't ever put out of my head what has been done these past two years\nOn this totally bogus investigation to prove Trump colluded with Russia that is so big that is so outrageous\nWhat has been done in these past two years ignoring the real collusion and the real criminality and not even investigating\nPlanting spies in the Trump campaign why did the president about whether he's a target or not literally trying to set up Trump employees\nStaffers and so forth sets them up so that they behave in certain ways as to give the impression\nThat Trump is colluding with Russia Russia was involved it somehow that election was illegitimate that project is still ongoing it's ongoing in the form of the Mueller investigation\nAnd all along that line George Papadopoulos who at one time was the guy the FBI told us was the reason this investigation began\nGeorge Papadopoulos is now claiming that what he has learned that in these past two years he's thinking of withdrawing his plea agreement with Mahler\nJust briefly to recall Papadopoulos was a young eager beaver so called foreign policy advisor on the Trump campaign he never met Trump he never gave him any advice but he was hired early on because the media was hounding Trump or your advice virtues obviously goes out these positions\nPapadopoulos was set up he was invited to London by one of the spies the FBI embedded the Trump campaign guy name stuff and help her\nHe was in it or just a professor from Walter named Joseph ... who planted in his mind the idea hey George do you notice the Russians have a whole lotta Hillary's emails no I Know that Stephanopoulos twenty four year old kid he thinks he's being told something really big so they tell him this\nThen he finds himself having adult beverages were the ambassador from Australia at a bar in London\nAnd the ambassador to step in options you know I told the we we know that the Russians have while the Hillary emails\nSo this ambassador goes back and reports to the FBI what Papadopoulos told them well they planted it and his head he didn't know what independently because it probably isn't even true\nSo Papadopoulos spreading the word that the Trump campaign knew that the Russians have Hillary emails at one point that's what they told us was the starting point for the ... go get the ... orange what's all bogus that was not when the investigation started it started way before that\nMy point is how much the deep state wants their government back\nWe don't even really understand we think we do but we don't have any idea these\nPeople have an entitlement\nTo our government the strings the levers of power their positions in it to you and I cannot relate to we can do our best to try to understand it but they think they own it if there's they are scared to death that the actions that I just described the mother but this whole two years silent who\nThey are held back that none of what they've done it ever really see the light of day that nobody ever find out and the fastest way to making sure\nNobody ever finds out is to make sure the Democrats win control of the house and eventually get to the Senate and the White House back and then everything's cool the cover up we'll continue nobody will ever know what really happened\nThese people who might be facing jail time or other serious criminal problems will be spared that's another reason why Hillary had the wit and the Mueller investigation I Believe is an attempt to distract everybody and and be a cover up\nFor the real conspiracy and the real ... and the real collusion that without well if I Believe all of that to be true and I do and I know\nIt is true I'm not I have no doubts about it I Will those
