Rachel Mitchell ask her some questions which now turned out to be brilliant but at the time\nWe were all kind of curious what what the purpose was\nA all Trump is still is reminding everybody what she said she doesn't know she doesn't know the people she says we're there say they weren't there\nThis is not mocking her and this is a sign of what really is wrong in this country and accuser comes forward and you can poke holes in\nObvious places you can't point out obvious discrepancies you cannot reference or make mention of the\nDifferences in her story from depending on the day she's telling it\nWhatever it is it is it is not mocking\nChristie and balls the Ford now\nTrump has a lot of people saying this is crazy rush because last week Trump was saying that she was credible and her testimony was compelling\nI have explained this before and I'm going to explain it again Trump all ways eventually will tell you what he really thinks about anything and he may not do that out of the batter's box\nI have a name for this I call it pacing\nTrump will the necessarily go out with a general opinion like on gun control after a shooting or the dreamers are in this case Dr ... for your caller credible testimony\nCompelling and he'll even go so far to say that yeah if if she's telling the truth yeah they're my nomination might be in trouble yeah I'll agree with that\nThat gives him credibility it makes people kind of cock their head they don't think Trump can be that's fair I'm Talking about the media and the left Democrats they don't think Trump can be that that a reasonable\nBut he does it to them every time it gives them the credibility later\nTo be critical and the step away he said yeah I found a credible founder compelling then as we learn more and then there's events play out Trump is able\nTo parlay his original statements into what he really thinks based on\nWhat is not a knee jerk reaction if Trump were to have said initially when he said last night at the rally why there would have been held up pay but now he can back it up now there's all kinds of evidence that her timeline doesn't make any sense\nWe've got an ex boyfriend claiming she is a polygraph experts has taught people how to beat them\nWe have people challenging her account we didn't have that last week it is perfectly fine for Trump to do what he did\nIt gives him a credibility later to be critical of the step away it's a common technique he uses he does it on everything\nIt's why I've always told you don't take his first draft statement or his first tweet as a sign that he's caving or flipping you people you I'm sure you remember there haven't been many instances in fact I may have fallen for one myself that's how I learned\nThat Trump will tweet something

Russia's week in review readings and walking back Rush Limbaugh but yeah I mean I work for your ear is the there's the James of the gym and\nGuarantee quote from a National Review um\nThe more time I spent covering politics the more I'm convinced that a significant chunk a grass roots political activist or not really arguing about politics\nAt all\nThese people are actually struggling with personal psychological issues and projecting them\nUnder the world of politics bingo I've been searching for bad description for years I have no problem admitting that I was unable to put this together it's one of the rare moments I was unable to this is exactly right\nWe're dealing with people who have suffered some kinds of psychological disorder they've turned to politics\nFor the solution or the river bend is actually what they're looking for and they don't just want revenge against to ever did whatever to them they are now demanding that every representative of the group that that are the individual that did something can be made to pay a price for it\nIt's what the ... this this uh ... well\nThe me too movement in large part was never bipartisan it was thought to be said to be but it never was\nA and even if it if you okay even if it was it's been co opted by the Democratic party look at look at the uh [noise] Occupy Wall street move but look at black lives matter or to take any left wing group that you want it's made up of people\nWho for some reason I think they have been unjustly mistreated by somebody\nAnd instead of dealing with that in their lives they enter politics and they demand that the Democratic party take up the cause of the Democratic party willingly has the Democratic party has become the party\nOf all of these disparate constituency groups\nWith their singular causes because the Democratic party realizes that they can combine all of these things into a singular assault on the concept of America that America is responsible for what happened to these people\nThey capitalism is responsible that the power structure that the founding is responsible\nAnd so people with psychological disorders are being granted the status of normalcy\nAnd then the big donors come along and under write them and fund their efforts and they become political movements\nAnd then they become victims and then of course allows them to blame everybody for what has gone wrong in their lives and then they demand reciprocity or revenge or what have you and I can tend to view that most people in our side have no idea how to deal with\nThis no idea whatsoever so we ended up and debates about whether boys want to pretend to be girls so they can go on the girls' bathrooms and becomes legitimate that's sick\nIt ... it in in many not that specifically but just the whole concept of what is happening here and it is a violent bullying intimidating\nMovement that has been constructed to push all of these this\nBritain various agendas and the target\nIs America the target is America is founded the target is American Capitalism and so when our caller says that Kavanaugh is simply a stand in\nFor men who have abused every woman out there he's right balls the\nFord will end up being supported by other women who've been abused whether she's\nTelling the truth or not it doesn't matter because it did happen to them these women we do know that are out there watching this it did happen to them and by God somebody's going to pay for it in this case I mean capital that's how they're going to be heard rather than just deal with the specific incident that happened to them\nIt's the same thing I think with black lives matter or the NFL players kneeling for the anthem a all cops are bad and free white cop is rate every black convict is in is\nIn every instance here points to the country at large as being responsible in unfairness in biased in discrimination racism all of this\nThe Democratic party is neat organizing party the collection agency for all of these compliance\nDemocrat Party is happy to make victims out of anybody who wants to be one and Democrat Party is happy to promise these people that they'll fix it and they never do they never the raging angered never ends if only gets worse because the Democrats don't fix anything and finally\nIt doesn't even depend on being fixed it just means somebody's got to pay in this case capital he's got to pay\nWhether he did it or not\nNow Sarah Sanders White House press briefing is going on she just lay the end of the press and she said exactly what I said if I don't mind saying so she said Trump didn't mock anybody last night he simply recites did the facts\nAnd he said all of this can be laid at the feet of the Democrats they are to blame for this none of this needed to have happened in public\nThey had ... forge email or in a letter ... way back in July they could have done everything that's been done to investigate her claim off record behind the scenes nobody knowing about it but they didn't do that they waited to use it as a Hail Mary\n\nShe dispute the idea that Trump mocks she said all he was doing was reciting the facts here it is again this is what the press the media everybody is out now ripping Trump claiming that he mocked Christine walls before\nDonald Trump is making me thinking those precisely those terms is that there is

in what you and I wouldn't call this massive civil disobedience although it's more than that it is it is genuine child like I Know it's not even tried like ... but we're just we're dealing with a complete emotional breakdown\nAnd a group of people I don't care whether they're paid or not ... that I don't I don't want to fall back on that the suggested this anger they feel is not legitimate if legitimate whether they're being paid or not I don't think that means that the real enthusiasm a democratic voters is less than what we think it is\n\nJust because some people have announced that they accepted money to go do this stuff I don't I don't think that they would sit around and do nothing and with all their phones all weekend long if they weren't being paid I think the Democrat rages real and it's been real since election night\nTwo thousand sixteen they thought they are going to win that aren't they going to land so they haven't been able to come to grips with that even now the capital of the thing is just further evidence that the election and consequences they censor themselves losing control and losing and losing and they can't deal with it\nThey simply cannot deal with it and rather than do what's necessary to put themselves back together and become a winning\nEnterprise they continue with their primary strategy of trying to tear down and destroy the opposition and eliminate it\nRather than do what's necessary to reach a broad swath the majority of the American people which they cannot do in their current makeup which is why I ask\nOver and over if the Democrats ab large elected Democrats really are unaware of the impression these people are creating about them\nAnd when these are Mandy insane is dusting Democrat protesters and they are identified with the Democrat Party and I don't know if some elected Democrats really get that I can be all wet that could totally get it and they could be promoting it and which is probably closer\nTo the to the truth than not but for those that don't get it amazes me that it is possible that these\nProfessional Democrats are like Nate Silver do not consider these protesters to be members of their party and representative\nOf the uh the party\nAt large here's J Christian Adams writing it PJ Media Kavanaugh foes fills Senate gallery was sounds will be insane\nSo but as any doubt that the opposition to

least bit embarrassed by it the Democratic party at large doesn't seem to worry at all that this kind of discord madness is going to negatively impact them in the elections\n\nIn fact they may think the opposite they may think that this is what's going to further inspire more discordant\nMadness which will result in massive turnout\nThey believe it's going to frighten Republicans in tune not

happy watching the news over the weekend to hear a number of people on our side making this point because it's a point that's been true for as long as I have been doing this program in the longer we say constantly to the left uses the courts\nTo act as insurance policies against losing elections that left cannot\nSucceed in implementing his agenda nationwide except to be the courts\nAnd that's why the courts are so important and that's why the courts a liberal Democrat presidents have stacked as many of the federal courts federal appellate courts as they can with leftist activist judges not just plain old simple judges a rule of law\nAnd there is a dirty little secret behind this folks\n\nThe Democrats simply do not have\nThe numbers in the country\nTo pass their agenda in Congress they do not have the numbers to implement and pass their agenda legislatively other words they cannot get their beliefs their ideas past as the laws in America\nThey have to rely on an activist judges to do it\nNow you might miss it was Russia or Jews or before to nothing new there well there's nothing new about it but particularly its in its relevance its power\nAnd it's important it's has been magnified in this current cabinet fight and explains in one reason why why this is so important to them they are in their minds on the verge of losing the highest court in the land\nThere on the verge of losing the ability to have the highest court in the land a rubber stamp their policies if you go down and look at leftist issue by leftist issue\nThat these issues that have royals our culture turned our culture upside down and you won't find any of them that have been passed into law by the elected representatives of the people except for Obamacare\nAbortion the American people haven't decided that that was forced\nOn the American people by a leftist activist judge and a majority on the Supreme Court\nAnd any other number of cultural issues which are designed to strike out at this white power structure that the left so despise isn't so hates\nThat they cannot beat they cannot win they cannot do this legislatively\nThey need activist judges dominating courts in order for what they want to be forced on every ... this is the point\nWhat they believe in\nThe idea is they have must be forced on the rest of the bus if they are to happen\nThey\nCannot withstand legislative tests\nIt's the same reason why every Democrat president up to and including Obama never tells the truth about their agenda they would not win the presidency if they were honest about that which they intended to do\n\nIf Obama had been honest about the way Obamacare was going to end up and how much it was going to cost you and how much you deserve to pay for it because you've been getting a free ride all these years\nYou buy my had been anywhere near honest about that or what climate change was going to cost you renting ... he would have never been elected\nAnd no Democrat ever wouldn't be\nThey routinely soft sell what they really believe they do not come out an advocate socialism or communism in presidential campaigns they will do it as it was a case of a I'm a Gemini oh gift to task who's lunacy on display in a leftist district in New York is harmless\nBut you put her on a national ticket somewhere and she kills it\nWe have not lost this country and we have not lost that which can be traced directly back to our founding but the left once everybody to believe that that founding and everything traceable back to it is unjust unfair\nThat it is also racist and sexist and massage sticking all these other things that are despicable we must do away with it\nThey don't have the ability\nTo to win any of these issues legislatively\nAre you left us you can get mad at me all you want out there but you cannot review this everything they want everything they have achieved outside of Obamacare has been forced on the country\nThe country has been bludgeon into accepting it\n\nThe country has been bludgeoned into looking the other way and if you don't look the other way and if you find it then what did they do they sue you\nThey try to ruin you or they bully you or they harass you or what have you this is not the behavior that does when things legislatively\nAnd yet the Democrats firmly believe that all of this is going to lead to this giant ... blue wave and I don't care even today\nThere are links all over the Drudge Report where if you click on them you're going to find a story saying yeah it's over Democrats when and when bang and even the Republicans

I don't think given what we've seen the last two weeks among people in the public who watched it I don't think the Republicans need to do when he got out the vote this was that\nIn my scene and just world the Democrats are just exceeded and getting Republican turnout larger than it's ever been for a mid term I Know I'm probably wrong about that but that's how I look at it that's how it ought to be and I'm the king a book's title the way things ought to be an automated people were outraged by this\nIt ought to be that people can't wait to go punish this month just common for the way they have treated this country the past two weeks alone the Republicans are not have to spend the time getting out the vote based on this but I Know that's not the reality kind of frustrating to me but that's the case\nDemocrats thinking they're going to have turned out here that dwarfs anything the Republicans have to show up on election uh Democrats think the whole\nCountry is because if they really don't they know they don't have enough Americans to win legislative battles but they think that they're going to be able to put together enough people to dwarf whatever Republican turnout there is and

Bush the victory illegally\nNever mind the Florida Supreme Court was out of control the way it was handling all the legal issues here\nThe U.S Supreme Court had to step in and stop it because it was out of control when they did the Democrats were fit to be tied and from that day forward George W. Bush was an illegitimate president\nAnd he didn't stop being illegitimate and they finally got his approval numbers down to the twenty six years later in the middle of his second term so we get the two thousand two and it's the first chance the Democrats have\nTo pay a country back to pay the Republicans back to pay Bush back\nAnd they are going to retake the house and they're going to retake the Senate and they're going to reopen the Florida recount and they're going to make sure that justice is finally done and that Al Gore be duly recognize as the legitimate winner of the presidency\nEven though Al Gore didn't want to be part of it by that time\nThey were feeling show up so shore so confident\nWhen it came time for a memorial for their late great senator from Minnesota Paul Wellstone they totally blew up what was intended to be a memorial\nHonoring and celebrating the life of Wellstone\nIt was about three weeks prior to the mid term elections in November of two thousand to\nThe ... stone memorial was hijacked by activists Democrats and turned into a shore Paul lyrical rally the purpose of which was to destroy\nGeorge W. Bush and Republicans in memory of Paul Wellstone\n\nRepublican senators who were friends of Wellstone was due to flee showed up at the\nArena they did this arena in a place that whole Fifteen thousand people if my memory serves ten Fifteen thousand people\nIt was some time after a while most of them died in a plane crash and it was some time after that but this was the official memorial and it was I don't think it was ever intended to be a memorial I think it was a political event from the get go disguised as a memorial\nAnyway Republican senator is not knowing up from dominant I'm Trent Lott and the boys all showed up thinking that they were showing up to a memorial\nA religious memorial ... there for one colleague Paul Wellstone\nThey worm booty and bullied and harassed out of the place within thirty minutes of having arrived in sat down\nIt was identical to what we saw the way Jeff Flake and others were assaulted in elevators animal hallways of the Senate office building\nExcept this was after memorial and this was a Democrat voters going up to the we're the Republicans receded in getting in their faces and pointing fingers adamant Boeing at them\nThey thought they were there\nTo participate in a solemn occasion they got up and they walked out and they left\nAnd this memorial turned in to a hate fast a hate fast aimed at George W. Bush a hate fast aimed at George W Bush's policies they couldn't even set aside what had happened on nine eleven for this memorial\nThis Morial took place about fourteen months after nine eleven\nTook place so then the men terms occur\nAnd I remember I was invited to the last time this happened I was invited for election night coverage on NBC Tim Russert asked me to join him and Tom Brokaw I Do to fully accepted and I went\nAnd I was not on camera all night maybe four or five times while they they cycled other people through\nAnd they brought me and after it was clear that the Republicans had gained ... seats on heard of\n\nThe Democrats just like now we're supposed to win big\nBecause Democrats told everybody hated Bush everybody resented the way the Supreme Court stole the election for Bush\nThat Al Gore had won the popular vote just clicked and at the American people felt betrayed by Bush and the Supreme Court and nine eleven and Bush's general stupidity and competence and as such couldn't not wait for the Democrats to take back control of what is right bully there's\nWashington DC\nExcept it didn't happen the Republicans gained ... seats\nTim Russert was great broke all brought me out and so what do you think happened\nHere I said well stone memorial but Wellstone memorial is what happened and I went on and told them why and the truncated version of what I just said they knew they were shell shocked\nThey were shell shocked is just not in the formula the party in power does not pick up seats\nIn mid term elections the first ones after a new president is elected so that's a formative experience for me and if it's\nUnlike ... if it's happened once it can happen again something that hasn't happened before probably won't happen but if it has then it can happen again and this is a replay of that except this is a replay of even more outrageous behavior\nThe Wellstone memorial took place on one night the Democrat Party has been insane on display four to four years\nAnd actually longer than that but in the in the context of Trump's election it's been two consistent ears of public arrangement\nPublic insanity psychological disorders on display childlike temp by the way I too have sat in the Senate gallery\nAs a young boy my parents took my brother and me in Washington DC one summer\nAnd the Senate was in session and I remember a Barry Goldwater was among the senators speaking when we were there he was speaking on the farm bill I was fourteen or Fifteen\n\nAnd I remember being in the gallery and I had a it was a pamphlet or a book some some kind of a a\nExplaining what the Senate was and what was going on and I was turning the pages and the Senate page came and grabbed that book away from\nMe and said you're making too much noise I'll give you this back after you leave just turning up page was not permitted the gallery could not do anything more than ...\nYou were not allowed to chew gum people\nWere chewing gum and the pages said you're leaving Russia or putting it in a piece of paper and tossing it you're not staying in here to tell them\nThey would come whisper this to you they took my little pamphlet a way\nI felt like they just stop all just come and then I'm watching this thing the other night in these in these these these these women are going bad eat\nSounding literally like they are infants out of the boom that and they don't want to be there\nAnd I couldn't even make out what they're saying it sounded like Christian Adams said it sounded like we were in the middle of an asylum in there and ... my\nPencil saying over and over the sergeant ... started an arm to restore order and the gallery there's are done an arms will restore order and the gallery sergeant at arm's is having a hell of a lot of trouble restoring order in the gallery\n\n[noise] as I said the United nations Intergovernmental Panel on climate change the I.
