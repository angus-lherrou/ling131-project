because it costs so much for\nOh yeah oh yeah we that's right because we ... we the eight hundred number didn't apply their cell phones cell phone callers had to pay money to be on hold yeah yeah yeah I Do remember that way and I are way back then I ... back you\nGo I I've been way back before that even so ah but hey I've got a theory about this caravan\nThe last two years there's only one\nThing that the Democrats have won on and that's the wall and it as a Trump supporter every time the the issue of the law comes up I get aggravated that it's something that they want on income Trump is caved on\nAnd I think that they've done that fit this time just to put an exclamation point on and they emphasize the Trump is not the winner that he says he is\nYou know that's an interesting thought a that it\nThat the idea to flood the border to demonstrate that Trump does not have the wall can't get the call maybe isn't going to get the wall so maybe people should abandon from do you think that would work\nWell it's not going to work on me but let me tell you as a as a Trump supporter that is the big thing that aggravates me every time he finds one of these are one of these things to keep the government going that's got nothing in it it burns me up\nAt all the time so are you are who are you a little concerned that Trump is not really trying hard enough for the wall\nNo I I mean I've got a political theories as to why it hasn't happened yet maybe\nYou know Trump Trump I trust in Trump I I think he knows what he's doing a ... it could be that he wants to do their next year right before the election to get everybody energized you know I don't know if he's a ... all I can say these are smarter than than I Am\nA navy but but I uh\n... they said that your theory is really quite insightful but it requires ... for the Democrats to pull it off a lot of Trump voters would have to believe he's not trying not trying hard to end for for the Democrats to capitalize on flooding his own\nWith four thousand people that get into the country just to demonstrate that Trump pass a bill but Waldor Trump really can't stop these people that Trump therefore as ineffective\nThose people in order to abandon Trump would then have to conclude he's not really trying very hard and I I don't even think they would have banned it in this soon yet over\nOver I don't I agree I I Know I'm not and I don't think most of them well\nMy question is what else did they got\nWell they've got my behavior a lunatic insane range\nRight but I mean on on Trump they got they got nothing they can they can put up the Trump hasn't done that he's promised and that's the that's the uh well that's exactly\nRight and wound right there that was four in the Trump supporters that we haven't got the wall and we want it's not even you know that they aren't even begin to foundation yet and I think even started so it really aggravates me personally\nThat this is something that they just keep the continuing resolution than leave things to keep the\nOh hey I'm with you all of that you're talking about all of these spending\nBills we've had new budget ... we've had continuing resolutions um we Democrats\nCan't stop anything in the house they can in the Senate\nWhat what here's what Trump's up against and I'm like\nBefore you go Todd I Want to get your thoughts on the Trump is still up against the fact that leaders in both parties do not want that ball\n\nIt's not just the Democrats are opposing Trump on this it's all so there are a lot of Republicans don't want that wall because of Republican donors the Trump is still pretty much fighting the establishment the swamp on that\n[laughter]\nThey they didn't want tax cuts either no they didn't and there's a lot of other things\nThat they didn't want the he's he's a a that he's come through and he's twisted them a into doing what he wants\nOut in many of the ... the ...\nI think many of the Republicans have bought the idea that Trump was going to be gone or a before and now I I\nThey are so convinced the media will get rid of whoever the media targets I I think the first is certainly the first six to eight months of two thousand Seventeen Trump's first year I think the Republicans didn't do anything to help him 'cause they didn't think he was going to survive\nAnd\nIt it that's one of the reasons that the Obamacare repeal and replace didn't go anywhere because the Republicans just bought into the notion that most of the country actually hated Trump despite the fact that he had been elected and it's been a slow reversal than a slow realization on a part of the Republicans the Trump is the guy\nAnd the Trump is immensely popular particularly on the Republican side well we'll see if\nThis story on the caravan turning around Pompeo is there a palm payroll left Saudi Arabia after having met when king Solomon and Mohammed bin so I'm On the crown prince you flew to Mexico\nAnd they have to know the Trump is

I have a radio ad high check out our blog at her radio resentment inside a studio featuring a brand new episode with the legendary sir Paul McCartney\nNo I'm In St Paul sit down with Joe leaving the talking about his new album Egypt vision and of course some discussion about a little band called the feed off we were ... when we were playing music or radio present decided the city yeah check it out now\nTalk no batteries required here we'll stimulate you naturally KNX the AM seven Ninety two sons most stimulating talk [noise]\n\nAm I going to get through the production I may last night on Hannity about the mid term elections and the Fox them and asking people all day to react to it so that some of the sun by that we that we have coming up\nWhat other stuff here on the soundbite roster as well which I I thought I was going to be able to get to the first hour but habits would try to make up for lost ground here when we get back there's only one hour left this week or so hang on [noise]\nYou're you're on the state update for October Nineteen\nToday in Seventeen fifty to Ben Franklin published a newspaper reports that he'd flown quite a thunderstorm proving the lightning and electricity or religion [noise]\nBritain's general Cornwall surrendered to George Washington the Yorktown on this date in Seventeen eighty one\nBasically ending the revolutionary war actually porn Wallace didn't show up at the surrender he sent his aid with this sort\nOf the Beatles recorded on\nNineteen sixty three [laughter] and the first number one hit in the U.S [noise]\nAnd was the start of the British Invasion this was black Monday in Nineteen eighty seven the largest one day stock market crash in history the Dow industrial drop twenty six percent [noise]\nBorn on this day and I want to get your head to swivel to the rear\nActor John Lithgow and first daughter Amy quarter\nI'm Mitch Davis and that's your on this date updates [noise]\nHanging from the region will studio your local area reason well dot com is fantasy instead of a nice yard radio station [noise]\nAnd you charge of election meddling and Lisa Brady functioning as the Justice Department just announcing charges against a Russian woman accused with interfering in us elections this year believed to be the first federal case claiming Russian meddling in the midterms\n\nAnd I think that's a pretty good theory and then you add in the chaos that will happen and you're throwing the possibility that they do get to the border and do cross but they wouldn't be separated and that's one of all those issues when I went through the last hour that came and went and didn't have any glue or have any legs that one dead\n\nI'll never forget I was out in California I I I got so frustrated I was playing golf with a friend of mine was one of us\n\nAnd it was during the time to drive ... and the Democrats are making all this noise about how Trump separating families children for mothers\nAnd this guy who's up to speed on this stuff says Russia's pictures look basket come on you know the pictures are made up this was ... the pictures look bad it looks really bad you don't you're not really spoiling for just ... pictures look bad we've got to do some pictures with all my gosh I'm\nGuy was smart enough to know that he was calling for a meeting a trick\nBut at the pictures of what he was telling me was\nI Can't defend this I have people\nComplained to me about Trump's separating ... I can defend the pictures rush the pictures\nSo that's the one thing that has had legs okay so the audio salvage ship you're on hold if you're on the phone\nBe patient were coming to you ill quick oh this is the soundbite from the hands of the interview last night uh that Fox has been playing all day long to get people's reaction\nI still say that I think there are things that have yet to happen that aren't going to determine outcomes in some races the we don't know so it's still very hard to predict Kavanaugh feedback reaction was one hundred percent positive for Republicans and Democrats really blew that but there's four hundred and thirty five of these things I don't know\nI just rely on hope which is again naive I don't have survey data I don't trust the\nIt hasn't been right consistently enough for me the people doing these surveys desperately wants Trump goal and I don't know how they can take that out of their work I don't believe in pure objectivity is like this process if I put on the spot production but we hold the house and we increase the Senate\nBecause I think that's just I think that's just I think the Democratic party deserves to lose\nIn the single biggest electoral landslide defeat in my lifetime meals they actions they've taken just in the last month\nOkay so that bite and bite\nLit up the Fox news channel the day our first stop is America's Newsroom bill hammer uh Anton ... Julie ... cohost out there talking to fame and Republicans strategic wrist and Rollins about my comment than\nDeserved to lose like he's bar act on that front half right on the other front I think will lead some Senate cities I think the house was very very much in jeopardy\nSo you are not buying into his are scenario they'll hold it Rush Limbaugh said they'd hold if they don't count those sites I Do and I ran a congressional committee I've been doing it a long time\nThere are Fifteen seats that are now gone nine of those are the open seats there's another twenty five to thirty that our our seats that are in play was only about two or three Democrats seats are in place totally on the defense everything has to go our way to basically break even\nLet me run through them and say this is the stuff that I'm going to be honest with you I I Do not get into this stuff this is this just walk a stuff\nAnd to me this is totally absent uh any any what what's the word personality or I mean this is just raw numbers are based on data that is the result of polling and\nI Know as well as anybody that polling sometimes is right sometimes it's wrong and and I just sat in the bite\nI'm just suspicious of of polling units because I think I don't think these people can take their passion and their desired outcome\nOut of their work and we know that they know we look in the presidential polls in two thousand sixteen I mean that those people were all literally caught short there was no way Donald Trump is going to win it was just not possible Hillary was going to win a landslide maybe not the biggest ever but Trump didn't have a prayer\n\nAnd there was one maybe two polls showed that he was really in it and couldn't win it Rasmussen was one neighbor ignored\nAnd we've got a replay here's what informs me what makes me make these kind of productions is reality and as I also mentioned last night since ... rock Obama was elected in two thousand eight starting in two thousand ten including the midterms in two thousand twelve\nAnd the midterms in two thousand fourteen ... election or two thousand sixty in the Democratic party has lost twelve hundred seats\nThe trend is people voting out Democrats\nAnd that was happening while the Democrats were in the White House with Obama there that could be a factor Obama's gone so maybe the anti Democrat ... is not as high as it used to be when he was there as I Do believe he was a drag on the Democratic party\nBut then I asked myself what has happened in the last two years to make people all of a sudden want to elect Democrats again\nAs everybody's telling us is going to happen house has gone Raj Senate yeah we're probably pick up a couple of houses gone\nAnd then they say because rush these house races have nothing to do with any of the way you're looking at this these are really local races and they are have have to deal with things that are not on any national radar will not true if these races are being nationalized by the various\nCandidates in them but anyway what has happened to make people all of a sudden\nStop rejecting Democrats or the Democrats have they done a one eighty are made now performing and executing and behaving in ways that make people\nLove them again well no not in a just an insane world the Democrats aren't doing anything that would grow\nSupport their promoting rage in anger there promoting insanity and lunatic behavior\nSo then okay maybe as a Trump is\nThere's this much opposition to Trump from people who didn't care one way or the other two years ago has the media succeeded in creating a bunch of anti Trump sentiment\nIn a mid term turnout profile of voters\nWell that would have to be what it is because the Democrats are not the Democrats say\nThe justice associated with the Democrats are doing his landslide defeat the Democrats are not responsible for anything good happening in this country\nAnd they're not even trying to be associated they don't even trying to claim credit for the economy they did for a couple of weeks they tried on Obama out remember Obama was trying to say the economy was his\nWell that went on for like a land balloon and they died with it so they abandon that\nAn outside of that there hasn't been one attempt by the Democrats to associate themselves with anything good happening in America\nThey have in ... dad\nContinued to try and portray America as this unfair\nOn just on deserve\nExceptional superpower that discriminates that violates that ... that [noise] it's all negative so I'm just\nSo where is this body of evidence that suggest that trend voting against Democrats is reversed again I acknowledge house races are\nNot the same as a presidential race with a national issues of national turnout on balance Shannon dream last night Fox News at night with Shannon brim a wonders what my strategy was in predicting what I predict\nCome up with no calling says that the Republicans are going to hold onto the house so where do you think this is coming from with Rush Limbaugh what's the status\nI tend to agree with him um and I think what we could be saying is again the phenomenon that the Pony Express called the spiral of silence the shy Trump voted to the shy breakfast votes is the kind of people who know that it's not a dumb thing necessarily to support a particular view but secretly in the polling booth that's what they do\nThat Steve sheltered and who has a weekend show on Fox and he was instrumental in the Brexit vote in the u._k. and so a reason why what was Limbaugh getting this I mean there's not a single poll out for the shows this happened precisely my point not\nA single poll not a single poll shows so from this where to conclude and these people live and die by polls I'm telling you folks nine out of ten of people in D.C live and die by\nTheir ... and I really think um if I Lived in\nWashington each and every I don't I couldn't I wouldn't it be ostracized after not
