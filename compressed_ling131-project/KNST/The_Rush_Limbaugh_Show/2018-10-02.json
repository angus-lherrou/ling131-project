are within the margin of error Missouri Nevada Tennessee Florida the list goes on and on and on we have all of these close races which means we have the best estimate about what might happen in the Senate come November but it really could\nBe a democratic wave or could be a Republican wave at the polls are often wondered Republican wave in the Senate and the house in the ... not in the house\nRepublican wave in the Senate all know that means no impeachment of Trump means an impeachment of the Democrats get the house and don't think so but if they do it would die in the Senate unless there's a bunch of Jeff Flake clones in there\nBecause they would never vote to ah to convict if the Republicans hold the Senate or even swelled the ranks so the panicked host Jim shoot I couldn't believe when he heard their blue wave red wave in the Senate\nHe says there was discussion of a blue wave big generic battled advantage for Democrats do you notice it tightening their as we get closer to the election\nI Will say the generic ballot does seem to be tightening a little bit which is good news for Republicans on it you know there's a lot of talk oh with Brett Kavanaugh on this whole confirmation math that in fact that might hurt Republican but it doesn't actually seem to be so far we're actually seeing some tightening in the Senate races and more than that we're seeing tightening in the house races\nI'm going to leave your little ... observation about this but what did I tell ya he's generic ballots way back last December that's when they first started harping on this\nAnd back then you know nine months ago the Democrats\nHad a twelve point advantage and that's when all the talk of a blue wave began and that's what all the talk of the Democrats winning ... Congress began and it went all through the year Democrat advantage in the generic ballot was twelve five seven and the Republicans pulled even in a couple of them are Democrats once again broke away\nAnd all during it I your host have been doing this a long time and it doesn't matter\nIt doesn't mean anything me remind you\nOf a motivation technique utilized by the coach of the New England patriots won bill that will check\nPrior to one of the super bowl the patriots were empty might do it frequently I I Know one time\nHe gathered the players for a team meeting and so we're gonna have more fun we're going to watch a horse race he had videotape of a horse race that nobody had seen it was not a big race is that allow the players to make friends leave bats and weighing Drew's on who was going to win\nSo the players made their batch and Donald ... for the race and stops at at the first term it's OK layer bats tell me who's gonna win players go nuts making their choices\nTape resumes that was checked stops at at the halfway point anybody want to change their bed anybody want to double down players go into gear making their beds\nAt the final turned ballot checked stops the tape of the horse racing again asks the players if they want to make an additional ... or get out of ones they've made\nLayers do what they do that much jak resumes taped to the finish line makes the point it didn't matter at any point in this race when I stopped the tape\nThere is no way anybody could have known as the first term at the halfway point or at the final turn who is gonna win yet look what you want to do what you were making ... guessing somebody you're probably were certain bottom line is\nFinish you never know before it's over who's going to win no matter what any kind of expert tells you\nIt was a motivational technique designed to get the players to realize first quarter halftime of third quarter finish doing your job\nSame thing here holes in January in front of a November election doesn't mean anything polls in June July don't mean anything\nThey're interesting for the media which is trying to shape public opinion with these polls but at the polls do not give any indication the final outcome appalled in July or August would not a contained any of the Kavanaugh\nNews so how relevant could've been answered none ... zero not up\nAnd so now here we are on October second CNN is panicking\nRacist or type thing in the house this wasn't supposed to happen why they had all their pre election polls they had the generic ballot\nThey've had this in in in the in the camp has been in the bank since last December in their minds it's been over it's just a matter of ... out now all of a sudden house races\nAre tightening and there could be a blue wave in the Senate\nBut wave red wave and the Republicans could come out of nowhere at about fine old her in and take over\nWell\nWe don't know if the Republicans were ever really far behind we don't want anything because there wasn't a vote back in December or January or July or August we don't know anything\n\nAnd we don't know anything now and we won't know anything until the day after election day or maybe later that night now one of the brief observation here\nOnce again do you notice Mr engines knock it in there\n\nI think you know there's a lot of talk Brett Kavanaugh this whole confirmation messed that in fact might hurt Republicans it doesn't seem to be so\nLadies and gentlemen\nHigh and the reason he saying this and everybody else because of my viral prediction of last week that if Republicans don't confirm Kavanaugh as the Democrats are going to win everything that production of mine went viral as Dr buys loved it they love\nIt when the leader of the G O P and their minds me starts ripping the Republicans when I started predicting Louis that's when I become totally credible that's when they run the sound bites me predicting an all over the world\n\nYou notice how easy it would be to trick them they run with that and they right now all of a sudden it's just the exact opposite\n\nHe's just the exact opposite why all of this attention on Capitol on what the Republican is actually going to help them how can that the literature on just said they were gonna lose\nThey are totally totally confused\nAnd as I said yesterday what what what is the sense in saying that we have to lose in order to win you know people that will lead Kevin I'll go down that are really find them up that will fire buddy you know the way you get on the bandwagon the way you get people on the

haven't been subjected to this liberal machine and the way it operates a number of times I Know them I Know I Know how they lie and make things up and strategize I Know there are the techniques their strategies and everything better than they do\nSo a cartoonist by the name of Chris Brett that was his name drew up a cartoon of a fireman carrying a dead baby there was actually a cover of\nTime

this afternoon bringing up the fact that we need to start looking again at his roe versus Wade decision women's reproductive health and is assault weapons\nAre thinking on why that's been that long ago and you didn't have anything to oppose him there so you imagine how they feel about this\nThat mean they're fools to believe this was real and the first place but they're so damn desperate up one let me I Need to go back I Need to find Sheldon wise here it is number not Sheldon Whitehouse this guy's money this is a Democrat\nWho on friday morning the morning of the vote held up one of the enlarged pages of Kavanaugh's ... said that he had figured out how to translate it\nAnd the date in ... he figured this could be the date where the incident Dr foreign described happened and he is thought to try to translate some of the nicknames and phrases that capital used on his calendar\nOf course in incriminating ways a toward Kavanaugh so\nOn good morning America today George Stephanopoulos of the Clinton war room is talk English Sheldon Whitehouse is a demographic Rhode Island are you satisfied with the scope of the FBI inquiry can they finish this by friday\nI think I'm satisfied and we don't know how all the details yet clearly if they have been given a free rein to interview remember they won so that's a very good sign the last thing we want as a sham investigation\nI also think that there is a fairly small universe of witnesses here on a very big FBI so yes I think they probably should be able to ah get this done by friday if they really put the effort into it\nNow wait a minute that just makes too much sense that just doesn't fit\nWith Chuck Schumer today on the floor of the Senate who we have we have audio soundbite number eight this is Chuck you he went to the floor right after the turtle did\nAnd basically made the uh the case that\nWe're nowhere near ending this FBI investigation as the turtles said the Schumer and the Democrats are moving the goalposts\nWe are looking at what judge Kavanaugh says at age fifty three not what he did at age Eighteen we're looking at his credibility now is grown adult\nAnd if you believe Dr Ford and judge Kavanaugh is not telling the truth just yesterday NBC News reported that either judge Kavanaugh people close to the judge Moore in communication with his classmates\nTo get them robot allegations by Deborah Ramirez it seems that judge Kavanaugh was at least very misleading to the Judiciary Committee about Mr ... story\nSo now it's up to Capitol lying\nIf Kavanaugh perjuring yourself and that means he's not qualified what they've got to make up their minds\nFirst he's a serial gang rape is actually throws ice on people at a bar Denise negative falling down drunk and now\nHe's a liar their flailing\nBut Sheldon Whitehouse totally out of character with his majority minority leader in the Senate Chuck Schumer\nYeah I think probably just might yeah there's not too many people to talk to hear me I've got a lot of shore or we can\nGet this done that's just to central maybe White Houses out their truck in the spirit here to be the public face of a reasonable Democrat Party while everybody else stays insane\nBut they are moving the goalposts but\nAnd yes for a delay but they're also trying to move the goalposts as a target where they can catch Kevin ... in anything\nUh there's one more than I Want to play and I'm looking for it and I just found it I Want you to go\nAudio soundbite number twelve the question of who leak Dr Ford's letter to Dianne Feinstein\nYou know this this is of leaking this letter my memory and this is kind of fuzzy but I remember Feinstein during a press conference were either on the foreigners ... judicial committed I
