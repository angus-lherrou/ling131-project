Fox News\nIn the forefront of his supporters mines so I've been studying the media to trying to get a handle on who actually might be behind this\nAnd here's what I have found today CNN is spending almost eighty percent of their time on the show ...\n\nEighty percent may have even if it's just sixty percent of their time on ... they're not focusing on the care of him\nThat tells me\nThat if the caravan weren't a Democrat idea design too embarrassed that they would be\nCovering it and building it up and with people down there interviewing these people creating sob stories it'd be there'd be man on the street interviews with a mean guy Trump is are they just want to come to America to and that may yet happened down the road that CNN\nIs is not wall to wall but they are predominantly focusing on the show Gabe and of course whatever CNN does just to try to damage Trump let's let ... wife CNN is so ticked off because Trump's approval numbers are higher than they've ever been out\nAnd there are higher than Obama's war at this stage in the ah in his mid germs at the same point in his presidency after two years there just beside themselves none of this\nIs happening the way it was supposed to happen now there's more and more stories on how the blue wave may not happen hip hid it never was going to happen I don't think anybody's ever know whether it's going to be a blue wave they've been relying on polling data but nobody knows for sure that was a media narrative\nIt was a meeting that was not born of any evidence there couldn't be any evidence for a blue wave or a red wave the election as an happened yet\nEverybody wants to rely on polling data to suggest that it's going to happen but the polling data hasn't been accurate either starting in two thousand sixteen or the presidential race\n\nSo we've got this caravan trucking north and I think you know put some things in perspective on this\nAgain the way to look at it is is as a\nA microcosm of what's happening every day at our border every day this is what's happening\n\nSeven thousand a day but but but every day\nThis is what's been going on for decades and it needs to stop and Donald Trump is the only person that's ever talked about working to make it stop now the Democrats\nIf there are behind this one of the strategic ... besides getting somebody hurts\nAnd blaming it on Trump maybe what they're hoping is that Trump actually won't do anything about it\nMaybe they're hoping that Trump will be all huff and puff talk about sending the military down they're talking about setting a National Guard down but not actually doing anything they might be rolling the dice that Trump isn't going to do anything because they think they've rattled Trump with their stories earlier this year about how he\nSeparated families the border and how Trump didn't like the ... didn't want it but last so he did what he could to change it I\nI Do know this despite\nEverything that you think you would know the common sense there are still Republicans elected Republicans look at this caravan and their solution is to let them in\n\nAs elected still there are so you're about peace yesterday they are so scared of this issue they are so scared\nThat when ever the subject to legal immigration comes up Democrats automatically when Republicans think they've got their show they're not cold hearted mean spirited and all that let them at their not publicly saying this but I Know that there\nMay be the Democratic gambling is too is is is a wild guess at Trump's actually not going to do anything after huffing and puffing and I'll tell ya if Trump doesn't do anything if this caravans allowed to get to the border and come into the country what do you think that wouldn't do the Trump\nThere's one the issue that's been separate Trump from his voters or at least make his do voters began to\n\nI don't no doubt is the right where would they would be mightily disappointed particularly after Trump has said over and over again that this caravan is not going to get it\nIf if if if some Republicans are behind this than that it's obvious uh but I just somebody has to be\n\nSomebody has to be making this cap and folks we're talking we we've got how many two thousand miles\nStop and think of this from Honduras to the southern\nBorder of the United states assistance say Arizona is around two thousand miles\nSeven thousand people one day just decided to\nStart walking to the United states\nTwo thousand miles\nI also think if you're looking for people behind this you have to look at the drug cartels and if you want to start trying to analyze will what their politics in this be that opens up a whole new can of worms but I don't doubt that they are playing a major role in transportation\nBut there has to be political involvement here too because money has to be available there has to be money being spent on this\nSo you've got seven thousand people who all of a sudden and decide all of a sudden because nobody saw this coming and there was no advance word of it seven thousand people decided to start walking to a thousand miles\nWe don't see pictures of of of where they're using the bathroom\nWe don't see pictures of them gathering or getting food and eating it\nI mean look at random video you might you might see some people truly things I mean we don't see how this is being handled we don't see the port a potties we don't see and are they just urinating and rivers and streams and what would the environmentalist wackos think about that if that's happening\n\nWell did it I guess you you may have a point welcome to San Francisco they could already be accustomed to it especially the decorations in the street and they got maps in San Francisco for tourists can blame the piles of human the fate [noise]\n\nSo how long would it take to walk two thousand miles along going to take\nRemember they're vowing altogether I just hit the southern border may cause they're vowing to get here by mid term election day\nSo I don't walk enough to know how many miles\nA day you could walk if you just start walking and you take a periodic break and after twelve or Eighteen or whatever you stop and slow down and rest\nFor the next day that people tell me that they would have to be walking something like twenty miles a day\n\nFor one hundred days I mean if that makes sense to a thousand miles\nTwenty miles a day for a hundred days without any rest\n\nA hundred days for those are real Linda that's over three months\nAnd the objective is to show up right\nAs the polls open on mid term election day so if they had been walking for what two and a half months\nHave we seen video of the walk and it's beginning\nRemember the caravan was originally thirty five hundred or four thousand people now it's swollen just seven thousand and the word is it may become ten thousand [noise]\nAnd then of course a ladies and gentlemen the caravan now has been joined by a second the caravan than we are just hearing about Fox News ... ... S P report to the second the caravan of illegal immigrants has formed in Honduras\nAnd has already crossed into Guatemala they're hoping they catch up to the main group\nAs the massive my grand caravan Bush's during the southern us border a second group of about one thousand people from Honduras is rushing\nTo join the main group which reportedly and swelled the ranks with several people who've already been ... or did the caravan which has around five thousand uh seven thousand members\nWas on a more again Monday morning departing the southern may cause city of ... Chula the smaller group trailing entered walk them my love from Honduras late Sunday according to be a pay\nSome in the second the caravan are said to have experience in getting across the border with includes a number of deportations have some of whom have been sent home multiple times\nEight twenty nine year old the amateur Anthony ... is\nReportedly was deported for the six time from the U.S five months ago said they catch you up and you try to get back he has a son and a U.S citizen girlfriend living in Birmingham, Alabama according to the Washington Post\nSo uh\nPerson that you know what I have\nI'm landmine joined me in ... in the fight I keep up and that's how you can how\n... years\nAgo making a murderer became less TV show than a force of nature and uncovered a grave injustice in the criminal justice he was also completely\nDishonest and I would know I'm Dan O'Donnell I covered this Steven Avery and Brendan gassy trials and now they're making a murderer is back I Am too with heart to overeat budding among the\nMounting a murderer is now in the ... radio I just open the book\nIs your financial advisor reproduce sharing this year she worked for you for the

it's your money keep it that way\n[noise]\n\nYou're listening to Russia's week in review and we're back great to have your Rush Limbaugh kicking off a brand new weak and broadcast excellence here an eight hundred to eight two to eight eight to [noise]\nOne more with Louie Gohmert he is from Texas He's on with the bill hammer and Sandra Smith this morning bill ... says Mike Pompeo was in Mexico city over the weekend said we're concerned that these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who would exploit them are also deeply concerned with the violence\nProvoked by some members of the group as well as the apparent political motivation of some organizers of the Caribbean by the way the the details on that story are from the uh\nOh here's one from NBC and they are literally outraged over what ... saying sectarian saint palm pale raised the stakes\nLast night as thousands of Central American migrants\nInvaders\nHeaded for the United states as they marched into may go claiming they were inciting violence palm pay also they're inciting violence under the influence of politically motivated leaders\nHow was it raising the stakes\nTo point out what is happening what is the secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes Sunday night how is it raising mistakes to point out what's happening\nEspecially when\nWe have a party a political party that believes in open borders a media and the party that believes in open borders they will never report anything negative about these invaders\nWho right mind would want this who in their\nRight mind wouldn't want any of this illegal immigration who in their right mind would promote this it wants this who wouldn't want a mob an invasion of seven thousand now eight thousand people to storm the border in the world would want that and why\n\nIt makes no commonsense under the umbrella of what's good for America\n\nWhat ever the motivation for the people who want this to happen it's not for the good of America it's got to be for something else so Pompeo goes down and promptly identifies what's happening here NBC says raising mistake once cakes\n\nWe have somebody finally pushing back on this because remember the Republican Party up until Trump never didn't push back on this they they came up with their own reasons for wanting\nAmnesty for illegals and form you know having a fall push on securing the border on Sunday night ... who met with the Mexican president went on the offensive alleging in a statement that many of the migrants were criminals themselves\nBy definition they are if they intend to cross the border illegally they're all criminals one of the world is\nSo damn hard to understand about this\n\nI think it's a classic illustration of how tough this country is getting in one of the reasons this country is getting soft just because the elderly or senior generations are turning over everything to the young who haven't lived long enough to know what's\nBest are being driven stole my by a motion govern slowly by a motion not any ... any kind of common sense and because of some odd quirk that's happened\nIn our sociology adults today seem unwilling to teach young people right and wrong or to helping benefit from the wisdom that comes from having lived a bunch of life and having a may I ask a bunch of experiences\nThere is no way under the sun this makes any sense what so ever\nWe may as well not have any border if this is something that people want to advocate for permitting and allowing males will just to raise the border and saint of the world come on in\nBecause that's in essence the impact of this if it's not stopped if it's not dealt with\nThe people of the world do not have an entitlement to the United states taxpayers back pocket but the Democrat Party assumes or seems to think that they do\nThe Democratic party is calculating that there are more people who want to get in to the American taxpayers back pocket then there are American taxpayers\nAnd saw the Democratic party is siding with the people around the world who have nothing who thinks that because the United states has a lot they should just\nBe able to come in and get whatever they want almost as an entitlement\nWe have a political party pushing this we have a political party promoting this this political party ought to be no where near winning any thing\nIn the next elections\nThere is not a single reason to vote for these people under any real breakup commonsense\n\nTake a look at the things they advocate take a look at the people they try to destroy take a look at the things they are promoting\nIt defies common sense to support this\nAnd frankly I don't think they have as much support as the media narratives would indicate I don't want somebody to tell you right now I don't believe and I haven't believe for a long time that there hasn't been a slam dunk blue wave what we're being told right now\nIs that six months ago nine months ago all the way back to December when the
