Ford and the pressure came from a former FBI agent again who's one of the\nBeach buddies of Dr Ford's if this isn't witness tampering and somebody needs to tell me what it is\nCharles Grassley was on Fox by Grassley as I mentioned at the end of the yesterday's program Grassley has been a buyers' something has really\nSet him off I Would\nThink that it would have happened ... years and years and years ago but whatever something has really set him off now\nHe's going after the press accusing them face to face of out right by us he's accusing the Democrats are being insincere\nDoing great harm to the Senate what a grass means points just ... and John Cornyn do if we're going to get rid of somebody on the basis of an allegation with no proof what are we doing for every future nominated comes before this committee\nIf the new standard is is it all the nominee has to be is accused of something and that kills the nomination\nThen where are we headed we're headed exactly where the Democrats want\n\nJust to refresh remembered bossy foreign and leaving Kaiser were were ... some ... some say best friends at the time of the alleged attack by chemical\nWhen Kaiser's denial was brought up during the hearing before the Senate Judiciary committee balls the Ford attempted to discredit her by saying what she's got help\n... ...\nI don't know but she was not well I I felt really bad and for her\n\nTurns out that Leland Kaiser is a former pro golfer she does have back problems but not mental health issues ... Monica McLean again ... lifelong best friend and the woman boldly Ford allegedly coach prior to taking a polygraph test\nIs Monica Monica McLean is all over this story we only learned her name in the past week or so\n\nAccording to reports Monica ... plan was a bully forward side and the hearing room before she ... she was I have now seeing photos anyway Grassley said on Fox and friends this morning if there is evidence in the FBI report than other witnesses were leaned on by allies with Baltic port is ...\nWell not just legal then Kaiser other witnesses were leaning that means every senator has seen that every senator just read the report his seen this\n\nAnd that apparently isn't changing any votes of the vote was fifty one to forty nine mansion flake and Collins all voting yes but the final vote cannot happen by Senate rule\nBefore for forty two pm eastern time tomorrow has to be thirty hours after this vote was taken\nNow I Want to\nSay I'm not surprised by Murkowski who voted no a lot of people are asking is the vote now gonna not going to change I mean if we have the cloture vote we got the procedural vote fifty one forty nine you know folks because I'm going to tell you what's happening out there\nI have I have been made privy to some of the comments not just on social media but so the officers that so many Republican senators are getting their being Daewoo used\nTheir entire families are being threatened their grandchildren are being threatened their wives or their husbands bar made everybody they know being threatened it's enormous\nIt is never ending the phones don't stop bringing a threatening emails and tweets do not stop arriving in his ... it is vile and it is evil and it's not just like\nAn Collins and Manchin it's all the Republicans are hearing it is one of the most disgusting things many of these people say they've ever seen\nIn that regard Jeff Flake and Susan Collins\nI think they have\nTo be credited for doing the right thing they are both facing enormous pressures\nFlake is getting pressure like you can't believe for not only members of they paid professional mobs squad on the left but other Democrats are in the Senate and on the Judiciary Committee\nAnd\nI don't think for for as far as flake is concerned he voted today for\nKavanaugh in is it's not technically have over Kavanaugh's of vote to go to a final vote\nAnd the rule of thumb always is that as these procedural votes goes so goes the final vote but but but you can't make book on that simply because of the average jak real frightening threats these people are getting\nAnd I think the vote for flake today was really hard I'll tell you why he went from being a yes vote to being harassed on the elevator\nTo becoming a yes vote with the FBI investigation he got what he wanted there still leaning on him he's leaving the Senate this is his final term the\nEasy thing to do here would be to vote against Kavanaugh and received the praise of the mob and receive the praise of the Democrats and he went ahead and he voted\nIn what many of us think is the right way he did the right thing is going to be attacked viciously he is going to be a cost and by the left all the way through the rest of the day tonight and tomorrow the\nSame thing with Susan Collins a senator from Maine\nI Can't describe for you you might\nHave an idea you probably know the things that are being sent to these people the rats that they are getting\n\nBeing alive and notion that we live in a civilized society\n\nIt's unhinged much of it is is insane and deranged and is made up of the psychological disorders that I Believe constitute and how the mainstream of the Democratic party the protestors are paid their signs\nAre all identically manufactured in the same phrases all over them\n\nAnd these people I don't know if you've received threats and I don't know if you've been ...\nBy them but if you have an if you believe them they can under review\nAnd yet flake and Collins did the right thing here I only hope that they're able to maintain their positions not Collins has announced that she's going to make a statement after three o'clock today\n\nAnd of course everybody's on pins and needles wondering what that's going to be not the thinking on this goes that that there is no way she would vote yes on the procedural vote this morning\nIf her intention is to vote no down the road if you're going to kill the nomination do it now not tomorrow I don't think any of these theories or traditions\nCan be hoisted up and used and rely on I think we're in we're in brand new territory here for a number of reasons I don't think you can say that just because\nSusan Collins voted yes this morning means a guarantee she's going to vote yes tomorrow and then why make a statement at three o'clock why why make some but why three o'clock and why make some statement\nI Try to keep my ego out of this as much as I can tell when I see somebody is going to make a statement at three o'clock first thing I realize is I'm not going to be here to comment on it\n\nIn his world people that matter they have a lot of er just up in arms overdose and he's standing up for doing the right thing here so\nI Want to play an audio soundbite for you a ... and this is they give you an idea what's happening to fly and it's happening all I remember that elevator confrontation where these two women in a CNN camera just\nRan into the elevator and ambushed a guy started shouting and they ... it looked like it totally a nerve damn\nWell the woman and it was portrayed by CNN it's just a couple of citizens are happened to be walking through the Senate they saw flake and I got limited they tracked him down and they went on the elevator an average citizen journalists they weren't average citizen part of the pay mob and one of the bands involved at MIT said\nThis morning on C.

I feel very encouraged that\nActually people around the country and feeling for that were happening when overcoming some of our fears and doing things for the first night he who was then the elevator with me never talked to like that official we spent ... minutes before we felt like talking about how they do that and\nJust tell him I guess\nRight so you're seeing a sitting outside planning there's little coaching going on\nA Anna Maria art GI is the uh call executive director of the center for popular democracy which is a Soros Hillary Clinton Trump group\nBut the point is they're not average ordinary citizens outraged by what's going on the political activists but the press portrays this people is just outrageous American women outrage the status of male dominance in America and

with the fallout will talk about a Monday morning three and six ten on Canada the [noise]\nThe course of the many recent months I have made the point that one of the objectives of the modern American leftist to transform America I'm away from its intentions and its designs is founded\nAnd in many ways this was one of the agenda objectives of the Obama administration wants to do it in the stealth white Obama couldn't come out and\nSay beyond that his policies were transformative uh he couldn't define what that meant\nA there would've been a revolt that he wouldn't have been elected him he'd been honest about what transferring America man so what did he claimed that man was taking on issues like climate change and health care for everybody and all this transform America but what they really want to do was transformed America away from\nOur unique founding\nConverted to a socialist democracy some of the radicals even want to go further and and and have this country become totally communist back\nLooking there's a poll out here today this from the Daily Caller Jay Paul is a buzzfeed news thirty one percent of millennials\nIdentify as democratic socialist according to a study that\nHas been taking\nA [noise] you know you'd like to not believe this but the facts on the grounds as to what you see [noise]\nEven though it may be anecdotal evidence indicates that a lot of them have fallen for this millennial men were far more likely to identify a some kind of socialist and women a total of forty percent responding affirmative late to the question now how would that help can that\nBe 'cause there's one thing or something just doesn't jibe with socialism you know what it is self reliance\nSelf reliance taking yourself seriously standing up for yourself believing in yourself relying on yourself\nBeing a man just does not jibe with socialism socialism does not work well with self reliant people socialism and communism attempt to her race self reliant people self reliant people people that do not need\nDo not depend on anybody but themselves their immediate circle are a huge threat\nTo social is in Congress or how the hell is this happened\nHow is it forty percent of millennial men have become socialist more than women it ought to be the exact opposite\n\nWell hello modern era feminism which has had as one of its targets that the masculine as they should have men and they've been very open and honest about that they've even conjure up terms for it toxic masculinity dangerous\nMasculinity they are doing their best to erase mailed natural male characteristics\nFor as many young guys as they can and since guys want to power around with women whatever women want is what many end up doing on balance I mean you have individual exceptions of course\nYou got Clint Eastwood's or you've got James cons at tell everybody to go to hell when they're told how to live and how to act but on balance men do what women want 'em to do if the big\nBook as famous and hot women did get men are going to go say they're reading it or try to become conversant and it\nJust the nature of things and so they're being highly highly successful\nAnd targeting America and its founding not just targeting capitalism it's targeting the concepts of individual liberty and freedom and targeting the concept that government is the institution that needs to be limited most\nIn a representative republic that the emphasis of government the getting government out of people's lives just the exact opposite with communism socialist so I have an evidence base here\n\nNot just slapping my gums there's a New Yorker story by Michael lift up\nA guy published yesterday the cheers of Brett Kavanaugh is its title\nIt is a horrible peace and it does exactly that which I had been warning people it goes all the way back to the founding of America the trash white men oh that reminds me hang on here you need a grab an audio soundbite\nHere it's a bit of that but I Do but it would you be every bit of six and seven [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n... quote Kavanaugh has no avenue of appeal do except his own hurt feelings he's in touch with them as he was taught to be and so he seemingly weaponized crying the way a little boy does when he's in trouble\nAnother pool quote\nBut Kevin last performance last Thursday was something entirely different distinctly contemporary if combined the post war attitude that men should be in touch with their feelings to the point that they make crime\nWith the intrinsic American ideal of white male privilege because Kevin is accused of sexual assault and may be denied the career elevation he has long plotted he blah burned like a newborn\nHe has plot ... his career you'll see\n\nHe hasn't had a series of goals in

you were just speaking of the person that contacted\n'em as Kaiser on trying to get her to possibly change your testimony yeah uh she she used the same person that the boyfriend or Dr Ford mentioned in the letter he sent him talking about how a heating and those costs\nGoing on but Dr Ford on trying to get somebody to handle it polygraph\nProbably yeah that's another story by the way to boyfriends letter has yet to be reported in mainstream media nor has the story of Monica McLean pressuring Leland Kaiser to change your test those two stories have not been\nReported ABC CBS NBC Washington Post New York times Associated Press people have not heard either of that\nAnd there's other things like for example a Dr Ford mentioned in her Senate and the testimony she goes she mentioned ... Delaware with where she was at and that's the last known address of of this moniker McLean\nCorrect yes absolutely that's when they wrote a letter when when when ... Ford wrote the letter that's where she was she was a ... a Delaware with McLean yeah\nHere's my question there's there's an emerging picture that there might be a lot going on but beyond that on the scene here that hasn't come out yet I I'm Wondering is not is it is the Democrat oddly enough or not better off holding this vote now for more of this comes out\n...\nGoing to go through at the last minute\nChange one of the people that things are going to vote changes that suddenly it goes down and a quarter and then because all this is about to come out\nNo it's not about to come out that's the whole point\nYou know it but it's not going to come out it hasn't come out yet it's not going to come out now one thing it has the lead when Kaiser a pressure to change your testimony that is in the FBI report the Democrats have seen that Grassley referenced it and Grassley said there's a lot more\nThere are many more examples of Baltimore foreign witnesses being pressure to change your test of on the Democrats have seen all that it doesn't change and it's going to change anything this is not about the evidence\nIt never has been about the evidence\nAnd if those two stories miraculously made the front page of the New York times website in five minutes and it ABC CBS NBC began to report on this if it wouldn't change one Democrat Senate vote\nDemocrats delayed about anyway that's up to McConnell the turtle\n... well the question is why wouldn't Republicans make make a greater effort for it to come out\nWhy would it make better ever took up a [noise]\nIt's in the FBI report the Republicans I think Democrats can see it it's the the the Monica McLean aspect is in the FBI report they discovered it looked\nTo my to my knowledge none of the senator grassroots so forth are not mentioned but we were just talking about\nNo no they're not I can't tell you why they're not ... okay thank you you bet I'm Wondering myself um well\nI Know your questions are entirely legitimate and they're rooted in pure commonsense\nYou're sitting there thinking if the world know this it would change everything it shows that the ... side is willing\nTo commit perjury ... born perjury pressure witnesses to change their stories which then couldn't be sad to conclude that there's not anything that ball Z Ford is saying it's reliable\nBut those two stories have not been seen by the American public at large they've not shown up at Yahoo News the Associated Press New York Times CBS NBC CNN and they want\nFor the exact reason the stories are being suppressed but the Democrats in the Senate

adamant\nThis week the turtle and Grassley has been fit to be tied Grassley still Grassley sent a letter late last night Grassley said his letter at four AM today\n\nTo uh I I I guess he sent it to Schumer you might've Senator Feinstein and in this whether he calls out Mazie Hirono the senator from her by e M Feinstein by name\nAnd let me read just a portion of grass when his letter indeed if the evidence supported your clients allegations us shortly what producer this quickly is you could\nBut you have repeatedly refused to produce this evidence to the Senate in doing so you are preventing the Senate from considering the evidence most crucial Dr forge allegations\nI don't know what other infringe we should draw from your refusal but with the withheld evidence that the withheld evidence does not support Dr Ford's allegations in quite the way you've claimed\nThis is the polygraph he's talking about the notes with a polygraph and the therapist notes Feinstein and the Democrats have not produce those even though balls eat Ford admitting\nThat she took a lie detector\nWill her warriors and that that she had seen a therapist and the grass and we've been asking for that evidence and Feinstein and the Democrats have not produced it and he's saying you have repeatedly refused to produce this\nAnd in doing so you're preventing the Senate from considering the evidence most crucial to Dr forge allegations she passed elect attacked or we want to see it\nThey won't let them see it\nI don't know what other infringe we should draw from your refusal but that the withheld evidence does not support her allegations in quite the way you have claimed\nAs a reasonable thing to say they're out there saying she's not gonna lie detector that she passed the lie detector that she told all these details tour therapist who am I see that stuff and they won't produce\nAnd Grassley said you're must be you must have something to hide there\nHe writes I urge you once again now for the third time in writing to turn over to therapy and now it's the polygraph materials and communications with the Washington Post Dr Ford has relied upon as evidence\nIn addition to the evidence I requested in October second letter in light of recently uncovered information please turn over records and descriptions of direct or indirect communication between Dr Ford or her representatives and and I am following one\nUS Senators are their staffs particularly the offices of Feinstein and Hirono\nNumber two the alleged witnesses identified by Dr Ford Leland Kaiser mark

and he's right the leadership of the resistance is the Democratic party the resistance is over the Democratic National Committee\nAnd in various Senate offices and offices of Congress members of the

last night from Salinas Ito who has made a name for herself\nBy traveling through all of these blue states during the election campaigns season of two thousand sixteen she went through all of these places in blue states that were going to vote for Trump and she learned anything about these people she could\nShe took them seriously\nShe went and met them and talk to them learn about them nobody else in the drive by media has done anything like this\nBut she wanted to find out who they are she lives in Pittsburgh she had a sense that something was happening out there that the Washington establishment didn't see and rather than gas she actually wanted to find out who these people are she went to a lot of small towns\nMedium sized town spent serious time they're getting to know these people she has stayed in touch with them\nEver since the election she has written a book about it if the Democrats in the media wanted to know who has been voted for Donald Trump all they'd have to do is go get her book they haven't they don't read it they don't care to know who the Trump voters are\nThey're not interested in appealing to them they're trying to find out ways to make Trump voters irrelevant or keep them away from the polls they want to separate Trump and his voters from themselves but they're not interested in finding out who they are so as to maybe convert them\nTo ah never Trump or his or anti Trump presents an amazing display of arrogance\nAnd by the way the same can be said of Republican political consultant so they don't care who the Trump voters are all that matters is that they are left out in ... and made fun of so I get a note from last night\nAnd she is explaining to me what the camping on hearings have meant and what has happened out there in these areas she has studied\nAnd she made essentially two points\n\nOne that something has needed to happen after the two thousand sixteen election to keep the coalition that voted for Trump together now a lot of us of assumed that if people voted for Trump in two thousand six day and that they did so for very specific reasons\nAmong them Trump is alone in fighting the Washington establishment that Trump is alone in in in pushing back against Democrats and the so called Washington conventional wisdom\nAnd then the assumption is that if people knew that in two thousand six game that they would not forget that and that they would realize the need to continue\nTo vote in ways that would continue to support and unable Trump to be successful and she makes the point that it doesn't work that way sadly\nThat after a single election with the known result something needs to happen besides just another election of party members or Trump is not on the ballot something needs to happen to make those people as eager to vote two years later as they did in two thousand sixteen\nAnd that\nIs the Kavanaugh circumstance in her mind the conservative populist coalition\nThat elected Trump needed something outside of Trump to coalesce around in the midterms in other words in her study of things\nGet ideas get involved [noise] get going and let's move dot Gov\nThat's let's move all the USDA ha jak

O. J. and the FBI\nAnd characters who weren't involved in the Hillary Clinton email investigation and the Trump Russia collusion investigation how does that happen\nIf you're just a woman out in Santa Cruz or Paolo Alto and you'll see that Brett Kavanaugh has been nominated to be on the Supreme Court and you don't think you should be because you think one time he\nAttacked you you send a letter to Dianne Feinstein the next thing you know\nWell no no no that's used and finally signed a letter after traveling to Delaware to meet with your buddy Monica McClain who probably writes the letter for you because of the inclusion of Cleveland Kaiser as a he not a woman which\nHe is so you're just you're a beach pay him a psychology professor whatever from California and you end up\nWriting a letter after traveling to Delaware after saying you're afraid of flying\nAnd their lawyers don't tell you that the committee's wanting to fly out to California to interview you\n\nI I I was I didn't know I Know you I I you I Would have all of you in my home if you add ...\nI don't even think I buy this they she didn't want them to come out there because she was going to go to Delaware to meet with McLean she didn't want the committee seeing who she was meeting with\n\nThis whole thing required her to come to Washington for this the pulled off she had to come to Washington\n\nSo we look at Hillary Clinton's email server investigation and the Trump Russia collusion or what do we find a woman who happens to be helping balls the Ford defeat Brett Kavanaugh and his nomination to the Supreme Court\nWith every Democrat staying within minutes of Kevin all being nominated they're going to oppose it\nWith every Democrats that they believe her even though she doesn't have any evidence of time magazine just\nPut her on the cover to cover at time magazine it was a ...\nA lasting she's she's she's seen taking meals a it's pathetic\nThis whole thing is going to set up is my point and the people that set it up are the same people that have been running the sign with coups against Donald Trump\n\nAnd every Democrat on the Senate Judiciary committee knows everything I just told you but rather than it'd be a problem they're telling themselves how well organized they are and how brilliantly they pull this off in their world\nThey've made the American people really believe that this woman was minding your own business one day when she was Fifteen and this nominee to the court came and brutalized her\nAnd she's just a woman she\nLikes to children in\nFear of bees here\nI think what a masterful plant we pulled off we got everybody in this country thinking\nAged summing it didn't happen did that we have nothing to do with it\nWhen this whole thing is an orchestrated screenplay\nAnd that's why ... won't turn over any of the cycle or the therapy and the polygraph information\nFor the Judiciary Committee to look at and the Republicans notice too but the power of the Democrats look at the Republicans that are quivering and a little afraid to go ahead and can confirm Kavanaugh\nThis democratic machine is a scary scary bunch Democrat machine includes the media and all of these\nPsychological deranged protesters that are out there threatening and in some cases committing violence\nAnd rhino metal safe well check out their extensive beaver network on line at rhinos safe dot com veteran own didn't veteran operated for over Twenty years that's our H.

Dianne Feinstein Cory Booker Kamala Harris to leave judge Brett Kavanaugh subject to claims of perjury and the impeachment which they're going to pursue by the way oh ... yeah or doing\n[noise] is another interesting thing handled her new develop it here but hang on just second here's a second tweet from Kimberly stressful\nLisa Murkowski Republican Alaska\nToday voted to abandon due process and the presumption of innocence she voted to potentially if the Supreme Court and a four Ford that block\nWhich puts loaning Ninth Circuit court of appeals in control of everything that matters to Alaska her state\nDevelopment property rights gun rights environmental rules Lisa Murkowski has made quite the statement\n\nThese are two devastating tweets and they are right on the money legitimizing in signing off on the most despicable tactics ever standing with Feinstein Cory Booker Kamala Harris who is in a class by herself\nAnd men dasa they and and a number of other things just just\n[noise] not much redeeming there but\nMore importantly Lisa Murkowski has voted to leave Kavanaugh subject to claims of perjury and impeachments\nAnd then leaving the court if he's not confirmed the courts stays up for for a deadlock what the ... the reason that matters is that in a way if the court votes for four and then the case then the decision prior to the court hearing it is affirmed nothing changes\nAnd that means that the Ninth Circuit court of appeals would be the highest ranking court\nThat could make decisions regarding fundamental aspects of life in Alaska her own home state\nIt is it would be ... to put the night if you're a Republican and by the way she does believe in property rights and development and gun rights and to put the Ninth Circuit court of appeals in a bunch of a leftist in charge of those issues in her state they're just shooting herself in the foot\nAll just supposedly be in unison with the me too movement\n[noise] so I mentioned we had a couple of photos\nOf Dianne Feinstein it looks like she has cornered Murkowski\nI don't know when the photos were taken presumably they are recent we can find out we just have checked ... wardrobe on a particular day of hearings\nBut go ahead and Scott put it in the sweat you're for those of you I'm watching the dental camp there is a picture and stand by 'cause we have a close up there is a picture of Dianne Feinstein literally when Lisa Murkowski up against a wall in a hallway of a Senate office building\nAnd\nThey are chatting with each other and Murkowski has a hand look on her face Feinstein that looks like\nShe is well the\nPicture speaks for itself it it it would that hand up she got a cornered she got her hand up on the wall framing Murkowski\nIt's an aggressive move it allows Feinstein leaning in to Murkowski\nNow let's switch to the close up of that photo for those will be watching on the digital camera do you see the pain the expression on the face of Murkowski and the expression of in hand\nSeriousness and you better be listening to me\nOn the face of die for\nNow we'll have these photos up at Rush Limbaugh dot com to I'm not trying to leave it buddy out but I Want to you watching on the digital camera to be able to see these\nThat's that close up as the same shot just to close up of the previously televised photo is that right\nWell done here looking here says why Feinstein sure does look like a bully and Murkowski looks very uncomfortable she not\n\nMeans it's been really pain look on her face and it it looks like Feinstein is running this relationship it looks like Feinstein is giving her what for [noise]\n[noise] I don't know when the picture was taken and I will acknowledge that our interpretation could be wrong we we have no context here other than the hearings and the way this has been going\nWell I wouldn't call that romantic I take that back ah one of these is from California and romance there has all kinds of shapes informed so you could be

story her opponent is Phil Bredesen\nAnd\nBreathe is and is saying that he is disgusting and that if he was in the Senate he wouldn't vote to confirm capital and he's a Democrat running against the incumbent Marsha Blackburn\nWhat is a Democrat doing saying that he would vote to confirm\nCapital this is in the ... this was in the middle of a campaign here now I Know what to Tennessee and it's deep red\nThat'll just wants to win and so forth but\nThis he expects this to pay off for him in his campaign this is obviously a reaction and reflection\nOf public sentiment for Kavanaugh in this state of Tennessee\n\nPhil Bredesen is by the way starting to lose ground to Marsha Blackburn in polling data this is my co workers seats And Corker by the way he was also tweeted today that it is outrageous\nTo punish somebody who hasn't done anything to anybody\nFor all of these some pose an actions are there are men have engaged in against women\nBut his point is we have no evidence Kavanaugh did anything to anybody we're going to design a seat on the court because of that and then the next day we're going to die because of the judicial temperate temperament and then we're going to deny because they committed perjury and I've been going to deny it because if your eyes at a bar back when he was in college\nBut Corker made a plan that he doesn't think\nKevin ... should be held accountable for things he has on his ... that's kind of like the affirmative action argue but when one of the world are we going to be punishing people here for racial discrimination when they have
