{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KNST", "content": "[noise] I'm going to get to that CNN [noise]\nCNN playing an impartial sound bite me to make it look like I was trying to make the case of can show you deserve to get killed because he was an ally of Osama bin Laden I never said any such thing I sending in fact the exact opposite so yeah yeah a lot of people\nWorked up about that here on the other side of the glass I'm going to get to it\nOr in due course same thing on this transgender business Trump diminished ration is attempting to eliminate the whole classification and I'm going to tell you why I agree with that but all of that coming up here's the final Louie Gohmert bite again bill hammer\nOut we're concerned these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who would exploit them were also concerned\nAh there's Pompeo saying this we're concerned about violence promote by some members of this group\nAll of these people are trying to force their way and it's called an invasion and thank God we have a president that will stand up to an invasion of like\nThis but under our constitution that Governor\nCan call out military troops to stop an invasion and I've heard people on TV so called experts say where you can use the military because of ... that normally prevents a military from being used against its own citizens\nIt has nothing to do with using the military to stop an invasion from another country so there's nothing unconstitutional illegal about the president doing what we do our Wilson did put tens of thousands of people on the border\nAnd make sure nobody forces there way no\nIt's a no brainer folks get is a number of the president can do that and has committed to it\nYou didn't you you you he may not send the military and I may call as a as a congressman Gohmert says there but there's no law says he can't this isn't about what is one of seven thousand Russians\nWere about to force their way into the okay\nWhat uh seven thousand Russians are about to force their way through the southern border\nTo try to affect the mid term elections what if we can make that case what do you think the people would eat demanding Trump do stand aside life uh seven thousand Russians in so they can hack our computers and make sure the Republicans win them in terms of it's a joke folks at the joke you never know who's listening\nI'm just asking what if it's seven thousand Russian communists think always trying to get in\nAn invasion either way you look at here is Mike in Youngstown, Ohio getting a call in here in the first hour welcome sir how are you\nGood good Russian I Hope you and your family's all doing good listen I I think this has all the makings of a bad set up for Trump\nBecause of the optics are I don't care if you're a militarized border that if they bomb rushed the border like the ... down in the southern side of Mexico where they tried to stop what's our military is supposed to break out the times or water hoses or\nTear gas that's just going to look so bad that Trump is going to take the brunt of it but he needs to do is call a a house and the Senate back in the emergency session and do a national address and put everybody on the line not just try to deal with this self\nSo bringing back in for a special session or do what pass legislation specifically saying that this mob is seven thousand can't come in\nSomething though that sort\nI mean do you think Trump needs to share the burden of providing the obstacles that if Trump sends a military down and he started cracking heads and it looks bad for Trump exactly so you think that's what the actual intention here is by the people who planned this thing\nExactly and that's where he can try to deal with this on his own he needs to put everybody else or but on the line get 'em on tape on film or whatever what should we do what what do you like to do if they come across\nActually like that in a way I like making Schumer and Pelosi stand up for

the other to get into office they do just the exact opposite so it's been a perfect storm for the\nMedia they've had Republicans who are elected properly intended David they've been able to persuade you that various Republican stink not worth your support we've been able to get rid of pretty much whoever they want it to\nJim Acosta in Houston, Texas last night twenty five thousand people outside

after all of his hard work trying to get you to abandon Trump to see the truth about Trump and you keep falling for the lives and you keep falling for the hate yeah you're on the problem Jeff Flake was also at\nThe CNN event yesterday the citizens CNN conference it was just Wolf Blitzer is afternoon show at some convention setting in New York City and here's Jeff Flake weighing in on this\nTo me now [laughter] it's just gone so far beyond you're not expecting the president to pet it anymore but what is troubling as the ... behind him\nAnd see the reaction of people to what he says and that's what's more troubling to me how as far as to who believes [noise] and he does it I think because it's still works instill rile people up\nThat divides us horribly yeah oh it's\nJust it's very very dangerous it's very bad out there Trump spreading lies stoking fear and the election there's Jeff Flake or who himself has been rejected by people like you went to Arizona voters in Arizona couldn't get reelected saw\nHe now says what's really troubling the look behind Trump and see the reaction of people do what he says and that's what's more troubling to me now\nWho believes is\nHe does it I think because it's still works at sea so Trump Trump as he pretty smart Trump knows when he's ... knows that you're idiots in Trump knows that you're fools and Trump knows that you'll fall for anything\nAnd so Trump is ... is working is spending like magic on you and and and people like Jeff Flake in the Washington establishment never Trump hers hey resent the hell out of Trump Trump knows what he's done so I guess Trump's not so stupid\nNow you are which takes me to one piece\nThat I had ready to go yesterday but didn't get to it David go lurking ... brilliant brilliant brilliant professor at Yale\nHis specialty is computer science but we have cited his work countless times\nOn this program over the past Twenty years we've even interviewed him for the Limbong letter way back when computer science professor at Yale chief scientist at detach L\nL C most recent book tides of mind and his piece yesterday the real reason they hate Trump\nAnd let me give you some pull quotes from this piece every big us elections interesting but the coming midterms are fascinating in for a reason most commentators forget to mention\nThe Democrats have no issues the economy is booming\nAmerica's international position is strong in foreign affairs the U.S has remembered in the Nick of time what Machiavellian biased\nPrint says five centuries ago don't seem to be loved to seek to be feared in contrast with the Obama years it must be painful for any honest leftist\nFor future generations the Kavanaugh fight will stand as a marker of the Democratic party's intellectual bankruptcy the flashing red light on the dashboard that says empty\nThe left is beaten\nAnd this is so right on the money they're not have to resort to these charades and and and really devastating tricks like this caravan the whole Kavanaugh episode was was intellectually bankrupted was morally bankrupt it was politically bankrupt and yet they persistent with it\nEven to the point of tearing not that they were destroying and American Life and American family in American career ended American future they couldn't have cared less\nThis is the bankruptcy of decency and the Democrat Party has non left\nAs this or a larger says this has happened before in the eighties in the nineties in the early to thousands but then the financial crisis arrive to save liberalism from certain destruction\nToday leftists pray that Robert Mueller will put on his Superman outfit and save them again for now though the let's only issue is we hate Trump\nThis is an instructive hatred because what the left hates about Donald Trump is precisely what it hates about America the implications here are important and they're painful\nThis is instructive hatred because what the left hates about Donald Trump is precisely what it hates about America\nAnd hate America it does smokes\n\nNothing every leftist hates America but the leftist either no right to alert or at Yale\nThey do hate Trump they hate Trump's vulgarity they have his unwillingness to walk away from a fight they hate his blood as they hate his certainty that America is exceptional they hate his mistrust of intellectuals\nThey hate his love of simple ideas that work\nThey have his refusal to believe that men and women are inter changeable and worst of all he doesn't have any ... except getting the job done his goals are to do the task before him\nNot be pushed around it otherwise enjoying life in short Donald Trump is a typical American except exaggerated because he has no constraints to cramp his style except the ones he himself\nIn vans and uses I'll tell you folks this is a heck of a paragraph in his instructive itself they hate Trump's vulgarity and yet they are the kings of vulgarity\nDemocrat Party the American laughter synonymous with vulgarity they but they sit there and hypocritical claimed to despise Trump's\nThey hate that he won't walk away from a fight they hate that he is blind they hate\nHe is certainty that America is decent than exceptional they hate certainty that's what I have found over the years that people that have had some serious problems with me I was able to boil it down they hated the fact I was so\nCertain that I didn't have any doubts about what I Believe\nI've had so many people are just not right and everybody has their you you do some way to do nobody can be that\nKind of an open I Am I Know your full of it fine no you're wrong and I know you haven't even thought halfway about this or you'd be doing the right thing\nThey can't stand that they love the quid vacation they love people see the both sides if things they he reaching\nOut with the heart they hate certain the especially when it conflicts with their own\nNow back to Trump he lacks constraints that the left hates him or because he's filthy rich always has been\nAnd unlike other rich man he rebels and well he doesn't feel any need to apologize for it ever he never learned to keep Israel opinions to himself because he's never had to he never learned to be embarrassed that he's male with ordinary mail proclivities guy went swimming\nDoesn't see the need to apologize for it sometimes he's treated women disgraceful you for which Americans left in Ryder ashamed of him as they are of JFK and Bill Clinton but\nGo workers as my job as a voter is choose the candidate who will do best for America I'm Sorry about the course most of ... constrained the average American Mr Trump conveys that course and this is unprecedented makes us look bad other nations but on the other hand\nMany of Trump's opponents\nWorry too much about what other people think I Would love the steam of France and Germany and Japan but I don't find myself losing sleep over it\nThe difference between citizens who hate Mr Trump and those who can live with him\nThey love are merely tolerate him comes down to their views of the typical American the farmer the factory hand the author\nFact that this election was they're stolen from them and now it's time to make it All right and they are convinced that you want Trump investigated to aunt there just to be tied to heaven persuade you to join\nThe so now you're part of the problem and so the American left in the media are actually trying to create a nation that consists of a majority of angry deranged\nLunatics in order to get what\nThey the media and the Democrats want that's what they're trying to create right in front of our eyes\nLooking for an event and smack dab in the middle of London it was\nTerrible and\nAwful [laughter]\nWhat is going to be arrested two\nOr three and seven Ninety three sons most humiliating\nTalk three years ago making a murderer became less the TV show than a force of\nNature

mall but he didn't want to call them all he said it was only a few thousand people\nAnd then I take my lunch break and they have another NPR a personality\nSaying that it's such a humanitarian disaster now that they're standing by the order of John ... making his eyes water so they use a mob\nThey don't want to see mark they use what whenever it is for them it is to them they don't want to say mom they want to say it's only a few thousand people when it's good for them but when it's not when they want to use the humanitarian side\nIt's such a disaster but there's\nYou know thousands of people on the line went on he couldn't even see the end of it the way they can go back\nRight so uh your conclusion from all this is\nThat oh NPR is a great did you want to listen to NPR you want to know what the enemies doing or what they're up to that for that day listening to NPR and they're trying to use the situation for whenever it means for them and that meant it they can that\nYou've got four we've got a bad we've got a a a a bad a connection here uh about\nThe only time I read it and NPR is when they run pieces to translate what I've said\nOh for the audience and that happens when I get the soundbites on that\nMaybe once every two or three weeks a ... of course NPR's not going to call it a mob\nNPR is supportive of whatever this group of people is doing and what is this group of people do it who are these people\nWe're being led to believe that these are average ordinary Hondurans Guatemalans El Salvador and fleeing poverty\nWar\nTorn poverty and a ... or whatever\nAnd they just organically happen you know these people is amazingly on the same day citing believe and they\nJust they just they just they just human beings and they just have a decent life you know in in in in and they're coming to the United states\n\nAnd of course Trump and the Republicans are a bunch of mean spirited extremist cold hearted SOB zoo want these people that keep suffering\nThat's the picture that's the picture being painted one of these people really doing\nWe've got reporters embedded in there now we know we hear what they're saying they're talking about Trump being you know an assault me screwed Trump Trump simpler Trump's a Nazi this there's no doubt this is a political movement it has been orchestrated an designed them as being paid for by somebody\nAnd it has one express purpose it has as its purpose to flood\nThe American southern border and to demand to be let in\nSomebody thinks or some group of people think somehow that this is helpful to the Democrat cause\n\nOther ways this could be helpful to Democrats causes if some damn of violence occurs to them or if I'm\nA they're able to show that Trump and his supporters are so mean spirited cold hearted that they don't care about the suffering of deny the entry in this kind of thing\nBut but for the media to act like this is a a normal news event like any other normal news event it just happened to we're going to cover it and we're going to report it but that there is no political objective attached to this is absurd\nI mean I I saw a um [noise] I saw a video tape of what's this guy's Jorge\n... Ramos or whatever it is it what does he tell among do ... what what what does it tell us tell them no but what is it Univision right\nAnd he's standing there as as a bunch of these people are walking past it I don't know where he was ... somewhere in the midst of the mob where packs of three and four or walking by and by the way\n[laughter] they don't look like the kind of people you'd want to run into you know on the street I mean they they just anyway he's standing there and these people are walking past them\nLooking at 'em they're behind him and then they walk past him on his left shoulder\nAnd managing for he's telling everybody who they are\nAnd what they want and why we must let them in and then there are different people and all they want us a better life and that we as Americans we owe it to these people and let them in the all they want is what we want we all have these\nVarious humanitarian objectives in common and I'm asking myself how wouldn't work and this guy vouch for whatever it is now eight thousand people but there he was down there vouch in trying to tell everybody watching him\nThat these are ... these are the prince and princesses in Central America these people are beyond reproach\nHe doesn't know them he has no idea who except I think he does I think he knows what the political objective is here and I think he supports it and is doing everything he can to advocate for this bunch which intends to be disruptive and destructive\nBut to sit there and to try to vouch for eight thousand people and to tell his audience who they all are and why we owe them and why we need to open our borders to them\nAlthough Democrats remain strongly favored to win back the house overhead and TV pictures of thousands marching north have the Democrats book asked if the timing worry them and national Democrats strategist said in the Senate yeah\n[noise] white\nSo in the house it's a good deal in the Senate it's not a good deal they're

offices in recent weeks\nSaid it is very difficult to win on immigration vulnerable voters in states Trump carried in two thousand sixteen even the most direct Kony and the Republican policies like family separation and deporting dreamers persuaded relatively few of those polls to vote Democrat\nOn Monday Trump unleashed an explosion of immigration focused statements warning on Twitter that he made the point the military to the border and threatened to cut off aid to Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador which he has doubled down on by the way\nSo this is a story trying to tell brain dead people read political why Trump is talking nonstop about the care of him\nBecause it's going to help him with immigration\nWell [noise] [noise] who did they think is behind this some of the stuff\nIn the media is literally mind boggling that that the the attempt here to be on attached to it or disengaged from it\nWhen when you get down to brass tacks most people in the media would be supportive of the people is caravan being allowed the lead in the country because they are every day anyway whether people show up in groups or two or five or ten or in a Bob up seven thousand the left as in favor of letting them in\nAnother worried that this was going to be a boon to Trump right before the midterm elections which it is\nThat's\nBut when you stop and think the Democrats are behind this has to be democratic donor money behind this and the reason I say this\nIt may make no sense of ... because this report is right this is helping Trump's allied with the Democrats do this book they're not rational right now\nThis group of people throughout the media\nThe Democratic party itself and and all of their social media base voters I'm telling you are so\nPoisoned with hatred and resentment all of these emotions they have felt following election night two thousand sixteen and all of the times in the past two years they thought that Trump was gone you gotta\nPut yourselves in their shoes everyday they've gotten up for two years and I've read in the New York times how Trump's toast\nThey've read it's only a moment of time before a matter of time before proof that he's ... loaded with food is going to be revealed they believe these two years that Mahler has made goods so they get up everyday believing that Trump is history sooner rather than later and nothing happens\nTrump just keeps getting his rallies get bigger they get happier they get more raucous\nThe Democrats get more panic everything they do to try to take Trump out or to stop Trump in his tracks like the capital thing is backfiring on them and I got ... out there promising subpoena power saying yeah we're going to investigate Trump we're going to investigate everybody in his administration as the reason for the Democrats to win back the house\n\nThey have they have lost all grounding here in in rationality\n\nAnd their perplexed because none of what they have done has worked in a white has worked its it's if it's getting back to the same old thing they can't persuade you to abandon Donald Trump they can't persuade you to stop going to Trump rallies they can't convince you to look at Trump and see

real clear politics average of polls\nAnd political experts from across the aisle site real clear politics and trusted as\nAn unassailable source so Tom ... cofounder of this place was on ah the Fox Business Network today\nHe said that if there was a blue wave that it would be cresting at this point meaning it'd be building and we'd be we'd be seeing the top up here and Tom Bevan sat in all of polling data that they have it real clear politics and analyzing it's not there is no crafting\nThere is no blue wave if a wave was coming it would be building he says and it isn't\nBut on the other hand the generic ballot is holding\nMeaning the Democrats are not running away with it they still have a ... depending on three to five point lead in the generic ballot but they're not expanding it there's no growth there is no Democrats pulling away as what happened with a blue wave Trump's job approval is rising\nDemocrats are in the advantage that ... says but they're not building on anything there's no way that's gonna wash everything away and leave only Democrats standing\nHe says the house races are really tight they are race by race real battles hand to hand combat is how he described it he forecast that Democrats might win the house\nThat they do have an advantage right now because they have a range of Seventy competitive races and the range of pick up as they look at polling data now\nIs anywhere from Democrats picking up ten to forty one the seats\nThey're projecting a democratic pickup of twenty five and a half seats which give him a slight a bed Democrats need to pick up twenty three that's the magic number anything above that Democrats have an advantage in the house\nThe range of the pickup according to the polling data real clear politics takes a look Savage anywhere from ten to forty one seats they project a pick up a twenty five seats twenty five and a half to two and a half seats more than they need\nBut with even a tiny shift in just a couple of races there GOP can hold the house so all of this synthesized and stripped away and I went to bear essence there isn't a blue wave\nThere isn't this blue wave that's going to sweep every Republican away and leave only Democrats standing\nThe generic ballot is not moving in Democrats' favor Trump's approval numbers are rising over on the Senate side ... and real clear politics project the Republicans are going to gain two seats\nTwo weeks ago they were predicting no change Republicans wouldn't gain or lose any two weeks before that the Democrats were going to pick up seats in the Senate so in the past month we've gone from Democrats picking up a couple to Republicans gaining a couple and that's the momentum and that's the trend\nAnd he made the point that it's a whole new world with Trump\nGender gap education gap the rural urban gap all of these things don't mean mean nearly as much as they have in the past the cause of Trump neutralizing much of it\n[noise] and Trump is the great unknown as these rallies\nContinue now another\nRetired historian and political analyst sends an email\nThat I received a lawsuit but I've been able to have the justice morning\nAnd I'm going to identify who this is doesn't matter I don't know you've heard of them but I just want to share with your some of the things I get some of the is by the way legitimate some of it is obviously tried influenced me\nA into promoting whatever it is that since I have to be very very careful about so I'm just I'm I'm gonna relate this to you\nThis passionately this guy who is it a story and who has studied the American politics and congressional races along the lines of of Michael Barone just not as well known as he looks at things he usually is an absolute red wave\nAnd he did not believe this until last night he's been seeing trends in the past two weeks but he has been reluctant to convert into these trends are the actual prediction until now he says the numbers he's looking at from Nevada are exceptional in Minnesota Keith Ellison is\nThat's just the way we like it came on and have a conversation continues twenty four seven\nOf is just so much to say and not enough time to\nKNX DAM seven songs\nYears ago making a murderer became less the TV show of\nForce of nature and did uncover to rave injustice and the criminal justice it was also completely dance on it and I would know I'm dead O'Donnell I covered this David Avery and Brendan Bessie trials and now they're making a murderer is back I Am too hard to re budding them\nMoney murderer is now on the ... I heard radiolab just open the\n[noise]\n\n\n\nUses mayor would find your direction one location designed to get\nPeople still think an education from northern Virginia community colleges just\nSettling but when you think about it was\nReally not settling is graduating college with\nRushing didn't loan payment but do you have your green from nova feed you a ton of college and I\nDon't think you're settling with no education\n[noise]\nYou're listening to Russia's weeks in reviews are quick question seriously [noise]\nMany Republicans right now in the midst of this political campaigns on a\nTwo thousand sixteen midterms how many how many Republicans [noise] because they have the Clintons or Obama on their radar\n\nNo no I mean how how many are the are the Clintons an obstacle to the upcoming midterm the ... no ... is Obama an obstacle in the no I mean what the Clintons and Obama are not even on the radar except they are today\nI mean the Clintons announced yet this Clinton's announced this nationwide stadium tour third team locations stadium tour they're going to charge admission for people to come in and spend some time listening to bill and Hillary reminisce and talk about\nPolitics what\nWhat if there isn't a whole lot of interest in that [noise] what if a lot of people aren't yet\nBuying tickets\nI don't know that they're on sale with every venue yet but I mean the Clinton sucked on anybody's radar right now\nI mean the closest that happens is you know when Trump goes to a rally and they start talking about the deep state and Hillary and her ... and the FBI trend the shaft Trump on his phone in collusion story the lock her up lock her up but I mean the Clintons are not considered political opponents right now and Obama certainly is and\n\nI don't know I ... and and now with so many leftist tweeting this is typical this is Donald Trump has engendered so much hatred in so much anger the wife and I remember hearing is not seen it just it just to pass it it's just it's it it it's too obvious it is becoming what\nIn form ... and a educated suspicion about this would tell you that it is uh we'll see we'll let\nTime on the phone here in the meantime we go back to the phones Andrew in Cleveland it's great to have you with us or hello\nHey Russia I been within that there was a kid a riding around in the car with my father it's a pleasure speaking\nWell thank you I appreciate that you very much\nRush you know it's a you're talking about this passing the smell test I'm I'm sure the drive by spin on this will be that uh we have a dangerous dreams right we're out there putting\nThese bombs in the mail you know if that really were the case where it is a redneck right wing hillbilly which I'm sure that's how this will be on by the media where do they go about getting a mailing address is already George Soros Hillary Clinton Iraq saying oh\nYou know that that information is not out there for the masses to obtain you know quite being there were never any attempt for these devices to make their way to their intended target whoever put them in the mail\nAnd I don't know if it's right on me to point fingers and certainty but my gut is telling me this is a left wing smokescreen\nWanted for them to be discovered\nThe Democrats the proven time and time again there's simply no load that they won't do everything for they've tried to do to derail Trump or the hot and might video that came out during his presidential campaign to Russia to even gone so far as to try to ruin the wife of judge Kavanaugh nothing has worked\nWhat makes you think that they wouldn't do something that's whoa it tell\nAlong along those lines if you want to look\nAt it that way it doesn't make any sense for a Republican or conservative to do this if they really care about winning these elections just makes no sense to do\nThis was going to be instant fodder for the Democrats in the media to blame it on Trump and his supporters and our history there's there's ... it doesn't make any sense for a Republican or conservative to do this if they care about the elections none whatsoever but flip\nThat flip that around\nWhat does it make a lot of sense for a democratic operative word Democrat in cocaine and the lunatic to do it because things are not working out the way\nThey thought do not forget this is why I've spent so much time dwelling on this today and the psychology that that that's attached to this this is not going the way they have a short us for the last nine months it was going to go more importantly it's not going the way they believed it was going to go they believe they're allies remember\nThey believe their pollsters\nIf the polls are telling there's a big way based on the generic ballot they believe that they get it in their heads and they believe it\nThey start reporting it and they just compounds itself and it becomes even more intensely believed it becomes gospel\nAnd then it doesn't\nAnd then the things that are supposed to cement it like the Kavanaugh trick backfires and these mobs are backfiring they are not achieving their objectives\nSo if you flipped this around you've got this you've got this this this mob of people flooding the border by intention\nThere's no way that helps the Democrats don't and the Democrats as I said let me grab the let me grab the uh the sweet here it's really strange ladies and gentlemen I'm going to quote the creepy porn star lawyer but Here's Michael ...\nThere is too much at stake in the mid term shut the Democrats do allow the Republicans to use this caravan which is so obviously is set up\nAs a wedge issue it is time for the Democrats to step up and be strong on border security we cannot once again be painted as a week and then lose [noise]\nPalestine he I what more do you watch well\nNot good enough apparently this is why I Can't find a temple by the way\nIf you know at temple here in town please let me know that isn't isn't uh and and they don't have to agree with me they just need to shut up about it I won't say anything I don't say anything anyway I Want you to hear what this woman said when she just by John Berman about President Trump over there we go listen to this\nYou welcome the president is or in the wake of the [noise]\nAsking that personal question\nI'm asking you I Do not [noise] I Do not welcome the president or vice city oh it's nice why not\nBecause he's the purveyor of ... states have half a critical um\nPoured that come from him\nTell me nothing hypocritical um we have a we have very very strong leadership and the city we have a very strong mayor with very strong value of what I just very strongly tiny executive rich Fitzgerald way of people who stand\nBy as it believing value not just Jewish values of leaving values and those are not the values of this president and I do not welcome to Pittsburgh\nWe just played the sound bite of a mayor no no we don't have armed anybody no no no I'm sure they have armed guards at the city council meetings where he goes\nNo no no I'm against illegal guns no crap dude who isn't\nSo there you go this is what I have to deal with and it's so frustrating so frustrating is not welcome you imagine you went to the January shootings or somebody said Obama's not welcome to Tucson\n\nI disagree with Obama I thought it was great that he came to Tucson after the shooting\n\nBy the way you'd be called a racist if you said I don't welcome Obama in my city\nIt's just the way it is just the way it is will continue nine fifty one it's

Lewis radio you got to follow the money\nAnd there's a story that I have from a I think it's from USA Today and ended up on a a TV\nIn Minneapolis, Minnesota somewhere there their website or\nThere's gambling websites now that are saying they were up there they're favoring Republicans keeping the house\nAnd they don't bookies don't get into this to lose money okay they must know something has happened on election night Hillary was heavily favored at about four thirty local time and by about six thirty\nThey were tied ...

best friend ... at the hands of a white police officer now facing pressure from all sides of the community star\nBecause what it shows is that whenever there is any kind of violence\nAny kind of uprising any kind of the first instinct of the drive by\nMedia has\nAnd I when I drive by media may as well be selling it saying a Democrat part of the first thing I think they have is to try to find a way\nTo link who ever committed the bad deed to the Republican Party or\nThe so called conservative movement\nAnd of course now it's blamed Trump everything everything at all what ever it is blame Donald Trump\nBlame me blame you blame anybody that supported Donald Trump\nAnd frankly I wore dealt with this reaction I have had it I Am fed up with it's been this way for years there were showed up during the Obama administration there were mass murders and at no time did the drive by media ever try to link any of it to Obama\nAnd yet [noise] people have forgotten wasn't inflammatory\nJust said that Republicans were going to be responsible for millions of death if Obamacare was not passed into law\nPeople remember that because I sure as hell do because I was set up one is that\nWe're trying to oppose a government takeover of one of the great industries in America better than anywhere else in the world we're trying to take them to prevent a bunch of incompetence\nA bunch of government bureaucrats in the left wing politicians from taking over the American health care system\nMeanwhile Obama is lying to everybody about it claiming that they like their doctor keep their plan they didn't get get get to end up their premiums are going to be reduced by twenty five hundred dollars a year or lie after lie after lie not called out not reported\nAnd then the Republicans come along and try to impose it\nOn subsidies grounds and the Democrats and the media start running around talking about how the Republicans are going to be responsible for the deaths of millions of people you want to tell me that's inflammatory or not\nHow many years have average ordinary Americans had to listen to this like you and I have\nWhere every time something happens that Democrats politicize literally everything and that's why none of this stuff ever gets that is why none of this stuff is ever going to get resolved until this politicization of everything stops in other words\nYou have some guy who's been mentally ill for ten Fifteen Years [noise] excuse me\nThen decides to take action and all of a sudden it's ... it's the fault of a political party or it's the fault of a president's and and so predictable because they hate the president will do anything they can to get\nRid of him they spent two years trying to get rid of him they fail to get rid of him they're fit to be tied over their failure they're ratcheting up this this anger\nAnd if it were getting so far away from the notion that whoever did it is the person that\nWe're getting to the point where in this country because we politicize everything nobody's responsible for what they do whatever anybody does it's because of the politics of the Republican Party or the conservative movement\nAs far as the drive by meeting is concerned it's not because somebody is mentally ill disturbed who knows what's been going on in their lives I mean he doesn't care about that except to the extent they can link the Trump\nWell I've I for one am am fed up with it I Am sick of this reaction to every freaking event even\nThough whether we can even get away from it from the weather extreme weather happens it's our fault it's the problem of the Republicans or Trump because we don't sign on to this asinine manmade global warming theory so we ended up being responsible for deaths in print Domingo\n\nAnd then when we stand up and defend ourselves against then all of a sudden we're attacked in we're assaulted for being anti war many anti anti black anti minority what have you\nBecause they politicized literally everything and you know what if I have gotten to the point I Can't tune it out it is by your man\nTo pay attention to it\nIs my man to come here and pay attention to tell you what I think about how many people do you think are fed up with this by now\nYou would think this is going to affect the midterm elections Democrats and maybe I got I got a clue for ya neither of these events that you are hyping are going to ... change significantly the mid term elections as much as you would like them to and as much as you're trying to make them change the mid term elections you must be worried how the midterms are going you pretend to ratchet these two things\nUp and try to get people to somehow vote against Donald Trump you may you must not believe like Nate Silver says eighty five percent chance that you're going to take the house\nNo you have to take these too sad unfortunate events in and build them up into somehow they are Donald Trump's fault and this is why you should vote against Republicans in the mid term\nI can tell you right now I mean a ... do not know it from a ... hands on knowledge I'm just telling my gut is that there are millions of Americans wants this stuff starts they tune it out they're fed up with being blamed they're fed up with the people they love and support being blamed\nThey're fed up with their country being blamed and so they just they just tune it out you think about all of the mass shootings have cops back during the Obama those and those were supported\nYou had the support those you have the support black lives matter and they weren't condemned there weren't any consequences\nFor that protesters could roll into Ferguson, Missouri and and literally tear up a town on why\nThey create a lie about the shooter in that in that ... the Mike Brown ... first name was\nWho was held up a convenience store in ... whatever it was they just totally making up turn it inside out\nAll for the express purpose of blaming Donald Trump now\nIt it it gets it gets to the point that if the media wonders why they're in such ill distribute right now it's because of this\nNobody believes what'd you say nobody\nTrusts one you're saying it's so obviously politically charged so obviously you're you're passionate about this\nIs what you're going to do with this politically\nThe guy that shot up the synagogue in Pittsburgh squirrel hill section of ... I Know this place well I Lived there not squirrel hill but I Know where it is\n\nThe guy that shot this place up hated\nDonald Trump Donald Trump was too big a Jewish supporter his daughter converted to Judaism before marrying questioner he more into the\nAmerican embassy to Jerusalem this guy thinks Trump is part of the sellout\nTo worldwide and Jewish people and yet the media is blaming Trump\nThey're saying well a lot of that that is a rock and all that just that that that's just a disguise you know that\nThat that they just did that the cover up Trump's real anti Semitism Donald Trump's maybe one of the best friends in Israel and Israeli Jews have had in the in the oval office and I don't know how long remember the case\nOf\nWas it was just a David Koch David Koch of the Koch brothers they're re Wichita energy from and family\nAnd David Koch and his wife Julia donated twenty five million dollars to some New York hospital the nurses association and other organizations at the hospital told the hospital's not doing except the donation\nBecause David Koch is nothing more than a yellow ballet and white privilege racist and the only reason for his donation wants to cover his racism and hide it so people didn't really see\nThis is who the left is so they even reject acts of charity as\nIll motivated why does somebody think that way what would make those nurses thinks that way I submit to you that it is the drive by media I submit to you that it is their union leaders and maybe instructors teachers they have in school\nWere not even legitimate acts of charity work compassion\nAre allowed because they're not real their relief from racist in big it's who are trying\nTo mask and cover up their racism and bigotry and so the money should not be accepted and if it were accepted it should be returned\nAmericans Republicans conservatives have been blamed for the deaths of ...\nSo the left wants Trump to tone down his efforts at self defense that's what Trump is doing he's assaulted he said countless times if I'm here I'm going to hit back\nWhen Trump is blamed for the actions of a lunatic he's told to be more dignified remain silent be like Mitt Romney would

the way this works is [noise]\nUh thirty six year old allegation can be bad for which there is no evidence Adam for which force opposing witnesses candy but the place themselves at the place because the victim doesn't know where it happened doesn't know when it happened but it becomes real and we got to destroy somebody's life we have to destroy somebody's career we've got and Kavanaugh exposed to sit\nBack and just take he's just she those are the old rules in Washington\nPeople under assault take it\nThe best way to deal with it they are advised to not make waves sit there and take it and that's how responsible reasonable Republicans always acted well that's not that Donald Trump as he wasn't elected to act that way\nYou ask me the wrong people being told tone it down\nThe left needs to tone down it's organized violence the left needs to tone down all of these political stunts\nThat are in many ways designed to provoke a reaction from people\nBecause they\nUtilize abuses of power and character assassination\nAnd the the character being assassinated just supposed to sit there just supposed to take it\nThat's how you get ahead in Washington if you're under the gun you take it you just sit there and you take it and you realize it's just politics don't take it personally judge Kavanaugh\nDon't take it personally it's just politics because everybody hates Trump we can't let you on the Supreme Court and you're gonna have to sit there and that's the price you're gonna have to pay for this guy being elected and he's supposed to just sit there and take\nYou wasn't supposed to be angry\nWhile he was smeared and while his family was threatened in his life and future we're in the process of being destroyed he wasn't supposed to say anything\n\nJust to sit there and take it that's the rules that's the way it works\nIn Washington\nNot personal just business just politics and then a couple of years afterwards everybody forgets it and everybody likes Kevin except Kevin O's life was ruined\nAnd he's never supposed to want to get even he's never supposed to fight for him\nSo Trump ditto not supposed to stand up to this not but that's who Trump is they're not used to it they thought they would have sent Trump packing a year and a half ago they thought they'd be rid of Donald Trump\n\nAnd they still aren't let's go to the phones we have Steve in Pittsburgh with us You're up for us today Steve thank you for calling hello\nHey rushed pleasure to speak with you thank you sir\nI can tell you the last week in front of the Pittsburgh School board they had a proposal to arm school police and it was voted down toward\nWell the thing that happened at a school but you know similar situation where President Trump came out and said if they had an armed guard this could've been prevented\nAnd then you have the Mayor Bill Clinton was very anti Trump very liberal come out and say that an armed guard would not stop that's what we need is more gun control I mean how many more things have to happen before they realized that more gun control was not the answer not putting someone with a gun that can stop this\nWell look I hate to be the one tells you but uh there's no amount of death there's no amount of shooting\nWhatever get your mayor to change his mind about what he believes\nBecause you see it's really not about guns he thinks it is in his supporter but it's not really about\nGuns it's about something much larger than that it's about being able to tell people what they can and can't have it's about it's about telling people that they have freedom of speech except\nYou can't say this you can't say that can't but other than that you got for freedom of speech with us leftists [noise] uh yeah and you you want to have gotten you're going to have a gun except in East Africa but but but but but what we're all for freedom if we define it he mentioned this let's\nGo to the audio soundbites I Want to start here with a Trump himself this is this is this is an example\nYou [laughter] well I I'm sure some people were shocked\nA on Saturday when this was Trump's reaction speaking with reporters he was a joint base Andrews it used to be Andrews Air force base case you're wondering what does this joint based business well it used to be Andrews Air force base and then there was another military base close\nBy another branch close by to unify them all the court and joint base where multiple services are on the same place\nAnd so that's that's where air force one is parked at Fort Trump takes the helicopter to get on board Airforce one way is going to travel a reporter said Mr President do you think you need to revisit seem so a guy goes nuts in a synagogue and spoil hill\nAnd the first question a drive by Mr President do you think you need to revisit gun laws\nBy the way I Need to tell you something I've observed this is the last time the drive by some cared about the guns this guy had an arsenal and the drive buys have dropped focused on it because they think there is a bigger target\nAnd that is Trump being responsible for this and that in all the other things an anti Semitism\nThey think oh there's a lot of racism so they're not really focused on this guy's guns as much as they would otherwise and all that tells you this guy's got even loaded with guns why here's a drive by not\nReally focusing on that when they always do because it's a political calculation that there's more fertile ground here and that would be Trump is an anti Semite or a big it or as a racist anyway the reporters as Mr President do you think you need to revisit gun laws this\nPart is that the rightful owners of those names never had a clue who he was they never had a clue they were being ripped off until retailer started calling them\nViolent crime it's why people have life like have light flock to protect them from every kind of identity theft see when you have a life luck\nYou'll know immediately when somebody is running

got some experience for the Hollywood types in Europe parents that opinion can liberal Druze be anti Semitic when it comes to it when it comes to Israel\n\nThey when they did they probably wouldn't say that they were but they they they yeah I mean a lot of them\nOh I Know they wouldn't say they were but couldn't couldn't he said that they were I mean because one thing to\nSay that yes because a lot of a lot of a lot of them also would tell you that they don't even believe in God or racially Jewish but they don't they're not religiously Jewish which I also think it's a load of well you know [laughter]\nI Know there's all kinds of young people justify their existence and all kinds of ways ...\nThey're really they're willing to claim the victim had nothing else [noise] [laughter]\nWell the one of the reason I ask you that specific question was because many people do not understand how a liberal Jew is like the New York times ownership and editorial board can be so anti Israel when Israel is\nThe ... it it it it's it's the Jewish state and yet there is there's so much anti Israeli sentiment\nAmong Jewish people in America that are predominantly liberal that people scratch their heads and don't quite understand it\n'cause it's a lot because it's anti the religion and it's not anti the race they still need the race in order to have racial politics\nBut it's if the religion in time the river legion\nYeah because you can't separate the Jewish state from religion I don't think you can and that you know any any time you're Jewish\nAnd you're in a you know you're in a liberal you're in a conversation with liberal and Israel comes up now with a disclaimer I'm Jewish but I totally disagree with everything Israel doing that yeah that comes up and it's it's really sad\nBut isn't that more disagreeing with the politics disassociated with with Israel is a book because if their entire religion that's big\nI mean the Jewish religion I mean you've got the reform an orthodox and and the other branches how many\nDifferent flavors [laughter] um yeah but\nI I don't I used I used to feel that way but I feel like it but yeah with a push toward atheist I mean you see this or anti Christian too um I don't see them as necessarily\nBeing seeing Islam but I you know but I think it's the it's a it's a ... I thought\nThat's exactly right I was wearing Mrs all headed this is all headed towards atheism anti God that's exactly what is a unifying the people on the left whatever they claim their religious

else that you say that you are\nThe gold the liberalism creep into Judaism and a rising anti Semitism you're right it's it's anti Semitism is rising in Germany and nobody's talking about it it's rising throughout Europe and there aren't very many people talking about it so\nThis has been in Pittsburgh did it did it adds to any of the uh discomfort or on ease you're having about things in general\n[noise] ah it doesn't and I I don't I don't feel like that there's a million people out there targeting\nA Jews and the way that they would want to go she got the thing that I think that that these are isolated incidents in this country because of the country it's so good at that so many people I mean this guy is facing the death penalty he he ... he certainly wouldn't be facing the death penalty anywhere else\nAnd I I mean I don't I don't feel unsafe as a person who is Jewish walking down the street because I'm Jewish\nI and I and I obviously don't think Trump has anything to do with it at that absolutely ridiculous and it's it's not going to make me not vote in the ... or anything silly like that\nI Am glad used because I'll tell you there's a lot of people think and there are a predominant ... thank you thank you so much a re July precepts racial from Thousand Oaks California [noise] um\n\nI don't think these events are going to have anything to do with the midterms [noise] a lot of people do\nA lot of people think it's going to dampen a turnout what you you think I'm wrong or you\n\nKnow I don't think it's going to have a thing to do with them in terms like now after Caesar say a dare I say this year I put my hands together and look to the lord and do I say this\nCaesar sidewalk and his pipelines none of which exploded what do you think\nThe odds are that the drive by the Democrats are thinking\nWell I don't have to ask as we know what we had people talking about how that whole thing last week was suppressing turnout remember and even Trump alluded to the fact that that story was maybe going to dampen some people's enthusiasm remember that OK\nWell there were some people I'm sure not too unhappy about\nThat and then the second event happens on Saturday in Pittsburgh and\nIt was the to the people to politicize everything\nAnd that's the people I'm Talking about and that would be the media and the American left ... people look politicized and of course you've got extremists out there in in the fringes everywhere who irrationally try to explain things away\nBut the people at politicize everything who look at both events through a political ...\nHad to be thinking are right now this is going to this is going to really help us in the midterms this was going to dampen turns going to dampen enthusiasm for Trump I have\nI have an\nEntirely different it's why I did the show opened today but I did I don't think it's going to have that impact on people in fact I think the media\nTheir natural state drives more people to Trump each and every day and I think they've been doing it since Sunday shows yesterday with is the attempt to politicize this the attempt to blame Trump for this\nThis is Trump spoiled and\nThe media wants to be exempted from any impact ... they they damn well one of the things they influence opinion and shape the outcome of elections\nBut they don't want to be held any kind of responsible for what people do the same time it seems in Congress to me here when they when they get called out on this they deny it this is a montage Tom boss search\nWho a former national security adviser and Stephanopoulos and Mary Jordan of the Washington Post\nI Want them to be calm but I don't think that the American viewers are looking at in terms of murder\nAnd he also has a lot of the reason why the murder\nYou know here's what I said ... yeah he is responsible for fomenting using rhetoric that causes people to feel like that is normal life\nSo when ... calls them out\nOh yeah I don't think Trump responsible for a ... looking and it was a murder we didn't say there's no well we didn't see that Matthew Dowd but he is responsible for his own for the rhetoric that led to do murder\n[laughter]\nNo they all so that they when when they're when they're confronted with what they're actually saying that they pulled back and deny it\nBecause we're coming right back\nI Am shuttle Stevens I'm here to talk about

[noise] you know I don't know what happened\nTo Max Boot Max Boot used to be a columnist a reporter for the wall Street Journal is the the international\nPolitical expert at what have you and I used to\nThink of the guy as a conservative being a journal opinion writer and he would occasionally send me his pieces\nIn advance thinking I Would enjoy them\nBut ever since Trump was elected he has gone off the reservation I mean to the point that a lot of what what will people asking what what what happened to Max Boot\n[noise] and now he's on CNN is often easy as he can get on that just ripping Trump a new one primarily from the standpoint that Trump's manners and his behavior and his ah\nCompartment just isn't present control and you know the usual complaint from the\nEstablishment grad so he tweets out\nThere is partisanship on both sides of the political spectrum but know left wing outlets\nPropagate extremism as successfully are widely as conservative media do conservatives are being brainwashed and an echo chamber form rumor and conspiracy theory\n\nThis tweet is then replied to by John Harwood a former New York times Wall Street journal reporter now at CNBC who has never been anything other van and Wilbur ultra left his\nHeart was says Max Boot is one hundred percent correct most important extremism on the right has gotten baked into the entire movement and the G O P White House Congress Fox Limbaugh Breitbart the pack\n[noise]\nI maintain to you as I said in my opening monologue the program today\n\nThat we get up every day and we see people and institutions that we

murderers by the Democratic party am willing accomplices in the media Mr boats simply because we don't believe in the man made climate change folks\n[noise]\nMurderers Republicans have been called murderers for not supporting Obama's takeover of the American health care\nIndustry for the purposes of putting it under the auspices of government for the purposes of controlling the way people live\nA\nPartisanship on both sides but know left wing outlets propagate extremism is successful lawyer why\nThe mainstream media is extremism if you ask me that's what they've become daily media\nReporting has become extremism it certainly isn't factual\nIt certainly\nHas an investment in the outcome of events and somehow we conservatives\nIn the media are far more successful\nIn propagating extremism and are you in this audience are being brainwashed in an echo chamber\nBy rumor and conspiracy theory\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nWhich takes me to President Trump President Trump tweeted and I'm also mentioned in the first hour that Trump was elected\nTo behave differently [noise] he was elected precisely\nBecause he is cut from a different cloth these people have never [laughter] look it's kinda understand a little one sense I mean the guy goes down the elevator and\nTalks about these hordes of illegal immigrants containing a people were murderers and rapists and you just don't talk about them that way I mean nobody's supposed to talk about him that way but\nTrump did and so they all start laughing I think this guy can't be serious he is not going to last his campaign two weeks\nAnd then the first poll came out and they saw Trump bleeding\nThis guy is not going to laugh and it's just quite amazing that Trump tapped slowly but surely eliminating all of the other Republicans in the primary on all of them had this preferable a laid back a walk all over me attitude toward the left and Democrats that you want\nTrump kept eliminating them one by one by one with catchy nicknames and so forth\nAnd they fought this to sift it can't happen these camps that you're never going to survive in the Access Hollywood video convey thought that was it was over and nobody can survive but\nTrump survived and then they started the two years silent cool and that is the real reason for all of the suspicion about those of you on the left I'm going to tell you something Mr boat there is nothing that I\nOr anybody else I Know in conservative media couldn't do that even approach is what the Obama FBI department of justice and intelligence community did and he is doing\nIn corrupting\nThe highest levels of our government the express purpose of overturning an election I don't care how much power you think I've got I couldn't come close\nTo doing what was done and has been done the past two years including the Mueller investigation including the planning of out right lies\nFive times a day in media all over the country from anonymous people alleging that it was only a matter of time before proof that Trump pen colluded with Russia to steal the election for\nTwo years Mr boot for two years with\nNo evidence and everybody in on it knew there was no evidence everybody in on this new that there had not been any collusion they were hoping\n\nThey were hoping and they live with every day with the ideas are going to wake up and that the
