blame when when nobody knows who actually is responsible for this\n... back to my point it takes it takes some expertise here to manufacture ... like this if it's true that they're not intended to go off and if it's true that they're meant to look crude and made by people that started in the movie deliverance it takes\nBomb making skill to put together bombs like I mean these bombs mail bombs have timers on what their mail bomb any bomb expert knows you don't put a timer on a mail bomb a mail bomb is designed to go off when it's open\nYou put a timer on their ... strictly for visual effect because every bomb on T. V. has a timer\n\nRemember we are at TV ingrained society and what we see on TV we tend to believe therefore bombs are featured in many TV shows and movies and every bomb has a count down timer on it so these due to except they're not acting they're not turned on and not counting down and they're not connected to anything\nThey're just there for show\nThe stamps have not been cancelled I mean as as though they would have progressed through some sort of\nStandard procedure at the at the post office but why am I why might the drive by I think that Republican momentum has stopped why might they think that there has been a a slow down\nWell it's possible\nThat\nThey see the shift in soap opera narrative coverage every day from the invasion the caravan Kevin on the economy the Trump rallies all of that stuff is gone none of that stuff is being reported or talked about at\nAll and those were the things that were stoking the talk of Republican enthusiasm not to mention all the polls and\nNot to mention the story is on the on the flurry away blew away all of those stories are gone now\nEvery story that dealt with the men terms and those stories had shifted toward Republican momentum all those stories are gone now and pretty much every story has to do with the show he\nAnd the Turks and the Saudis or the bombs\nAnd how Trump's not Trump's gotta learn to shut up Trump's got us he's got to stop stoking emotion like this I mean they're blaming Trump for this from beginning to end but if you're in the drive by media and all those other stories\nThe caravan slash invasion that Kavanaugh aftermath the economy which is a fabulous story and the Trump rallies if they are not news\n\nAnd the only thing that is news is the bombs these mailed devices\nThey've taken all of that other stuff\nOff the radar so that Dr buys reporting this stuff may feel like\nThat the enthusiasm for the midterm elections protect why only on the Republican side by the way\nWhy only Republican and threw it must be because that's where the enthusiasm was I mean if there is a significant sea change in voter enthusiasm and the drive by going to report that itch Republican enthusiasm that his camping down\nThen it must have been Republican enthusiasm that was very high on ratcheting up so now they're saying and those he has um has waned the it's Republican enthusiasm\n\nSo they are in their media capitals are in New York and there in Washington there in Los Angeles they're reporting this stuff\nAnd in their world the midterms are off the radar in their world anything to do with them in\nTerms in well not off the radar it's a very important point the enthusiasm on the Republican side they see us having managed why because there aren't any stories about well yeah they determine what stories are covered in what stories are not they determine what's reported and what's not\n\nNow at what point will be mailed device story from the southern jungles of Georgia said\nWhy [laughter] why are you laughing in their\nCome on you know as well as I Do that that I Know\nThese people like I Know every square inch my fault prison my glorious naked body I Know how they think I Know what they're thinking I don't know what they're hoping\nI Know what they think of the average Trump voter I Know what they think of the average American the average American may as well be a co starring deliverance and that's you're\nProbably in their minds put together these bombs and sent them around and so Fort Trump hard\nDon't forget CNN calling them Trump targets you think that's not claiming Trump while out of\nThe other side of their mouth they condemn anybody for blaming anybody in Minnesota and all we know the fact\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] so Mr ... let me just ask you do you think somebody is getting away with playing a big joke\nOn American with is if you think this is and it's ... [noise]\nUh getting away with it with liberals [noise] alright well\nGetting away with ... with liberal so you believe that there are some liberals in the drive by media\nWho even if this is what are they calling a false flag they're saying I'm cleaning falsely that even if this is a liberal plot you're claiming that there are liberals and to me who don't know that it's a liberal plop\n[noise] [noise] okay so they're gonna believe what they want to believe it or whatever it is is is what they make it okay so but it has to face at some point right known say yes soon as I don't say it has when women fate tells me ...\n[noise] the caravans not going to get to the southern border by elections that you can't unless somebody sends a whole bunch of trucks down there you can't [noise]\nWhat

behind this or is it a team of people\nWouldn't want anybody say that what we have here is meddling in an election\nYou think this is the drive by so clearly think this is meddling in that election and they're happy about it\nDr buys clearly are happy to report that they think that this bomb business\nIs making you Republican voters less excited less enthusiastic that this bomb story has totally destroyed all of the energy you at what they're reporting out there\n\nIs that what the media is trying to do with all this over the top coverage of this Trump targets bombs received by Trump targets\n\nIf this is indeed election meddling depending on how it ends up here this could be a pretty successful case of election meddling\nAnd we don't even know if this is ... or a perp\nDon't know if it's a Russian government agent or operation we don't know who is behind is whoever it is doesn't know how to spell Florida\nOr whoever it is is not sure how to spell Debbie lab or mouth shows his

president\nAnd they should instead of blaming the president take a cue from the president didn't leadership yesterday called for the country to come together instead of attacking\nOne another with partisan politics time for family and the president is shameful that the New York times today chose to publish an article tend to pick the assassination of the president of the United states we're twenty four hours from these devices being delivered and how painful and the New York times\nI now I mentioned that through your toward the tail end of the hour they actually did they published a fiction piece by a writer fantasizing over a secret service agent\nTending a Russian agent his gun to assassinate Donald Trump not the president not just the president I don't know named Donald Trump you've got a Russian agent trying to assassinate his gun doesn't go off\nAnd so a nearby Secret Service agent hands the Russian assassin his gun sincere use mine the times runs this story and they excuses\nBy saying well we must publishing stories that relate to react to live with the Mueller investigation of Trump and\n... what does that got to do with Trump being assassinated anyway even if there was something to it which there's not\nAnd and then they're preaching to us why publishing that story they're preaching to everybody\nAbout civility and why you need to dial back what Donald Trump is saying into Donald Trump needs to dial it back and Donald Trump needs to change it Donald Trump didn't\nMeanwhile they can call him a Nazi they can call him Hitler they can lie about the things he says and does all day long with no recourse that's what Mac and then he's talking about here now is Natasha on a top response\nI think that the president controlled himself has that she could last night at his rally that he was poking fun at the whole idea of all I'm not going to talk about the things I'm going to be a presidential which is essentially saying to his audience you know
