theme that they have all unified behind today and I think for the remainder of the time\nFor these next two weeks and that is Trump's spreads lives and stokes fears head of election I fought when I got in here and saw that\nOne time I figured it was just you know a graphic Cairo's graphic to represent what they were doing at that time but every time I looked up at the TV over the next three hours I saw that that that manner\nIt didn't matter what else was being discussed it didn't matter who the guests were then I saw the Washington Post thing and so I checked the New York times and there it is spreading fear telling lies\nA hand of election this caravan thing you know I\n[noise] I continue to study this\nAnd try to pick it apart analyze it and and make sense of it from a political standpoint and I still can't find anywhere in the media any concern about it I Can't find anybody concerned are worrying or thinking that it's anything abnormal about its\nBack what you find in the drive by media isn't tired total miss characterizations these are desperately poor people wonderful people fleeing poverty in their homeland\nAnd that's not an oil what they are they are part of an organized mob\nThere is no question about this is an organized mob and like everything else in the left is behind some point in the future we're going to learn exactly how this thing was pulled off we're going to learn who did it we're going to learn who paid for it we're going to learn who scripted it\nJust like we've learned how they did the cabin off thing with Dr balls the Ford how bad was structured how that was planned how it was kept in reserve what is that nothing that appears spontaneous or organic\nWhere it benefits the left is spontaneous or organic in his all structured it's all planned it's all scripted it's all paid for its all focus grouped it's poll tested from their perspective\nAnd the the obvious you know there there there's no ... you look at this you look at this caravan and it is\nYou don't want to scare everybody it is exactly the threat this country has faced for years we now have a focused concentrated microcosm up with seven\nThousand people that maybe a thousand or ten thousand if they get here by election day there's still a thousand miles away yet vowing to get here by election day at the drive by claiming they're walking there not walking they can't they'll never cover a thousand miles in two weeks if they're walking it's physically not possible\nSo when the cameras aren't there some of these people have to be being driven\nBut it is all orchestrated none of this is organic none of it is real from the standpoint that individuals totaling eight thousand people decided on the same day or in the same week or even in the same month to start walking\nFrom Honduras to the United states that just didn't happen it doesn't happen somebody is making this happen somebody set this up\n\n... obviously is a bunch of left is to set this up and when you look at that and examine it from that standpoint you've you've got to wonder what it is that makes them think they are going to win massive elections ended his clear to me\nNot only examining the caravan the mob see there I go I even got caught up calling it what it is it's not a caravan it's a mob it's uh bought and paid for and structured scripted mob\n\nThe Democrats clearly believe and they have believed since the two thousand sixteen election\nThat the way\nTo win back their power is to stoke and create Trump hatred that they think organically naturally exists in either a majority of Americans or close to it and that's what they're trying to capitalize on his massive Trump hatred massive Trump resentment\nThey're not doing it by talking about issues in our own individual campaigns you'll hear Democrats promise to repeal the tax cuts and roll back things that have led to economic prosperity but in terms of the national message from the Democratic party you're not getting one you're getting\n... fear Trump hatred promoting it [laughter] and exacerbating it or what have you and it's\nIt's silly it's not the way you build a movement now\nLet me share with you a couple of uh\nStories today on the polling leading up to the midterms because it is all over the place and it is contradictory as it can be five thirty eight this is the adored do and the indispensable and the eagerly anticipated Nate Silver\nWho has now said the Democrats have an eighty five percent chance of winning control of the house of representatives the Republicans have only a fourteen and a half percent chance of keeping the house\nThis is almost identical\nTo five thirty it's forecasting two weeks before the presidential election in two thousand six Dan where Hillary Clinton had anywhere from an eighty eight percent Ninety two percent chance of winning the presidency\nAnd Trump pan what\nTwelve percent to ... percent chance of winning which was effectively zero and even on election day throughout the day and that is how five thirty eight and the New York\nTimes reported and we all know what happened Charlie Cook considered the dean of political analysts\nAnd this company\nAnalyzes races individual house races and Senate races and reports on which way\nThey're going to go the cook Political Report today has shifted it ate house racist toward Democrats and two in favor of Republicans were fourteen days to go before the midterm election the non partisan election forecasts there is no such thing\nAnd Charlie Cook is not nonpartisan Charlie Cook cares about the outcome of this stuff Charlie Cook is not nonpartisan but that's how this stuff gets reported\nThe non partisan election forecaster Charlie Cook Political Report rejected Democrats will have an edge in key swing districts following the party's massive\nFundraising haul\nIn the third quarter of this year so those are the two story but then\nIf you turn to NBC News in the wall Street Journal bloom wave collapsing early voting shows geo pie out pacing Democrats in key states\n\nIn this story is even is even prepared in a written as another sign that this so called blue wave eagerly anticipated blue wave could end up disappointing people next month if it arrives at all NBC News\nHas looked in early voting day and it provided by a company called target smart in eight states and found that GOP affiliated voters are out pacing democratic voters in several of those including North Carolina\nGOP affiliated voters hamster past democratic voters in early voting in Arizona Florida Georgia Indiana Montana Tennessee Texas also North Carolina\nOnly in Nevada\nHave Democrat affiliated voters exceeded Republican affiliated voter so far in the early voting the latest data distributed BC suggest robust in a fool's Yaz among early eight Republican voters that couldn't put a dent in Democrat hopes for a blue wave\nRepublicans typically dominate early voting by absentee ballots while Democrats tend to have the advantage when in person early voting so for example the entire early voting patriot in Florida which is you have to begin in person voting is in a complete\n\nNow that that is somewhat of a important point there because it's it's not just that the Republicans are doing better than Democrats in the states\nIt is that early voting almost always favors Democrats the usual pattern for all this stuff is there for Democrats are growing up in the early Italy and\nBecause of early voting and the Republicans have to then make up for a bad on election day itself but that's not what we're seeing here and they get Mrs NBC News\nSo the question here ... hard to apply this to actual election outcomes too much we don't know but one thing we do know this is not this is not according to conventional wisdom conventional wisdom is and conventional wisdom has been the Republican enthusiasm is kind of suppressed\nUpstairs downstairs no escalators rush or let me tell you the

Nevada you know the the CNN\nGraphic that's been running all day Trump spreads ... stokes\nFear ahead of election\nI don't care what Donald Trump lives about ... states are there is no body and but rock Obama's league\nIn terms of purposely lying to deceive people such as you like your doctor you keep your doctor if you don't like your health when you get to keep your health plan\nWith Obamacare your average annual premium will be reduced by twenty five hundred dollars those lives were told over and over and over again to do\nOn winning Americans into believing that Obamacare was going to essential Eby cost free that it wasn't going to cost them very much of anything at all and that if they want their doctor in plan that wasn't going to be any change\nAnd we later found out course we knew from the beginning he was lying about it tried to tell everybody he was\nLying about people didn't want to believe the first African American president would lie about such things so much hope was invested in Obama misplaced as it turned out those wise again and they were just the tip of the iceberg those lives were meant\nTo deceive people those lives were meant to make fools out of people to get them to agree with Obama's Davis takeover of one sixth of the U.S economy\nFor the express purpose of being able to control people's lives if you control their health care if you control people's access to healthcare you control them\nYou can determine what there'll be allowed to eat or not you can even determine what political party gets preference if there is a line at the doctor and this is exactly what Obama and the Democrats were doing it didn't get a single Republican vote\nDid the media run banner headlines Obama's spreads lies and stokes fear to pass Obamacare [laughter]\nNo way how about the Ben ... just after with Obama and Hillary lying for months\nThat video produced by somebody nobody ever heard of cause the unrest that led to the riots that meant gutsy knowing all along that it was a pre planned and executed terror attack that the Obama administration did nothing to defend\n\nThose are lives designed to mislead to deceive and to ...\nHimself and the Hillary Clinton and everybody else that was in on that damn full decision about the law is Obama told about drawing red lines in Syria the Obama administration\nIt was a series of lies upon lies and deception upon deception and the American people quickly saw through it and began defeating Democrats at the polls in record numbers starting of the two thousand ten minute germs\nAnd Obama is outlying today he went out and get his own little rally in in Nevada and he tried to tell everybody\nWell when you think about it was going to go do remember who started or remember who was\nIn the ad is phased in his head up in the air looking up over everybody like God that like you got to look up to him but you're you're so far but neither me can't see you just woken up like this over everybody\nKnew just remember you just do you remember where his greatest comedies ... rock Obama\nCouldn't create these economic circumstances have his wife depends on it because he doesn't know how and he doesn't know how because he doesn't believe that what has happened in the last two years was possible but beyond that he didn't want this kind of economic activity he didn't want this kind of robust economic growth\n\nHe didn't want it demonstrated that people have more control over their destiny acting on their own behalf that if they stand aside and led government take care of things\nThis guy was a walking talking disaster for eight years\nAbout Obama colluding with Russia on getting rid of American nuclear weapons or an open Mike after the twenty ... right before the twenty twelve presidential election Obama's overheard\nTalking to ... number one the aid he says you tell Vladimir to be patient I'll have a lot more flexibility after this election flexibility meaning I'm up to run again and so I'll be able to even get rid of more nukes in our stockpiled than I could be for\nThe guy was just an honor disaster that the American people quickly realized as soon as the American people were able to get past the idea\nThat it was okay to vote against\nThe interest of the first African American president then the country began its recovery\n\nThe American people when it came to voting for Obama that couldn't pull a trigger not do it but when they came to voting against Democrats they did it in droves every chance they got starting in two thousand ten\nPut a picture up we got a picture for you to get a camera going to send us up to Rush Limbaugh not can we have to picture side by side make the switch on the left is Obama in Nevada on the right is Trump last night in Houston\nThere's something really really off about these people and I think they've been driven to various degrees of insanity by professors teachers and the media\nThey'd been lied to for so long about things that the things they expect to happen the things they think are real are so devoid\nOf reality and truth that they're on able to accept that Jim Jim Jim Acosta\nHaving the president whip people up at a rally after rally he says is the most depressing thing he's ever seen as a journalist this is the citizens CNN conference yesterday in New York City\nIf you want to ask me what makes me the most depressed about my job it's covering the rallies and it gets to the larger point of what it's like covering the president United States and in particular Donald Trump in many ways the danger is not what Trump is doing to America the danger is\nHow America is changing under Trump and I never thought I Would see the day where I Would go to a political rally and you know people would give you a hard time I you know people yelled at me that Hillary Clinton rallies during the to those make campaign\nBut at a rally after rally after rally\nHaving the president noted states where people up into a frenzy and attacked the press to me is the ... the most depressing thing that I've ever witnessed as a journalist man\nOh man we're has this guy begin to see Trump\nWhipping people up at rally after rally and having people get mad at me as a journalist is the most depressing thing I've seen as a gym you can get but you've got\nAll kinds of 'cause you could go be a waiver you obviously listen well\n\nMr Acosta however was not finished somebody needs to walk the guy back from the ledge here\nYou know thousands and thousands of people who are willing to join in and do the same thing I'm at the rally in Montana the other night when President Trump praised grudging unfortunately for bodies slamming Ben Jacobs I remember looking over to the supporters in the crowd and there was one guy one young man\nWho was doing these body slammed moves you know and and he and his buddies were all getting good laugh out of it and then he looked at me and he goes like this like I'm gonna cut your throat and you know it just it I I went up to him after was over and I talk to them about it and and he was a sort of laughing about it and I I guess he wasn't serious about it\nBut to me that the Trump effect on America\nWhat do you make of this so it it's it's no different than when Trump is onstage hey Russia\nHey Russia maybe you can find Hillary's emails and media is looking for him nobody can maybe you can find Hillary's missing thirty thousand a Muslim the media they love to hear from me\nAnd everybody on the left the media has a heart attack thinking Trump is asking the Russians to hack\nHillary server Hillary's already done the hack\nHillary's already done whatever she's done to hide the emails no sense of humor these people have no ability whatsoever to relate to people as they actually live so Trump praises the guy for being able to body slam somebody\nThey see no humor in it they don't have any idea how to relate to that they see that they think Trump they really do they think Trump is promoting violence\nThey think the Trump is recommending and praising ... girl violence Bobby ... but they just I I have never seen\nA group of people this large that is so distant and absent from reality from day to day life and how people talk to each other\nHe goes up to this guy and the guys laughing hey man hey Jim Acosta how you do it I really didn't want to see what you're ... you're not just fun and with your dude you're out there trying to destroy everything I Believe Mr I'm ... I'm just having a little fun with\nYou so these people in journalism they can go out they can destroy anybody they want they can take shots at anybody they want the people at that rally have respect for Trump the media can do whatever they want to try to destroy Trump but you'll let somebody throw it back on them and it said ... give a disgrace to show something\nProbably wrong with American culture what's wrong with American culture is that the elites of Washington DC not only do not understand real life America they don't like it much\nThey really have I think what they have about Trump more than anything is those of you who are elected him I think that's what this really boils down to when you get down to brass tacks more on that but we get back\n[noise] somebody has to have to say rush public ... being met work\nHe's pretty smart Russia is on it [noise]\nAll right to all of our listeners out there who are aged Seventy five are older and only one hundred thousand dollar life insurance rolls ... ...

York City and here's Jeff Flake weighing in on this\nTo me now it's just gotten so far beyond you're not expecting the president to pet it anymore but what is troubling is to look behind it\nAnd see the reaction of people to what he says and that's what's more troubling to me how as as to who believes and he does it I think because it still works still rile people up\nThat divides us horribly yeah oh it's\nJust it's very very dangerous it's very bad out there Trump spreading lies stoking fear every election there's Jeff Flake or who himself has been rejected by people like you and Arizona voters in Arizona couldn't get reelected\nSaw he now says what's really troubling the look behind Trump to see the reaction of people do what he says and that's what's more troubling to me now\nWho believes is\nHe does it I think because it's still works at sea so Trump Trump as he pretty smart Trump knows when he's Trump knows that you're idiots in Trump knows that you're fools and Trump knows that you'll fall for anything\nAnd so Trump is ... is working is spend golly like magic on you and and and people like Jeff Flake in the Washington establishment never Trump hers they resent the hell
