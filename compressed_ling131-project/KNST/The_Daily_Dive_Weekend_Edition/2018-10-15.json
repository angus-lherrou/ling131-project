Ramirez nobody could corroborate her story kept changing there was no evidence for it the New York times found that so bad they wouldn't they wouldn't allude to it much less reprint aspects of it and so Jane Mayer and Ronan Farrow run a second story\nThat isn't true just to establish a pattern in other words we're going to lie twice we're going to run a false story first that has no backup and then we're going to run a second story to show a pattern\nBecause I remember that with Clarence Thomas other women came forward it showed a pattern and it helped us persuade people at Thomas was guilty and so we wanted to show a pattern of behavior with Kavanaugh a pattern obese you couldn't even substantiate uh single allegation\nBe it from Boise Ford or being at from Ramirez or from Amman ... client\nWas her name sweat Nick I mean this is a flat out admitting yeah we made up a second story well\nDidn't use those words but we wanted to show a pattern so essentially they're saying we believe we can convince people that something happen just by writing a story alleging it and of course their buddies in the left will gladly accept an allegation is fact and an act on it you know we needed to show a pattern\nHere's here's Kennan Oklahoma City we're back to the phones great to have your er Hi\nHey it's great to be on Russia I'm not only are you L. rush but but you are the lead

don't need to be civil to conservatives anymore it reminded me of a profound quota came across ... years ago and maybe even you set it ah but here's the quote a society is either moving toward civility or barbarism\nAnd I see Trump trying to apply civil law and order to our society\nAnd it's apparent that the liberal left his and bracing barbarism again just wanted to get your thoughts\nAre ... the but the question is do I do I agree that uh our society as always trending toward a barber is what what barbarism in a\nSociety barbarism or civilly were trending one way or not in the middle of the ... eater trending towards the middle of the barbarism off the clocks and the oh it's a constant influx and so what what what what is your question more Trump isn't it\nWell it seems as if a Republican conservatives are taking the side of civility and working uh you know towards the law and order or restoring\nIt and it seems like the Democrats have just outright embraced barbarism right ah with all of their a character assassination attempts on Trump Kavanaugh anti a violent shooting\nYeah there's no there's no question about that it's an active choice I mean Hillary Clinton's endorsing it\nYeah absolutely and uh it's it's sad to see because this is not the Democrat Party of my uh mother and father and I remember so well you know conservatism here in Oklahoma where I live uh in fact in most states\nWell let me ask you know there was the Democratic party the Democratic party ... what was it when that was all gotten fine and dandy what word named him\nI think it was a

Democrats\nAlready has always been rooted in the modern era in our lifetimes of this century and the previous at the Democratic party has been rooted in anti capitalism has been rooted in pro socialism and big government\nThey've just now a band in any pre chance of moderation about that and have gone all in on militants and violent socialism to achieve their means\nMy boy they're

Peterson and Colin Powell and Benjamin Carson in ... and others\nFor being disloyal to the Democratic party when the Democratic party has not been anything but disloyal to African Americans and hurting them\nPractically every chance they have ... it's incredible to watch what's going on\nBack for the past half century Ninety percent of black voters have cast their ballots for Democrats a national elections even though it's against their self interest the Democrats have consistently opposed go choice trapping kids and failing public schools\nFor generations they've ... Democrats have promoted illegal immigration which is destroyed black working class jobs\nAnd champion Bill Clinton's prone after policies which have led to a massive levels of unemployment in black communities they've also Democrats who crippled the black families by embracing welfare writes the penalize married couples who get married\nIt goes on and on and on\nAnd this was all set in a sense to CNN's Don Lemon\nWho laughed with venomous ... and what these other African Americans were saying can you imagine if a white conservative Republican had called some black guy a house negro\nOr use other racial pejorative against them they wouldn't be kicked off said but not when their own get to do it and they do it with such ... and you know when you think back in history\nWhich CNN did the Kanye West borrows from an ugly ugly and tragic history of slavery and the pre civil war you see white slave owners who wrote Democrats ruthlessly\nPunished any black man or woman who sought to educate themselves and think for themselves\nThe Democrat white slave owners in the south headed control blacks maintaining power over them and after the civil war ended conducted by Democrats\nSlave owners had to release their slaves but they formed the Ku Klux Klan Democrats formed the Ku Klux Klan as the terrorists arm of the Democratic party to intimidate murder Lynch suppressed and destroy\nAny political activities of the newly freed black population to keep them under control if they threaten the Democratic power structure believe me the Democrats and the Ku Klux Klan went after them hard later on in the era of Jim Crow why Democrats\nCodify into law the idea of literacy test and other means and methods to dumb down and keep African Americans poorly educated and keep them all in line\nTo protect their power\nNinety five percent of black people continually vote for Democrats\nBecause his sample issue in media like the CNN and ABC NBC and CBS control black Americans to keep them in line to keep them under control we have well I watch free thinking African American men and women be partially destroyed by CNN and the mainstream media in Democratic Party\nAnd so then I look at the results of the Trump Administration black unemployment historically low\nCriminal justice reform is coming he's fighting against illegal immigration that hurts black workers he's trying to find a solution to the never ending slaughter of black men by other black men in Chicago dominated only by the Democratic party\nAnd he's going to try to make it possible for Democrats to sit down at the table of equal economic opportunity and so what happened and Kanye West is the same crap that's happened to Clarence Thomas to Jesse ... Peterson the condo Lisa rice to any black who steps out of line\nThey're called madman like by Jimmy Kimble they're called uncle Tom's like by Snoop Dogg they're called mentally ill\nBy Don Lemon and they allow the racism on CNN dummy employed against a black man if he doesn't express the right political viewpoints that is why CNN working with the Democratic party must destroy Kanye West\nAnd and they do their best but I don't think it's going to work I have trust and faith that African Americans maybe in three weeks\nWe'll discover and learn what the Democratic Party has done to them and not for them\nThe truth is just take a look at the education system and the crime in cities like Baltimore Chicago Detroit Memphis or Milwaukee the schools are completely dysfunctional the black family is completely broken\nThere's no job creation\nThe average black student comes out of high school in Milwaukee or Detroit or Chicago reading about the eighth grade level unprepared for the world of the twenty first century and all those cities that Democrats have been in charge for the last fifty to eighty years with no discernible results\nYet when a black man like Kanye West steps out of line and begins to express support for a different political outlook\nHe has called every dirty rotten filthy racial name and the book\nBecause it fits the idea of the Democratic party keeping blacks in line they want to dissuade other African American men from thinking in acting independently of the Democratic party that is cause such harm can you think of worst cities to live in\nOne control by crime and poverty single mothers academic failure racial inequality that is the result whether whatever black city it is controlled by Democrats what occurs\nWhen you think about how badly the Democratic party is treated blocks the relevant question isn't y con you realize that but why others have not realized why even more black voters had the same ... funny as Kanye West why hasn't happened yet well maybe it is 'cause right now\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nOkay here's the deal Monday Night I got a call from the White House president would like to see you friday night when he's in Cincinnati I sort of course\nI wanted to go watch a high school football game where the relative playing but I thought well this is pretty important it's on Wednesday I made a request that the White House to do a short interview\nWhich of the White House should said should be kept her about five minutes if it's granted I said okay actually turned out to be almost Fifteen minutes goes the president and I had so much fun so I met the president in a hanger on friday evening and about an hour later he was going to go speak in ah north of Cincinnati about thirty miles north of Cincinnati and Warren County\nAnd I am a Republican gathering of which twenty thousand people show up and little Warren County while standing in a field with a light rain and cold dark and the sun was down and must have been forty forty five degrees the president let 'em up\nSo well on friday night the White House said no problem I met with the president\nDid like eight Thirteen fourteen minutes interview and the references to about an hour from our relate to the what was going on in orange county and yesterday Saturday he was in Kentucky and uh and beautiful and I think he he told me off the\nOff the air is going to be doing this three or four nights and the next three weeks and he said I got more energy about this than I've ever had so here's my talk with the president that uh was approximately seven pm on friday night tater had it\nFirst of all Mr President welcome to Cincinnati thank you you have a long distance relationship here\nI Do have to ... ships I had swift in with my father a long time ago and we uh we did a good job we fix it up we uh eleven hundred and sixty four units are remember the exact we fix it up I worked here for two summers\nSick of it by saying that I ... that's right right by since and I don't even know if it's still there are no and knocked down about six months ago a really yellow and gone the whole thing is loading the garbage can sure everything's on what's going to happen with it making a housing development oh okay good but it was great for us we fixed it\nAnd sold it for more money and uh it was very good but I Love since the queen city I Love the queen city let's talk about what happened today with a pastor Brunson a major accomplishment you're like the hostage receiving president all the world they're coming in how important was to get back this religious leader who was being persecuted in Turkey\nWell he is that he's a great religious leader and it was a you know they accused him of things that he didn't do\nBut we got him back and we got back I it we got back many people actually if you look at it as like seems like all the time we're bringing back people and uh I Know President Obama pay one point eight billion for nothing to bring back a few people from around one point eight billion\nAnd uh we got back and he's going to be safer shortly he's in the air just he literally just took off\nAnd he'll be in the office he'll be in the oval office big welcome a big welcome yeah you know evangelical Christians everybody everybody wanted a back what happened to them was incredible and he was held hostage but now he's a he's going to be happy I'm sure he's very happy right now about\nYour wife is good she's a lawyer to Africa sure which is unbelievable what happened there talk about what was the goal and what was accomplished with Maloney in Africa well\nShe's a terrific first lady and a great human being and she wanted to go and see for herself Africa because we've heard so much\nAbout it some very good step but some very tough stuff in the sense of the way people live and she made forceps and she also went to the pyramids and Egypt and there was quite something special\nBut uh and the poverty is incredible you know the level of poverty a it was very sad a beautiful in one way and very sad and other kids were beautiful they loved her\nAnd she came back and she said I Hope you're going to continue to give a lot of money because they needed is not a question of it's not a question of defense it's not a question of it it's just it's on a human basis they needed and she had a big impact on me I Will tell you a bill she really had a big impact\nOn me and the other thing the mid west I looked at Canada Mexico in South Korea [noise]\nMillions of jobs have been credit and you were told a year or two ago by Gary Cohn and others that you know the candidate deal is probably not going to happen Mexico's too tough NAFTA is ingrained what did you do that cause Canada may not be real happy right now in Mexico may not be right in and South Korea\nTo kind of play because we're the big dog in the kennel but they don't treat it that way what did you do with the\nTrade deal and we're also the piggy bank that everybody wants to come in and Rob\nAnd uh Mexico we made a deal and we told her look otherwise we're going to have to just to actually car industry which would have been bad for them and frankly I wouldn't have wanted to do it but we were going to do it and\nWe made a deal with Mexico we could not make a deal with Canada they just wouldn't make a deal that was fair for us because NAFTA was a total and complete disaster you know that better than all of that you saw what happened over here with you still have building's empty with just everybody moved out\nI don't know what they were thinking so that's why I refused to call it NAFTA I said the deal with making I refused so we call it the U.S embassy a and it works good but we made a great deal is with everybody what happened then is Kennedy came along in the end\nWe were unable to make it I said we're going to tax you cars coming in and then what happened and they made a deal they made a deal they made a deal and it's a deal that we're very happy with I Hope they are very happy with I Hope everybody is but it's a fair deal for us and\nWe have now we're just going to deal with South Korea which is fabulous much a much improved approved deals you know improved I Will say that Hillary Clinton you remember she made that deal and she said it's two hundred and fifty thousand jobs and she was right for South Korea so they got two hundred and fifty we didn't get two hundred and fifty\nIt was a terrible deal so essentially we terminated that deal and we made a new deal with South Korea\n... how many jobs you're talking about are we talking about Canada Mexico will be talking about a million\n... you're talking about millions of jobs potential don't forget we've opened up countries that were just totally close to it if you look at Canada we couldn't sell our dairy products are there and if we did it was a three hundred percent of people don't talk about that you know if I put on a ten percent or twenty percent Arab they make a big deal if they have three hundred", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Daily Dive Weekend Edition", "city": "Tucson", "day": "15"}
