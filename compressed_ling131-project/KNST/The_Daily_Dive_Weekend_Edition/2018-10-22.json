Fox News Central American migrants streamed through southern Mexico heading toward the United states after making an end run around Mexican agents who briefly brought blocked them at the Guatemalan border Fox's William last year that\nAnd so right now a regular army of ... migrants streaming through southern Mexico\nToward America has made an Enron this afternoon around Mexican agents who briefly stopped them the numbers have swelled to about ten thousand and every time you watch ABC or CNN interview one of them\nThey talk about a gentleman by talking about what Trump wants you to do and the F. word all these things are shattered against our president they're they're getting help from sympathetic Mexicans at every turn offer them food and water clothing transportation driving pickup trucks and vans and cargo truck stop to let them clamor aboard to go north\nAnd so over the next several weeks we're going to have tens of thousands of individuals\nFrom the most violent place on Mother Earth\nMake their way into Texas Nevada Arizona and basically\nThe media is telling us we should encourage it and not let and let it occur like Nancy Pelosi said Saturday that she would welcome all of the migrants from Central America all of them\nWell there's about thirty five million who live in Central America there's about a hundred and forty million in Mexico there's another two hundred million in South America polling has indicated given a choice South American Central Americans and Mexicans something like two hundred million would come to America to a hundred million\nWhat would that do to our government to our welfare spending ... hospitals do our presidents we wouldn't have a country anymore two hundred million want to come here and because the way the law is constituted that are the Democrats were not allowed to change it takes ten Democrats and the Senate to do anything and they won't permit it they will permit\nThat because if you're from other than Mexico to him the other words from Central America and you may go to America there's a magic car that you have to read seeking refugee status and that begins a legal process it will take years\nIn the meantime you're inside of America waiting for a hearing that cannot take place we are not scaled\nTo have enough camps they have enough judicial officers to have enough lawyers are not scaled for any of this to allow tens of thousands or millions to arrive at our border so far this year until October first which is what about two and a half weeks ago we have a hundred and Seventy five thousand migrants have come to America this year\nFrom a central and South America hundred and Seventy five thousand we don't have the judges the lawyers the courtrooms to hold hearings hundred and seven hundred Seventy five thousand when you have five to ten year backlogs of millions who adopted her jet\nAnd so the game being played by the Democrats as extremely serious\nIf you're from Mexico here illegally you mean taken right back immediately if you're from Central America you have the right to hearing that goes on and on and on and never stops so uh I I'm interested to see when and if the media will change\nTheir coverage to provide objective information the damages caused by unbridled massive illegal migration from third world poverty driven criminals societies into America and what the impact that has in schools orphanages hospitals\nAnd the rest there's no media coverage of what's happening in Nevada Arizona California taxes to New Mexico through legal migration that there's no coverage it doesn't exist the murders of rapes et cetera it does not exist\nRemember that nine\nOf the ten most violent countries in the world or south of the U.S border sixteen of the twenty most violent the other foreign Africa and they're invading our country they don't have uniforms on but they're coming here and mass incentivized by our media by the Democratic party\nI said in twenty sixteen the reason Trump shocked the world\nWas because of illegal immigration federal judges and the economy right now with Trump is our leader everything is coming up roses it's unbelievable Trump has everyone from North Korea to Russia\nBelieving we're about to bust up every new trading necessary to keep to get America back on even track the trade imbalances are starting to flip he has an economy exceeding five percent GDP\nThe unemployment numbers so not just the ... the lowest they ever could be the or the other three point seven percent of us would not work can be put a gun to their head the terrorists are on the run\nISIS is destroyed Iran has on notice in marginalized\nEven the Saudis now are doing some soul searching about how they treat people opioid issues prison reform marijuana reform is all coming on the rise\nThis guy is performing magnificently but the media is going to use they think immigration the tank the twenty eight teams to favor the Democrats and the tank this president and twenty twenty now that's not the world that I live in maybe if you live in Connecticut a Las Vegas or Chicago\nOr California San Diego that's the world you live and you want more individual is here with a third grade education Eighteen to twenty eight years old with no marketable skills not able to speak at the English you want maybe a few thousand more in your community\nPlease bring them according regarding party but that's not the word I live in Cincinnati, Ohio I don't think those who think about these issues\nIn Las Vegas or Chicago or California San Diego Tampa Denver Cincinnati I don't think we think about these issues in ways that the mainstream media can understand I must live in some alternative universe because according to CNN this is the issue\nOf unbridled migrants walking into America that will cause average Americans living in Wisconsin and Michigan to vote for the Democratic party if that's the case I live in some alternative universe that's not the world in which I live I'm Sorry\nAnd I wish there was some way through the magic wand\nThat we go to help the two or three hundred million Mexicans Central Americans and south Americans not living a great life that don't have the opportunities that you and I have\nWe're only four percent of the world's population but every year legally through ... says these we've taken legally one point one million foreigners to come into America take the oath of office and become American citizens which is more than the rest of the world put together we already do that one point one million\nBut I'll be damned if I'm going to sit here and watch hordes\nOf young males from El Salvador Guatemala and Nicaragua Mexico Venezuela Colombia Peru Bolivia Paraguay why Europe why Brazil and Argentina it simply\nIllegally make their way somehow into America claim their quota refugee get in line for hearings five to ten years from now that will never happen\nThis is fundamentally changed our country that is far\nAnd it's going to be much worse\nIf in twenty Eighteen one and two weeks two weeks in two days the Democrats take the house and or the Senate\nThat out if that happens the country we live and will cease to exist do we have the have the wherewithal to take in a hundred million people or the school was coined in such a fashion or the hospitals ready to go ... or the bridges and roads next\nThere's always ready to accept a hundred million more people because the Democratic party says that's what's coming how is this possible that the most violent places on earth is sending its largely young males to come into America\nI got a Kevin Jackson coming up later an African American leader of great no there's no race or group of people more hurt by legal immigration than African American males especially young African American males they figured out that this was not benefit\nThem at all there is a benefit American business does it benefit American public education doesn't benefit the hospital systems that we have\nThis benefit any part of our does it benefit our jobs economy absolutely not we bring in legally one point one million and I'm proud to say that we\nAre a nation of immigrants but there are legal immigrants you don't determine for yourself to join a country come and walk into a country which you don't belong to and not a citizen up men demand right\nAre you kidding me\nOh last year the question tonight is that the issue that's going to cause millions of Americans in two weeks and two days to vote for Democrats do you believe that\nOne eight six six six or seven seven three three seven we continue we have calls from a Chicago Los Vegas Connecticut California San Diego and every place in between coming up later will be

Arabian killed in Turkey is more important to us that a brave police officer who gave his life\nIs that what CNN believes the answer is yes\nThey want to use ... as a cudgel against Trump and why I
