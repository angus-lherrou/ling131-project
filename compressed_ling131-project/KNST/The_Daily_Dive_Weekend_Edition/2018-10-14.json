Institute in Virginia and William sounds as a suicide Hitler therapist and he guide you\nThrough these incredible states as consciousness and I personally know that things just from my experience it love to hear more from William welcome\nTo the show and thanks for joining me William\nHi how are you feeling very good good\nSo tell me first of all what led you to even create such assistance and out of body ventured idea\nWell over forty years ago I had my own ah I had an out of body experience goes back to Nineteen Seventy three and I was not a believer and then this would be impossible\nBut I had a friend of mine that had a spontaneous experience in college and I decided to explore it ... it was a life changing experience for him so I began to investigate it and found that there was methods to self initiate and out of body experience so I explored them and for\nIt took me I Believe on the twenty fourth day of having a daily exercise um I initiated my first\nFully conscious out of body experience and it was it was completely life changing I mean 'cause I was not a believer\nBut I wanted to explore and experience it see if it was real for myself and it's it's quite a life change your family who had actually the your entire life a whole paradigm of your perception of reality shifted\nOh yeah it is now you had your out of body experience with sales induced it wasn't through a an accident or any type of trauma right\nRight it was self induced through um like a meditative exercise that I that I learned and then I developed many different kinds that we can do to self initiate the experience\nThere was this before or after you became a\nOh that was way before yeah I later became a hip no therapist and I was a I used it to develop other techniques to help or negotiate these altered states and out of body experiences\nSo after you had these experiences yourself then you went into helping other people experienced the same thing so tell me about your oh B. E. where did you go what did you experience how did you know it was effective for you\nWell the my first one I've ever had hundreds and hundreds of experiences over the decades but the first one I had um I was actually in a dorm room are going to college\nAnd I was doing what I call the target technique where you select three objects and you focus on them and as you fall asleep at night\nThe next after\nA series of days went by a one day I was sleeping on my side and I when I become aware I've realize I was vibrating differently\nIt's it's strange to really describe this but you feel a vibration of floating sensation when I reached out my arm I realized my arm entered the wall\nAnd when I did you think we reach the arm out oh no I was not ...\nI didn't realize it was that you the truth at the time but when I reached out what is at now I realize and at that moment I realized was my non physical arm\nIt went through the wall and then I saw them standing and next thing I knew I was standing by the foot of the bed and it was a one hundred percent Rio and I began to move around the room and examine my surroundings\nThat was my first experience it was relatively brief but it was quite a life changing\nDid you encounter any body being guide anyone there\nAre actually that I did and I write about this is my first book adventures beyond the body that I observed someone that was observing may ... but they didn't I didn't communicate with them but somebody was observing may which was at the moment with a little bit shocking\nI was a newbie I had no idea about that what I at first stepped into here and a ... over the decades and years of course I became more and more comfortable as I began to have more and more experiences\nIt's addicting isn't it\nYeah well it's it's it's exciting because you can finally obtained the answers for yourself ... ... that\nSaid I think is the most important thing you don't have to depend upon um external sources and uh the indoctrinated society and culture that surround us you can you can find out the answers for yourself\nYou don't get me an example 'cause how do we know the answers are true\nWhen you experience from in other words once you leave your body you know you you're more than your body you know that your brain is not the sort of consciousness mhm as we've been trained to believe\nYou realize that you continue to exist and also you begin to realize that the universe is multi dimensional\nWhat I began to experience was a not only one non physical dimension but many of them and you realize that the physical world is just the in a sense ... than at the ... of the universe\nIs just one of them yeah yes\nAnd but you can experience that first hand and that's what's important it's it's it's not conjecture or belief system\nMhm I always think you know is incredible as our our world is and you know this incredible globe that were in it\nIsn't stopping couldn't it stops here I mean with all the intelligence that we had a year and with all the system's information to the human being why would the universe just create one type of human being it doesn't make any [laughter]\nAbsolutely not and once you have to mention that\nOnce you have these experiences you realize that the universe is multi dimensional mhm and that and that there is there's trillions of all their life forms\nYeah and not all human and has to be it wouldn't just be one [laughter] you don't want him anything\nNo of course not and it's the universe is far more diverse and magnificent and then we can do that I can express\nMhm yeah it is an absolute in so now when you you have these experiences and you know they're real because especially they feel real you know he was clean the because usually not a language to really clearly defined\nWhat an addict and mention is universal understanding\nWell once you leave your body and you begin to you begin to communicate and meet other being's generally they're humanoid they're generally what we would consider to be people that have died\nOr I write about communicating and meeting my mother and my uncle who who passed and it all communication is very elegant it's by thought and there's no need in other words language is no longer a barrier\nWe we communicate directly by soft ... and it's amazing it's so clear and concise compared to the physical languages that we use here that are symbols\nAnd it's uh it's amazing but that's one of the great benefits or this or that you have an opportunity to experience and explore\nYourself and discover the answers for yourself there was no\nUm when I teach my classes I there was no um belief systems attached to it\nEach individual is given the skills given the tools needed let's say to go out and become an explorer themselves so they can discover what they feel is the truth for themselves which is very important\nNow you're listening you teach them and really tell us what does look like when you have people come and I call it an actual tourism many [laughter] ... it really is an adventure and you say beyond the body\nYes it is it's um the among roe Institute which by the way I'm calling from\nOh great in Virginia I'm\nOnly twenty four people can attend it's a world renowned as being\nThe center for the exploration of consciousness but in my workshop I'm generally what I each person is in a checked unit or Bob Monroe had a real thing for ah\nThese Akron as ... and um what is that controlled holistic\nEnvironmental chamber in other words each person's in and personal isolation both and I speak to them when we're doing a technique through headphones so everybody's in their own isolation chamber\nTotally disoriented let's put it that way badge and you're having coffee one morning and your office and suddenly your entire body it's called ... I mean can you imagine I mean it's hard for us to wrap our minds around that so there was a lot of people\nThat we're shifting those are people that died and this is a this is an ongoing process it's done by many around the world and it it's functions in different names in a different cultures or in up to the Institute\nWe we presented in I think I'm more or let yourself very grounded in a scientific waves at least a scientific as we can that goes for all the training here it's a it's done in a way that's presented\nIn a very logical way that's a understandable which no cultural or
