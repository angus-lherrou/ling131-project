New York about thirty miles west of Albany the state capital Chris ... is with the New York state police\nWho tried tried to rape her\nNot one but for boys she said she said she was in her late teens that she switched it back to Fifteen Years old she said it happened in the mid Nineteen eighties and then she switched back to Nineteen eighty two practical everything she said turn out to be false\nNow you got to be kind to the woman because she's a allegedly a survivor of sexual assault but part of the deal is when you make certain assertions\nAnd if they're refuted as they were by Brett Kavanaugh you got to prove it supposedly she was terrified of small spaces\nTerrified of airplanes then we find out from a boyfriend that they want on John's together basically all over the globe she went to Costa Rica she went to Hawaii she went to ah the south Pacific Island she went to a French Polynesia she went to Israel she went to Central America she went to Europe\nAll by being terrified of airplanes\nThe boyfriend also said during the six years that he dated her in a sworn statement to the Senate committee she never mentioned a sexual assault never mentioned the name Brett Kavanaugh shed no fear of flying in fact the flu around islands on single propeller airplanes sitting next to each other\nBut she uh the the second door theory was a bunch of crap because it came out\nThat they wanted to second door in their home in twenty eight four years before the therapy session because she wanted to provide an entrance to her therapist to conduct their business as a psychologist inside of her home\nShe also coached a friend about how to take a polygraph test she lied about that she also ah stole money from the boyfriend so all these things that she said\nDr Christina forward simply fell apart and now yesterday or today her lawyer Deborah cats came out to say that she doesn't want to pursue the Kavanaugh thing anymore really\nShe's done with it so\nMedia turn out to be liars and thieves in trucks and miscreants every every description the second accuser Debbie ...\nA dusting off the memories polling of Bill Clinton on her as a freshman in college no one supported horror story either she gave for names and the FBI they checked out the stories of ... Ramirez\nShaking his junk in her face she must have been thinking of Bill Clinton but basically no one supported her story either and then one of the silent heroes of this\nHas been the porn lawyer Michael Evan Eddie boy he did a great job for the Republicans he came out with such ridiculous\nAntithetical information that no one believed word of what he said in fact the cast light away from\nAway from a from a doctor forward and Debbie ... put it on sweat Nick nobody believed\nIn fact here's a quote from Senator Collins on Saturday quote some of the allegations Lebanon against judge Kavanaugh illustrate why the presumption of innocence is so important\nI'm thinking in particular not of the allegations raised by professor forward but at the allegation that when he was a teenager judge Kavanaugh drug multiple girls and use their weaken state to facilitate gang rape\nThis outlandish allegation was put forth without any credible supporting evidence and simply parrot it\nPublic statements of others that such an allegation can find its way into the U.S Supreme Court confirmation process\nIs a stark reminder about why the presumption of innocence is so ingrained in our American consciousness quote unquote so said the Senator Susan Collins and that was a beautiful comment I Love Susan Collins I Love Lindsey Graham and I think Michael ... he's doing a great job representing the Democratic party\nAnd needs to keep doing it plus uh\nAs far as supporting the me too movement and standing with Kevin ...\n... I read some way of a expert from the independent women's forum Julie gun like coming up later on but Patrice lay on ... spent on my show many times wrote a column a sudden this morning Sunday Morning\nAbout supporting survivors and standing with Kavanaugh she said those who promotes the slogan set up a false dichotomy if you believe that survivors of sexual assault it abuse should be able to tell their stories and find justice I Am with you\nThat you then must believe the allegations of Christine afford therefore you must agree the judge Kavanaugh was lying and you must opposes confirmation she said this is a false choice as a woman I can be sympathetic to victims of sexual abuse\nBut also care about the facts of each specific case if I was a member of a jury sitting in a rape matter\nMy sympathy with the with the victim\nHowever I Want to hear the evidence or lack of corroboration and inconsistencies to make sure the correct parties identified and she goes on to point out the number of times\nInnocence Project in others have exonerated through late a DNA testing\nRape rape is to have spent thirty seven years in jail including Gregory towns\nAnd Van Dyke Perry who's spending combine thirty seven years in prison on false rape charges DNA testing showed that the men were not connected with the crime and the victim later after they did thirty seven years in jail admitted that she lied\nOr how about the Hofstra University case in which for Hofstra University men were indicted expelled from ... or their lives ruined about a gang rape of an Eighteen year old fellow students and twenty nine\nThe accuser later admitted that her allegation was fabricated the authorities dropped the charges but the damage to these young men and their families were already done plus innocent projects it go to innocent project dot com they have hundreds and hundreds of men exonerated\nOf rape charges when later evidence came out why can't the United States Senate understand that about Ninety percent of the allegations of rape and sexual assault or accurate but ten percent or more are not accurate\nIn other words there are uncorroborated and you need evidence which is a bedrock of American Jurisprudence destroyed or goes on to say as a woman as a mother as a sister and a daughter I Believe in justice and fairness and the me too movement these fires are not in competition to treat men\nFairly all victims deserve justice but justice is not one sided due process and fairness should be upheld for both the accuser and the accused for conservatives and liberals for women and for men\nSo when you look at the allegations of professor Christina forward they completely fall apart they don't exist there is no cooperation\nAnd so you can't say we support the me too movement\nAnd we also have to say that we believe in bedrock principles of due process and fairness and innocent until proven guilty those two principles are not in conflict except in the minds of Cory Booker Kamala Harris\nAnd a senator Hirono of Hawaii when asked this morning whether it's right for paid democratic activist to chase down Republicans in restaurants in elevators and airports she could not say that as wrongful activity she couldn't say that\nIn fact they indirectly demand violence against Republicans\nAnd showing where we are Steven ... of the Late Show has a terrible late night product I Would never watch but I read this or the Drudge Report this evening aerial doom is\nAerial do most as a writer\nOn Stephen coal bears the Late Show on CBS she wrote at six thirty six pm on Saturday quote whatever happens I'm just glad we ruin Brett Kavanaugh as life\nUnquote you see this was never about finding the truth about professor forward she was used like a three dollar steak\nBy a Senator Feinstein and others to make public private information that she wanted to keep private because she fit their diatribe it is unbelievable\n... and this writer for the CBS Evening show Stephen Colbert aerial Duma says it clearly quote whatever happens I'm just glad re ruined Brett Kavanaugh as life\nThey want it to ruin ... for the sake of ruining him because he didn't vote the way they wanted him to vote and he was nominated by Trump who they hate\nThat sums up the entire difficulties with Democrats they now try to dig out from their own rubble for the coming midterms suddenly they were woken the Republican conservative majority and now we're more energized to vote than we've ever been because the Democratic party has shown us their backside and it's an ugly backside\nLet's continue to take your calls we have thousands on hold millions are listening the heroes of this fight didn't think I'd ever say this Senator Susan Collins is a

Susan Collins\nAnd Lindsey Graham to be the key voices the United States Senate\nI didn't think I'd ever see this in my lifetime Susan Collins stood up like a tenfold bacon in the night she was brilliant\nGoing over forty five minutes why she was going to support and then I I Try to listen to Lisa Murkowski who made no sense at all it seems like slime ball tactics have good consequences as long as you make the slime ball tactics they seem to work Lisa Murkowski in Alaska I mean there was no reason she could not listen to what Susan Collins had to say\nAnd and maybe she hates Trump's so much you could not stand to put one of his nominees in the U.S Supreme Court\nAnd I'm so proud of ah Brett Kavanaugh as his wife his mom and dad as girls\nAnd what they had to put up with like he was crucified on the Democratic cross of political correctness and title nine that's what boys go through in college when charged with a girl\nUp some sexual assault the most likely did not happen they get into title nine court and presumption of innocence cross examination of witness confronting your accusers all that kinda stuff doesn't apply\nSo in the minds of Democrats this was the title nine case in which the allegation was made and therefore you cannot investigate professor Ford\nOnce investigated mainly by the conservative media practically everything Ford said fell apart\nIncluding the four eyeball witnesses including her river version of the facts from er twenty twelve and twenty third gene therapist notes including the front door the fear of flying whatever it was I'm not sure she said anything that was truthful at all nothing\nAnd so Lisa Murkowski is stupid a woman from Alaska stupid Susan Collins took some serious flak from the radical left like my friend Bryan kill me did a Fox and friends and she stood up and did what was right I don't know if she's going to run for reelection and two years\nBut she ought to but now a clowns and fools to come out of the woodwork like Valerie Jarrett open gossipy famed to run against or in Maine have added\nLet's continue their calls is go to a Lewis in Chicago\nLewis in Chicago welcome to the bill Cunningham show Lewis go ahead\nThank bill I appreciate you taking my call Yes sir I just wanted to comment on the relationship of the Democratic party to the pornography industry if you don't mind sure yeah\nDo you know the Democrats claim to care about women but I'm over the years or one of their largest supporters has been the pornography in the street I'm just wondering if they're really cared about women why did they take money from these people who would like women that way\nAbout Michael evidently the porn lawyer and I I think he did a great job I mean he's got to be on Don Lemon put 'em on CNN or MSNBC a lot more times Michael ... is such a loud mouth clown in such an embarrassment he defends porn stars and this guy says he's going to run against the president twenty twenty\nCould we be that lucky my having any run against ...\nI Hope he does bill but I tell you you know if you look back to the Clinton years they didn't have one criminal conviction against pornography and open the doors to all this I Believe I Believe it open the doors to all this\nBut you know bad stuff is pilots stuff you see out there\nDuring the porn star to porn industry has given millions of dollars with the Democrats along with the abortion industry so killing babies in subject getting women to lie for sexual assault is what the Democratic Party is all about if they if they cared about sexual assault or women than their leader would not be\nThe U.S Congressman Ellison and he would not be the candidate in Minnesota that they're really cared about women and sexual assault Bill Clinton will not serve out his term if they really care and the enabler Bill Clinton Hillary Clinton wouldn't have been the nominee in ... if they really cared about sexual assault correct\nCorrect absolutely right and you know but actually are doing a lot of harm to women these people because uh you know the old effect of the boy who cried wolf you know nobody's going to believe women who are are telling the truth\nOr if a woman comes forward with the probably eight or nine times out of ten is correct but every now and then you have the Hofstra every now and then you have the Duke lacrosse team or UBA every now and then you have the Innocence Project that was listed hundreds of men cleared of rape charges\nFrom false allegations and so yeah I'm going to believe a woman a Ninety percent of the time but I Want to hear the story I'm sympathetic with professor Ford I Want to hear what happened how it happened\nHow'd you get to the party how'd you get home from the party Hoover the eye witness was telling me get hit by the second door tell me about the fear of flying all these things\nLewis turned out to be a lie or a misstatement or not true you know the truth little thing that happened is I think in twenty twelve and twenty Thirteen when she wants to see her therapist she spoke the truth\nAnd she said and twenty ... twenty Thirteen before a Kevin always going to be a nominee she told the therapist that she was a attempted rape by four boys\nIn her late teens and the mid Nineteen eighties and the reason it didn't fit Kevin Oh it's because he was one boy and by the mid Nineteen eighties Brett Kavanaugh was not living in Maryland anymore he had moved to Connecticut so she had to\nTell the fib that it was Kevin Oh but they but the notes of the therapist clearly indicated it could not have been bred Kevin you see if you go to a therapist or a doctor and you're seeking help psychiatric help or medical assistance\nYou are incentivized to tell the truth not going to go to a doctor and say my right arm hurts when it's really your left foot\nBecause you one treatment so when Dr Ford went to a therapist in twenty ... twenty Thirteen who made copious notes about what she said out of her own mouth she said and twenty twelve that four boys tried to rape me when I was in my late teens and the Nineteen eighties\nShe had flipped out on Kavanaugh and change the story completely suddenly there was one boy and not for suddenly it was in her late teens it was Fifteen suddenly one in the mid Nineteen eighties it was Nineteen eighty two she had to change your story in order to fit Brad
