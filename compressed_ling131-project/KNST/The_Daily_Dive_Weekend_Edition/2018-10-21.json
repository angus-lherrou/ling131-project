experiment did it work Thomas resentful welcome to the coast to coast am how are you\nI'm well Richard thanks for having me on\nMy pleasure let's talk about Harry who d'nese um how should we described his I mean he was not just a skeptic of after death communication he was an of vowed to bunker and I don't even think that is saying it strongly enough I mean he there was almost a hatred\nOf for these people that he considered to be frauds where did that he knew why did that happen how did it come about\nThat that's a very interesting place to start 'em because you're absolutely right I mean he wrote two books as you mentioned and he really um he um\nWas not just on the side he his mother died in Nineteen Thirteen and at that point he tried to get in touch with her through some psychic but he could tell they were all faking what they were doing and so um\nThat kind of got him going and so he has an excellent magician he was able to replicate\nSome of the things that these fake mediums would do\nSo he was always looking for that and actually I think this is ultimately will get got him killed because I think that the people these fake psychics we're talking amongst themselves and I think they want it to refer them up a little bit I don't think they wanted to kill him\nBut I think they wanted to say back off and we don't get in your way get out of our way and I think they might have spent some money to get that um\nYoung student who had been on the boxing team to punch him in the stomach which was a trick he did in public and as you know Richard he he would pick someone out of the crowd pick someone like you or me you know right and they would have them come up to the stage and he would make his muscles ready and he would be ready for that but\nThis time there's this guy came backstage and Harry wasn't expecting it at all his muscles aren't from this guy really late into him and the trauma in his abdomen was so intense that um you know you had those problems and his appendix burst and this is why passed away\nRight and and had he had he gone to the doctor immediately to receive a medical uh help he probably would've lived but always the showman he the show must go on and he went on and he performed or four or five more shows and and then finally collapsed in Detroit\nYes he was doing little tiny handkerchief magic 'cause that was all he had the\nStrength for 'em but one other point I on this subject about these fake medium\nHe would send his assistance out and they would find people and they would see the show and he would find a point in time where the show could be busted so to speak and he would even get the guy that was in control of the light and on the deal and Harry would show up with a photographer and the newspaper Harry would be wearing a disguise\nThe magician would be in the middle of his you know they say on the weather would ever where the hidden string making something fly to this guy or whatever and the lights would come up in a photographer would take a picture and and the you know the fake media would be totally surprised they were you and he'd say I'm Harry Houdini to pull off his mask and\nSo these guys are very sick\nFascinating I I had not heard the the theory that perhaps some of these a cabal of of disgruntled a psychics and mediums had put this young student at McGill University up to the task of of ah yeah this writing on beating on Harry right into my\nThat's my own idea I haven't heard it from anyone else um it seems to make sense a few phone calls hey you know I mean that guy had\nNothing on Henry you know I mean he didn't have any kind of reason to go there or do anything\nRight right I thought it was ... I just wanted to ask you about briefly about a circus or Arthur Conan Doyle because they were Harry and and he were were good friends and yet a Doyle was a prominent spiritual is so how did that\nHow did that friendship survive or the fact that Harry was such an vowed to bunker didn't have time for spirit you list and yet he's good friend and his wife were both very much into spiritualism movement\nYes yes the spirit was movement is not exactly out and find in some kind of permanent structure you know you can't say there's a leader but a lot of people did looked at the oil as the leader of the spiritual as a matter of friendship starting in around Nineteen twenty for about two years\nAnd I think the friendship came about through fan just fame crossing pass and hey how are you and they enjoy the fact that they had a different perspective and they talked about it\nUm but eventually um there was a little bit of\nA discord between them that got so much that they did break off their friendship after a couple of years it was the oil's wife who gave a I think it was a [noise]\nYou're driving and protecting America\n[noise] down here in rock spotlight from Nineteen Seventy six Dylan releases down desire to go one is mainly just significant radio airplay for the single hurry\n\n\n\nJohn\nStations obesity rule was finally glory and the U.S with a number one single Saturday Night\nMiliband member by gang members you know green\nRibbon is number one was live out in ...\nI'm from the ... out\nHard rock Star Wars among them which\n\nFrom some of these [noise]\nYou deserve a better way to watch the ESPN was live for and all of this show roaming\nWith the original and these fires are and\nBoom\n\nOn my body\n\n\nThe moon networks resume goes to goes to the you know use your guest host Richard ...\nSay hello on Twitter at Richard Sayre and asked why because I Love you R.
