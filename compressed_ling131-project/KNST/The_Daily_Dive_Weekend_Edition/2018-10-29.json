a great weekend become everything's call me back in\nOn Monday rubbed in reading and\nI dumped is only we can be doing as only weekend [noise] and then of course who is this week talking what am I saying [noise]\nMy name is Joe Thompson I'm twenty nine years old and they have a career that I Love is a systems analyst career it still sounds cool to say that word I never could have gotten on this path without a college degree\nTo college and they were here he tell you I never would have gotten to college without big brothers big sisters\nI could have ended up anywhere on the streets even\nCollege Joe Thompson not likely [noise] my big brother helped me out\nShe taught me I could do anything\nAt a time when a lot of people were saying just the opposite\nSeven year old\nOf big brother's name is Phyllis reading that seven year old girls as analysts [noise]\nWhether you donate money your time you're helping big brothers big sisters hope a child\nAnd that can last a lifetime [noise] start something to the big brothers big sisters who died or\nBrought to you by big brothers big sisters in the Gulf\nRegion will studio your local region will dot com and it's being used them and I ordered radio station\nHow serendipitous the Jews save the life of Robert Bowers\nAnd if I was in charge I Would a deal with all the other ones first to deal with him last to know fully what a blood out but unfortunately he's alive now being cared for in a Pittsburgh hospital by Jewish doctor\nMy God and so I look about what happened in the hate this guy exhibited for many many months that I like to know where are the people he communicated with was he\nA friend that was ... who else knew what he ... he was saying the things he was saying\nAnd and by the way he hated Donald Trump because Trump was a great friend of Israel and Bowers also had a Trump because Trump is the only American president in history Deb Jewish grandchildren his daughter Ivanka\nHas become an observant Jew her husband Jared Kushner is a ah Orthodox Jews the children the president's children are Jews the president has attended many Jewish religious functions is I have\nAnd so this guy who ah hates Jews and wanted to kill Jews mentally ill no criminal past his neighbor said it was a great guy always very friendly\nAnd went after Trump for loving Jews is now Trump is being attacked by the mainstream media in Washington Post for somehow causing directly or indirectly the murder of Jews when Trump is the best friend Israel and the Jewish people I've ever had\nA few hours ago Sarah Sanders put out a tweet presidential press secretary quote is there any tragedy the Washington Post went out exploit to attack President Trump the evil act of anti Semitism in Pittsburgh\nWas committed by a coward who hated President Trump because President Trump is an unapologetic defender of the Jewish community and the state of Israel\nSo one headline Saturday yesterday and the Washington Post said bomb suspect found an inspiration and Trump\nSo the media is saying that ... was encouraging incentivized by Trump\nTo put out a fourteen bombs simulating the killing of two ex presidents and twelve other a notable Americans so that the president's being tried to assassination attempts and the murder of Jews\nNot by some far left wing website is filled with hate but by CNN by MSNBC and by the Washington Post\nThat are supposedly mainstream objective news sources which of course they're not in fact on the day that CNN received\nThe photo bomb in the mail from ...\nThe New York times ran a progressive fiction depicting the secret service itself assassinating President Trump with Russian help\nIt's unbelievable on that day\nAnd in fact CNN's parent company Time Warner as you may know what's a co sponsor of the play in Washington park\nThat simulated the stabbing the murder of the president last June performing Shakespeare's Julius Caesar they had an actor playing Caesar dressed up like Trump he was stabbed to death each time and their performance\nAnd uh one of the sponsors of that was the parent company of CNN\nNow can you imagine the reaction if say the summer of twenty Fifteen that one of the parent company of Fox News had a play in Central Park that simulated this stabbing the vicious murder upper Iraq Hussein Obama\nI Want to know the media reaction to that event but the parent company of CNN paid money to sponsor\nSee Julius Caesar's Julius Caesar that had the an actor playing Caesar dressed as Trump being stabbed to death\nIn fact after James Hodgkinson attempt at the masses fascination of Republican members of Congress resulting in a motor wounds to Stephen skill lease\nThe Washington Post the next day\nRan a story about stirring up violence focusing on right wing talk radio even though Hodgkinson was a supporter an advocate of a Bernie Sanders and also posted many complimentary things about Rachel Maddow\nSo instead of focusing on the fact Hodgkinson actually traveled hundreds of miles to the Capitol tape the leadership of the house of representatives and it was a Democrat a Bernie Sanders supporter or frequent viewer of MSNBC\nThe Washington Post ran a story about violence stirred up by right wing talk radio\nOver the last several weeks much like the uh the photo bomb sent to about fourteen people\nThere have been at least twenty examples\nOf left wing or sending envelopes filled with white powder for many many Republicans in fact all Republicans people like sex or a defense James Mattis the president himself the vice president all the adult children of a President Trump have received in the mail\nEnvelopes containing white powder simulating rice and in fact the the the rice in like substance was sent to the home of Senator Susan Collins after she voted in favor of Brett Kavanaugh\nSo all this is going on for weeks and weeks and weeks and the media largely did not cover it because all the news that fits they print\nAnd if that doesn't fit and then they don't print it if there is a political violence committed by James Hodgkinson of Illinois they blame conservative right wing talk radio\nOf course we know about Ted Cruz an IT cruise chased out of restaurants\nAnd also when a Senator McConnell was having dinner in a ... restaurant a Democrat grabbed his food and threw it in the street other diners came to the assistance of Senator McConnell who's a survivor of polio and his wife who's in the cabinet and the media\nDoesn't want to call those actions a mob in fact one CNN anchor brick Baldwin and Don Lemon chastised Republicans for using the quote andme word\nOne other example whenever a white nationalist they've got the right to do it but I Wish they would march in the street progressive activist cover the words they expressed as violence\nBut win largely violent leftist from in ... and other progressive groups commit acts of violence causing thousands of dollars worth of damage on college campuses the media never covers it that way at all and so this is a long history\nOf radical leftist\nAnd so I'm On the right committing acts of violence that is covered completely differently by the objective mainstream media the worst in my opinion it's Time Warner the parent company of CNN providing money to sponsor a Shakespeare play Julius Caesar\nWhen the main actors dressed up as Trump stabbed to death and people apply\nIn fact when Louis ... Louis Farrakhan the left wing nation of Islam on big at the anti Semite set a large rally that Jews are termites in thousands in attendance applauded and cheered coding juice termites\nThat is the same person Louis Farrakhan\nWhere President Bill Clinton and Brock Hussein Obama stood next to had pictures taken with\nAt the funeral of Aretha Franklin and in fact a Obama had the political sense to know when he ran for the presidency and overweight not to allow the public to know that he was a friend of Louis Farrakhan they ran around together in Chicago and\nThat that's the classic anti Semite that the media completely ignored the relationship between Farrah Khan and Obama because it was bad politically so this whole thing disgust me\nI Hope soon very soon but a powers is killed either a by lethal injection heading electric chair shooting whatever it takes powers has got to go the way Timothy McVeigh for violence and Bowers\nWas a Trump hater but the Washington Post has some al implicitly tied Trump to the murder of God's loving eleven Jews yesterday morning in Pittsburgh the whole thing is disgusting\nWhen you get your reaction plus we're going to have later on David Wray affair to talk about what's happening on the southern border\nIs anyone thought about the public health crisis caused by thousands of immigrants without vaccinations flooding into the southern border with type ... measles whooping cough\nThey you know the Ku Klux Klan and the Democrats lynching Democrats they're all Democrats so please can the media set the record straight when the president said there's good people on both sides the one thought he was referring to\nWear those southerners who wanted to keep southern monuments\nOn the other side where those protesting it was not referring to the white nationalist caring tiki torches shouting racial and ethnic slurs at night in Charlottesville there's no good people among that group you cannot be a good man or a good woman shouting racial or Jewish lawyers\nAnd the southern city at night carrying torches\nThere's no good coming from that that is blatant racism and that's wrong\nLet's continue we'll get your goals were causing Wisconsin Ohio Indiana Illinois Nevada Florida New York and California by the way the\nBoston Red Sox are bought 'em in the seventh inning of four to one [noise]\nBecause Andrew ... a friend of mine who plays left field\nFor the red Sox I'm rooting for the red Sox\nThose continuous more still counting hand the great American your calls her next live with you\n\n\nLikes to play you go again by around ... wait I didn't mean by that I just wanted to know what I mean it's all about you I agree with him that\nKim and share like barking around feeling sorry\nMaybe people generally prefer the swimming and comforting kind of a female voice apology\nAccepted her Kate Brown so what station did you want to hear against\nGay and that's the I Am seven Ninety there was nothing artificial about their talent\n...\nThis week\nA rock and roll lovers is any west let's take a trip back to this week in rock 'n' roll history\nAs we can Nineteen Seventy five Paul Simon issue is for solo album still crazy after all these years gone it lasted sticky ways to leave your lover and the title track all reached the U. S. forty and the album hit number one\nSimon's first album to do so emancipated from Simon and Garfunkel fans finally\nStop shouting where's the party at his shows\nThis week in Nineteen Seventy six

cover with the headline all the rage book veteran Kurt Cobain refused to speak with a magazine for the story but they ran it anyway in an attempt to explain why young people are listening to such angry music and this week in two thousand\nThree in the middle of their first world tour and flush with fame from their debut album ever in essence founder Ben Moody abruptly quit the band\n\nAre you better off today than you or two years ago [noise]\nDoes America are better off today than it was two years ago as a Foreign Relations better off today than it was two years ago\nIs the judiciary better off today than it was two years ago in fact what's going wrong is the unemployment rate better now than it was two years ago or more people working today than two years ago is the American military stronger today than it was two years ago\nIn fact everything it could go writes gone right and not much has gone wrong and that that's gone wrong largely has not been Trump's doing but other forces and he's the president but he's not the ... he's not the dictator is not the czar\nContinue their calls will go right to go to Robert know Utah Robin Utah welcome to the bill Cunningham show Rob go ahead\nThanks for taking my call Yes sir thank you\nWell yeah in the middle of the shooting at Al Sharpton on\nMSNBC and and I am now and then\nAgain and and friends [noise] you know\nWell I'm ... how about the riot that Al Sharpton started a New York city are based upon the death of a Jewish person what about British furniture Mart\nMean it Al Sharpton life is filled with anti Semitism any run around with Louis Farrakhan who called ...\nAnd I I watched it and going\nOh you're right you're not able\nTo address I just Google this December thirteenth Ninety Ninety five the river and Al Sharpton apparently referred to the Jewish shown or a ... fashion\nBut as a white interlopers in a rally three months before the Harlem massacre newly revealed tapes show Sharpton is not named Freddy but mentions the least dispute and calls out his audience Nineteen years ago Al Sharpton is cited the massacre at Fridays furniture Mart because a Jewish a small business owner moved into the black community\nAnd so I I just Google it and how how does he get away with it\nThat's what I'm saying I got away with it that Middle East is going on and on it it's the people for this crap\nAnd you know other than that that guy who is that right to the White House and it was All right and he actually got the cash for being made rice and\nMrs you're calling from Utah and this is the guy who's now under an indictment now this one's in a large media stories that fair to say in other words maybe\nDidn't have an immediate story hair in it\nAnd second hand the phone\nAnd and and all the white powder sent to the Trump children not much of the story at All right now I don't know just being concoction would've actually cause any damage but it was like a fake pipe bomb in other words it was intended to cause fear\nAnd if someone would get that and you open an envelope and you get a white powder all over your hands impose on your lap believe me and say fearful tear filled event and this was a regular event that the left does to Republicans and the media doesn't cover it do they\nCover it and you can make rice and I don't care if they're being and and there's a real\n... well can you imagine if a bunch of Republicans have done similar things to the Democrats when Obama was in the White House\n[noise] [laughter] oh no you couldn't even bring up you're going to bring up anything you can say a word\nWell Time Warner did this to Trump well what if the parent company of Fox\nAre sponsored a play in Central Park that depicted the murder through repeated stabbing of Iraq Hussein Obama
