will be a manager of non\n... and that's why we focus on poverty is a financial planning for those people that are getting ready to retire or are already retired and that's that's really the niche focus\nSo and that's the primary cracks that that they seek out professional advice that they have that plan that financial plan that retirement plan on and we've talked so many times about the importance of having that plan\nWell you know it's it's it's no secret that the earlier you start with a plan the smarter decision that is so many people wait until the last minute and then decided to put that or they just think the plan is going to happen by itself because they accumulate\nA certain number of dollars on it it is but a lot of people say well I don't know I don't know who's managing my four oh one K. all I Know that I have to put in a regularly and somehow when I retire I'll have a magic number in there that will have to you know create some lifetime income from\nAnd [noise] I guess that's better than not at least they've saved at least they buy something and that is a plan at least the plan is to save it accumulates but along the way there's a lot more things that will get into a throughout the show today\nThat we'll talk about how how people that are wealthy and you don't have to not just the ... not just the super wealthy but just to the average you know well off some people might call them rich you know millionaire next door that has enough to retire on and live comfortably\nI might have back up on that plan I mean we talked about it before having a vision for your retirement and that's not just the financial side of it it's the ... days weeks months years in retirement\nAnd if you're wanting to travel and if you're wanting to start a new business does have to be wrapped into that financial plan exactly we have to have your bucket list right right yeah and that plan includes tax mitigation or how your taxes are going to look in their future\nUm strategies for with drying out of your retirement income strategies right so and having an estate plan what do you want to have happened to your many after you're gone and if you don't plan that in your retirement plan could you be costing your family members and necessary tax liability oh wow\nAnd we're going to talk about that more later but you know the the thing that um I think people forget about the estate plan as they think this tape plan only deals with when both husband and wife are gone but the estate plan also has to have some sort of a succession are so survivorship planet for a spouse or loved ones because\nNot all of us live to Ninety and die in the same day you know we ... my father died before he was sixty and mom is still alive Seventeen late late Seventeen years later you know found somebody new to marry and now they're you know going through their retirement but\nUh yeah they didn't really have a plan they didn't really plan on one of them dying early in my mom was literally the hanging of I've showed that story of you know in in part several times but\nYou know having a state plan is not what happens you know when you're Ninety it it it takes care of you know powers with money or whether a trust what if when he dies early is their replacement of income and those and those sort of thing so by the way you when you were going through that list of um [noise]\nThose things that you need in a plant let's not forget Social Security again\nThat's a big part of it well income streams and\nNo\nBills don't stop just because you retire just always a good thing [laughter] you still need those paychecks and the six Social Security is one of those paychecks replaces unfortunately a small but very significant part of retirement income for most people so we talked about taxes generating income um what what about inflation\nRight you have to plan gets that cause even three percent may not sound that much at three percent over twenty Thirty years and you retire and they can take a huge bite out of your retirement\nAnd I hope it doesn't keep growing at three percent which is like the last forty your average or so I Hope we can keep inflation a little bit more intact but um you know that does have the ... going to play in the other thing that has to take into consideration is\nUm you know when you're going to need to use that money in your retirement when you get that bucket list are you going to do a lot of traveling expensive things earlier on during your go go years are you going to need more money you know later on for health care if you're going to be self insured\nBombing and by the way health care and other things so anyway there's a lot of comprehensive are are a lot of lot of areas in a comprehensive plan having a plan and using a professional to give advice and by the way to get an advisor that gives you value\nSome advisors just charge you a fee for parking your money\nWell and that's where even if you have a plan it's there's value in getting a second opinion\nCertainly and also they have those are the comprehensive nature of a plan all the different areas those pillars of of a practical planning or a prudent planning need to be in place and the only to duck tale together and that's why a good experience financial advisor is smart and that's why smart rich people\nUse a financial advisor if you'd like to get a second opinion on your retirement plan to see if you are ready for retirement readiness review we'll talk about how you can save a\nDollars and retirement on taxes how you can get better advice

management with my co hosts Linda ... we're talking about the seven strategies that ultra rich people use\nTo minimize everything from taxes and maximize returns on investments minimize risk seven things that they do to create an ideal retirement that you can do to\nSo welcome back Linda welcome back to you know I think before we move onto the managing risk can we just let's just kept on taxes a little bit yeah that's such an important one\nYou know ... salmon just licking their ... that well there is chops his Uncle Sam to us the government the IRS is going to get some of your money if you don't plan right um they can't wait to retire because that's when they get the biggest whack at your retirement you know\nSo many people don't realize they're in a higher tax bracket when they retire than when they're working they put all this money away in a different basis and get a tax write off\nMaybe off their income taxes they might be in a load in mid range tax bracket then they retire and in a high tax bracket that's when they get to take the money out and they have to take the money out\nThat way is that why is that because everybody assumes they're going to have a lower tax bracket when they retire because they're not working\nBut not smart people who save regularly who take advantage of upside to the market who protect against risk and you actually enjoy a nice retirement uh from from their retirement\nOr people who who are more info are not necessarily smarter but more informed about what can happen when you do retire with your tax brackets\nWill I think more information is more yeah I don't know interchange informing now are so let's talk about just really quickly about the attacks buckets and the way money is actually the main thing is in order to be informed and make those better tax decisions let's just understand how tax diversification plays out\nThere's assets that are taxed always tax later tax rarely are not at all and there are some a patch traps in all of those that we need to watch out for the tax to always or what brokerage accounts checking a savings account if you're making any interest on those anymore yeah and then you pay tax on dividends interest and capital gains\nA tax later\nWhat are you get taxed later on for one case Iranian things which\nAre down ... which is that's where the cracks than it is because you don't know what that tax rate is going to be twenty ten Fifteen Twenty years down the road\nWe know what it's going to be now and we also know that at age seven and a half and everybody knows their age I Hope so you know how long it's going to be before you are forced to take those required minimum distributions they started out just under four percent of your account value but the ...\nYou're talking about two thirds more money\nThan if you took it at age sixty two but here's the ... the big question is do I have enough money to bridge that gap right am I going to keep working do I have to use on my social or do I have to use on my investments up maybe that's not a bad thing or maybe it's a good thing depending on the matter\nThere maybe some other strategies that you might be able to capitalize on if you were married divorced and we can you know when you come in and we can talk a little bit more about your particular situation\nRight and I think instead of belaboring all the different techniques here let's just a you know offer that you know as a\nYou know something that you can do is cause for that five point I'm Social Security analysis to find out when the optimum time is to claim or benefits how to coordinate claiming benefits with your spouse how you could eliminate or pay fewer taxes on the benefits that is by controlling what's on your tax return by tax writers we've already talked about\nAnd then um how to get a boy how to avoid also getting gouged by the Medicare premiums remember all those four different levels of premiums\nAnd also if you're eligible for other benefits there's over five hundred ways you can choose to take Social Security\nAnd uh you may not even know some of them exist we have some really close off where they'll uncover some of those so if you'd like to come in for that five point Social Security ... analysis a give us a call in fact I think for the first time cause we should do it um I have a free one yeah okay [noise]\nSo for the first time caller she want to Social Security now says to find out when your optimum time has to take that or give us a call you know what we should let's add something we risk ally so that share we just talked about risk\nWhy aren't you know\nFive point we want people come and just for a review but some of these other services are pretty cool the risk allies will actually look at your a total portfolio find out how much risk you're taking compared to how much risk in your mind you should be taking rise you're going to know your risk tolerance and there's a little quick Lincoln do\nYou think versus reality and\nThen you'll find out how diversified or how that risk number really works and how much you might be susceptible to losing the next market correction so um yeah I think that risk allies is really cool things will come in for a ... test as well and find out if you're taking too much risk and I can protect the money from the next market\nAnd isn't it that tell on that that when it that is something that you're interested in and we would need joy statement span your accounts as well as for the Social Security would need to bring in white your numbers are at sixty two six your full retirement age\nOf ... and we can't do without some day so and and we'll send you a little email and remind her call and get your updated on what you need to bring in but um yeah do do be prepared to bring the information needed so that we can help you obviously that's a skinny\nIs a major component for the wealthy they take they take that seriously and they really do understand what their options are\nSo the last two that we want to cover the next few minutes is um [noise]\nThey want a is a state planning make sure your state is protected we ... we talked a little bit about memory or on about how estate planning isn't just when both of you were dead\nAnd trying to leave your a state out appropriate and that's it sometimes people think well I just don't want to put everything in a trust I'm fine well what about succession planning for a spouse in case you die early what about making sure your kids or grandkids have college educations you can set trusts up and plans that will create a legacy that you can leave behind\nA wealthy people do that and wealthy people I think live a retirement live with more peace of mind knowing that they have those contingency set up should they pass away early and should they leave a certain amount of assets in the family they want to keep it in the family not let it go disappear through the court system\nOr through probate or through taxes or whatever\nOther things might might habits so\nYou know some of the state planning mistakes and people do is they they they they assume that he will get a lot of prey that's probably the most common one a will is a probate document probate takes over two years in Arizona on average and it can cost according to an AARP study that was done for Twenty years ago it could cost ten percent or more of the state and believe me\nWith four or five hundred dollar an hour legal fees now it can cause a lot more than that well for someone that\nReally you know they talked about do you need it at ... or you don't need a test there are still some things that they can do to avoid probate if they just had that that well as well\nWell and if if you if you have direct succession or if you've done a good job setting up beneficiaries on everything so everything that you have is lined up and goes directly to somebody that also will avoid the ... process and some people think of trust is the only way and they pay thousands of dollars for addressed\nOh we do trust and they don't charge thousands but we have a very efficient way of creating trust for the typical person even even very wealthy people at a much more efficient cost\nBut you may not even need to pay those costs and if you set your state up an estate planning doesn't mean trust it will necessarily it just means leaving your ass as to who you want how you want with the least amount of taxes trouble and trying to get out of probate\nRegardless of if you have a wheel or trust remember to have powers of attorney because you might not just diner sleep you might actually get sick first and need somebody to take care of you have the living well so you can pull the plug if your brain dead or if you're in a persistent vegetative state [noise]\nAnd that leads us to the last big topic [noise]\nUnnecessary fees and expanded fees and expenses and that\nToo many people pay too much in fact a forms that an article a few years ago that showed that the average mutual fund just because of the inefficiencies in the fund itself\nProbably cost the average investor actually they're they're number it was three point six percent it's not just an expense ratio figure it's a three point six percent\nWell is a passive investment like a mutual fund or that cost in reality three point six percent really inefficient way to manage your money or would it be better to pay an advisor right tactical money manager to actually create value\nTry to do timing the market hedging techniques that might actually save you from losing money in the next market crash\nCreate more value during years when there's upside\nAnd it may actually be worth paying a fee for instead of just doing a passive is what the charge a bunch of fees that are hidden anyway rich people know that\nWhat we find most often that people don't really understand what their invest it in and a lot of people don't think they're paying any fees for their four O. one K. their IRAs\nWell because you can't find them anything right so here's everyone\nTo call the one eight hundred number not your broker and that call the one eight hundred number and ask them what are all the different fees and they may tell you the first one is the management fee of one percent\nKeep digging what other ones but other ones and like I said on some of the variables that I looked at 'em for clients one was over six percent on a variable variable annuity right they don't even ... you know even on any ... year investments find out what those fees are by calling the company\nRight you may be finding out that Ted taking money out of a four O. one K. and doing a self directed IRA even with an advisor fee maybe a quarter and you may be getting more value free money that way so keep in mind fees matter\nA one percent are different differential in fees could make a you know my big big difference could make your money last five or ten years longer in retirement just by reducing those fees rich people know that now you know that to\nBack there seven good strategy that you've learned today we hope you are I'm ready to implement those if you need some help\nOr looking over them again in finding out how to put them into your financial plans please give us a call at five to one Seventy five sixty six [noise] and um again with your family has a plan to make sure you are ready to retire or if you already retired that you will stay retired peace of mind [noise] five to ... to one Seventy five so she says she loves to me it was just as\nRight as I said I have had a safe and happy again\nThis is willy Nelson these days we all know people all around us that are having\nSo if you have a diversified portfolio as the Ohio public employees' retirement system does they're projecting seven point two percent a year\nSo we need to keep this in mind for two reasons number one to make sure that your expectations are reasonable and realistic and number two to make sure that you recognize\nThat this is a long term projection and at any given moment this month's performance the last quarter the year to date the past one or three years anything can happen\nIn that short a period Ohio isn't suggesting that that's the rate of return that they're going to hit in twenty Eighteen they're not suggesting that is the return they got in the third quarter of the year or year to date they're saying that over the long term they're\nExpecting targeting an assumption of seven point two percent and oh by the way that's before fees because you know Ohio doesn't\nPay the kinds of fees that retail investors had 'cause you don't have a hundred billion to invest and we all know that people will invest a hundred billion don't pay the costs that retail investors who have one million or one hundred thousand or ten grand et cetera et cetera get my point now let me take another step further\nWhen you are making your investments\nWhich investments is it your assuming are going to perform well because a lot of investors think that the key to generating successful returns is by picking the right\nInvestments in other words they're Thirteen thousand mutual funds out there which one are you going to pick\nWell\nLet's look at it this way according to tip around in twenty twelve this is six years ago there were five hundred and Ninety us stock mutual funds that beat the S. and P. five hundred that year\nOnly five hundred and Ninety out of the thousands of mutual funds that exist only five hundred and Ninety of them be the S. and P. five hundred so I Want to ask you the question do you think you could pick\nThe fund that's going to beat the overall market first of all the odds are probably not since such a few number did that in the first place but let's assume that you manage to successfully pick one of the best funds of the year good for you\nFive hundred Ninety of them in twenty twelve of those five hundred and Ninety Gino how many of them beat the market again the following year in twenty Thirteen\nHundred and forty so of the five hundred and Ninety who did it in twenty twelve only a hundred and forty of 'em did it again the next year and of those hundred and forty how many of them did it again in twenty four team only twenty two\nAnd a twenty two only three of them did it in twenty Fifteen and all of the three only one of them did it in twenty sixteen in other words of the entire universe\nOf Stockton mutual funds over the ... of them that exist over the five year period from twenty twelve to twenty sixteen only on\nThe the us and the five hundred every year for five years in a row one\nOut of thousands sell less you again do you think you can pick the funds that are going to outperform the market\nI don't think so I don't think we can do it in our firm we don't even try instead what we do is provide passive\nInvestment approaches for our clients instead of trying to beat the market we're trying to provide the returns of the market modest fees and taxes and expenses associated with the investing exercise and guess what\nIf you're investing in that kind of a pattern you're not trying to beat the market you're trying not to get beaten\nBy taxes and inflation so that your money is earning a competitive right of return which should be sufficient to enable you to achieve your financial goals and objectives and that's really the point it's not about beating the market it's about achieving your goals think about it this way two thousand eight\nIn two thousand eight the S. and P. five hundred stock index fell thirty six percent\nSo have you picked and above average fond of funds that beat the market instead of losing thirty six maybe you lost thirty two is that like you know any consolation of any kind of [laughter]\nRight I mean we should be feeling really good we didn't lose thirty six percent of our money we only lost thirty two percent of our mind that you see my point meaning the markets and that's the goal that's not you should be trying to accomplish what you should be trying to accomplish\nIs making sure you are long term\nFinancial goals and objectives are met and to that and I'm going to cite a new study that just came out that shows that forty percent of middle class Americans forty percent are facing\nPoverty in retirement [noise]\nForty percent nearly three quarters of American workers say that they are\nGoing to have to work past traditional retirement age because they don't have sufficient money\nSaved and invested so instead of saying the key to my financial future is beating the market wrong the key to your financial future is making sure you have sufficient money saved on a regular basis\nAnd that the money you're saving is earning a competitive return if not\nBuying a lottery ticket and hope you get rich quick\nJoining the latest hot fad getting into what's hot and avoid and what's not that's not the key\nTo achieving your long term financial goals
