Social Security by so I'm not going to dog on Social Security at all now they know it's a great great place to start because there's so many good things about it\nAnd we're going to delve into a lot of those things a little bit more in detail um throughout and show to end tricks yeah I'm going to talk about tips injury but I I like this little story about you know how the Social Security I'll start it and the very first Social Security check was given to mess I may fuller\nAnd Nineteen thirty while is that it was designed or created by um President Theodore Roosevelt in Nineteen thirty five and she was the very first recipient and the Social Security check what I find most interesting now is that at that time in Nineteen thirty five people were expected to lift\nAged sixty three\nNow the kicker is that the program was available for benefits at the age of sixty five so at that point in time it was a pretty look it is well ran that not to go out of money you know now what were they were they take their benefits\nI don't know that it was a ... that's our you know that half the people are going to live and then it was geared to pick up costs for those half of people don't even mind this is on the heels of the great depression right where parents and grandparents had to move back in with their kids and they weren't working anymore and it was\nYou know not easy to\nWhy we can't find jobs for grandpa Joe at AT and then there were older people that that had some difficult times I think it was a great way to make sure that\nIf you are retired and if you weren't able to move in with your children are have all the means you know that you needed met\nThat the elderly those people that are given so much of their life to create the America we live in what at least be taken care of not to have to move in under a bridge you know ...\nAnd it was not meant ever to be a replacement or a retirement plan ranch and it was expected just to give them enough not to have to ... percent you know it it would it would provide enough to where they would not become homeless and it was not a get rich scheme and again it was only supposed to help\nAbout half the people that retired because actually speaking most of them are we going to be done before sixty three or at least half of them\nSo bottom line is things have changed [laughter] there's a little stressed all these years\nA lot has changed in eighty three\nWell and you you were about to mention the what's life expectancy now\nI'm now ... expects mid eighties\nYeah many he said well according to census guarantee when you do are optimize or it will put a female at eighty five eighty six and mail at eighty to eighty three so but we do know people are living way past that into their late nineties and even some into their early ...\nForty percent or you have a forty percent chance if you reach age sixty five you have a forty percent chance of hitting Ninety according to the last steps we did on the longevity show a few\nWeeks ago [noise] so yeah man what do you what do you do um well\nLet's talk about do we have time to get into our first subject was just going to finish rented out the ... and I do I want to I'm going to just ... it may maybe I Want to just kept a a couple of extra things there's a couple of 'em\nAre misconceptions out there that and I mentioned that Social Security is safe now some people think well it's one of the brain it's going to go bankrupt right well we still have\nThose Social Security system as is with out changes was going to go to at least two thousand and thirty four we also had good news this years the trust fund broke even it did not depleted was supposed to actually a ... more than ... supposed to break even and start depleting as of this year [noise]\nAh well two thousand and Seventeen numbers came out but in two thousand Seventeen the trust one still grew by a little over twenty billion dollars which is pretty nice\nUm that means we're still making our own we're still keeping that trust fund or even or better and that statistic that it would go broke by two thousand I'm thirty three a few years ago is now two thousand and thirty four and may be extended so\nThe fact that the economy is better and more people are working where people are paying into Social Security they've raised the limit on income that Social Security taxes are paid on and a little bit as helping a little bit I think with a few weeks we shouldn't worry about Social Security becoming bankrupt I think the government smart enough I Hope so [laughter]\nGovernment coming right out and make some tweaks I mean they they don't have to make big tweaks I mean even if without tweaks it's going to be funded at Seventy five percent or better going forward\nWhich means there's about a quarter of our Social Security paychecks maybe integrity in about Fifteen Years or so uh that's a lot of time to get it fixed and I sure hope they do and I'm certainly willing to pay a little bit more if everybody else will now that my kids can have Social Security I mean they should get it to write\nAny way of Social Security is a big concern you don't

always happy when I'm here with you talking about important things to help people live their ideal retirement life in this time in this next few minutes we're going to talk about purchasing power\n... well I think\nInflation has an effect on purchasing power anyway but with Social Security there's kind of a curious thing that happens\nI'm with it now one of the cool things about Social Security is it has an automatically included cost of living adjustment which\nOver the last forty years is average four percent now that my all sound good and great to\nHave you ever forty years yeah yeah ... we\nRemember the eighties when ... when a cost of living was a you know sit down in well yes that Thirteen percent in big numbers which have been the last seven or eight\nAnd pretty much maybe a half percent one percent\nWell we've asked some zeroes in there and we've had I think a three and a couple of one some things and the curious thing about Social Security is lately because I Know they're trying to make sure that the press one doesn't get depleted too fast is that one of the things that get was held out of your Social Security check and if you haven't received one yet you'll find this out\nAnd if I had a lot of things that that does\nIs Medicare gets paid from your Social Security check and gets withheld and depending on your income level you may actually pay more for Medicare then the next guy in fact there for two years to Medicare depending on your income level so depending where that is that it's going to be taken out of your Social Security interestingly\nThey raise or they have been raising Medicare premiums\nLately about the same amount as they've been raising the cost of living adjustment yeah so it's kind of watch so when you plan for retirement if you think there is really going to be an inflation factor put onto your Social Security\nI Would just kind of consider that a null and void kick that whole idea of the curve for now and just say you know what I'm just happy to get a paycheck that I can count on I'm going to make the best of it and I'm going to hopefully be in a position to supplement with other planning and other means\nAnd that's very you know my favorite topic is supplementing that with your own um income planned with annuity\nWe love we love those for income gaps you know you've got the as we mentioned earlier we've got that the\nThe pay checks that you need the first paycheck that you should really try to maximize if you especially whether you have a pension or not is that Social Security because there are so many different tips in tricks and rules and regulations surrounding it um you know bad decisions could actually cut you off some of the ... the benefits that you're entitled to in fact\nThere was a recent article by forms that said that\nUh because of bad decisions or bad planning ten billion dollars in Social Security benefits are going on claimed every\nSingle you said every single year I Want to say every stinking here but I you know every year ten billion dollars of unclean but that's because people don't know they can claim it or don't realize that they have a right to it and that's why it's important to talk to an advisor that has a little bit of experience with uh\n[noise] at least a little bit of experience with Social Security and also the resources like we do to make calls to the higher power so to speak that no Social Security much better than we do if there's ever a hard question to make sure you get what's yours and keep what's yours I mean you've paid into the system you might as well get what you're getting out of\nLike what five hundred and forty seven different ways to claim years tells a security benefit as well is there is over two thousand rules\nYeah it's uh it's amazing if in fact when we do our um Social Security review on our software it'll say that is going through like twenty thousand different scenarios based on all those different choices and rules and a spouse choosing at this time that time or whatever by the time the computer which I'm so glad they're fast with our we couldn't come up without a conclusion\nAbout one of our clients did she oh my gosh I was so impressed with her she on every restaurant a spreadsheet she had written that how yeah she did every scenario\nEvery age every month and for her and her has banned ads and I still kind of like wow I I just plug it into the computer and all that I thought why didn't press\nSays understanding how the benefits do take at ... and then the benefits\nWhich means the claim it can go down there and ask the right question and as long as the person at the desk understands what question they're asking they should get an answer that will help them make the decision that's right for them not\nGoing to give any more explanation or they're told ... different option I've had to take this as beneficial\nUm the last few words of that sentence and that description in their\nHand book or in their in their training book is but do not give advice says but do not give it by so they're not supposed to give advice it's sad to know though that a lot of people do go down there and give advice and I I ... I had an experience recently where a person came in and they decided to go back to work and um\nThey couldn't turn off their Social Security benefits but if they work and have a certain amount of income\n[noise] um they they they have withheld and they they said well I thought it was flexible when I went down there I told the guy I thought I wanted to wait till my full retirement age and he goes\nWell what the heck it's only this much less and you get an extra few paychecks and so he did but now he's in a position where\nHe doesn't want the extra taxes he doesn't want the Social Security wants to put her on hold and he can't undo it because he took it before full retirement age now the reason we call full retirement age the magic ... just because after full retirement age you Kansas fan and you can have a little bit more flexibility\nAnd so that was something that he just got bad advice on either because he didn't ask the right question or the person\nDidn't take into consideration all the life contingencies that my\nAnd to this person is life and that you know we can't expect them to give us advice down there that they don't know is there just there to answer questions\nThat they can get a little deadline that specially for the amount of time that you just sit and wait\nWell yeah but when he's on the lookout [laughter] maybe they had to give you the book to read you know how to how to claim your best benefit [noise] ... ... you're right but I think the\nI I Would say more bad decisions are made just like getting up by expecting that the answers down there at the Social Security office or the final answer are the only answer without people going out and getting adequate help now I Would also say that be careful and be wary of what you find on the Internet a lot of his allow\nIt and I they on their side a lot of it is so misleading and then followed jar again and it is a very complicated when there's understand that they're saying on their website\nAnd there's even when I'm not talking about the Social Security website necessarily I'm just talking about a ... you know one comes to mind are well I don't know if I throw anybody under the bus but it's a [noise] a well known financial guru that does advice and talks about you know\nAll these things that are\nOld news that basically oh so and so left this much money on the table well guess what they did or are they did away with the spousal\nI'm listening to science and a strategy which could have put anywhere from forty to eighty thousand dollars or so\nInto the pocket of a couple retiring given their ages at a certain time in in a perfect scenario but anywhere between zero and eighty thousand dollars is still a lot of extra money right yeah well they're still counting that that's available and it's been gone for a guy years so terrible is is be careful on that information make sure it's highly\nYeah the ... and the life out there listening in your sixties I mean for me um December thirty first two thousand and it's cool man you're allergic to that status since gone away\nNow there is a grandfather clause that still exists for anybody who is sixty by that same day\nFor a decade application waste land mine spouse tends a full retirement age taking their that might just seconds assed chance for retirement age than they can\nTake a half as the\nSpouses standing as Don still let airs glass so why only one person can lead it kind of just yeah but it but it's not as robust and was it used to be where\nBoth spouses could or they can on both of them want to take the train sixty two in sixty six in the other could take a between sixty six and seven eight and they could both end up letting their their benefits dry it was a great plan and it worked for many and some people actually calculated\nThat to be in their planning or unfortunately disappointed now that they can't use it so again or where do you get the good advice you know I I Would say there's there's one I'm going out I'm\nI'm In a town or ... or I'm learning now because like I say Henry but no I Know that's a in a market which says that it's a different guy [noise]\nUm Lawrence caught the cough is a guy that ah we actually use in in and have access to his team of advisors that no Social Security inside when in doubt [noise] one of the recent books he wrote was get what's yours\nOr one of the examples in that book as is actually a client I I had a chance to call 'em he calls easy lives it's called Larry when we're paying their money and then you get your ass or a lottery or is it anyway so you know Larry yeah you always calls me if he calls me back and he doesn't anymore now he has his assistance to it because he's too big\nTo to begin got too many people like me calling him now but a few years ago I called Boston University where he worked I left my message I said hey I got a guy down here he took he went down to Social Security and they told them so basically bad answers\nAnd he says will give me their phone call and they don't fix it also um I mean he's he's got a lot of clout and he writes books but uh if you ever um want to find good information about Social Security and timely stuff [noise] um he's probably the resource I Would go to and and he is the resource and the team that would that we uh we pay money to every year in order to have\nAnswers to our hard questions [noise] but um\nIt it's good to get an advisor that isn't restricted on the help that they can give and that's one of the reasons that we are for new series and we believe that Social Security planning is a critical part of a comprehensive retirement plan\nYou can't really do it without knowing what your options are on Social Security maximizing that income and filling in the gas around with your other savings and income\nAnd if we don't know the answer we leave effectively find the answer I mean first came into the side and there's like you said five hundred forty cents for a\nWhile the older I get I realize now that I Am older I thought when I was a kid [noise] I guess when\nA when I was just yet I thought when I got older I Would get smarter but what I found is when you get older you realize how smart you really aren't and yet because the more you learn the more you realize you don't know it was an older and wiser for a reason so we are older and wiser and we have the resources to ah make a comprehensive plan a comprehensive\nAnd make sure you're getting the best picture as Larry ... let's say\nYou're getting what's yours what you've paid into and what you deserve in Social Security round that out with a comprehensive plan and you know what it's really fun to come down to visit us we've got drinks and food for you\nMake a visit a very nice time to get to know you a little bit find out what your goals are and if there's a way we can help yeah we share that with you if you want to pursue it any further than that that is totally up to you there is no obligation for coming and visiting us we'd love to meet you love to answer your questions and if we could send you away from our office better than when you came in that in the world is a better place and we've had a good\nDay and we hope you have to so we hope you enjoy the program today we hope you give us a call and let us know how Social Security and other financial or\nHow we can make Social Security maximize sitting every time I met her phone number is five to oh to one's seven [noise]\nEighty five sixty six five to one Seventy five so you say [noise]\nOf an antiquated retail mutual funds they generally you know you don't want us to pay commissions to buy them there are very low expenses there's also generally very low turnover which means the annual tax liability is very low\nAnd each he asked we believe simply offer a better alternative in many cases for many investors and as evidence of this I mean I you know I've been promoting in town of ... I don't know what Fifteen Years\nAnd we are in fact finding that back in oh wait there was a half a trillion\nInvested in each yeah that was you know ten years ago today it's about half a trillion it's three point four trillion dollars that investors have placed into ATF and that is exciting it shows that\nYou're getting the message that's that's really fabulous you're paying attention to diversification you're paying attention to investment cost a and you're staying up to date with the investment opportunities which maybe aren't the same as you grow up with what you were familiar with\nWhat you've accepted the need to adapt and stay current with the market place so I think that's a really very exciting\nOr is it because if we take a look at data\nThat has just come out from a a recent survey back ten years ago to the credit crisis of two thousand eight you know it's great that each yes the sky rocketed in in value from five hundred billion to three point four trillion you know part of that as market appreciation of course but a big part of it is your contributions into ATF as well\nBut not everybody's been\nTaking advantage of that and I'm not just saying that they're not taking advantage of ATF themselves they're not taking advantage of investing at all\nTen years after the crisis we discover according to this latest survey research that twenty seven percent of Americans stopped saving for retirement they stopped contributing\nTo their four one K. entirely they were so spooked by two thousand eight they lost so much money so rapidly\nThat scared them out of the markets apparently for ever twenty seven percent one out of four Americans no longer saving for their future and fourteen percent have continued to save what they're doing so in\nCash oh my goodness so instead of\nWatching their investments triple and values since two thousand nine I mean that's what the stock market has done its tripled in value instead they've been earning less than one percent a year 'cause that's what you know bank accounts have been paying over the last ten years zero point nothing only ten percent of people in the survey said they invest more today than they were\nIn two thousand eight two thirds are saving less today than they were\nAnd almost eighty percent say they can't explain what happened in the financial crisis they don't get it they don't understand what occurred\nAnd so it's no wonder that Seventy eight percent trust Wall Street less than they did in two thousand eight and only forty one percent say they feel\nFully recovered financially in the face of an economic expansion unraveled in American history with the stock market tripling and values since its depths of two thousand nine\nThe majority of Americans still say that they earn behind where they were ten years ago and you know what the biggest crisis is about all of that\nEverybody's ten years older everybody's ten years closer to retirement and that's the big problem and just permeates through out American society regardless of age group according to another survey forty six percent of millennials\nSaid they believed that they need at least a thousand dollars to start investing Seventeen percent say they think they need at least ten thousand dollars\nTo start investing that's simply true anymore due to advanced technology you can invest\nYou can open in account with the dollar not a thousand not ten thousand I'm not suggesting you should necessarily do that before you joined you were trying to plan a worker before you pay off credit card debt or before you Bill cash reserves but the point is it doesn't take a lot of money anymore\nTo build investments and oh by the way a lot of parents are are not saving a lot either it's not just the millennials but the millennials parents that are in saving a lot and you know one big reason for that\nI'm going to tell you when we come back\nHere on the record them and show I'm going to tell you\nWhat it is that parents are spending five hundred billion dollars on every single year and no it's not their kids who are on the playground K. through twelve ... it's not raising children that are the parents are spending a lot of money on\nIt something else and I'm going to tell you what it is when we come back on the program so you can figure it out before we return\nAnd we're going to
