did how can I make sure my bucket list\nItems can be taken care of within that income you know don't leave those all to chance you know how expensive is your budget and I think the biggest thing that people are probably hate to do is that budget\nPackage it yeah it's it's not as funny and exercise to do that knowledge is power and\nWhen you know where you're spending money what you're spending your money on it gives you more power to say is this necessary do I need this is this the my stories just say I want and can you cut back and we'll talk a little bit more about that when we get into\n'em that that I Know we said it many many times when you're getting ready to retire that five years before maybe even ten years for some people\nIt's a time where they actually do a paradigm shift between accumulating those assets and then turning them into income and if you are relying solely on assets in your retirement to draw down especially now looking what's happening in the market everybody starting\nThere is a little bit of panic out there that if your money is not in a safe position and now they're a couple of weeks and this downturn or correction if you will\nAnd the market could wipe out or severely damaged somebody's nest eggs\nAnd it just depends on how you deal with those of a market fluctuations are you are you prepared with enough safe money that will carry you while you wait for the market to return are you going to get scared because too much of your money is at risk are you taking too much risk because you're a little complacent because the markets been going so well for so long\nThat to you know if you listen to the news we're in this new era again and the economy's great so that means the market's great that's not always necessarily true sometimes the market has its own little mind and does its own little things and\nAnd can catch us by surprise in fact I think this if you look at it the stock market does more to determine the economy than the economy does to determine the stock market\nUm you know the economy was clipping along pretty well back in the uh uh two thousand and eight but as soon as they found out that all that collateralized mortgage obligations of some of the banking\nStrategies that I think we're a little unethical a lot of ethical they weren't really real um blew up and the financial markets face and then all of a sudden when the market crashed that's when the economy got bad and we went into recession and had that long recovery real estate crash market crash a lot of people lost their\nIRA money there four one K. money and they were caught by surprise and had to adjust their lifestyles\nSo what you do what you don't want to do is get too complacent with a good economy assuming that the economy is going to drive the market it does to a degree but it's the market decides to correct or of Wall Street decides to take profits or if banks just decided to take profits or if interest rates go up and people stop buying houses and things in in in such unemployment rate um things can happen\nWhere the market softens and if people start accepting the market um that could create a ripple effect so again um\nYou know we need to take risk under consideration when he'd take income sources into consideration we'll talk more about that as we go but um as far as if you're ready to retire it it's there is no right or wrong answer it really depends on what\nYou need to know what you can uh survive on what your lifestyle is going to be and um you know what do you need for your paycheck and what you need for your plate checks and going to go from there\nI Know when we get clients coming and they're pretty I'm\nStressed out or or somebody and filled with anxiety about making that switch and taking some of their money out and as risky market positions and putting them into secure\nAnd other vehicles that protect you from market last at once they do is they finally make that decision there's always this sense of relief for them they have they know that they don't have to worry about the market going up and down anymore that there is that added sleep insurance for\nRight life's too short to stress out especially when you're retired no never checked me ... well you know ... and one of the analogies that that has come up and we've talked about is you know how how income and investments are kinda like a balancing act if you can envision a a poll on a folk rumor or teeter totter so to speak and you've got\nYou know buckets are on one side that are considered assets basically all your savings and you've got other buckets on the other side that include income\nStream she might have your Social Security or pensions the income that you take out of your four one K. or your IRA you're required minimum distributions or nudity that you purchase those or income streams and those income streams need to be balanced on that teeter totter so to speak\nWith those assets on the other side and if you don't have enough assets that incomes to Hi\nYou're out of balance if the um income is\nOr the if the income is lower and you have a lot of assets maybe you can increase that income but you can balance it out is kind of a retirement planning really is a balancing act and that's why we encourage you to come in for retirement readiness\nPreview and see if you are ready to retire to see if your goals can be met see if you're ready to live that ideal retirement life now or maybe if you need to work a couple more years but that of that discussion is a you know free of any obligation or charge you can give us a call at five to ... to one seven eighty five sixty six that's five to a two and seven\nEighty five sixty six will cover all five points of the\nPillars of retirement we call them the income plan\nInvestment plan the health care plan and also you're safe way to look up all five of those in our retirement British reveal your calls five Seventy five or you\nMay call it quits

believe that could be done\nBut they were also believing based on these rules of thumb taking risk into consideration realizing that market crash ... and they couldn't go all out\nBut when we showed them how about a fifty fifty split between guaranteed assets principle protected assets could guarantee them enough income that they wouldn't have to worry about the other half of their assets or that they could use those other half of the assets in a more discretionary manner that they had enough to live on a six figure income for life and\nNot work till they're Seventy and that was that was that those are one of the best moments in my life is to see how happy people get when they realize that they're not doomed to this\nYou know decade or more of a work that they're actually closer to retirement than they thought they were so\nIf you want to see if you're ready or to see if you can maybe retire earlier than expected that's another positive thing that may come out of that retirement

your tax plan your health care plan and your legacy or your um estate plan\nSo before we go into our next break maybe we could just talk about a couple of the strategies to create more savings before retirement for those of you are\nThat's actually where I have is going to go that if you do get the answer to that question can I can retire and it's no aggressively looking at saving more\nAnd that doesn't mean saving aggressively that doesn't mean oh hey I got to buy more apple and Amazon I don't want to you know we're not talking about aggressively investing we mean I'm I'm ... let's say I'm

we're talking about today and it's your money welcome back I'm Jeff open your host with my co host ...\nWelcome back welcome back to you\nLast little uh a break we are talking about the ways to well if you have to delay retirement to save a little bit more to make sure that we're ready what are some of those strategies that we can use we talked about well he's talking about the change bucket if up your change the little things that up um talked about um\nYou know basically getting on a budget learning to live on it for a while um work a little longer right what else\nAre they even taking care of our taking advantage of the catch up her vision and your IRA adding a little extra every year\nMaximizing the savings um you can also delay retirement if you love your job that's not necessarily a bad thing I hate to be the bearer of bad news when people come in and say you know this is what we want to leave when we really need it but are we ready and and honestly to to to give us a guaranteed retirement life\nIf it can't be done and we're not going to be the bears of a good news when there is not you know unfortunately we have helped me out of the reality check and yeah\nIt's a reality check means well you know you might have to work a little longer doesn't necessarily mean you have to stay on the same job\nYou know how many times that we've had people that have gone into either consulting in that line of work are gone to part time for a few extra years rather than fulltime for you know having a an extra year or two of miserable fulltime work might be easily exchange for maybe five years a part time work and still get to the same point\nUm we just had to come in last week that that did that he got a job I mean I may not be able to say that it that I bought it let's say where but anyway I was just so little hardware homebuilders store and he's working for like Thirteen bucks an hour but he's making just enough to where he can delay of Social Security and get back to that income level that he wants to have in a few years\nAnd guess what he loves the job not only that they even give him I'm a part time benefits for his part time work he gets benefits are in the form of reduced um [noise]\nI'm costs healthcare al ... which is kind of nice as I care done now and he's not sixty five so he's automatic everybody's got a few years ago\nAnd he ended up hating his job enough to leave but that part time job is going to fill the gaps so again we can always work a little bit more\nBut we're seeing my clients coming in wanting to retire prior to their full retirement age either sixty six sixty seven\nAnd you got to remember there that that is adding extra expenses that you may not be I'm planning for cars how are you going to cover your health care ... a two year full retirement age ... or sixty five and ...\nHow are you going to spend on your savings in order to get to that a lot of people don't realize that is a big difference not earning let's say you're making a hundred thousand dollars a year as a couple of\nNot earning a hundred thousand dollars a year as a couple of between ages ... let's just say sixty and Seventy that's a that's a million dollars let's say if it's just between sixty two in sixty six that's still four hundred thousand dollars that you didn't earn that you may have had to spend\nUm that's a ... that could be a huge difference maker in in whether or not you're living your ideal retirement life are just eating out a retirement life\nRight and even are you still working because if you were still working you're getting and they can now you're still putting into this as a security but that also does have a ratification on how much have yourself a security as tax\nThat is true as well and if you're working before age sixty six or ... or your full retirement age which ever it is\nA once you start making a little over Fifteen thousand a year they start withholding some of your Social Security benefits\nAnd and I'm going to say that more often than not the it depends answer on if you're working and you're still want to claim Social Security it's better to claim Social Security after your full retirement age so that you can keep it all ... you don't have to give some of it back because the IRS or an Irish the Social Security department\nDoesn't just hand you the lump sum that they've withheld they just increase the amount you get over the rest of what they consider your lifetime might be so [noise]\nUh you know if you have to take Social Security early be very careful on understanding the consequences of that and how much they're going to withhold and how you'll get that money back\nBecause that is money that isn't you are entitled to you put into the system and you should be able to get back so\nAgain it's one of those mathematical things do the math figure out what makes sense to you and figure out what your lifestyle dictates\nBuying you mentioned a married couple said there are a couple of other strategies that a married couple can use that ... that a single person doesn't had as far as taking that spousal benefits now too that were really nice to married couples that that had been gone for the last couple of years that Ireland suspending restricted application\nOh she got to tell everybody what they can't have owned by that\nStill some people think that that still and play that there is that that spouse will benefit can actually be beneficial if when one spouse should take their their Social Security even taking it early and then getting that has ... half of the husbands later on when he starts taking his so\nYou have to be a certain age so that's why things coming for the Social Security ... will tell you if you're in that ballpark where you can take advantage of that loophole I wouldn't call it a loophole would just take advantage of the the way the law is you know I I hate St loophole because it's not like we're cheating anything we're just seeing adage of of the rules\nAnd then there's other benefits rather Saturday he won't are single and and divorced or you have an ax so they're allowing benefit it all depends on your situation\nRight so remember even if you don't have your own benefit or your own benefit isn't that much you can take half of your ... up to half of your spouse's benefit or up to half of an ex spouses benefit that may benefit you and uh the way the widow benefit\nWorks um is you can take that as early as age sixty if your spouse's pre deceased do and would have been at the age they could've taken Social Security\nUm when it comes to income planting keep in mind that not all of us die in the same year right as a as a couple of right and if one of us out lives the other by a significant amount of years uh consider the will benefit the widow or the survivor gets the better of the two benefits\nAs what may be smart for one of the spouses to wait especially the ... sometimes even the most unhealthy spouse to wait so that the healthier surviving spouse that may outlive the other one uh would get a higher benefits for longer amount of years so a lot of things that are\nWe talking about that it gets a little confusing too much spouse this house\nThat well that's probably the things that come into play that or the I guess probably the more confusing elements that people need to iron out is how to make sure that we work it out with our spouses are surviving spouses of some of the things that are\nKind of the unknowns but really need to be included in a plan and you need to plan for the contingencies the what ifs I mean that's that's really what retirement planning is nothing is certain nobody has a crystal ball you don't have your desk date you don't have your purse or your death certificate in your hand yet\nHow do you know how you're going to live and what you're going to need so a lot of big questions now the last um besides um Social Security we've got that health care question\nRight and and the and the two guys town together because if you do plan are are wanting to retire earlier say at sixty two how are you going to fill that gap between I'm sixty two and getting Medicare\n[noise] well that's the big question as yeah are you going to go on a cobra plan which is typically a lot more than your employer was paying for your health insurance spend more on me that only lasts for eight months the most you can get it uh so you're going to have to go out on the open market get healthcare hopefully you can qualify for a good plan if you can't then of course you take what you can get\nAnd uh and pay out of pocket so keep in mind that that's going to be an extra drain on your budget for those uh those years also we want when I mentioned about Medicare Medicare requires you to sign up whether you're working or not\nAt sixty five give or take three months for part a give or take us at eight months for ... something like that um depending on your situation or you may or may not have to apply for part B as well\nBut if you don't apply for Medicare during the window that you're supposed to apply it goes up by ten percent on the Medicare be part it goes up tenure penalize your penalize ten percent in premiums for every year and he left\nAnd right and that is for the rest of your life\nRight you can't go back and say All right I did my time I paid my penalty now when can I go back on the regular rate and so they want you to start paying into those Medicare premiums because our premiums for Medicare they're not very high there are subsidized greatly by the Medicare trust which is nice\nAnd the other thing I wanted to mention about that is that if you were working and sixty five and if you do um and you want to go in and register for a\nMedical ... has said her name because it is free if you have an eight and H Sai health savings account be careful 'cause once you do that then you're not able to contribute to your age I say anymore so it's still looking into that in finding out from your situation what's the best way and and how to go about looking\nAt the NATO here so loaded up that each essay updates sixty five in my opinion just get it off though to\nHey I think that's a great way to start making and account for long term care if you start saving now and putting as much money as you can in that age say it goes in tax deferred it comes out tax deferred and that can be your nice little a bucket if you will for long term\nCare ends up being tax free you can even buy insurance your long term care insurance premiums will be paid at the age of say not just your care once you get there so\nAh depending on how you want to pay that um those are some options but don't overlook a healthcare especially if you're planning on retiring early um who's going to cover those costs I mean we can't to foot the bill is alone on those expensive medical expenses we do need insurance in Medicare\nDoesn't cover long term care medical doesn't cover a lot of those expenses that was my next\nPoint so anyway a lot of things to think about are you ready to retire\nMore so are you ready to stay retired or in a position to stay retired regardless of what might come along your way for that five point retirement readiness plan can find out if you have enough income coming in and out if your investments support that income make sure you're saving as much in taxes as you can possibly save\nOr make sure that that health care all those healthcare contingencies recovered and make sure your state plan as an order those are the five points of our\nRetirement radius review normally gay should just come in let's get to know each other find out if there's some doubts we can help you feel we'd love to be of service you love to meet you would love to talk\nIt was in South Carolina they let the winters remain anonymous so what could you do with the money well you could probably by the Tampa Bay rays baseball team that's worth about\nA nine hundred million but none of taxes you can only about half the team so no outfielders for you forget about the Yankees they're worth four billion dollars\nYou could um by half of the islands and the British Virgin islands because of the total GDP of the British Virgin islands is about nine hundred million dollars so here seriously what you ought to do if you win the lottery first number one\nTell nobody that you want not even your spouse I especially your spouse don't tell anyone as soon as you tell anyone everyone's going to know\nAnd that's really scary because not only you're going to be bombarded by requests for money from family and friends but also total strangers your safety is also at risk and I'll talk a little bit more about that in a second so when you win the lottery what you need to do is take that\nTicket and keep it somewhere safe like bank safe deposit box no not not under your mattress not somewhere and you know a secret police from my house no antibiotics it deposit box do not sign the ticket not yeah\nWhat I Want you to do is to photocopy photocopy both sides and then put it in a safe deposit box then get a lawyer get in the state\nAttorney someone who is expert and experienced in dealing with wealthy families because guess what you're not willfully and left the lawyer tell you how you should sign the ticket should use on it and your name only should it be join with your spouse should you put it in a trust should you have an owned by an L. O. C. limited liability company\nYou want to get legal advice tax advice financial advice or you need a lawyer he needed a CPA and you need a financial planner\nBecause if you don't handle this correctly you've got to be aware of the studies that have been done on lottery winners there is a preponderance of bankruptcy I mean how can a lottery winner go bankrupt hey Michael Tyson had three hundred million dollars and ended up bankrupt\nPeople think it's a bottomless pit more okay one point six billion is pretty bottomless but it's not it's only four hundred and Ninety two million metal taxes in a lump sum\nIt's not a bottomless pit like you think it is and when you start throwing out a lot of money to family and friends and charities you'd be amazed how fast you can plug for the cash so a lot of lottery winners end up bankrupt they end up divorced the end up with drug and alcohol abuse they end up with suicide\nThey lose their jobs are friends even their family and if you're going to say on the kid growing up my work every day like always know you're not you know why because every time you show up at work all of your co workers are gonna be resentful\nBecause they got to be there because they need the money and you don't and they know that you're going to go out to lunch and not treat everyone\nYou're going to be a pariah so if you think your life and not going to change Oh yes it absolutely well you're going to lose all your friends you're going to be ostracized with family if you don't give them enough money to satisfy what they believe\nIs how much money you want to give them so\nIn addition to having a lawyer and an accountant and a financial planner you need a personal security team as well the first thing you've got to do is get out of your house because everybody knows where you live easily to Google your address not only strangers but\nCrux might come and do you harm they might come and challenge threaten your family members in order to uh extort from you blackmail you\nSo you need to go to an undisclosed location choose a suite at the receiver may and have a security detail around your your life is going to change and what did you have never thought possible because you need personal secure and when it comes to gifts to families and friends well let's think about this for a minute\nHow much money you're going to give your mom you're just netted after tax four hundred and Ninety two million dollars unless you give them a million bucks you ...\nCome on you're going to give her ten million\nJust got to know how much given your mom\nHow much you've given your dad how much you've given your brothers and sisters how much you've given your children your grandchildren let's say that you decide to give ten people ten million dollars a piece that's a hundred million dollars I guess what you didn't give away a hundred million dollars\nBecause when you give away a hundred million dollars you know my friend knock them you\nHave to pay a gift tax guess how much the gift tax is forty percent\nWhich means if you give away a hundred million dollars you incur a forty million dollar gift tax now you've just spent a hundred and forty million dollars\nSo about four hundred and Ninety two that you you just gave away a hundred and forty of it you're now down to three fifty\nWe haven't even talked about charity let alone Bentley's do you see my point in my friend you got to recognize that winning the lottery requires a massive change and lifestyle massive calculation and preparation and planning\nBecause your relationships are going to change with virtually every one you're not going to be able to trust anyone because they're all going to be wanting to know what you can do for them and whatever you do for them ain't got to be enough in their opinion\nLet me give me another reason why I didn't buy a lottery ticket instead of buying a lottery ticket if you were to say take the money you would have spent on three lottery tickets three dollars a day instead of buying a lottery every single day you take that three dollars and you invested into the S. and P. five hundred stock index and you do that for forty five years\nI'm On a bet you'll have more than a million dollars was won the lottery of course pass performances notification of future results and these are some of the country as a federal ... and therefore my friend now you know why [noise]\nI didn't buy a lottery\nBecause as I often say to friends and family well okay not friends and family what I often say the enemies may you win the lottery because it's often the worst thing that can never happen to you and I mentioned all of this for one simple reason trying to make you feel better for not having one so I'm\nSo glad that you didn't win the lottery I thought so that's why I'm here to help you make you feel good and the reason I'm trying to make you feel good is because you probably have been noticing that not only did you win the lottery on Tuesday\nYou saw the stock market meltdown on Wednesday\nAnd you did notice that they're not only did it get you got a little\nPoorer because of the stock market's performance and we're

got promotions that helped me move up in the world and earn more from my family [noise]\nThirty year degree on line from her\n[noise]\nWelcome back to the elements show we invite you to send your questions by audio and that's exactly what George did here says question he sent to ask Greg at ... dot com\nIraq this is George from California my in laws are both over eighty five years old and have an investment balance that likely could pay for a long term care for both is needed\nMy question is should they maintain any stop investment since they could earn over three percent in bonds and it is unlikely their life expectancy will expose them to significant inflation risk so Rick what do you think thanks\nSo that's a great question George and a lot of folks faced this question in my older years I'm In my seventies my ... my nineties I have far more money than I Will ever need to spend even if I encourage massive medical costs are long term care costs\nBetween pensions and Social Security and the money I've accumulated over my lifetime I have lots of cash and I'm not spending it because I live kind of frugally\nSo therefore we would argue traditional financial planning strategy would argue that you should place all of that money in very conservative investments you should put the money into bank accounts you should put the money into treasuries you should put the money into guaranteed\nInvestments that they might not pay much an interesting not only pay one or two or three percent puts so what you don't need to earn high returns it's more important that you have protection of your money than that you try to double your money because doubling it isn't going to change your lifestyle but losing half of it could\nSo traditionally we would argue don't take any more risk than is necessary\nTo achieve your goals but let me turn that inside out and give you\nA different reason why you might want to consider a riskier\nInvestment strategy and their strategy that includes investing in stocks to some perhaps even significant degree\nLet's say that you've got a few million dollars saved\nAnd you're hardly touching it and you don't think you'll hardly ever touch any of it because you get plenty of income off of that money you've got plenty of income from pensions and Social Security you only spend a few thousand dollars a month your house is paid for your expenses are low\nAnd you've got this money now ordinarily I Would you know we would say like I said a moment ago put the money to bill's calling today\nBut think about this when you die who gets that money\nI'm willing to assume that you are going to leave that money to your surviving spouse and ultimately to your children and your grandchildren\nIn other words if you have a very high degree of confidence that this money will outlast you and will ultimately be transferred to your kids and grandkids\nYou could argue that that money really isn't yours it's theirs and you are merely the steward of that money\nYou're the custodian your to the caretaker of that money and if you know that you're going to transfer that money to your children and grandchildren who will use it for their lifestyles and their personal financial needs and the achievement of their financial goals\nWell then maybe we should be investing the money with their goals in mind meaning that if your\nSon or daughter had the million dollars they would invested in stocks because they would have a long term time horizon and they would want to earn a return that none of taxes and inflation is growing and real economic\nTerms therefore we could argue you should be investing the money not based on your age\nBut based on bears and if your kids are in their fifties or sixties if your grandkids are in their twenties or thirties then maybe you should invest in a portfolio allocation that mirrors them and not you know we want\nSure we're not doing so to the point that we are really placing you at financial risk we're jeopardy\nBut I think we could strike a healthy balance between protecting you for your lifetime while also having an eye toward the legacy of protecting your children's financial futures as well\nAnd on that basis we could in fact argue that you should have stocks in your portfolio\nTo what degree should it be ten percent of the portfolio fifty percent of the portfolio somewhere in between the only way to know for sure is to meet with us all sit down with one of my colleagues here at the farm\nSo that we can examine the entire family dynamic\nLook at what your true expenses are relative to the income available and the resources and design what that strategy might be taking into consideration the circumstances with your children and grandchildren so don't automatically assume that the older you get you shouldn't have any money in stocks\nInstead look at it as an intergenerational family dynamic because after all that's exactly\nWhat it is so George
