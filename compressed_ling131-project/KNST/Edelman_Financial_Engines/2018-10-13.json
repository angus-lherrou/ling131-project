{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KNST", "content": "Into tablet Saturday\nMorning at rosy hum the house with the rain falling out of this guy\nI I this is a tire\nRegional seasonal events wettest October ever recorded in Arizona's history and we're only two October Thirteen and like Eisenhower said it's going to make a great for\nA a a wild flower\nSeason comes springtime of headed that it's going to make for a great we'd season of a weed applicators are going to be busy if you don't do anything this weekend maybe get granular pre emergent spread around your yard it's\nGreat well you're probably up painting outside but we are talking painting with the Arizona pay company owner Joe Camel Joe we've talked a hour and I haven't even you know people are probably saying where I might like to jump on that ten year warranty what how would people get older you have\nWe had you on the air power given your phone I haven't had a chance to get it out\nThere ... if you're interested in the free estimate we do all three estimates toss in Phoenix at six o two six for eight three zero seven one in Tucson at five to ... to eight for one seven nine to or Arizona painting company dot com\nAll right we were talking pretty much about the details required for you to give your ten year warranty and the prep in the selection of material and the application techniques and processes but you all have to take it on a new product line\nYeah we're actually I've been doing a lot of work was into your cabinets kitchen cabinets bathroom cabinets and re painting and those and we found you know a lot of people are interested in that because it's an inexpensive way to really improve the look of your kitchen or or bathrooms\nWithout tearing everything out right right without a huge thing we can be in and out of there and a couple of days put everything back together and it's a brand new look for you\nKnow you basically setting up the kitchen is a big giant spray booze yeah it's a big\nBubble essentially a so you know don't expect to be able to cook anything for those days um but uh once it's done it\nIt looks really really really good okay go ahead but I was you know that's one of those jobs that you schedule ahead of you leaving town for ... absolutely yeah and absolutely that would be any interior painting you know if you're smart you try to get out of there as much as again that would be ideal for sure\nSo what's your prep on these cabbage you've got to do an analysis of are the worst repay I mean yeah right\nRight yeah look at the kind of condition of them now is it is it something that we can bring back to life if there are two ... two nectar banged up water saturated underneath to sing yeah exactly\nUm by the prep for most kitchen cabinets is clean scuffed Dusten and then prime on\nThat is going to be your your main prep work that we need to do to get ready for the paint finish at what you're cleaning product you just go in there with a ... sodium phosphate CSP yep try sodium phosphate wipe them down cleanup and just a sponge yeah we just use this ... um\nThat'll knock down a little bit of the sheen and then we ... them up with a little bit of sand paper steel wool just to break down that she and a little bit more um Dusten to get any of that dust finish off because we don't want to paint over top of any right and then finally you can ask can get to the priming and painting portion\nBecause you're trying to take the slick this of the varnish surface off but you're also trying to take up the years of accumulation of finger residue and Greece and and everything else\nOh yeah and that the cabinets above the stove especially clean those well because you want to get all of that grease off before you paint or it could peel\nOkay so that's another service and then you all just reuse the doors and drawer faces that are with the cabinets\nExactly yeah we're not we're not installing new doors or anything like that okay\nAnd and then we've we've really gone into this because they've developed a new paint that we can use that dry is really hard drives like an oil based paint it's really washable and gives that shiny new brilliant look\nBut it's a lot easier to work with than oil based paint which smells and the cleanup is really hard to do really hard yeah really really hard so they've they have a new product now it's a done Edward cells that ... Williams and it's a ah water based al ... euro thing\nSo it's clean up with water a but it gives the look of an oil base and gives you that really durable finish for cabinet\nOf of the ... of the ... the almost ... but that's not\nWell and it's water based white\nWater based al ... euro thing out here than All right so it has the look of an an al Kidd or oil based paint\nBut it's clean up with water does it apply when you're painting one like oil or is it more of an acrylic it applies to just like a normal paint so you know if you want to paint your kitchen cabinets I Would recommend after you've ... you've prime I'm with a extreme bond primer\nYou want to use a really really good primary for this and then use that finished coat and you can apply it with a a phone roller and it will level down and give you that nice smooth finished so this is something\nA homework to do on the road okay\nVery good well Joe and Joe we appreciate your taking time out of your Saturday morning come

care of your would you like a preview of rosy on the house weekly broadcast\nBefore it airs will sign up for our weekly newsletter comes up every Thursday germ box\nAnd we'll spam it and we don't sell the information just one email a week it'll tell you what our lineup is for\nThey can't live on even Ninety nine percent of what they're used to living on if they really need that hundred percent and then there's other people that are making a ton of money way more than they need well I mean what's relative to a ton of money or relative a question about that just say they make twice what they need to live on well they can maybe live on fifty percent but if they what you need to find out is what you're living on\nAnd you want to create a lifestyle if you can to maintain that lifestyle in fact\nSome people want to increase it a little bit and so don't plan I think that one of the biggest thou shalt is to determine what is going to cost to live that ideal retirement life\nWell at least and then the entire to maintain what you're used to now granted but that being said\nSpending habits when you have that income coming in spending habits can be very difficult to change so make sure that you know what your budget is going to be in retirement versus um what it is when you're working and some of the the research that we've done show that some people spend a little bit more like you said some people spend a little bit less\nBut one of the um study shows that when you first get into retirement you are going to spend a little bit more money on travel health care pre retirement\nAbout eight percent of your budget after retirement about Nineteen percent utilities is one that I kind of shocked me that utilities are going to go out yeah you stay home or staying why especially when are you doing you're cranking that air conditioned\nOut for those eight hours you used to be working here at home so yeah there's a lot of expenses that actually do go I mean those are the necessities that actually do go up in retirement when you think maybe they'll go down and I think to travel is probably the biggest one if you have a lot of travelling during your working years that's kinda the bucket list thing that you want to get out while you're young and healthy and able to do it during those go go years\nAdvantage I went ahead is ... ... retirees are now really looking into fitness and health and their spending now after retirement about Thirteen percent on ... membership a trainer national chain ours\nSo up amongst all of that and that's you know those are the things that I I guess are more discretionary than say utilities and other stuff but you know one of the things I just wanted a rabbit before we get to the next commandments is\nUm you know when you decide how much you're going to live on\nYou have to decide if your savings is going to generate that much cash flow and we have to look at the type of investments that you're making are going to keep it in a a portfolio of stocks and bonds where the most you can probably take out legitimately of somewhere between two and four percent that's the two and four percent ... percent rule which used to say well as long as you have a\nA pretty good balance of stocks and bonds as long as you don't take up more than four percent of your balance you'll you'll have a good chance would not run out of money that's been debunked by the last decade of to market crashes now do around two percent so if that's the rules and\nYour grade a long time to\nWrite it but if that's the real you're going to go on you need to have a lot more in savings if you want to use annuities alerts and some of those things that we've talked about an or other shows and we may get a chance to talk about the more today but probably not\nBut some of the annuity products that have guaranteed income can pay out its highest five and six percent guaranteed lifetime income which is one of the males will talk about later and you're guaranteed lifetime income not take a pretense right so\nAnd that four percent rule that you were talking about but the sequence of returns especially living into that at air market can be devastating\nRight timing is everything especially when you um are talking about leaving money at risk and one of the first rules of retirement planning well I guess what officials of investing in Warren Buffett's first role is nothing to lose money right now the second ... don't forget the first will lose money\nIf you lose money that's money or you may if you have to spend it while the markets down you're locking losses and that's not good so what about number two that is a the number two commandment is Social Security [noise]\nA lot of people plan on using Social Security is our main focus as retirement income and thou shalt not is now shall not plan to live off of Social Security alone\n... wasn't designed to be a retirement plan of is just to hedge against longevity and it was only designed to cover that forty percent of your retirement extends\nWell that's that's what it was a ... that's what it has amounted to in in general it covers about forty percent of the average person's retirement\nI think it was really meant to just keep somebody from having to move a homeless person to to have him move under a bridge in a cardboard ... it was another recession 'cause that's kind of where the Social Security program came off of a in Roosevelt time when the ... the great depression as they they had to create some sort of a\nA reasonable rate of guarantee that retirees didn't have to move in with their kids or didn't have to become homeless and have some sort of a a a plan to cover the basics but if you want to do some things like live life and have an ideal retirement life you're going to need to cover the rest of it so Social Security is a good basic a good place to start but it is don't make it your primary source\nOr or don't make it your total source of income is probably not going to pan out and then the other thing is is when a spouse dies you lose the lower of the new head of it so you can't count on both of those Social Security payments to continue for your life it does not create lifetime income\nSo again income so it was the first two commandments we've covered so far today ... ... if you want to a a five point retirement income plan and to see if you have enough to live your ideal retirement life\nIf you're ready we would love to have you come in for that retirement readiness review see what you need to do to get there see what you need to get to stay there if you already are there and make some tweaks along the way\nI Love to have you come in for that at a and you just got to have to give us a call\nAt five

I. R. P. as the life insurance retirement plan that is a Seventy seven to go to the Irish code that allows a permanent life insurance policy to give you tax breaks similar to a rough IRA\nWith gross that his principal protected and grows based on indexes and\nCan give you a lifetime income and those are tax free distribution so not only that you get a long term care benefit you get a death benefit\nWhich is also paid out tax free so the loop is a way that you could also divert some of that future tax money into an account where you can take money out as needed tax free rather than be forced upon your taxable so\nMaybe you'd like to pay taxes right now at twelve or Fifteen or twenty percent so that you don't have to pay taxes at twenty five or twenty eight for the rest of your life\nThat's what we mean by good tax planning but you have to start now you can't wait to start later if you need that throw tax plan that's part of a retirement readiness review feel free to give us a call for a top five to ... to one seven eighty five sixty six again that um that is part of our our complete review\nNow we have two more commandments we gotta talk about and you have another thing on taxes\nNow now that is that it's just kind of lead us end to number nine is down you know our health care costs than I think you kind of hit a little bit of that with the law at having and other avenues that there than purchasing a life or at long term care insurance plan\nRight and sometimes you can divert if you want to pay taxes now when some of that retirement nest egg money\nOr end diverted into like the ... uh qualify for that that could supply a long term care benefit\nYou might also want to just set up a nest egg of four rainy day funds to cover that and self insure or if you can generate the cash flow necessarily necessary you can also do a pay as you go long term care insurance plan which I personally don't really like that much but [noise]\nMoving on from that make sure your health care is covered but moving on from that number ten can't be too aggressive or too conservative\nIf your kid aggressive and you can lose your money if you're too conservative you may not make any money\nSo we believe in balance now that doesn't mean we believe in balance that you should have just as much money in bonds as as stocks are just as much money in variable products is a mutual funds if the asset class has risk it's considered aggressive if it doesn't have risk is considered conservative\nThere are some really nice principle protected conservative accounts that can generate on average historically better than five percent a year which is much more than bonds or have been paying are probably going to pay in a while [noise] better than CDs yet still very safe\nUm I think a balance between those conservative investments that actually have higher potential returns\nIs one way to ... to just continue to be balanced without taking too much risk it also gives you a chance when you have that conservative bloc of money set aside it gives you the ability to me to go a little more aggressive with a smaller portion of your money to swing for the fences for when the times are good\nWow we got through all can\nBarely but surely if you want to know if you're keeping those Ten Commandments and if you are going to live your ideal retirement live come in for that retirement readiness review at primary tire of planning mesh what we love to visit with you know ... just a chance to get to know each other and see if you are ready that's five to ...\nTo one Seventy

think you would either because although the stock market has been historically the best performing asset class we also know it's a very volatile asset class remember two thousand eight\nOf course you do and that's the problem is that we don't want to expose ourselves to the possibility of suffering massive losses in a very rapid pace and that's why you only have part\nOf your money in the stock market so up until Wednesday people have been saying\nHow I'm a I'm a minority that I'm not doing as well as the stock market how calm I don't have all my money and the stock market\nBecause the more diversified my portfolio is the worst it's been doing relative to the stock market because it's been the u._s. stock market that has been out performing everything else\nOf course that's what they were saying up until Wednesday\nOn Wednesday everybody started changing their tune to\nBoy am I really don't have all of my money in the stock\nMarket boy am I really glad I have a highly diversified portfolio boy am I glad I have money and investments other than\nThe stock market see my point in other words just because the given asset classes performing well and even might be performing better than alternatives doesn't mean that you ditch the alternative instead we have to recognize that every dog has its day\nAny given moment fortunes can change as we saw was striking evidence on Wednesday and Thursday when the Dow fell\nFourteen hundred points this is why you don't place all your money into stocks and it even goes beyond that because what Wednesday and Thursday demonstrated for us with something else that's really fascinating\nYou all know what's been going on with General Electric right\nWe've been talking about G E for a few times throughout the year because this company which was at one point one of the biggest companies in America and one of the best performing companies in America certainly one of the oldest companies in America\nHas been doing terribly over the past several years the stock was down forty percent over the past year gee it was kicked out of the Dow Jones industrial average earlier this year\nWow really awful so far this year\nGee is still in the U.S and the five hundred but its stock performance in the U.S and the five hundred year to date through Tuesday\nAt the four hundred and Ninety six best stuff out of the five hundred that came in at four hundred and Ninety six only for stocks were worse than gee\nYou're the date but as of Wednesday for the past week jeeze stock performance is now number one [laughter]\nIn other words nobody wanted to own Ga all year long because of all the terrible things\nThat have been happening in that company but suddenly with the stock market dropping so much on Wednesday compared to everything else GE did fabulous and\nBecame the number one performing stock for the week through\nTuesday of this past week I mean this is why you really can't try to decide what's gonna happen next because you're probably going to blow it in fact it wasn't the just the GED one from among the worst two of the very best for the weekend and Tuesday\nIf you look at what's been going on in all of the death filed the top ten percent of all stocks compared to the worst ten percent of all stocks there has been a complete flip flop\nYear to date the three best performing stocks of the U.S and the five hundred were advance micro devices\nA bio med and Netflix they were the three best performing stocks of the year but now as of Wednesday they fell to number three hundred and Ninety three number four hundred and eighty one and number four hundred and forty three respectable\nThey went from being the three best\nShoot for the past week as a through Tuesday among the very worst in the marketplace there has been a complete flip flop\nAs a result of the changing of fortunes as of Wednesday the very best performing stocks have become the very worst and many of the very worst have become among the very best this according to analysis published in the wall Street Journal on Thursday\nSo what we have to recognize is that all of this is fleeting the ability to make an investment decision based on how things have performed in the past well that's just a suckers bat and therefore my message she was very simple number one\nLet's not get overly anxious and fixated on point declines in the Dow Jones industrial average number two this is an argument a reinforcement for why you need to maintain a diversified portfolio based on your goals and objectives and number three to maintain your focus\nOn those goals and objectives if your goals and objectives have not changed if your personal circumstances have not changed\nIf your attitude about risk has not changed than there is absolutely positively no reason for you to be making any change in your investment strategy\nThe fact that the stock market had a lousy day one day this past week is not in and of itself enough of a reason to make a change and the portfolio no I'm not suggesting that we aren't going to see continued volatility in the market my point is very simply\nWe can't draw a conclusion one way or the other nor should we attempt to make a prediction about what's going to happen next instead look at the economic fundamentals unemployment is at the lowest level in this country since Nineteen sixty nine wage growth is at its highest level over the last ten years\nThe economy is still hunting along just fine and on that basis the argument for staying fully invested in a diversified portfolio remains completely\nIntact and so if you're upset about it if you're watching the news and worried about what you're seeing\nStopped watching the news it doesn't mean you should change your investments that means you should change the channel that's the most effective advice I can give you on the show today I Want you to stay with us because if you're still struggling on what you should be doing with your investments I have the number one piece of advice\nAnd I'm going to tell you what it is when we come back you're on a Rick element show\nSo if you're struggling not knowing what you ought to be doing I'm going to tell you exactly what you should do\nAnd you're not going to stay with us for more here on the truth about money triple a plan wreck on line at rice dome and [noise]\nThe the number one bestseller rescue and your money

right guy doesn't show heading out to Troy in Michigan Paul's on the line how you doing fall\nOn my question is about the option to take a a lump sum a passion briefly I've been given the opportunity to take all your input on it\nSo ah the question is whether you take the lump sum\nA or a series of monthly checks for as long as you live and uh it's it's an important question isn't it because once you give them your answer you're like stuck with it forever [laughter] so that's a yeah it's like they're no reduced though do overs and such like that and that's why it's pretty vaccine for a lot of folks\nGood news is this it is straight math in other words we simply want to look at\nHow much money they're going to offer you on a monthly basis versus if we take the lump sum\nPay any taxes associated with that invest the rest how much income can we reasonably expect to produce from a an investment we make with that lump sum and is that money going to be equal to what you would have gotten from the pension\nSo the good news is all requires is a bit of math and I can tell you this usually\nWhen we do that math for our clients the answer is take the lump sum and invest it on your own to produce your own monthly income usually not always but usually that is the more\nCost effective more economic uh the the superior answer given the two choices now I say usually and here's one big case where it's\nUsually not true a radio station our federal employees and the reason is that in some pensions\nThe pension amount you receive will grow over time they will actually increase the amount of income you're receiving sort of like Social Security increases this year they just announced that there will be a\nVery small Social Security increase for folks mostly about thirty or forty bucks for most Social Security beneficiaries\nUm so if you have a pension where where the monthly income you're receiving will rise annually than a clearly that are in most cases is the better choice but most pensions don't do that most pensions it's a fixed amount\nWhatever they are giving you one day one is the same you're going to get ten years from now Twenty years from now Thirty years from now and that's a big reason for choosing the lump sum over the monthly pension because when you take the monthly pension\nThere are several pieces of fine print\nNumber one is I just said that amount will not rise which means overtime inflation will take its toll on the value of that monthly check\nThe the ability to buy goods and services diminishes because those costs rise but the check your receiving doesn't second is that when you die that pension benefits stops are you married Paul\nNo single okay so it's not an issue for you if you don't have a spouse or a partner you don't have to worry about that but for people who are married to have a partner a vet pension check stops when they die and that leaves a huge crisis for their surviving spouse\nOr so that's a consideration ah that's not a problem for you so not as big a deal another major one his lack of liquidity once you take the monthly check that's all you ever get as a monthly check if you ever need access to the big bucket of money it's not available to you whereas if you take the lump sum now invested and generate your own income\nYou can increase that income whenever you want to keep pace with inflation you can reduce that you can start it stop it if you need a lump sum it's available to you you have greater flexibility and when you die whatever you didn't spend stays there for your heirs so the lump sum has greater flexibility that is often\nSuperior to taking the pension benefit but here's one final point in favor of the pension\nYou don't have to worry about your own habits in other words some folks if they are given the lump sum\nWill blow the cash and they will discover at some point that the money was spent on vacations and on jewelry on on big screen TVs on lottery tickets and beer and they have nothing to show for it in ten years and now they're in trouble whereas if they had taken the monthly check\nThey can be pretty confident that they will get another monthly check next month like Social Security checks and so they can protect themselves from their own\nA tendency to get my ... so you have to know your salary you have to know can you be trusted to receive this lump sum manager permanently properly for your own personal benefit or will you be your own worst enemy\nAnd you would say the best thing to do is put it in a\nA R a yes or assuming you're eligible and in most cases you argue roll the money over to an IRA and then you begin making withdraws from that account whenever you're ready to start taking it if you want it right away you can start if you don't need it for a while you leave it there until you do need it\nAnd you go from there so in order to find out the answer for sure we need to do that math we need to do those calculations to evaluate how much money is your employer offering you and can you reasonably expect to generate a similar amount of income\nFrom an investment strategy you create on your own\nAs I said usually the answer's yes we can do that but not always\nAnd that's why we need to go through the exercise we actually have an office in Troy on in your neck of the woods and so happy to sit down with you and go through this and detail looking at the amount of pension benefit your being offered and contrast that with a lump sum they're willing to give us an alternative to see which strategy is best in your situation\nThat sounds good so yeah the good news is like I said it's largely straight math that doesn't require a too much judgment will show you the spreadsheet analysis and say here's what yet this way and here's what you get that way which number looks better to you", "show_name": "Edelman Financial Engines", "year": "2018", "city": "Tucson", "day": "13"}
