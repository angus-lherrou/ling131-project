like so real to me when it's about exposing the truth\nAnd getting the story right\nBreitbart Texas [noise]\nNow back to the green [noise]\nOnly did I Do one for you I did too often interviews\nAnd we still have Joe current the student we didn't even bring him up to the Mike which is just crazy but Joe I promise sometime soon we will have you on here and we were talking about your security job AT Metro because that is a story that I think the listeners want to hear I Will be bringing that up\nI Am going to switch gears one more time I've been doing a lot during today's show how can I add a young you're switching gears which I'm sure that that's what I Do\nIt you might get a ... for for the information of the agents is great right I drank a ... a big monster before I got on and then uh I'm not endorsing this product are usually but I also I found this product called grinds which is like tobacco fused with like more caffeine\nAnd that's what you need B. twelve and ... and all kinds of stuff and ... it's called the grinds black coffee pouches oh yeah yeah they're really good uh they keep you awake it's better than monster is it like I don't drink coffee you'll you'll take it in a pouch\nYes ... just released into that they're just gonna they're gonna they're they're going to try to figure out how to turn that around I mean think fly and the interest or love it\nAlong the Rio Grande there's some backlash to President Trump's push to speed this border wall construction\nAnd I guess ... homeland security department of homeland security department or they made a decision last week to speed the construction and it was a border wall and the lower Rio Grande valley and it has pretty much upset a lot of these residents just as the mid term election isn't site um\n[noise] I'm not trying to attack anyone or see anything but if\n[noise] I don't know man how can I Do it without attacking people I'll never be able to do that now so let's just go straight to the point\nCould just be somebody's Obama holdovers that I keep on talking about\nRight before the midterms you're going to try to push this\nUh I mean I don't know or is it is it obviously President Trump asked to push the border wall construction and where we at but it was it was a homeland security decision to speed the construction in in a area where it's very controversial\nUm and then obviously we have a little Francis down there a poncho he likes to be called poncho because he likes to believe that he's Hispanic so little punch O'Rourke um you know is peace talks his voter interest by reminding them about President Trump's plans\nAre I think he forgot that will pass or ... miles and miles of border fencing and because of it all passwords regularly cited as being one of American safest cities\nDole talking to some old Paso guys uh those polls may have been a little tainted too you know what I mean like you and it's it's obvious I mean they can be that's safe you got water is just south of there which is just a dangerous city some of its spills over the past\nBut I don't know if the timing is right\nObviously no there's miles of gaps that separate segments of walls constructed a decade ago and hardly any of it is imposing as the bear that President Trump has envisioned\nSo somebody's residents are very angry that the administration decided to waive environmental and other regulations half way through a two month comment period\nIt's crazy but as you've ... you've heard some of our guests today obviously Steve for running for district nine seen firsthand\nThe issues out there and knowing the importance of a better barrier marks Spencer sharing his experience and the death of law enforcement officers at the hands of illegals that come into the into the United states\nWe know it's important it's important to build a better barrier\nMy problem a little bit is that we have areas here in Arizona namely over sixty linear miles on the ... up from reservation where not only is the barrier less than than what we need it the leaves a lot to be desired right let's say\nBut also there's certain technologies it's hard for us to work because of all these regulations and and the holy land and what's not hold in I mean I don't want to get into that because that's not the religious aspect but obviously we need to start taking the security of our country serious\nBut you know the other thing too it seems to me agents need the technology that is available because right now there was a story that just came out last week about a one of the tunnels they found those solar equipped right solar eclipse that means you're getting the technology if they get they can't have better technology than our agents on the ground it should not be that way\nThis is where it it upsets me that we have representatives and I know Steve for our talked about it border security and\nTurning your family is an American citizens it it has nothing to do with party it has everything to do with just your securing their country and if you run for a position\nOf political office within the United states shooting regardless of party shoot into your priorities be towards the American citizens that you are representing me because it's pretty simple I mean it just it's just it's not hard to figure that one out\nRepresentative bin ... Gonzales he's a congressman or down in ... called the plan to build the wall and I'm going to quote him\nA monument to waste of money that's what he said\nHow I mean that's just insane uh and he said we look at it in terms of common sense does it work\nHe says is it offensive to our friends and neighbors to the south that's when it comes down to\nA Vincent Gonzales Vinnie let me tell you\nIt works look at ... Frances ... your buddy his home town is a prime example down in El Paso areas where we've put better barriers or prime examples that it decreases in detour as the people that are entering in those areas\nWhy should we even care that it's offensive to our neighbors I'm not offended that my neighbor has a fence between his home in mine that's the dumbest argument you can think of I'm not offended or you know that my neighbor has a pool and I don't have a pool that doesn't offend me\nI take care of my family and make sure that my people are secure like I said earlier I don't hate my neighbor\nBut I Love my people in my house and that's what it comes down to it's ridiculous to have that argument of it it doesn't make sense of we're going to send our neighbors to the south you know what I'm sick and tired of being told that we need to set the example people need to start paying attention that no one's following our example that's the reality\nUm lots of things that we do to not upset her neighbors to the south one of the issues that humongous here and it's it's very it's going to be hard for the listeners who understand this but there's actual firearms training\nThat are agents have received that has been cut down because of funding yet that same firearms training that should've been given to our agents is now being given to the Mexican federal police\nWell how ridiculous is that to cut the training of our own men and women that are defending our borders but you're going to give it to another country and oh well we want to maintain good relationship\nYou know what is that that old saying Andy big fences make good neighbors yeah\nThat's the reality when you just start taking care of our own people first\nAnd whatever's leftover we can help out that's the reality folks thank you so much for another edition I Hope you enjoyed it I think it was huge it was it's been a long day along busy day we've been out on the border we had Steve Ferrara don't forget them\nMarks Spencer my friend ... a council chaplain\nAnd he had on the sidelines jokes or we'll talk about him and his other issues later but it's always a pleasure to have all of you guys hear Andy another fantastic job like his are huge shout out to Lee thank you for the notes and a big\nHeart felt shout out to all the agents of Wilcox station and of course\nThe never forgotten and always remembered ... border patrol agents in the northern border I Love you guys all thank you for listening to the Greenland until next time stay safe\nViews and opinions expressed in this episode are solely those of the host and gas they do not necessarily reflect the positions or policies of the national border patrol council the United states border patrol any other government agency or this station [noise]\nAnd we were ... you don't laugh\nFrom the region will studio your local area for you dot com is gay and it's the instant wins and high art radio station [noise]\nThe Saudis story ... Fox News Saudi Arabia's citizens arrested a team in connection with the death of ... at the consulate in is ten bowl the kingdom says to show the died after a fight broke out but there's worldwide skepticism over this statement\nAnd when people get stressed they want to push it down the road let's procrastinate Martha let's not get to that today right is this not this Saturday we got to go here and here you know\nSo again a but sometimes later sadly never comes and many people find themselves applying for their Social Security before they reach the age of ... pay out of their benefits so they're exposing their four one K. is are there either race\nThe high levels of market risk and living on a fixed income that does it for them the lifestyle that they are accustomed to enjoying she got a lot of actors going on\nNow our time is almost up for this portion of the show is there anything else you want to add before we take a quick break here TJ\nYes sir preparing for retirement whether the understanding your Social Security benefits are learning about common mistakes to avoid can be overwhelming and even nerve wracking at times\nSo I'd like you to take a moment right down if you're not driving don't do this if you're driving but if you're not driving right down my website which is T.

filed for Social Security on day one of their retirement that's not always the smartest moved to make others will rely on supplemental income from an IRA or other retirement account such as a four one K.\nAh and then working with a bright angel professional such as myself or or someone like me can help you determine\nYour best course of action so is it the right move to jump right down the Social Security office maybe so but maybe not again why don't you come get some advice on when the best timing for you is for you and your family that helps\nOh yeah it's huge it helps a lot so ah how do we know though which strategy is going to be the most beneficial to us\nTony that's a great question and I would answer it this way just like no to people's DNA are like\nA note to people's situation is exactly alike so it's not a one size fits all a process here ladies and gentlemen less ... let me let me say that again each person's situation is completely unique and different than the next so each each program or or or strategy that we create will be unique\nAnd and customize to that specific family or individual and their specific situation so\nAdvice about what to do with money has been around as long as money's existed hindsight allows us to see which advice was good in which advice didn't cut the mustard the reality is that investment strategies in savings plans that worked in the past\nHave encountered challenging new circumstances that have turned them on their heads in these days so remember the great recession of the early to thousands highlighted how old investment ideas were not only ineffective but incredibly destructive to their retirement plans have millions of Americans\nAs you will recall you remember the term Toni my four oh one case turned into a two oh one K. was that was a very popular little catchphrase that came about and\nTwo thousand eight okay so so the reality uh again or perhaps the most important lessons people learn from the great recession and I'm going to go so far here Tony let's just say that wasn't a recession that was a flat out depression we just don't want to admit so\nBut uh it was two thousand eight was not a recession and it was a depression but because of that uh it it is that not understanding where your money's invested in the potential risks of those investments can work against you\nYour plans for retirement and your legacy so whereas some as sources of advice that been around for very long time\nWhile there are some basic investment concepts that have stood the test of time\nMost strategies that work adapt to changing conditions in the market in the economy and the world as well as changes to your personal circumstances\nAnd as we know Tony\nWe're in a twenty four seven news cycle these days with social media Facebook Twitter yadda yadda I mean Jesus that the president the United states God Bless them but he uses Twitter more than anybody I think I've ever seen right but my point is we are bombarded with such\nConstant chronic diarrhea of information that it is we're in a whole different stratosphere than we have ever been before this ... this point or less yeah different stress here\nYeah I I think it's ... it's huge it really is a changing world out there especially when it comes to finances and um I think that uh we need to look at some of these ideas um so what are some new ideas that would be helpful to people in retirement or at least fast\nApproaching retirement well uh I I Would say there's a concept where there are essentially two kinds of money\nAnd I know we talked about the past but I'd like to review it there's hope so money and no cell money\nUnless just briefly divide that so everyone can divide their money into these two categories all of you somehow have more of one kind and you know there are so here we go we have hope soon we have no so the goal isn't to eliminate one kind of money but to balance them\nAs you approach retirement so let me briefly define\nWhat is hope so hope so money would be what we at triple age would refer to as red red or yellow money ... money is money a complete risk money in stocks individual stocks bonds are\nOverseas investments you know maybe limited partnerships in such okay so really high risk kind of stuff that's that can drop on a dime and and disappear tomorrow or or double can double or it can disappear okay that's Redmond you ... your money is a little little bit safer but still still somewhat at risk\nYellow money would be managed portfolio such as mutual funds or ATS or actual professionally managed accounts like you would see from an R. I. A. or if they do Sherry where they actually professionally manage their own portfolios and money\nBut they're still professionally manage which means someone is watching over your money pretty regularly daily or or every other day or weekly at the least right but still it's connected to the stock market in some form or fashion so there's still that little bit of risk\nThat if they weren't watching it close enough they could take a bit of a ...\nWhereas the nose so your nose so money that's what we called green money and I refer to green money Tony as just safe stuff cash in the bank money markets CDs\nOr money in your under your mattress at home although I don't know how safe it is from being robbed or burglar rise but you know if if no one knows where it is but you then I'd say it's pretty safe OK yeah cash cash life insurance cash value life insurance that's very safe\nAnnuities very safe so or pensions Social Security those would be considered green money or no so money\nSo again we we are eliminating one or the other category we just want to make sure that they become balance so we're we're uh I Know we're running out of time for this segment but I Will provide more information as soon as we come back from our our last commercial breaks all are given a a little more detail Tony on how we can help manage that\nYeah and I look forward to that or do you have any comments before we take a quick break here\nYou sure do you bet ladies and gentlemen again take a moment and write my website down so you can pay a visit to it if if and when you're not driving that is W.
