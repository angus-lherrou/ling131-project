{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KNST", "content": "What did I Do I texted her we weren't even done with the show she said yeah I'll get on that's that's she's just cool that way yeah it's a big deal it's cool um she's awesome awesome lady so I hung out with her talk to her\nShe was very nice I Know I mean I Want to make sure I don't forget anybody that I run into a jar pile yeah I read into Joe good oh Joe\n... Joe Brown was that a circle Kay my friend Joe my friend and and just see you guys can yeah he's my friend\nAh [noise] and obviously he wasn't endorsed by the end because he was ... was endorsed uh because this is my friend to the both of my friends and Martha is my friend and then you have to have loyalty towards your friends and it has nothing to with bipartisan with partisanship you know what party poured a but Joe came up to\nMe he hugged me he ... he was he was he's who he is all the time when he was fantastic\nHe's it was going on the border they fixed that what's going on cells the gift that said no job we have the same people running the agency they rented under Obama they're not doing anything well you needed to President Trump and make me make me the commissioner\nMake me the secretary a bit I'll let you guys do whatever you want as long as it's within the law and then he ... and then he says 'cause 'cause me and him talked a lot before right things and he says oh\nOh care more about the loan or care more about defending the borders that don't care about you guys growing beards and\nMost ashes what a clown show and I said what are you talking about [laughter] you know we've talked\nThese more on up in D.C are too concerned with you guys growing beards that they don't give you guys proper under drugs are not on your friend a border\nAnd I thought to myself he's so he's so right so real there's ... you have these leaders these leaders supposedly arguing with brand name John and the national board because when everyone they can think of them on on the color of boots and the ... beards\nAnd they forgot that their job is to help us figure out how to defend the border I mean jeeze and and he's so real so it was great seeing a bunch of those guys and and talking to him and I'm\nJoe ... was there ... Spencer wasn't there but jokes or was there so that\nWas fun and it was a good time is a good time so I Want to talk about ... the the by the time you guys hear this show the jury will have been select I was there\nI saw the the selection process I think George Collins is doing a fantastic job at the judge in charge of the case you're doing great\nSo I show up or I was late I was doing some Fox interviews um have another one tomorrow morning for twenty in the morning by the way raised killing but anyway um so I show up of low late I wanted to make sure that Lonny knew I was there\nYou know so I show up of course to the listeners Loni shorts was found innocent\nBut the witch hunt continues because these people are yelling for justice but justice is not what they want\nWhat they want is revenge stop asking for justice when what you truly need and want in your life is revenge and it's just a setting that they're dragging this human being through all of this garbage and shame on the prosecutor to\nAnd shame on the office of inspector general ... I've been in their office a few times with shame on them\nThey sit there and they hug on this dirt bag\nKid's brother like if they're victims\nThese guys were smuggling dope into the United states they were rocking federal agents and launched shorts pulled out is going to defend them so that is the reality of what happened and the choir boy picture that you guys are seen on the news and the choir boy picture that you see\nBy these activists groups it's garbage kid was not a choir boy he was a drug smuggling that's what he did ... so I'm going to the court case I'm literally not case but to the to the ... going to court yet and I'm seeing the New Jersey the they're selecting the jury\nAnd I run into the heck is her name gosh I always forget her name is Jessica ... Martinez is about ... ... is it about jazz about also yeah [laughter] oh\nIt's not Martinez can't remember her name right Isabelle something she's an activist right I thought she was looking for one of her Dalmatians she looks like the lady like the hundred and one Dalmatians lady right for she's out there looking for a Dalmatians ... and ... and she's running out of the court\nAnd she turns around and she looks at me and she says how shameful you are Mr does with them and that was like me and she turns around she looked she was yeah you and I and I was like you're talking to me I did it again because it was funny right right you're talking to me\nAnd she says and then she stops and she says she like I just she thought and she's like well that is the right guy and she says um\nWould you are or you weren't the weather like really confused and at this point I'm laughing a little bit and I'm like what adults\nAnd then I said yeah that's me and she says shameful all of your ads are just shameful\nThe head of the ads you're doing for ... I don't know if it's the ads I'm doing for my Sally or if it's the ads that I put on the Greenland Facebook page or if it's the ads that I put on local two five four for his Facebook page and please listeners\nGo to the local to five Facebook page it's the second story that's up right now still\nIt's it's um it's pictures of gang members that's what that's how I got a point you get the right direction but it's not gang members it's the individuals that were involved in the shooting at lunch which dependence life right but look at that share that post I Want everyone to see who these people really are not with the media is telling you they're\nSo suggests a belt no wait a minute you said it was as ... as\nThe lady looked for the Dalmatians right she turns around and she's she's she's just shameful when she walked away and she she was in a hurry\nI didn't get a chance to stop her and say well ... which which um which ad or what are you talking about right so she she ran out of their quick um I think her her broom was double part how she got to pay the parking meter and she just left or Roman attended\nSo I went upstairs and then I find out that they they they kind of kicked her out because they weren't allowing certain people in but it was it was just that the the courtroom was so packed\nRight that they couldn't have everyone in there so they just couldn't have you standing and in typical\nDalmatian form she got upset and she was all angry that they they told her to leave and all kinds of stuff but you know the public just needs to understand\nDo you want justice or do you do want revenge\nAnd you know in this day and age you can second guess officers all day long\nAnd I know some of you asked for video cameras and all that money to put this into a real quick perspective you have to make split second life and death decisions out there and you want one camera and so you can judge this individual\nIf you watch sports they have all teen billion cameras\nFor sports play and they still get it wrong but you're going to judge an officer think about that let that sink in for a second our prayers go out to lunch shorts were behind you\nI Hope that the jury that get selected does the right thing and they see this for what it is it is nothing more than a witch hunt they're not seeking justice they're seeking revenge\nLet's do the right thing to do the right thing folks\nTo next week we'll see how this invasion works out you may you may be seeing me or hearing me I'm record from some bunker I don't know\nIf you don't come along yeah okay if you hear the words the chair is against the door\nThat means we're in trouble if you feed it twice is it twice ... shares against the door yes until next week thoughts thank you so much for listening

com is saying is the hard radio station [noise]\nA lead Jay in Pittsburgh I'm Joe ... another mass shooting this time at a synagogue in Pittsburgh where eleventh fatalities as a result of the shooting incident\nA live to the max OK your retirement lifestyle something you can prepare for but until you experience it you can never really know what to expect so many Americans especially in the baby boomer generation are are hardworking individuals and after so many years of working it's hard to disassociate yourself from what you've\nFor a living in fact most of us man on TALK to you guys out there sadly guess what we do we tire entire self esteem up with what we've done for a job what we've done for a living to create a life for our family so we tie our our our person hood into what we've done and when we stopped doing that\nWe stopped being a lawyer at an accountant a police officer firefighter and we were done with that we're going to the next phase we kind of lose our identity sometimes\nYou don't want to do that remember you're more than just your job you're more than what you do for a living ladies and gentleman you are a miracle created by God himself and I mean that with all sincerity I don't care what your religious background I'm not here to ...\nThe ties are preached to you but I Am here to tell you you are a miracle I mean just look at your DNA and how how do our lungs keep working on our her keep beating for you know really I mean you're a miracle so you need to know that you're more than what you do for a living\nOkay so let's let's let's talk about a few more ideas so your retirement lifestyle or something you can prepare for but until you experience it never really uh you never really know what to expect so for many Americans are\nBasically we've got to think about All right you wished you'd never worked another day in your life but when that day comes you may wish for the opposite ... be careful what you wish for\nSo not working can provide a major Boyd in your life and filling that void is easier said than done so as you prepare for your financial transition from working to non working years you should also prepare for your life's transition what's your life\nGoing what's your new purpose okay\nWhy is it important to have retirement lifestyle plant retirement is a life event that's going to change your lifestyle obviously and I believe this planning is almost as important as your financial retirement planning in fact having a retirement lifestyle plan will help you determine what you want your retirement to look like\nAsk yourself these questions do you want to travel if so how often do you want to continue working if so and what capacity and doing what do you want to take up a new activity or a hobby if so what and how much time\nDo you want to spend doing it answers to these questions can help you plan out your retirement lifestyle and how you envision your retirement so also it's good to make your retirement lifestyle plan when you're healthy and independent and can make well informed\nDecision so I Know I've said before I'll say it again remember there's the go go years this logo years ... years and then go go Europe and ramp like your health is great your wife fell through your husband's health is great\nYou're off to the races a year traveling around the world going on cruises visiting your kids grandkids all around the countryside but you're doing your thing okay and then ten or so years go by and now you're in your slogan years maybe you\nCan't move around as as freely as you used to be you can still go visit the kids and grandkids on occasion holidays in such they come see you write and then you've got to know go years where one of you or both of you are confined to a facility and or you need full time care around the clock care for you\nAnd your own home okay that's gonna that's gonna adjust thanks so keep in mind if it's a very good idea to make your retirement lifestyle plan when you're healthy and independent okay\nYou can make well informed decisions so uh basically uh another question would be how much time or\nHave your class dedicated to planning for their retirement lifestyle okay well some of my clients haven't given it any thought at all usually clients have already dedicated countless years days hours to play in their retirement income\nThat's not altogether true I remember I told you last time most people spend more time planning their two week vacation than they ever do their retirement plan sadly\nThat's true it's sad\nBut it's true okay so ... but in the meantime while you're planning for your actual financial portion of your retirement let's spend a little time planning your lifestyle portion as well so they probably of grand ideas for the return of lifestyle but NO PLAN as to how they will afford that lifestyle\nRetirement dreams don't come cheap the finding resourceful ways to make your retirement lifestyle Marta ... is possible\nSo our

want your retirement to look like okay so\nUh when you're working days are done what are some ideas to stay motivated inactive during your retirement let's talk about there are multiple ways to keep you motivated when you're working days are over such as exercising exercise and it's been proven to not only provide a physical release but also a mental what in fact\nI just heard this and I am not kidding you guys I've been in a bit of a funk a mental funk a little bit of a depression depressive state over these past few months that I couldn't figure out why I'm like jeeze\nWhat's going on here right well it's because I was in the hospital year and a half ago and the doctor said stop weight training no more weight training you can get to go do cardio all day long but stopped the weights well I was listening to one of my favorite radio shows John Test radio\nA Sunday Morning about two or three Sundays ago and they have did a study at Johns Hopkins university or Harvard one of them and it said do you know that strength training has the same effect on our brains as taking an anti depressant does it increases doping meaning serotonin levels\nAnd I remember I stopped doing strength training a year and a half ago and I thought holy could\nI went back to weight training a strength training about a month and a half ago and lo and behold guess what that quote dark cloud hovering around me has dissipated dramatically know sometimes it's still there do I hate Monday's you bet your bottom dollar I'm allergic to Mondays I tell everybody\nBut most of us are right am I Am I talking to a wall here do most of you out there listening that's still have a jail be considered Monday's like you're held day right it is it I don't know why that is it's psychological I Know but I'll tell you something get back to the gym and do some strength training I don't mean push it to the max here\nBut if you're used to doing bench press with a hundred and fifty pounds job but to Seventy five pounds it's still bench press it'll still keep going okay or some chin ups pull ups whatever a leg presses squats ... curls for your buys and push down for your triceps all kinds of things\nBut they are all kinds of things we can do okay and I I've I assure you if you feel that same dark cloud hovering go hit the gym and get some strength\nTraining and I promise it'll lessen okay so again a in other ways to volunteer volunteering can connect you to community gives you a sense of purpose and most importantly make an impact in someone else's life and ladies and gentlemen is it that really what life's all about\nTo God and when we get down to it isn't making a difference for others are real core passion and I know there's a few super selfish people out there that could give a rat's butt about what I'm saying right now\nWell they're the few there the ten percent they are not the Ninety Ninety percent of our population I promise you feels exactly like I'm Talking right now they want to give okay if you won the lottery I guarantee most of you out there\nWouldn't go spend it on your cell she'd want to go help your family and friends get out of debt right away especially with this Powerball going on right now imagine winning a billion dollars can you stop and think for a moment a grand you're only going to get keep about half of it but it\nHalf a billion dollars five hundred million\nThat's more than you could live on in a lifetime you got to think to yourself OK if I got more than enough to take care of me and mine what else am I doing and seriously what would you do
