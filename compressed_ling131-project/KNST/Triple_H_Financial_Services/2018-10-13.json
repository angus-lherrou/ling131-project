longer than I'd been elsewhere so anyway again and welcome back ladies and gentlemen if you're just tuning as a tuning in right now you just happen to hit the dial stay tuned you're going to enjoy our topic today it's a dealing with an unstable market okay the title is show is dealing with an unstable market in the last segment we covered the fear gauge\nWhich measures expected market volatility and the color of money which is used to help people allocate their assets which are broken down into three groups red yellow and green money just to recap red money is that money that's exposed to more risk and can fluctuate with the ups and downs of the stock market\nYellow money is what I Would prefer referred to as manage money professionally manage money it's usually has a cohesive strategy behind it that is implemented by a professional money manager\nAnd finally green money is typically more safe\nAnd dependable it's there again when you need it in fact I tell people in my workshops which by the way I forgot to mention last segment my next workshop is right around the corner this uh [noise] uh Thursday and Saturday the eleventh and the thirteenth\nThe eleventh and the thirteenth of October at Pima college east campus and then we're doing another uh our next workshop is October twenty fifth in twenty seven at the Pima college downtown campus it'll be again at the payment college downtown campus\nOn October twenty fifth and twenty seven which is Thursday evening at six thirty and Saturday morning at ten AM so again just mark on your calendar this Thursday the eleventh and the thirteenth and ... uh two weeks from now on the twenty fifth and twenty seven at the Pima college downtown campus\nAt six thirty PM Thursday evening followed by ten am Saturday morning okay so again uh uh but ... green money is money that has a guarantee comes with a guarantee the you\nKnow you can never lose your original principle [noise] so what should someone do to help prepare themselves for volatile market\nWell let's jump into that it's helpful to begin by creating an investment strategy and investment strategy is defined as a set of rules behaviors or procedures they guided investor to select the appropriate investment portfolio that best fits their specific situation no to investors are like just like no two people are like\nIt's important to understand your needs and goals for retirement have an investment portfolio tailored to your objectives\nRisk tolerance and your time horizon or remember you and your neighbor or not\nThe same so whatever your neighbors doing does not necessarily mean that's exactly what you should be doing when you're sitting around the Thanksgiving table this Thanksgiving and your brother in law spelled enough oh you should buy this stock or that\nPortfolio have this bond or that David and so on that may be good for him and his family but it may not be the right choice for you because your goals and objectives may be completely different so just like\nYour DNA no two portfolio should look identical either\nOkay so yeah it's important to understand your needs and goals for retirement and they have an investment portfolio Taylor do your directives and your risk tolerance so it's good for you to make sure your portfolio is individually focused\nSome clients are thrown into arbitrary categories and don't received a portfolio that they should have to meet their goals with any investment strategy always keep in mind that you can get drawn into it and don't let your emotions get the better of you while you can't control the ups and downs of the stock market you can't control how you react to them\nAnd having the knowledge to be ready for a volatile market with a tailored investment strategy can help with making sure you make the right decisions for your future\nSo how can the color of money help with creating an investment strategy as we mentioned earlier in the show the color of money helps you organize your assets in the market most people spend the majority of their working years trying to build their retirement nesting\nWhile many people folks on how to accumulate a retirement nest egg often times they don't think about where their retirement asset should be invested accumulating read accumulating a retirement nest egg is certainly\nA a most important and I feel like in some cases it may be just as important to have your money and assets that represent\nThe risk or safety that my clients want a this is where the color of money comes into play are from AAA financial group is put together a simple way that showcases the showcases the benefits of red yellow and green money\nAs mentioned earlier each color has a unique benefit and unique feature involved as properly colored asset allocation can help to provide my clients\nWith her retirement that they want and deserve\n[noise] so how do I help clients allocate their assets in order to help them achieve their retirement goals\nWell here's what we do no matter how challenged they're successful someone has been financially there's always unanswered questions or concerns people have a they'll also have questions like how much risk taking how much safety will I get and how much is the right fit of each so retirements a pretty big life is that would you agree\nHopefully the answer's yes you're shaking your head you would agree therefore\nIt needs to be taken seriously and I want to help as many clients or prospective clients understand what their options are that are available to them to help them meet their goals\nIt's important to note that everyone's situation is different and I pride myself on giving each of my clients of personalized service that they deserve which can help determine the right amount of risk for them\nWhile each person's situation berries there are some concepts like the color of money that can help all of us achieve our retirement goals and dreams\nSo this is important to understand a but they're also a wasted deal and prepare for an unstable market\nOkay so let's talk about that organizing your assets understanding your color of money and creating an incumbent accumulation plan for retirement can quickly become an overwhelming task it is your responsibility to figure out if your income and accumulation needs are being met but you don't have to do that alone\nConsulting with the financial professional may be a wise approach to calculating your risk level a professional can help determine your risk tolerance by getting to know you asking you a set of questions and even giving you a survey to determine your comfort level with different types of risk\nIn our case we have an eleven question questionnaire\nThat it creates that colored money risk analysis we talked about or colored money report so it's a field felt found deal it's we're asking you how you feel about loss and instability and how you feel about safety instability and we're just going to get a feel for how you are and then we come up with a risk score and\nThen we base to report on that risk or\nOK so a professional such as myself can help determine your risk tolerance by getting to know you and and again going through this survey to determine your level of comfort with the types of risk you're taking at a hearing to sound investment a principal or principles such as asset allocation\nRegular portfolio review and managing risk can help you achieve long term success in the end it comes down to your personal tolerance for risk as a I guess I'd ask you to ask yourself this question how much\nRisk am I willing to take that's a big one how much risk am I willing to take [noise] so uh we're we're about to the end of our next segment ladies and gentleman so uh [noise] I'm going to just throw this out again uh my company has triplets financial group [noise]\nAnd uh in our planning process it is truly to provide our clients with clarity knowing that they all
