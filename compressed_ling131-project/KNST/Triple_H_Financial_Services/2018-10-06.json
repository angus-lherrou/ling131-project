that's about it and and you guys for having me on today\nKnow every day and do it and I know like I said and so I think you everything you do I think for being a friend for being a brother and a\nFour you know being just someone that I Know I can count on when if I'm ever going to buy for sure absolutely and that goes for anybody in in ... sheet that Cruz thank you so much just we're going to go on a real quick break and we'll be right back [noise]\nLike the men and women who carry their gear Gerber is unstoppable decades of innovation and dedication and put them on top renown as a master of knives and tools reverse problem solving lifesaving products are designed with the you need to have a specific activities in mind today that includes much more than a blade it is a lifestyle\nThis is the green line you know what I Love I Love the border patrol agents that are busting their butt out every day that's why I Love and I know I sound like this crazy radical America America guy but I'm sitting at home at night with my kid I'm sitting at home and I'm with my wife I'm watching TV I'm I'm reading a book and\nI Do feel a little bit more secure because I Know that the people that I work

they go five eleven tactical ... or the loyalty and trust those protecting humidity and families will why we're proud to have five unlimited our sponsor and Ross promote their phonics because they've heard our respect and so forth\nAnd now back to the green line this is kind of some real heard from the twenty third congressional district of Texas and you're listening to the green [noise]\nThat was an awesome interview with you again\nI liked it I I I don't know any martial arts at all and it just you know it's a lot of discipline yes and it just it just seems like a smart thing\nFor anybody that's especially if they're in law enforcement or even now gosh the fire department really anybody that's working in public service that comes in contact with people you get the experience\nRight and you just don't know now because I I've been on several interviews that I've done um television interviews radio everything right and they've always ask me what's the difference now as to how it's been before within your job and I've always said you know\nWhen when it first started doing my job my first apprehension by myself was a group of eighty\n... you know what I mean yeah and and luckily thank God they were peaceful everyone complains yeah right\nBut now you hear so many so many stories of agents arresting smaller groups groups have gotten smaller but there's there's always that one guy from Honduras that wants to fight mhm\nAnd I know people say that I said ... because that's who you really wants to fight every time you catch him and I don't know what's wrong it must be something in the water in Honduras rape but they want to fight\nAnd even now with catch and release still going on\nThey still want to fight yeah it's like they're going to release you ice is going to pretty much release you why do you want to fight but\nObviously in the Tucson sector there's there's a huge amount of cartel members and drug smugglers that we have to encounter yeah and I think that's why it's important it's great and it's fantastic because agents have the opportunity to do this ...\nWhich is they have an hour during their shift where they can you know do some kind of physical activity to stay in shape and measured because it's your life right that's the outcomes absolutely um\nAnd here you have it you know if you're in Tucson you have that option to be able to train with a real Brazilian jujitsu black though\nThat's what it comes down to you know I'd rather have the upper hand right right and ... and he said it I think Chris did a fantastic thing that has to resume into a lot of people's minds\nAnd even if you're not of course when you hit it has to resume because things are different than they used to be you know what I mean there's a lot of violence out there and I\nMean he says just four to six months\nOf training or something is going to help yeah and I think that's a big deal I was I was listening to um ... McNamara who we've had before on a show and I was listening to what he had said today and and I follow him on his social media and he said something very cool this morning where\nHe's a very intense individuals people that you've heard about the show he says\nYou gotta wake up every morning\nWith the mentality you have to do something to make yourself better than your yesterday absolutely particularly when it comes to the violence that there is in this world because you can shelter yourself and say there is no right as you can try to stop you could sell to your kids\nBut it's we live in a wider world and she said you have to wake up two day\nTraining something so you could be able to kick your butt from yesterday yeah right and he and and Chris is now the same thing is twice I've heard it in one day which is that's what it comes down to ... Chris we'll train you so\nSix months from now you can beat yourself up today [laughter] you know what I mean right I mean that's what it comes down to and I think it's important that in the mirror every day time to start graying beard yeah yeah I Do with the beard [laughter]\nAh but do you know what I mean I think is fantastic to see that and to hear that in in to see what options he gives agents it's another tool you look at agents to carry their gun they're they're asked their old sea spray that just different things\nHere's another tool that you don't have to worry about I'm a pouch to carry on your belt and it's a tool that you can carry for the rest of your life and that's what's important so I'm really happy I was able to have him on I think it was fantastic\nThere's there's up we had a ... a lot of other things planned on the show we wanted to talk about the issues of ice and all kinds of stuff I had some notes that I wrote down a on the incompetence of some leaders\nUm and I won't be able to get to those either or but it was just I I've been going through some issues with trying to deal with sector on some things and it always bothers me when I talk to these managers and\nThey say well wait for an email response or I'll Wait for it and the second show\nWhere they are wrong and they know the wrong and you can have an another leader in that room to\nHigher ranking that debt than them that tells them hey you're wrong right and they'll say okay that are still waiting for your email and that thing is just frustrating I've been dealing with that or they said and get your email right it's because they're scared to be responsible they're not responsible individuals\nAnd like I've said before\nNot everyone but unfortunately\nUnited States border patrol continues to promote mediocrity and and I think now they're even lowering the bar they're promoting failure which is angering me but we have a lot of good leaders to and and I'm hoping that there'll be some promotions here soon on on some leaders that I\nThink are great leaders cool I Can't talk about who they are but that's my leave it at that rented my seed folks\nWe've come to the end of the show a thank you so much for listening to us thank you for I'm listening to a ... interview with Chris\nReach out to him he's a Tucson now you got you can add that extra tool to your belt that we think is very important for survival\nUntil next week though [noise]\nViews and opinions expressed in this episode are solely those of the hosts ... they do not necessarily reflect the positions or policies of the national border patrol council the United states border patrol any other government agency board this station [noise]\nCourse meal with your immune to it on that last\nOne is from the region will studio your local sushi areas where you can well darn calm day and then the other night and I are radio station\n... news alert I'm Rogers during Brett Kavanaugh expected to be sworn in this evening after vice president Mike Pence announced today's vote on Kavanaugh's confirmation the eyes or fifty\nIt's also good to review the Iranian bank account retirement accounts and for one case for updated beneficiary information is is critical because wills will not insure that your assets passed to you or your loved ones\nBeneficiary designations are the only way to ensure that assets goaded those you intend them to go to life insurance annuities for one case should all be reviewed to ensure proper beneficiary designations\nFor this reason Tony you may want your children to be the direct beneficiary of your four one K. but you may want your wife only your wife to be the beneficiary of your life insurance and or\nAny other account you may have for example okay so we want to be clear that we've planned properly in advance so after you are gone your wishes are fulfilled that screwed\nSo um anyway it's also a good to make sure that uh\nUh we've got bank account CD counts individual broker counts are also wind up and they are susceptible to probate a ... as you must have signed transfer on death designation so\nA nifty way to do that or what we're teaching our clients is to go get a an additional signature put on your checking account or savings account so add one of your children the ... the child you trust the most are the one that will be the executor or or that person you know is going to help manage the affairs if you are in the past it\nGet them added another way to accomplish that is go get a trust and have all of your checking account bank accounts and such CDs thrown into the trust then they do become probate\nThree says this kind of critical but without this feature your assets will pass through probate and be distributed according to the court instructions not necessarily your instructions\nYeah people need to know that yeah I think that's key right there and this is good information so what other steps T. J. do you encourage us to take our listeners out there to take before the loss of a spouse\nWell or a couple of steps I Would encourage people to consider taking Tony or if your spouse is a veteran\nGovernment life insurance center veterans' benefits may be available to you it's good to verify if there are any okay and uh\nAnother is to initiate important estate planning documents at the very least meet up with an attorney or a paralegal and\nAnd uh your community and hopefully most of you listening or in Tucson so meet up with someone here in Tucson at the very least you should have the will power of attorney trust guardianship for any minor children and or a\nHealthcare documents in place so once you're a state plane documents are finalized\nSelect what I Would call it a state administrator or an executive someone you trust that's responsible for following the rules of your will in the event you ah when you pass away so you should think about how your death will impact the decision making ability of that person once elected\nAnd sent copies of your state plane documents to them as your executor administrator at least make sure they're in the loop and they know where to find a guy\nAnd last ah and ah maybe most importantly it's a great idea to select a financial planner in which you and your spouse or comfortable with and this should be someone you trust to be with you for the decisions you will make for the rest of your life and the U.S that's worth triple\nAgent TJ how potentially come into the mix if you don't have one or you're not worth enough to garner someone else's attention as we said last week we want to take care of the little guy so if you're worth less than two hundred and fifty thousand dollars we are your guy we want to talk okay we can help\nWow well I think that's great and our time is just about up for this first segment of the show is there anything else that you'd like to share with our listeners before we take a quick commercial break here are\nPreparing for the loss of a spouse can be overwhelming and it doesn't have to be so so I'd like you to take a moment visit my Web site\nAT T Jay how dot com that T.

shore\nWe've been talking about protecting the surviving spouse in the event that one passes away and we've covered the probability\nOf someone living longer than their spouse which is a very high likely a probability and that the majority of lives outlive their husbands and how people can prepare for the loss of their spouse\nYeah it's been a great show so far TJ and you always have a lot of wisdom and this is important stuff that we all need to know and you mentioned in the last segment or some things we can do to prepare before the loss of a spouse what are some things we should do after the passing of a spouse\nA that's a great follow up question so there are several things so when the loss of his spouse occurs there are a whirlwind of emotions in decisions that need to be made in the last thing you want to do is worry about\nYour finances I'm a I just want to really drive this point home Tony when you've been with your spouse for an excessive thirty forty fifty years right\nYou are going to have enough grief or to last a lifetime when your spouse goes your partner goes okay and so you we do not want you to be in a position where you have to rush to make any rash decisions any major decisions involving finance is\nIn fact a lot of experts out there say they recommend taking a year before you make any major financial decisions whatsoever so therefore if that be the case\nWe want to absolutely make sure we've done the planning and and preparation so that you're not forced into a decision that you may regret later because if you haven't done the planning guess what you're going to be forced to make some decisions right now\nBurial cremation or burial you know a good paying this person paying that person getting rid of this bill getting rid of that building so far so\nBasically I Would lay it down this way Tony the first thing a person should do after the devastating loss of a spouse is to update their beneficiary information immediately after a life changing event\nBeneficiary form should be updated and reviewed to ensure that all are up to date no changes need to be made that includes your life insurance your four one K. and or your spouse's four one K. because now becomes your four one K. now his IRA becomes your IRA\nThey're a account speak their duties become your annuities so you want to update all those to\nMake sure they're going to who you choose for them to go to and uh as hard as it may be another step that uh the spouse should take is to converse on any important issues that need to be addressed this conversation could include discussing your wishes with children\nOr loved ones and or making sure you have the health care directive in case of the tragedy\nWell that's good information at great advice I think that's very important now what are some other ways that we can be prepared or or prepare for the loss of a spouse or\nAnother way I Would consider preparing as to consolidate your financial records\nI Would consider account numbers contact information Social Security numbers passwords maiden names secret keys or past votes to accessing online information also consult with the financial advisor to ensure your assets are structured to pass the maximum amount\nOf legacy to your heirs as the only living parent now your death will trigger the benefits to primary and continued beneficiaries so you don't
