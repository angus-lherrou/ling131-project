I Do really well here as well\nAnd when you're talking about the two types of apples that you had your gored door ... golden door set in an apple and\nYou can plant others to experiment experimenting is always fun always something new I have [noise]\nSeven apple trees seven different varieties well that's how I started yeah Daryl Anna's now though [laughter]\nThought they were Hannah you thought they were different and they all turned out to\nBe an is no all the other ones didn't work so I never replacing it with what area do you plan is there you go so here's\nThe thing let's talk about experimenting with fruit it's not just about the cost of the tree you\nKnow and the cost of the tree can be anywhere from forty do you know hundreds of dollars depending on what kind of true you're buying\nIt's the cost of planting it's the cost of fertilizing it's the cost of wishing the tree into production and it's the cost of time so\nMy fruit tree program is called the fruit tree the urban farm for a treat education program\nIs designed to bring the idea of\nReally growing fruit trees in your yard and I teach people how to do it I give classes called three ways to ... your fruit trees so you want to grow fruit tree I'm I've been planting fruit trees here since Nineteen Seventy four\nAnd I've discovered even this year I've discovered new things about growing fruit trees and it's for the experimenting part if you want to experiment remember there was a huge cost involved not just the cost of the tree and for me the biggest cost his time\n'cause you know if you plan to fruit tree and it never makes any fruit and you take it out five years later you just last five years\nSo all of the trees that we bring in through the urban farm for tree program because we do education this time of year and people can free or to their trees and then the trees come in in January and February and then they plant them so that's the way my program works that's the way I found works best for planting\nWe've had great success so the trees that were bringing in I've proven over and over and over and over again that they're successful so I'm a fan of experimenting but know up front there's a huge costs of experimenting be careful with it\nLast week when Jay was in and we talked a little bit about tree planting just because this is such a great time to plant I'm well\nI'm going to take issue with that but go ahead\nWell I Know exactly where you're going so we're talking a lot that conversation was was gardening you know when you go to our roots over what was it ... the stem or the leaf of Yemen goes in right now yeah ... it's a great time for planting we talked about trees and if you're going to do\nA like an evergreen that would make sense but for January planting something that's dormant on her roots die if we planted it now it might start to grow just in time to start to go into dorm and its first season\nAnd I could see it being a much better strategy planting that bear route in January in January I went to her physically dorm absolutely\nThe other thing is is that all of the deciduous trees come in at the same time here in town we get them all the nurseries kept him in from the growers in January and we got them as ... which means there's no dirt around the roots\nAnd then we plant them from there so of deciduous tree this time of year has been in a pot for ten months that sat through the summer in a pot you don't really know how healthy it is I saw some other nursery than the last week that we're in pots\nAnd they looked terrible you know it's not the kind of tree I Would be buying and planting and so that the way we bring trees in we plant deciduous trees in January they come in ... there dormant when they're harvested in California and they're brought here on a truck and then we shield them in in mulch\nAnd you come and get them and plant them best time that way there\nAnd you plant them in the ground there breaking dorm and see where they're going to live the rest of their life\nNow experimenting you've got on your avocados and tropics have you have you had any successful experimenting with those\nTropical yes in fact I pick some pie as today I actually eating pie as an ... off of my trees\nI got to mangoes that we're going to see about I've not heard of anybody growing mangoes here but we'll see and the of the three avocados that I planted two of them are dead one of them struggling so I'm not a great big fan of avocados for here no they're highly experimental\nHighly experiments on I Know are the big plant or out in California Dave Wilson ... they've got one that they're trying to ah they've got a route stock that they\nFeel they are going to have a better success than they ever have in the desert southwest with ... and and I heard that I I Know that if it takes off that will be very popular 'cause we get asked about that all the time and just do this out there if you're trying to get avocado\nPlant grown in Arizona if there is a plant or they could have won successfully do it they would because they can see yeah they're going to make some money when they can find out you get one

that the fall you went to it's going to turn into a white winner we're not going to have that in a lot of parts of Arizona at least for most of the population is\nAnd the great thing about that if you want a white winter maybe getting a ... three hours two hours out there you go up to ... to the White Mountains we've got snow and we've got beautiful sunshine does the rest of it and you go\nIt is however not the reason I moved here no my parents moved me here when I was six kicking and screaming in the back seat so I didn't have much of a choice but I Love it here [laughter] but I Love it here\nWell good and you've made quite an impact with uh the urban farm as we're talking through your rules that you've developed other her trees yeah the fruit trees what about a talk show hours\nShe'll hours yep that that's a really important one is a tag on a tree doesn't tell you the variety and tell you this chill ours don't buy it in fact I was recently at another big box store and you know there's literally hundreds and hundreds of different varieties of peaches right\nThe tag on this particular peach said peach\nThat's it that's all it said it was like you've got to be kidding me [laughter] and you know somebody's going to buy that\nHe had gone on to a a a Sanderson Ford and just as car\nRight [laughter] exactly [laughter] exactly\nSo be really conscious about what you're buying and chill hours of one of them the next piece is root stocks and in my experience of growing fruit trees here in the valley for over Thirty years I have never found sands one I've never found a dwarf rich stock\nThat does well here in the desert none of the ... route socks work none of the peaches none of the apples they just don't like the soils here\nSo early we're talking about keeping trees small an eye on my mind automatically went well he must be using a lot of doors nobody you're not you know you're just spending that much time trimming our regular sized\nExact right stuff and it you know it takes a little bit more work out front\nBut once you have controlled the size of a tree\nIt'll stay smaller for you it really does work very well and that's part of what I teach and in December will be offering\nTree pruning classes at two different locations here in the valley and you can come down and get some hands on experience and look at how we're pruning trees and you know how to prune them for size so selecting the right rich stock is really important\nOnce again another reason to plug into archery tree program is 'cause I don't bring in any trees that don't have the correct root stocks on them\nSo he's got she'll hours we've got root stocks ripening times does that go back into play with your consecutive harvesting\nKind of okay here's this nobody knows this this is a an a widely unknown piece of data that I've discovered over the past Fifteen Years by planting out dozens and dozens of fruit trees getting them to fruiting viability and finding out so I experimented a lot to\nDo what you want to know about this is that if you're planting a soft flesh fruit tree\nAll your deciduous trees so peaches apricot plums to flush ... not the nicer to flush the fruit while we're on fruit okay lash fruit so Apple's peaches apricot plums grapes\nThose trees you want to plant a variety that rape and ... and his fully off of the tree by July tenth\nOtherwise they just cook on the tree I Know I've done it\nYou know I planted an August pride peach and it's a you know after five years I ended up taking it out they just don't make viable fruits I recently had somebody and one of my classes and she said oh\nThat's why my red Baron peach which is later July ripening that's why my red parents teach never does anything has been five years and I've never had a piece I said yep that's it\nIt's not a kind of teach you want it's a beautiful beach but good luck\nAnd\nTrying to picture the urban farm you've got a great big shade tree in the back by do could you can't even put it in uh\nThe protective shade of this big pine and you know keep it preserves out\nSo there is one thing here about this some people experiment my friend jak out in or out in Tempe she's got a pink lady apple that she gets some pink lady apples off though so you can get some fruit I used to have a nice Asian pair and my front yard\nAnd I planted it Thirty years twenty eight years ago at the urban farm as a little pencil sized tree and over the course of the next ten years it grew up nicely and I would get three to Fifteen fruits ear off of it\nSo then it's just a matter of is it worth keeping it for that little amount ... or in a mental or right do we need to switch it out for something function and act\nLike produce so and pears Paris let's see here here's the ones that I don't suggest that people plant pairs and ... and cherries the threes that they just they're almost impossible so\nGive the urban farmers and other states business guy was um they can't grow citrus so we've got to exchange going on here right exactly\nSo those are my three big rules around trees no you're chill hours no you're root stocks and know when they come right 'cause that's going to have you be successful right there\nAnd most of that should be on the attack the ripening one maybe not but uh most\nWell it depends often they don't have a route stock tag so the root stocks tag is different than the fruit tree tags so you should have at least two tags on your trees\nSo take no that ... the cool thing is you can do your research we all have smartphones these days if you're sitting there looking at a fruit tree and you look at the root stocks tag and it says name a guard for peaches look\nUp name a guard for teachers in the desert and ding ding ding ding euro bonus if it's not then go to the next one go to the next one exactly you know all too my own horn just come and see me I'll give you all the free education you want a guarantee our trees supports local and helps us out\nAnd now that's not what's going on at berries today to fruit you program you sign up and there'll be delivered in January when they all get delivered like you mentioned earlier\nCorrect so the September ... through December timeframe is learning how to plant your fruit trees how to make them successful this one I Do online classes I Do in person classes I've got\nMy three ways to kill your fruit trees class coming up on line this next week I've got so you want to plan of fruit tree coming up on line urban farm dot org the front page you can sign up for those free online classes takes about an hour at a time and uh you know honestly whether you get trees from me or not you want to come and take these trees because you're going to learn a lot\nAnd in that time between now and the planting we've got time to put an irrigation get to design select which varieties and yep do all do all the free work and then when we get our trees they're ready to go on the whole exactly\nNow on those three ways to kill you've got a a note here you're going to give us a little preview on some of that [laughter] yeah\nSo there's two major ways in a minor way that I have seen hundreds and hundreds of trees killed first one is we cook them\nBack on the corner behind the in the Carlos O'Brien's okay center you know that's right on the corner there and you'll be there from nine until noon is probably one o'clock is talking about\nPre digging holes what to put in your whole so we're a big proponent of\nPre digging your whole because how many people out there raise your hand of bought trees and plants before they never get planted my hand is up by the way and if you ... your whole you determine where your trees go you predict your whole what we suggest that you do is you put forty percent native soil back in the whole\nUh you put in former Greg's planting mix which is a really nice planting mix we had as a might Mike arise and were castings in the wheelbarrow mix all that and the wheelbarrow put all back in the whole now do that now\nAnd what that does is that starts developing the micro rise of the life in the whole so that when your trees arrive in January for just a Jewish\nAnd by the way that's the best time to plant deciduous trees and when you're citrus arrived mid February all you have to do as big a quick coal drop the tree and put your woody mulch around the base and you are good to go\nWhen you had your guest from tanks green stuff up a couple Emily broadcasts ago you were talking just about the lack of organic life in the desert so so all these micro raisins and these ... these yeah I had a third one in there that starts creating the life\nYes yeah our biggest job growing food really anywhere but specifically in the desert is to build healthy soil and you build healthy soil by but putting in good stuff no we don't use any chemicals it's all natural and you're really giving the tree a limb up\n... ... ... attack you're giving a trip with him up by doing that I like that yeah\nAnd that amount of time you're not going to like you said it's a really easy dig it's not going to be re compact and yet exactly beautiful back and then the roots will do the rest from the tree once they start growing it'll just it'll keep that from turning back in the native soil yeah\nExactly and then the other really exciting thing that happens this week is a this is the end of our early bird pricing on our fruit trees and next friday and Saturday I think this November second and third\nIs the open house at the urban farm so friday morning Saturday morning we will do a B doing an open house you can come by you can see fruit trees I've got you know ... I've got deciduous I've gotten most everything growing that I sell\nAnd you'll be able to see a growing you'll be able to come and ask questions about it I'll do tours and you know it's really informative and then you can also at that moment a re purchase your fruit trees for rival in January and February\nAnd I would find out the location of that and sign up at urban\nFarm dot org up right on the front page on the right side you can go to urban farm dot org and plus my classes and the next week I'm three ways to get your fruit trees and so you want to plan of fruit tree are coming up as well\nNow I'm going through your order form here you've got ...\nOh did you so much fun you know what they are no oh it's a it's a little apple they start out at about a golf ball sized apple and you let\nThem dry on the tree and harvest them and they taste like chocolate they are the most amazing candied chocolate and you know the Jew Jew be candies didn't I mean they swiped it from the Jews you'd be trees because it's just an amazing amazing\nYou'd mentioned earlier as well cherries don't work but you've got to seven berries on here\nSeven berries berries do really well here really the ... the best berries are two different mold berries and yes there are legal to ... their yes it is legal to plant\nMold berries female mo berries here in the desert and there's the dwarf black mold Barry Bush which puts out about a dime sized absolutely incredible ... and then there's the Pakistani military which puts out a three inch long\nUh amazing buried those are my two favorite berries for growing here for the rest of them do great\nAnd we didn't even hardly covered grapes I Know you mentioned it when you were giving your soft skin example of grapes but yep three varieties of grapes yeah regularly well I've got a lot of trees but the the berries and the grapes and uh that may have to be the priority for the seeds and there you go\nTwelfth street northern from nine until noon issue today come down and see me and my crew and we'll talk to you talk with you about planting trees\nLooking ahead on the calendar as well to force Saturday November's can be Thanksgiving weekend or we're going to talking growing turkeys at the urban farm\nWell there you go now although I've done that before I'm I'm much more of a vegetarian now not\nAnd I'm sure your neighbor and appreciate not living next to live Turkey's I've got a neighbor to the west to me that has turkeys and oh when they're quiet they're quiet when they're not looking\nSo next month we're going to be talking about growing winter garden because [noise]\nReally the best time to grow here is October through June\nSkipped July August and September take a vacation you know do your winter planting but now until February is a great time to be pointing out your garden so join us next month as we talk about running a winter garden\nAnd it's been a couple of years since we had a hard hard freeze and I ...

Dennis thanks for coming down the Saturday morning thank you very much ... glad to be here\nSo let's start with windows probably the biggest thing we're going to fix the fastest there could be some other things inside the home they're breaking may not be so urgent but how do we know if it's temperature temperatures were just all\nWell first of all if it's ... it's going to break into a million little pieces who's going to be all over the place it was just a Neal glasses is going to ... maybe splinter\nAnd you'll see some splintering into the glass and sell some of them I had a falling out of but most times it's going to be very careful you can take over at ... for safety temper glass you're gonna have to break it out and kind of let it fall to the ground so you can clean it up\nAnd you'll find tempered glass around the house for the next year probably but to it because it's just breaks and such small pieces but it's considered safety glass and that's the most important\nThing and the reason that safety glass is because they're because when a breaks it blows up into little tiny pieces and it just ... their skin if it hits you and it doesn't cut you like a regular class with as opposed to these big heavy discharge that fall down on and on and get\nFeet like Bruce Willis you know so that breaks if it's tempered were just reprint it up I'm recalling the glass shops that writes temper if it's not tempered and it's still all in place tape it and it tape it\nYou can tape it up you can keep everybody away um sometimes it'll it'll fall out you just got to be very very careful when you called the glass company we can come in at least helped get things tore apart and cleaned up\nSo once you've got it cleaned up to have to put a whole new window and can I get individual glass squares that can go back into the censor\nWell in today's world we live in the world of insulated glasses to two panels ... an outside panel in an inside with the space from between so normally see outside panel that's broken so you're still secure in the house so you don't have to jump around trying to find something right away\nYou call your glass company they come out and they measured\nNine times out of ten and what will happen is that they will order a brand new panel\nThey'll come back after they get it back from the factory and they'll come back and put it in a ... that's the best way to do that that way as a factory they can clean both inside panels with are nice and clean for ... before they seal it and then you you don't have any problems after\nAn unsealed anybody that's had condensation between their windows they know what an unsealed duo pain looks like a big foggy ness\nDoes sometimes it looks like a fish bowl of compensation\nOkay so that's taken care of the class but on those panels especially the ones that move up and down pretty prone to some other maintenance issues there well\nThis ... you know in the fall in the spring all of a sudden you go out to open your window because you like to some nice cool air to come in the open the window and it just fault the window just fall straight down\nThe window hasn't gone bad it's just the balance or is that keep the window up have gone bad the springs broken the clips of broken something's happened\nAnd so nothing that's you have to take a lot of time to do you discover glass company out they'll tear the window apart take the balance or see what kind they are put the window back together so you lose your house is sealed\nAnd they order 'em and come back out in a few days and put them back in\nAnd something you started recently just because of the amount of repair she'll do with windows is that the ... they don't have a long lifespan they're affordable they do a great job in their their five ten years Arizona son south west side and nothing would survive out there and that's a problem\nThe screens all of a sudden get a little terror in the bugs are rolling in and most people say I don't really have time to go out and get new screens they like to take their screen to are like a glass shopping when are glad that we have a screen shot there that we screen for you using your existing frame and that surge saves you a little bit of money we can do it in a few days\nNow real quick there are still a number of old single pain window still out there that haven't been replaced from the seventies and sixties and fifties is that an easy fix or is that your tipping point that hey it's time to upgrade to New Delhi we\nYou know there there are a lot of old single pain when is out there we used to work on them to fix a lot of um um the the sliding window you're able to take that out very easily and bring it into the shop and we can repair for you right there at the shop and give it right back to within twenty thirty minutes\nOn the stationary as little more difficult to tear it apart so most of the time we come out to repair that All right there in the field will come out measure the glass you can cut the grass and the side of the truck but it back in the frame and you're we're off\nAfter ... and go everyday everybody's happy\nThat statement made me think of something I wanted to talk about it to a beginning of the segment we said cut the class classes a liquid sorry you're really cutting [laughter]\nYeah you're actually putting a score on the glass and then you put a score and then you can either put a pencil something underneath and you can break the glass\nHalf I I Need to see a clash factor 'cause I always wonder how do they take sand and make it a liquid glasses sand and it's a liquid but you see through how how is this possible [laughter] it's\nPut into a big molten that in the weather does is that as the glass as the ... and comes off the flow goes onto the float line\nIt comes off at about sixty feet a second is running pretty fast as it comes off they're putting more into the into the vet to keep the level of a glass of the ... at a certain height\nAnd as that goes along the molten comes across at different sicknesses and as it does it cools and as it cools it clears and as you get it out there they got laser cutters cutting as fast as they can to stack it and get things going\nHow long does it take that process for that than to hit your shop\nWell for us I mean I'm depending on where it's manufactured ... it was manufactured in the United states um we have a distribution center here in town and they get they get glass delivered every day so we can get cases the glass as we need them so it takes about ... about three weeks\n[laughter] I I Love industry and and the supply chain of things that we'll think about it and take for granted in our daily lives until something breaks and then what\nYeah but you know it's it's one of those things you want to go to 'em and and watch on TV but they never put that that kind of stuff on TV for you to watch how you make class you know where's Mr Rogers when you these\nWhere is he [noise] so let's go inside the home ... glass tables class shower doors\nWe do a lot of glass shelving people or redecorating constantly they've got new things going on we do a cheerio cabinets or people should come out from other parts of the country out to Arizona material Kevin shelves break\nMake a lot of those shelving or and nowadays it's there there's the heavy thick glass and everybody's putting 'em ... and things on top of that and really screws up their bar areas and stuff\nCould make it very well could be is it only at the kitchen faucet\nYes yeah um yeah what what okay well what\nYou see I'm I'm suspicious that it is just the faucet okay and you could test that by the U.S connecting the hot side underneath the counter okay and crack the valve on the wall\nAnd fill a bucket and just see if if it does if it does it not if it does it that way this is something that just recently started yet yeah it's probably the faucet if it's not the faucet that we developed a something has changed maybe in the way the pressure at the house\nAnd we may have to go to like a little mini arrest or mounted right there underneath the kitchen sink which is really easy to do a and that limits the air hammer that causes that that that's the vibration inside the pipes\nBut try it with the angles stopped valve and a bucket see if it does it if it doesn't then you're probably going to just replace the faucet and be all set [noise]\nLet's see if we bring Nancy ended the conversation Nancy\nMorning calling from Phoenix good morning\nMy mother and living in a house that has a son getting living room and we would like to cover that in so that it's even with the rest of the flowering around it that we don't know what the best process\nYou know when you get a couple of guys out there and take a look at it you may get a guy or two that tells you\nLet's just put some too by sixes are too by eight down and put plywood on top of that to bring it up flush we don't like that method at all Nancy it's been putting would\nDown below grade it ... it creates a condition conducive for termite infestation\nIt's much much better or what we do is we go in there and we cut the sheet rock up above the floor 'cause right now as you step down and living in the sheet rock goes down all the way to the floor\nWe chock a line and we cut that and we get it completely out of there and then there's generally little offering strips\nThat are mounted on the ... we have to get those out of there\nAnd then we filled the whole thing with ABC's ill and four and a half inches a concrete uh and then the electrical receptive goes around the outside perimeter of the house probably have to be raised 'cause you don't want the electrical receptacle two inches above the ground you know above the British more grow\nAnd if you measure the room I can tell you to do it right what we like to do before we do all that is we go in and we termites treat underneath that whole area because once you didn't have\nFour inches of concrete four inches at ABC four inches a concrete is four inches ABC sometimes that area can be hard to to treat should termites ever come\nSo we saturate the area which are my pre treat that we put in a B. C. that were put into concrete would cut the sheet rock we raise all the electrical receptor goes patch the ... patch the drywall get ready for painting and then you can put whatever for cover you want in there when you were done\nGenerally speaking if you measure the room\nYou're going to be between twenty and thirty dollars a square foot to do that right\nAnd then what about letting the concrete care like how does that\nWork out that's a great question [noise]\nThat'd be great well generally what we do because that's a lot of humidity inside the house because as a creek cures people\nPeople calling curing it's really not curing its hydrated you're you're off gassing a ton of humidity and we generally just put some fans in there we don't blow the fans right onto the concrete surface we point them up into the room just to keep the air circulating\nThat accelerates it a little bit you might consider having this done before your mom lives in ah yeah and and and then within a within a couple of days you're pretty good shape what for covering would your mom what back down when it's done\nPutting carpet down\nOkay we'll carpet can go back down generally after about four or five days if you're going to go with ... we have to wait a little bit longer than that\nOkay and you have any company to recommend\nAt where is the house Nancy\nI'm the next thirty Fifth Avenue in Dallas area\nYeah I uh I Believe a T WD would do that Kirk development would do it both rosy certified ... hours and rosy remodeling we do it we do it fairly often so it any one of those three companies\nAre depending on how busy the other guys are this is this kind of consider a smaller job\nAnd depending how busy they are they may or may not be able to get to it the Rosie loves small jobs if if I could just do small jobs that's all I Would do a ... you get in you get it done and you go to the next one\nThese jobs that you go on and you're there for six or eight or nine months\nI Do I get a little Democrats get worn out there right okay and let me ...\nAnd that's it you can just dial this same number you dial to call the radio show just dial that number during the week and let them know you you want somebody to come out and take a look at it until in the do you all have keys to the house yet\nI'm now it's about three weeks out and then she was going to do some of the um changing out of things before she actually ...\nYeah okay we'll just call that the number that puts you in touch with Rosie remodeling Monday through friday and we'll send somebody out measured up or you can give you a specific written detail\nOkay well thank you so much\nSo you're saying yeah you bet that's who we appreciate it okay\nYou know as a a little rosy remodeling company uh we're looking for good people\nIn the business and you want to make a step up in your career\n\n\nYou're buying or selling home I don't have to tell you what\nWould I Do have to morning on the walls of the homeless veteran and let me tell you shall not all homeless ...

truth that's why you know there's different there's different techniques for ... straight lines you know you can use water levels um you can use lake water love it yeah water levels basically a PVC two\nI'm twenty to thirty feet long filled with water and water six at some level so you can hold one end up at the elevation you want to create the the line or the graphic take the other end\nAnd it'll find its you know she seek level with itself and then you can basically just you know go from there and establish should get straight wind and you can make hash marks every three to four feet to ensure that you are following a good line lasers or an easy way\nYou know thirty forty dollar laser uh one of the hardware stores or something you get a good good wine out of that too so\nAnd once the tape is on we've got to make sure we've got a good bond I've even seen guys that will go behind and\nPut a little little tiny beat of Koch right on the edge and today the old school\nWay yeah and that's that that's still a something that's necessary on some of the ... or more heavily textured surfaces\nSo the the tape that has the product on the backside that moisture activated works very well on some of the smooth surfaces you push the edge down and you get a good tight seal and then once the paint hits it um the product activates and he ended up with a good ...\nUm you know heavy ... you know textured surfaces that are a little more heavy in in nature that's the way you'd you'd run the tape you don't need the special tape for that you use regular masking tape\nAnd then you take a um some talking running along that edge take a wet sponge kind of melt that talking in a little bit seeing barely see the tape edge\nAnd then you paint it and the trick is that you pull it while it's wet um if you let the paint dry sometimes the the the paint bond is stronger and you'll end up feeling are fraying that tape it so the trick to that is\nAs you as you're painting that you pull it a rate immediate ... ... or no or if that does you put on\nWeight it on much yeah yeah now what about the tape with I never liked anything over and she and a half maybe to those those three and four inch actually seems\nTo come or something we have what's the purpose of this super\n... yeah there's a there's times where um\nFor instance having two inch tape\nIs a more practical way of protecting a space such as in between casing and an um an an adjacent wall that perhaps has an accent color or something like that and I'm trying to do with paper or free hand you know a cutting it in as a a good option\nAnd uh so you can just run in our appropriate with a tape down that particular strip\nGenerally speaking you want to I'm just use a um the smallest with\nAh as as is necessary to accomplish a good bond in between the area to try and protecting the adjacent area you're painting\nAnd then use a paper on I'm asking machine with that tape is a good way to just kind of run an apron if you will of protection of such as base board or something like that where you would run a um masking machine and then slide your drop caught up underneath that you're in good shape\nAnd on your masking machine it's a hand tool that has\nA a spot you put your tape on and then it comes around and it connects to\nEither role of paper or all of plastic do you have a preference on paper plastic or when you use one versus the other uh well they have what's called ...\nSeventy two and Ninety six inch masking film comes in roles like the paper does\nWhat that's a designed to do is if you had a large area of wall of let's say that you needed to protect 'em\nAnd you were a going to be rolling the ceiling next to that wall\nUm it's a lot easier to use the ... film um because it dispensers like ah the paper does\nAnd then you basically just unfolded down to the um Seventy two or Ninety six inch whichever you know uh Rowley button and it's a real easy way to cover a large amount of wall surface very quickly versus holding up you know ... plastic disc clean and trying to tape and\nAnd get that into place um the paper is something they usually use like an apron I'm Around in areas such as base board and sliding a drop crop up underneath it\nThat way you don't have to um mask\nA uh a lot of flooring or something like that and it's a good way to to just have some good protection anywhere from four to six feet out off of the wall um they do have some different um a a paper products for the masking machines\nThey have regular paper which is a good for general purpose uses\nUm if you're worried about any kind of material\nUm leaking through the paper and being absorbed by the paper they have the green a paper and that um will prevent any moisture in the ... the product from actually being absorbed and and reaching through the paper and to the foreign\nAnd just to give anybody a good perspective a when they're working on their own paint project for a professional how much time or your crew spending masking protecting versus physically applying the paint\nIt's that's a great question I'm\nAs a general rule ah if you were ... interior rooms in your in your house or something like that about sixty five Seventy percent of your time is spent in either cover protection or prep of the surfaces\nAnd then the remaining amount twenty to twenty five applying and five percent cleaning up\nUm one tool or masking tool that I think really was a very smart if you're painting doors how much time if you wasted but that little blue tape trying to get it around the curve edge of the hands have you seen\nThe door hinge it's designed to just go straight over the metal plate you don't have to sit there mold your tape around yes yes uh well\nI I'm a I'm a proponent of actually pulling the hardware off um I think in the end you end up with a with a better a finished product as it moves into that more to Syria where were the hinges are bad at\nUm you had to be real careful it the hard wears off and you're using a roller to not leave a bunch of paint product they're you know just have to cut it out sure to get that hinge plate to fit flushing yeah yeah\nThat's right and and a lot of times to to just kind of help that out what I'll do is take the screws that pulled from the hinge um and then I'll tape 'em right to the more to stereotype\nThe gym that will prevent them from getting you know uh any kind of build up there\nYou know take a razor blade as well before you re fast and the hinge and just clean that little edge up with a razor blade pretty quickly\nOr

apps were from men you paint manufactures none of them were independent of manufacture correct did they all restrict your options to their own color we'll [noise]\nUm yeah they all kind of suggests that their own colors you know for example when you use that the done at a word that they provide you with John Edwards colors and and they're special names for their colors\nWhich makes sense it's not like they've got to other companies color we'll probably program in their\nTheir software but and both regards I mean the the variations and the the look of color probably most human eyes couldn't pick out right yeah you've got quite a selection with both ah both companies so how does it work last\nSo I tested out these sure when Williams color snapped okay and so basically you you open it up\nAnd you have a few options on what you want to do you can either take a picture of whatever room you're standing in and say you already have a color in mind that you want to use it you know the PIN number the name you can look that up apply it and you click on who I'm your finger just right on the wall and it will completely apply that color you are and all\nI have my smartphone I'm standing in my kitchen right and\nI've got a a solid wall okay you know the ... behind me my walls over here got a little Nick over there so I've I've got my smartphone and rode the white right now okay I have a way I'd take a picture or I Will take out you'll take a photo\nWill just that's the thing about the sure when millions out there's two ways to do it actually I can do it in real time as they call it there I'm\nLike you're reading a cue are coated it takes a picture yeah it'll ... it'll yeah\nAudie up that automatically recognize through your camera different surfaces and it'll let you know services you know I've been recognized tap a color to paint the surface\nAnd when you use that they believe it's called in to pay\n'em the color of the quality of the colors are so great when you just take a picture and I think that has to do with the real time loading colors ... can get a little bit pixilated when you move the phone\nOkay but it does give you a good real time you know you can sort of do A Panoramic move the phone around and see how the colors were especially if you're in a larger room\nBut then you also have the option of just take a photo and\nIf you have a color in mind you plug and play and see what you like\nAnd so you're just changing the color on that wall on your phone to see what it looked like until you're happy\nRight and then you know say you don't know the color and they have another feature there which is a they call it picture match or explorer color and\nYou take a photo of anything you hit okay and the app itself will recognize it and pop up little blurbs with each different shade and the names and so say you have a maybe a plant outside or rose and you really like to call it you can actually take a photo and see if they have something that closely matches up\nPaint color that would match the rose to bash the inside of color you're looking to fill in your home\nRight yeah they got something close to it you'll you'll get a result for that\nAnd does it offer multiple results or do you have to like didn't go in and say here's the result I found on your app can have your ... and see color shades on either side of it\nIt actually will let you it'll show you the exact color he looked at and then you do have options to go through that picture or that particular few that range of colors whether you know from start to light\nSo can you say the roses dark red you can go all the way to maybe violet to pick you know show you that sort of range between colors\nNow this is all been color selection is that where the app ends or can look at this wall and do that it's twelve feet wide eight feet tall so it calculate your square foot and how much pain product you need\nUnfortunately no it does end with just the or the color selection but I bet you that's coming yeah do you pitch that to their marketing to enjoy the game that I did I\nGive 'em away dollar idea alive [laughter]\nJust handing out idea [laughter] that's the Sherman Williams at Gen John Edwards work the same way I'm\nPretty much it's a little bit more limited than these showing Williams apso or done other words they have the ... to color at a and I have an Android so I went to the Google Play store and I just started typing John Edwards\nOkay that's a great Lance was this on iPhone or Android that wasn't Android both of these have been injured okay yeah so you're the only two and the officer on and [laughter] probably I think I should have something like that three oh Jerry guy again\n[laughter] um so uh you know go to the the play store um they started typing and John Edwards and I've done other words into color apples what popped up right away\nAnd as a suggestion and when you go to install it it does have a couple of permissions on like at once access to your photos on than your camera but it uses that like the ... and you point your camera at\nA color or at a you know like we are saying that on a bloom perhaps you have a beautiful purple Bush outside and you really want that purple and you can point the camera at that Bush and it will pick up the different colors um so when you're in the app", "show_name": "Rosie On The House",
