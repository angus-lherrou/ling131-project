enough to get your winter rye grass to to germinate and establish\nProbably haven't needed water anything should not probably you should you don't you haven't had to\nDid you plant winter lawn I Know you've done a lot of American over an artificial turf run his artificial my back is still I mean I'm going to keep regular grass and I have not done it yet\nI kind of made a vow of this year and of course this was the year you should have put it in earlier [laughter] but the last you know for ten or Fifteen Twenty years it stayed warm so long I thought you know I'm not even gonna do it till last weekend 'til Halloween weekend\nI should try and do the front yard so it was up an established by Halloween 'cause kids walk across that mhm\nWell that's not an issue anymore so the backyard I Will do next weekend\nI always have a plan\nAnd it revolves around the kid's birthday to do a lot of our parties outside and riding lawn and right we've got a may birthday so I Try and keep the rye green until okay a pad member that has the birthday and then we've got another birthday in September so we try and make sure we've got\n... you know we we don't shut the water after the Bermuda too early yeah\n[noise] I I haven't water that lawn\nIn six weeks and it's greener than it was any point of this summer when I was like every other day that that's the other thing that's frustrating to as you work hard all summer trying to get your laundry recover from the transition from rug rats and finally about\nThe end of September it's awesome looking their Bermuda just beautiful and it's not growing that much you don't even have to mow is green slush doesn't grow that much don't have to water it much like why go over why go scout but I'm going to wait and you know if if people that are listening are worried about\nBeing too late to oversee no not at all I mean you can you could technically do it all winter it once we get really cold we started getting frost in the morning or that cold\nIt can be pretty slow to germinate but you can still get it to germinate I'm not advocating you wait till I figure a way that long you might as well just not do is what I'm\nI think actually early November late late October early November is probably the best time to do it anymore because what happens invariably\nPeople scouts or Bermuda\nAnd they plan through Congress with the Bermuda doesn't stay dormant\nIt grows back especially with all this rain so yeah that rug rats came out great\nBut it's still warm enough the room you just wanting to grow so it can be it grows back up and kind of mixes in with the ride grass then what happens when we do get that first frost all to Bermuda does go dormant and you look out and go oh\nYeah I've got this all whole bunch of brown stuff in my law on the other thing that we do is we really stress that Bermuda grass lawn by making it by cutting that short in introducing this competitor right in right on top of it the shades it out crowds at out takes and nutrition away from it\nBefore it's wanting to go dormant on the other end of that when it comes time to transition we've had this long that's been stressed out and now it's trying to recover and come back\nIn crowd this competitor out in a struggle to do that so I think that that too early over seeding in the fall contributes to our struggles with transition late in the spring and early summer\nSo if you haven't done it it's not too late but and you'd mentioned all winter long but what I notice is\nIt's hard to find if you wait too long well you might want to buy the seat absolutely good point if you wait too long I mean you know eventually they quit bringing an end quit straw shocking that um you can't they don't carry rug rats down here in the valley all win\nYou know through the end of the spring they want to be out so not a bad idea to go get the seed have it on hand and I always get a little extra because you're going to house spots that don't come up the way you want him to spots maybe or maybe something happens during the year the lawn you got a water break or water thing you've got to dig up\nKind of nice to have five or ten pounds or ride grass seed\nYou know keep it dry keep it out of the ... you know out of the moisture in if you don't ever use it use it next fall and keep ten pounds back on to that seat it doesn't go bad unless it gets wet but uh not a bad idea to have a few extra pounds around\nLet's guitar calls we've got 'em lined up at one triple eight seven six seven for three four eight that's when ... rosy for you starting with Jack welcome to the program\nHey well thank you guys are you taking my call um I have a youthful live oak tree in my front yard that wonderful shade and I love the tree the problem with it is it has a\nDroppings I guess now I got probably close to a hundred little many trees growing underneath that are in Iraq and the grass is well\nI'm trying to figure out how to get rid of those things without killing everything else around that\nWell you can you know obviously you can pull them\nUm that that's probably the safest solution to that um if they are seedlings if you're getting them from acorns dropping off the oak tree and their sprouting you could kill them with you know just just go up to each little individual one with\nA little round up and just take a paintbrush and just gathered on each one of them full strength\nUm if they're coming off the root system right at the base of the tree off the trunk you know I wouldn't do that because then there's potentially damaging\nYou know the main tree but if you've just got seedlings coming up and you're very careful you just take I just take a a bottle of full strength glass is eight and a little like a little hobby paintbrush\nAnd just dabbled on the news is ... ... you just don't want to go spraying doesn't just wasting the product if you get it on the ground anyway it doesn't really hurt that ... anything but just to be environmentally safe and to be careful and then I get it where you don't want to get a gist dabbled on there and that should take\nCare of it perfect thanks so much I appreciate it You're welcome we appreciate the call

Hartford\nAbout anything or your landscape gardening irrigation Theresa welcome to the program how may we help you\nAnd thank you um I live in dark finance and on the north side of my house the whole side of the north side acted out at ten by twenty area a year ago April when I had moved in I planted some thought I got from\nHome Depot was flying over the last fall wet or dry grass that was my next summer the grass came back but I Do have a pack so it was a little catchy when I guess when she does on the on the grass\nOn that later on this summer it just died and happened that happens the day it's total shit from my house\nSo I'm trying to figure out your age is that grass can even come back is right now I have this tiny little bits of regular Bermuda grass just died off I don't know if I could plant back here to help it come back next year for the regular grass there should just overseas with dry again\nAnd it my grass not going to come back here in the summer\n[noise] yeah I I don't think your grass is coming back I think what really happened is your Bermuda never really did come back in ... in about mid summer when the monsoons kicked in and the nighttime temperatures didn't cool off what you had there was probably mostly ride grass and it finally died\nA minute shady so it's going to hang on longer the Bermuda just not going to do well because of shady so the rug rats dominates it it's stays alive all summer until we get you know warm temperatures at night\nI'm so couple of ideas for you one would be I Would go ahead and plan a rug rats lawn\nAnd enjoy it and try and keep it alive probably as long as you can you could supplement that with ... next spring I Would I Would do it\nEarlier march April I wouldn't wait till may or June ... doesn't like hot weather really either it's more heat tolerant\nThan ... than Iraq grasses um but you'd want to probably you could actually so it with the rug rats and mix it in if you want it to 'em or you could wait until like ... spring and and do it then make just throw it in with Iraq grass\nBut regardless of what you do I think that the Bermuda\nThis is just sounds like us to shady and it's just not going to\nWork All right ...\nThank you so much You're welcome we appreciate the call has to be clear line that opens the line for you one triple eight seven six seven for three four eight that's AAA rosy for you Jackie welcome to the program\nIt mining um I have a question about in Oakland deal we had one that was about that I get ten to twelve years old\nAnd um every spraying it would leave out beautifully it last spring um about a quarter of it became did not leave out the rest of the plant dead and then um I don't know what was happening and can you tell me what what killed in Oakland deal\n[noise]\nHard to say um you know it could be just drought related to water it at all\nUm if it's really they really really hot and dry didn't have a a minefield we got a lot of rain we got we got plenty of water all we've got a thick feather Okla Theo that receive the same amount of water so I Know they were doing All right\nYeah and if it's going to say if it's not least out right now it probably isn't gonna I mean the ... and ...\nBeautiful what happened was when the ... the one of the last stories that we've got um we got up in the morning and um it it it completely shared off at ground level the roots didn't that route it this year it off at ground level and the whole thing just wound up collapsing okay well\nYou know it sounds like the one of the things that could have caused that is if it originally was planted maybe too deep in the ground\nAnd in soil got up higher on the the canes than it should have it's possible that it could have rotted overtime and causing those gains to die and then like I said when you got a strong wind it just they just fell over\nThat that would be my best guess is that something\nLike that would have taken ten twelve years for that the average\nPossible yeah yeah it's possible I\nI don't I don't have another I don't really have another good option a solution for you other than you know quite frankly in in nature some things just die and it just causes a natural thing once it's started dying other tissue around it might have continued to\nAh to rot or go away or or be damaged and and that just kind of kept spreading but it sounds to me perhaps like a like maybe a ... ... when it when it blew over what did the ... would\nLook like when you picked up the canes where it was connected to the to the base of the root\nAnd they were driving stamped it we're not green inside or anything\nYou know what is it kinda hollowed out on the inside was it do you even remember\nWhat it was you know I I Want to say that they would on the inside but it just dried out yeah\nI you know don't really know that I could tell you exactly what happened\nBut ... does seem to be a pretty hard slant to\nUh uh one of the harder plants to really care and manage for well what's ... bullet proof you know you don't have to do anything to them I'm trying to get new ones established and that's part of just how they're marketed in sold yes or a guy goes to probably Texas digs them up\nHowever long it takes to fill a truckload of um dug up puts them on a big flatbed truck drives them across the desert\nStops at various nurseries in town download and they just stack them up and sell them well that still works in some cases in fact you see old ranch is that ... offenses were these would break the canes off stick them in the ground and and they start growing but I think the biggest problem is just the fact\nThat they've been out of the soil we've ... we've remove most of the root system\nAnd uh and they haven't been\nCaring for the best and they'd be hydrate and they just don't they aren't able to reestablish themselves a lot of those native plants to they will\nSeem to have a way to manage the water and you know they might die off or a limb might die Ira and they put a new sprout on no that's exactly that's exactly right so under stress they survive by just shutting down\nI I Need to have rosy come just with his chain so I've got to where we probably have I had done account but there's a couple of dozen native\nA mosquito ... he's on the property that ah you know just to have grown there and two of 'em\nI've I've gone to cut down a couple of times and I'm All right this thing's finally debt we get a rain like to send an explosion [laughter] yeah it's a bit there in a horrible spot known they need to get\nI mean they're not they're not as slow as a lot of people want to make them out to be unnecessarily but a lot of times are better stronger\nMore durable trees are a little slower growing a lot of times the reason that ... break and blow over and have the problems they have is they grow too fast or we you know we we stimulate them to grow too fast water them too much we push them\nI'm so I'd still not talk you out of a pistachios maybe you want to start a little bigger than than than you would with some other type of tree but it's a heck of a tree live oak same way not not terribly slow not the fastest\nGreat sturdy tree I Love um Chinese film\nUm those those are probably my three favorites right there Chinese um red push stash in live oaks and ... the live oaks evergreen the red push is to sit on my than than the ... the elm is the semi deciduous as well yeah so it's just a matter\nThen at that point and decided he want winter shade as well or do you want that to open up for a little warmth and the correct the cooler I won't say cold in Arizona and I know that yeah the cooler\nMonths right as we're talking through planting those trees how do you get started on on trees and shrubs\nWell right now the reason is such a great time to plant is that you know the soil is is still relatively warm\nAnd the Arabs cooling in the days are getting shorter\nSo you can you can plan a plant in the roots are going to continue to grow because that it's almost like an incubator the soils warm but you won't get a lot of stress on the foliage because it's not hot there not transpiring so much\nSo you get this condition whether the plant is routine and establishing itself without putting on a lot of growth\nA on a lot of new foliage a lot of thing and it it's cooler you know how to water them as much it's just a lot easier to transplant instead of it when it's a hundred degrees out and you're having to water 'em twice a day or you know every day and you miss one and the plant Wilson stresses and get some sun burn on it\nAnd kind of goes backwards a little bit Anya\nThis time of year you want and then what will happen is as it continues to cool the plant will leave in slow down or stop routine the soil will will be cool enough and it looked like the plant just sitting there all winter and come spring\nInstead of trying to plan a new plant then we've got a plant that's already rooted in established at least underground and the the new growth just explodes so it's it's virtually like gaining a whole year by planting three or four months ahead of time\nWhen we're digging that whole how far past the ... he's talking about the biggest one\nI don't you realize how can you can actually buy one if he wants to but you know that's fine so what what you wider is better and wider you know I don't know that you go to why'd\nYou certainly want to go wide enough that you can get\nThe the container in the ground and then get the container off you know ... too tight you're not going to be able to get the the box offer or the container that it's in we certainly don't want to go any deeper and maybe not even quite as deep it's better for the plant to be a little shallower so that you ... you have kind of a crown\nSo to speak and certainly where the what we call the route flare or the Trump comes down and then there should be a little bit of a flare out where it meets the soil that needs to be or finished grade\nOkay so that needs to stay up at least finished our little higher I get to be a little higher because invariably soil settles or sinks a little bit then it doesn't you know soil around it doesn't cave in on it and that gives you a good area to put a couple of inches a mole then you can ... yes if you get a little higher than you can you can mulch around it\nWhich I think is critical especially during the summer months uh don't put the landscape rock right up against the trunk of the tree hold it back put some bark mall shredded\nBark something organic around it um you know even a you know shameless plug but Hickman compost around it\nOr something to to help cool the roots hold moisture it'll control weeds like John Eisenhower was talking about mulching and composting last week on the show and it it does exactly all of that so controls weeds stabilizes the moisture even the moisture out\nAnd reduces the stress that you have sometimes in the summer with a plant getting overheated or transpiring and losing too much moisture\nAnd your quickly talking about this is the time to save water it takes a lot less water to get an established right or if you plan to do this\nSpring and it's going into the heat season you're in a all this additional water not ordering relentlessly a Saturn dealership help it survive that's correct\nA better establish tree is it going to require as much water to keep it living through the summer or something you just planted going into not to say we can't do it not to say it doesn't happen and we there's people in ... landscape cruise construction buildings that have to play it when they have to you know but\nIf you have your choice you your whole motor and you're thinking about planting\nSome stuff coming up and you can do it the next couple of months are the best\nThey are the best and it's a beautiful time to be out there anyway up so this is what brings us to Arizona I was ... certainly rather be digging holes from now through February as opposed to march April May and June when you're just\nSweating lock a dog out there trying to get holes Doug so you know I was still people if if it's comfortable for you the plants are going to love it [laughter] very true very true and you're\nA big proponent of not ness of starting with a smaller tree as opposed

today\nYou know when\nWe see it so many times somebody goes to sell a home and they dumped all kinds of money in it to\nGet it to a condition that's ready to sell and so many times that just wasted money because if you look at the statistics of what a new home buyer does first one they move into the home\nA lot of it is counterproductive do we do to sell the home whether it's new flooring new paint new countertops things to make it pretty shiny flashy\nWell so much of our buying motivation is location location location there is a great chance that the new home owner coming in behind you is it going to like the color you have isn't going to like the flooring selection you've made and it's going to replace the stuff that you may have\nA just invested ... thinking that you're going to get your money back on to hire a ticket item for your home and it just it it doesn't work [noise]\nUh so if we can operate live in our home we're we keep it clean and consistent will maintain and that you could know that you could put that on the market at any minute and get um [noise] a a high dollar value for your home well\nThat's just going to make your home\nMore valuable that is going to make your quality of life more valuable because you're not going to be living in a home that you're a stuck to to constantly fixing and maintaining because we've let all these things go for a number of

economy\nI don't feel we're doing as well as we could be doing I'm not really concerned I I think that people you know can panic and things that are cyclical people calm down\nThings that the Republicans normally support like free trade are not are kind of in doubt so that's putting a lot of pressure the economy's in\nJust when we had got an unemployment down to under three percent and now all of a sudden growth will stop because investors have lost faith we should all be concern\nThat is really some real worry there for the real estate market\nI've seen the facts of the real estate

wrongdoing\nMeantime a former FBI special agent was sentenced to four years for leaking classified defense information attorney general Jeff Sessions says the Justice Department is conducting perhaps the most aggressive campaign against leaks in history\nBut some journalism organizations are raising the alarm the head of the freedom of the press foundation Trevor Tim says a crackdown on leaks is a

them and instead of creating something uh that we're not having to become software developers which I really wasn't interested in but I knew that that was the direction we had to go here's already the people that have the technology we've got the concept let's bring it together and make it work\nAnd one of the features that this home does\nIt'll help inventory what's in your home if you're a to for insurance claims burglary whatever the case may be\nA it'll help your manager projects if you've got a window replacement going on if you're working on roofing and it'll keep a log of all the work and records it's done so it's kind of like a\nYou know you've got the blueprint to build the house but after that did what how do you track everything that happens to it will this\nHome maintenance at ... is the answer for that we feel and what I'm most interested in is the maintenance aspect of it because that's something that\nYou know it's kinda like a car you might have one thing wrong and you can live with that you live four or five things go that turns into six or seven things\nTurns into more things and it becomes very difficult to get all of those accomplished a effectively costs like ... you know if we just keep up with that one at a time but there's no right way every homes different\nUh the building materials different how we live in ... different\nHow we use the homes are different the amount of people that are in it are different there's no like manual to\nThe home you can qualify for the lone move in and and then what well\nThis tool helps you manage your home and somebody new

and being able to give you a projection that here's when you can expect to replace your roof and here's what you can expect to pay so you can start planning for those big investments so you're not hit with these unprepared\nOr whether it's time or financially\nTo spend Fifteen thousand dollars on a new roof\nTen thousand dollars on a new air conditioning and those are average price is not even average price I got hate quoting price 'cause I'm not involved in the price world and uh there's\nThere's new air conditioning systems being put in high efficiency super seer replacing the duct work that are in the twenty thousand dollars now it's worth the investment and long term for the comfort of the home but I mean who who's got twenty Jim yeah twenty thousand dollars later on front air conditioning\nCenter right now [laughter] [laughter] I Wish I did [laughter]\nOh man and and if you had twenty thousand laying around is air conditioning the first thing you think I'm going to spend it on\n... no no but if you're a conditioning went out today you'd find twenty thousand [laughter] how does it get it out [laughter] a shaken Bush's should check into money treat us right [laughter] how are we going to get this replaced so it's\nIt's a way we can take did technology and\nHome maintenance emergent together uh and bring it to the Arizona homeowner so we're really excited about it right now we're talking about a whole maintenance item we've ... brought a gym and from about blind cleaning you are really a a kind of a\nOne of a kind it's not like a when you go to the register contractors website and you select air conditioning\nYou get thousands of air conditioning contractor correct you're such a specialty unit a licensing this and performance does a little bit about your specialty and then we'll walk through what homeowners can do\nA for their the maintenance of their window treatments\nBecause that's it doesn't seem like it that's a big ticket\nYes it is a big ticket out in um my company started in Nineteen Ninety five\nAnd what happened was that I walked into hunted Douglas and to get a part to fix for customer and the gentleman told me there that are on A Douglas just put the navy behind a school that people want to be a professional in this business and I so\nAnd ah he gave me the information and then two weeks I was in quarter learning how to hold\nA training for hunting Douglas window coughing so I've been going to school every since then because it does have new products come out every year so somebody have to know how to restore the bat close to the original\nCarla and this is one of those services that are and and as it relates to maintenance that if you maintain your window treatments\n...\nYou're you're at a fraction of replacement costs\nDefinitely definitely is a is a big savings and a half of them are restored than buying a new Juno which a lot of people spend a lot of money and they want to know how they can have a professional restore and that's what we do\nIt's not unrealistic either to ... to to see a home where they spent more on the treatments than they did the actual windows themselves correct\n[laughter] yes uh some of the windows or a can cost up to three thousand dollars or more and uh we have restored those type of when the companies had been up over ten to Fifteen\nYears and those three thousand dollar window treatments are covering an eight eighty eight hundred dollar window [laughter]\n[laughter]\nWe we by the window so we can see out and we put sunscreens on the outside to keep coming out that we put ... treatments on the inside for privacy at night to closer for decorative reasons or whatever right windows inexpensive function of the home\nYes yes they are and are they are a good energy efficient to ah when you buy a type of window coverings on your home\nSo looking at a sitting in my kitchen right now civil my cup of coffee just got done with breakfast and I'm procrastinating getting up to\nDo dishes because it's such a beautiful morning I'm trying to decide what I'm going to tackle around the house and I'm looking out my window on my eyes drift to the says whatever window treatment of have on the interior what what am I looking for an end preventative maintenance\nWell first thing a a lover ladies they be doing exactly what you're saying I Want to have gas coming in and then they look at that when the covers and he said oh my God my window companies is dirty you know then they go to\n\nMakes a lot of sense I mean you want to be able to have that privacy at night and not have people look in in the home and\n\nThere's so many things [laughter] you can say is that everybody would just take for granted that are there right take those off and see how long you're going to be comfortable with that grows you're to the outside world when you're trying to live in your home and and feeling constantly vulnerable to anyone from outside seeing what's happening on the interior\nThat becomes a pretty that was in our priority list pretty quick being able to have our privacy correct\nCorrect or most of their homes today is moving out what the many blondes at today you have a more fabric blinds uh be made for winners and home and they are energy of fish and a lot of people is going to go into um\nRoller shades and at home because they are energy efficient now but you know how to have a clean somebody has to be an expert on it because you can ruin a real fast\nAnd in need cleaning industry\nI'm going to mirror this to\nAir ducts there are people that will come and say hey you need to get your air ducts clean twice a year spring and that really doesn't do anything you have to get in and clean the condensing coil on the air conditioning unit itself and when you do that and clean the inside of your duck works\nYou don't have to do this but every seven to ten years I'm going to assume in the blank cleaning you could pay somebody to come and do a blow a good job or get it done per professionally the right way and this the last a lot longer and maintain the value in that fabric in that\nColor yes uh I think I said it before the average person and a Arizona has their window coverings clean every five years because we are more outside society and traveling and going all different places\nBut I don't look at a temperature right now who's windows and doors and left open and correct them and they had in their home right now [laughter] especially\nWhen when I have a monsoon season when the ... come across it brings all that Dustin and dust mites at comes all into\nA ... that's the only time women everybody's cooped up into the home but most of the time everybody's out so they actually don't think about having the blinds or window coffees a clean then until they see the dust on them or they have a gas coming in\nAnd how often should they be clean and\nWell they should be clean every two years\nBut the cost to having them clean law customers rather wait to five years and they don't uh do they just don't I haven't had anybody\nUh since I've been in business with twenty three years to come and have them clean every two years we just did a gentleman's house\nThat uh he hadn't cleaned five years ago and uh they look just like brand new again 'cause we save their money because if you pay that that that today's price for him it'd be two times as much for\n... for the new for the new one correct so you're cleaning price hasn't doubled and five years [laughter]\nI Know you might we should our [laughter] that's true but no I had no ...\nAnd if you called hunter Douglas 'cause you've got a broken line or you're trying to get something fixed on it they\nJust turned around and send them to you\n... they tell the customer the call us and we get a lot of referrals from how does this recall all over the state for them\nAnd that's really one of the premier names in the window treatment it's\nYes a hundred Douglas is the premier window problems of the world and\nJim somebody could reach you you can find them that rosy on the house dot com and the cleaning section in the blind section window treatments section it's one of those categories that we don't like to\nHave fifty million categories to pick from from rosy on the house but we also have to think like a consumer some people think blind some people think

responsibility of the homeowner the one that's going to be living in it to make that decision for you or you turn it over to your interior\nDesigner and just go with what they suggest as well but color selection\nAgain you don't appreciate it till you see a bad job and there's a ... an example of a home that off of its ... uh like ninth ... avenue and thunder bird call amount huh well [laughter]\nIt was it was a [laughter]\nA bad situation for him and it it shouldn't be the color of your home really shouldn't be what breaks relationships with your neighbors but they were on a limited budget this paint was available the home really needed it and it turned out to be like\nBig bird yellow when it was done and it created a lot of tension with his neighbors because he didn't even like the color of the home but he needed it for the\nA ... to protect\nThe surfaces of his home and he couldn't afford anything else so for a number of years it was you know the big bird home\nThat became a neighbor sore and amazingly enough when you're looking at location of somebody was looking for that location but didn't like this they want to live next to this orange home it could create\nA more of a difficult situation which was one of the reasons age always were created to avoid situations like that but\nYou know who I also don't want to be told what color realms I have to live in either so\nDon't write and done wrong\nIt's easy to not appreciate the amount of work and effort that it really takes to do it right\nI have a home in my neighborhood and stuff for evening Ron morning run I should say and a lady on the corner was getting ready to paint her house so it's going nice\nAbout a day later I I I pass by there\nAnd I'm not kidding it looks like cornbread it's the color of corn bread and so I nickname if the cornbread house and well it doesn't look bad Mm yellows again one of those colors that you get it wrong you're going to be pretty bad you know be pretty disappointed\nAnd the next year of your home is completely different than the interior of her home in the environment that you're spending more time it\nDo you spend more time outside or inside maybe it didn't bother cornbread lady or big bird guy 'cause they were more inside people does the people on the outside the home that had to deal with that color selection versus what's on the interior of the home\nAre we at a I'm going to these rosy on this one he had picked a color\nThat they thought was going to be a very nice yellow it turned out to be more like at LSU goals which I think may have been the intention to begin with you know I I'm going to agree with you on that it was in the master bedroom a new ... trying to surprise Jennifer did this while she was gone on a trip\nAnd came back to an el issue gold bedroom that\nWas that way for a number of years because\nWhat I was ... you don't have any time to repaint it right but\nThe the L issues colors are gold and purple so this was this was more of a yellow color yellowish color than not so much gold color [noise] well I wouldn't say that you know like a a gold bars\nYeah no it it was more close el issue or yellow but a recall purple and gold is just a habit yeah the\nBut the amount of disruption on the interior of the the what it takes to execute a paint job properly the disruption of creates in your daily life especially in your bedroom they didn't have time to re drape everything put the drop costs back down mascot\nProtect do the trend do rolling move the furniture you know\nThe more we can

our product because a perfect it it's amazing what you don't see if you don't look you can roll up\nYour paint roller on the wall\nThink I've got it covered and keep going because I went up and down twice as ... waving it you get up close with a magnifying glass and there's little tidbits and pockets\nOr that as a pain trying there's voids that are left and you don't see them on a new paint because at new paint looks so good compared to what you're going over\nUntil you've had time to living in a few days a few weeks a few months and you start to see these imperfections so being able to control and move freely and work correctly is a big part of it it it very disrupting internal process to your daily\nLiving and the amount of prep work in the ... and the joints in that the amount of time between applying you're talking where you're meeting too dissimilar materials like uh your windows your doors your trend and removing that pain or the tape from the paint so it doesn't feel it is\nVery precise process\nYou get done with that you think how does somebody make a living at this because you don't want to paint again for the rest of your life [laughter] and the crew that just

different speeds up white there are because you have a bright white you got a show white and what\nYou say you're on the white has its own color we'll to itself yeah yeah\nSo I remember painting my bedroom white and the first to spring sunlight that comes through the bedroom when I open up the windows that looks really nice boy at six in the morning it feels like it's ten in the morning it was so bright so I decided\nLet's not make it so why so I found a sheet of blue painted the bedroom blue just the walls not the ceiling or anything like that and that actually worked very well in other words folks I got lucky 'cause I have no idea when it comes to interior design and decorating I just kind of look and take a shot at it so I got very lucky on that one\nI picked a color one shade off one shade off what\nThe interior designer said here's what you want and it was so bright color was Colorado Ross and I was using it for an accident\nOn the middle a pantry and the entering hallways on each side of the house I did one shake because I thought this is too bright it's too hard I'm going to go one shade back to reduce just how bold this color is\nIt looked so bad I spent another five

going to paint their space and we offer this service in the store and they decide to purchase the appointment\nAnd then the color consultant gets that appointment and I that's what we call a pre call and verifies with them what their project is what they're a style maybe what their color or likes dislikes are\nAnd we prepare for the appointment that way uh and then the day on the appointment when we arrived we hit the door renting we know what they're looking for as a consultant ... every time I hit the door I start seizing up the tile the sofa\nThat drapes the light their comments about whether they wanted it ... or they wanted it bride and energetic\nAnd you start to get a picture of what they were saying on the phone and what your possibilities are in that space and from there you

farmhouse modern and they may like a rustic\nChateau luck so we always work with the client to make sure that we're achieving the results they're looking for so when we find all those details we start polling colors we'll show color in context\nAnd worked the appointment from there\nAnd this really fascinates\nMe I'm very task driven person and I can't imagine being in a job where my final task is to make you make a decision hound is I I Would feel like how I I don't know how to complete that task\nWill you complete the task because you're gathering information on the recall\nAnd you're

to talk it over with\nSignificant other is in his interest that they want to just get on with the ... project so this way out with a consultant\nShowing the caller's talking about the colors\nAre
