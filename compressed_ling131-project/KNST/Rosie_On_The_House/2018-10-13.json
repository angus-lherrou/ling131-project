main browse a shrub for\nDeer were all dry I mean there is about ... about fifty percent of the shrubs we're all dried they weren't dead but they had dry leaves on him they were all wilted and are just really struggling\nAnd this year I ... that we know that is going to change but in years past we noticed that they were nice and green and fall but that that last year this droughts really taken a toll that this is going to be a big help I bet this year\nWhen we had back up there again it's gonna be nice and green\n[laughter] I bet you're going to find as a whole new uh ... you're not even gonna feel like you're in the same place at the right to ... and ...\nAnd the one other um effect is gonna be the wildflowers and spring when we have a good ... you know a nice wet winter um it really produce a great crop of wildflowers in spring so that should be a a banner year if this continues like this\nEvery ... months when you come in we talk about a specific tree and we have the tree of the month which will be highlighting today\nWell this is one of my favorite trees of all time and is it is the piss stash\nTo stash or I'm Sorry it's the pomegranate this this this time I there are two of my favorite pie trees to stash and pomegranate pomegranate or a wonderful\nPlant in every respect is really considered a large shrub or small tree you can grow it either way you can kind of grow up to be pretty pretty tall you know ... minds about Fifteen feet tall in my yard they can grow up to be twenty or twenty five feet at maturity\nPretty slow growing but they they are multi stemmed they grow up from the ground or you know with multiple stems so they are great screening plant we use one kind of separates our pool area from the little back ordinary beyond it on and it's nice and full of course because it's producing fruit\nYou want it to be nice the branches to be nice and low right to the ground see it's easy for easy access for pruning or for for picking the fruit\nAnd what kind of ... do you get off of the\nWell the we're going to talk a little bit later this morning with someone who can answer that question even better than I can but I Will take shot is that what kind of fruit can you get off pomegranate well there are over ... varieties of pomegranate ...\nAnd they there are all for it pretty scene I'm at but at various sizes and qualities and and tastes\nAnd there's a few that are commonly available in in our nurseries it produce a wonderful\nOf pomegranate much this the same size and color that you can get in the stores\nAnd there are beautiful Advil edible fruit trees are giving you something back on your investment and this is one of those trees that\nI Would um I I think every yard nice little pomegranate tree they're easy to easy to to grow much easier than citrus even just throw 'em in the ground all grow up their deciduous trees to so they give you a little bit of fall color in this time of year will start to lose their leaves are just about now and it's certainly keep losing leaves all the way through November\nAnd be pretty much a barrel by December and but there are just so great a grapefruit tree and this is a time of year that that we harvest the fruit\nThey they have to be easy to grow up because they even grow at my back yard ... [laughter] I Need to see the YouTube thing again because I still have figured out your easy way of eating them they're\nThey're more trouble to eat then crawfish I Know I Know as a kid I remember you know opening those things up and picking out the seeds one of the time and thought I mean it was kind of a\nA a slow way to keep a a a young kid busy for for half an hour to my mom would probably give me one of those have you go sit in a corner pick through those but there is an easier way to open those up and get all the seeds out within about two or three minutes and I have a Youtube video look it up a\nPomegranate a ... an hour on YouTube and you'll probably find that there and it's kind of a fun method of a puff and I'm open an end to get all the seeds out and uh yeah there are\nA great addition to any yard and their this'll be a great time to plan up to any time there's a all deciduous trees can be planted in the winter you know turning the corner now into the cooler weather or you can pick 'em up at a local nursery or maybe even some bare roots or a plant available\nAs we head into December and January\nWith they register on the ... meter I Wonder I mean I ... I I I don't think so oh a ... meter covers a Oak Creek Flagstaff Flagstaff arboretum you're not going to get pomegranate grown that high elevation are ya\nKnow that's that's another good question because the pomegranate festival which was held last\nSaturday ... last Sunday and unfortunately we had planned to go but because of the big storm we had I wasn't sure the the roads are going to be good there was so much a flash flood warning we ended up not going but uh it was held in a school valley this year lots of\nYou'd pomegranate is up there in a barber will give us a little bit of a run down on that when we have her on in our next segment\nSounds good ... valley backed by between off iron springs out ... springs off yeah read out of ...\nOh yeah I was held an awful last year and the moves around it every year apparently I'm going to definitely be a part of it as soon as we can\nMaybe next year and put that on our on our events list the pomegranate festival All right I I meant to bring you a couple and I know you have a couple of yourself but I Want to shout ours is\nGoing to say it's finally about five foot height range and it had ... thirty beautiful time are granted sonnet

the sun and some kinds of birds will get in they're starting to pick them open because they're testing I'm too that's all they're doing is testing them and if they started opening those up and taken quite a bit of seeds you know they're they're ready to go\nA little secret that we found is to keep the birds out of them um you can put a small paper bag around him just a little a little lunch bag those little small ones you can just kind of put it over each individual fruit and just to put a food tire rubber band around the top uh at at the branch that they are attached to\nAnd and you can just keep the birds out you can keep you keep a few of them exposed to the birds will go go after those and then you'll be a um when when you're ready to harvest them you can just take the bag often

[noise] excuse me on one side of a tree you can be pretty close normally they\nAre the ... indicate one foot of distance from the tree for every one inch of truck diameter measured it about just tight\nSort about four or five feet off the ground if it's if the tree is twenty inches in diameter you should avoid any any um ah damage to the roots added a within twenty feet of the tree\nSo you're you're you can see that you've got to have a long ways away and at that point outside that twenty foot radius the roots are so small that it's in consequential in terms\nOf the health industry will recover any that being said many a lot of work has been done inside that ... what we call the critical root zone CRC\n... a lot of work has been done inside that twenty foot radius on single sides of a tree with no known harm to the tree because you're only cutting I Wonder if you did did that same amount of work on three or four sides of the tree\nOf course working inside that Sears he could really be harmful to the tree\nBut if you're only working on one side like the like yours and asked you have the fence on the one side and uh how far is it from the tree to that fence by the way I couldn't tell from the picture\nA it's about three feet\nOh gosh it is really close I thought I was I was more like six or eight\nUm but on the fence was beyond the the tree and the photo and I really couldn't tell the distance three feet away that that's almost impossible to get in there and use a treasure and cut along that sense\nUm with a tree planted that close to that wall I'm afraid that I'm a you don't have that option really isn't there to try to put a roof barrier and in such a close distance you could try it\nYou could get in there and and just go for it and uh but there would be a risk of destabilizing the tree but if it's it's if it's a matter of saving the wall oh that may be your only option and if the tree failed then you would have had to take the tree out anyway\nAnd depending on what's on the other side of that wall instead of cut or is it a neighbor's house or if it's open to the alley or something open if it's not hurt anything on the other side we can always an stacked that wall just put a link to low over it and re stack and you'll have a gap\nBetween the wall base in the ground that you could put chicken wire or whatever to keep animals from passing through that right now you you could just restructure that wall so it's really leveled and wrote you leave take that'll take that\nOne section of wall out and then as Rami said put a lentil or a beam across the the the the ... and then build a wall on top of that beam and leave a gap there for the roots to grow underneath and that's that's been done successfully as well\nWe appreciate the call that helps and good luck saving the Muskie tree that is hard losing a nice huge a shade tree they know already got a little bit of a ... well we actually\nWe actually got permission from our neighboring we built the wall into his yard six feet in his yard\nSo we had to get an exception on her title on our property and to actually build into his walk because he wanted to keep the tree too but it was destroying our wall\nSo we took it out and actually built a little a little ... a a a little section out into the neighbor's property now we both enjoy the shade of that treats there are options but you had to get cooperation neighbors across the way\nLet's see how we can help Dave who wants to talk about selecting a tree from Mesa welcome to the program\nHi Hi good morning thanks so

fourth and final\nCitrus tree fertilization application gets done um we uh also it's a great time of year to do fertilization if you're only going to do an annual fertilization\nJust to kind of keep your your your uh nitrogen levels up if you've been raking all of your leaves throughout the the the course of the year and you are uh just do it are doing a general um fertilizer application annually\nWe really recommend fall to be that time of year to do that and we still have about a month or so a too well the silt temperatures are relatively warm\nOr to get that fertilizer down the reason they recommend for full fertilization is because it allows the a plant to recharge a during the fall for it a really great a spring push of growth\nA root systems even though the tops of the trees can be ... in the dorm and see the root system to remain active in the soil because the soil is still warmer or an insulated from the cold weather and the research has shown that uh there's a lot of activity going on within the root system right through the winter\nSo they're ... the um the root system can be processing that fertilizer those nutrients and and storing them utilizing them and and getting ready for the spring push of growth\nAnd the research has indicated that is a great time of year to do that for those reasons\nOr if you fertilize leaders say in spring or in in early summer you're almost playing catch up because the tree has had to use it stored nutrients for that first spring push of growth and then you're kind of ... after the fact\nAnd so uh it's it's a good idea to go go ahead and do that fertilizing now um and then the tree is going to be able to really utilize that I'm\nIn the spring the other I'm just tip of the month is just to remember to be a little more like a little lighter I'm On the pruning for any of your ... sensitive trees like like citrus\nUm uh your histories your\nUm your orchid trees Hong Kong work it in some of your other flowering trees that are a little more sensitive to just be careful you're not a a printing them back to heavily\nOr they can just be groomed and shaped\nUm but just leave us as full a crown as you can you don't want to remove the trees winter coat so to speak this time of year other more vigorous trees can ... can be prone to little more heavily\nOr just the those that are putting on a ... you know a a foliage a little more vigorously like your ... your eucalyptus or your ... and others\nThat they can be prone to little more heavily because they can replace that foliage more quickly but just be a little more sensitive as a season goes on just be reducing the dosage of pruning right through the winter and then as we turned the corner into the spring you can start increasing that dosage of pruning for almost all the trees\n[noise] the last thing I Would mention is just to this is a great time of year to be composting\nI've mentioned is a several times throughout the year but it bears repeating the compost\nIs a a just a wonderful way to uh it's it's a wonderful way to to return to the soil all the uh the the the nutrients that are lost by raking leaves up you can take those leaves if you don't want 'em just scattered around your yard um uh you can pile them up\nAnd remember you don't have to be too good at this you can just put leaves rake them up into a pile find a corner of the yard somewhere you\nCan build a compost bin if you want and there's many designs where we can just put 'em in a pile compost happens to just leave it there\nIf it gets to slimy you need to add a little bit of brown leaf material if it gets to dry you need to add a little bit of green it's a combination of the carbon in the nitrogen the brown leaves and the green leaves that makes the compost happen\nAnd there's a pile gets bigger and bigger there'll be some combustion it'll be internal combustion it'll start to to happen it'll start to cook\nInside that pile and that's the the the magical compost it'll start to create a beautiful\nUm material that's going to be able to be returned back to your flower beds you can use it for planting you can use it for as a top dressing or the root zone of your trees and shrubs\nBut compost is a is a ... a great way to um a reduced the sole temperature around your trees it will ... are encouraged ... you know nutrient recycling it'll improve the microbiology within the soil underneath the the compost\nUh it it reduces dusty keeps the weeds down I mean there's so many good reasons to put that compost back around

or Chile we have the kids who are interested in things like woodworking carpentry\nBut we don't have the teachers\nSo I'm going to reach out to our listening audience and try and brainstorm the idea\nIf in fact for age has a supply of kids eager to get their hands on learning the trades they've got several opportunities there are single project clinics at the Maricopa County extension office\nThey have a coordinators that are busy in the schools would spin clubs and they have curriculum for introducing kids to the traits\nHow can we need to I Need I Need those of you who are interested in the trades those of you who teach the trades those of you who are engaged in mentoring the next generation in trades\nTo get a hold of me at info at rosy on the house dot com simply type in a four H. end of the subject where I Am and we'll see if we can't get maybe a lunch going where we can do something with this idea of recruiting for each kid into some kind of\nVocational trades training program 'cause we got to do something to do something that and\nThe heart thing there is so that's four H. dumb you've got Arizona construction career days and you get the harder to nurse then you've got the ag department everyone's working so independently to recruit labor there's it seems like if they could all come together\nTo recruited instead of everyone trying to compete against each other outside of it was a fishing pond is so small and they all come together\nI don't want to share those they share the message that here's these great careers it could attract more fish into the ... bigger instead of trying to you know get five fish out of the pond\n... let's let's find a way to bring in a hundred fish to the pawn excellent\nPoint excellent point so if you have a way we can put instructors and teachers together with these kids from poor age email me and for Rosie on the house dot com and simply type for age in the subject line and we'll see if I Can't put together maybe we'll maybe it would take the private dining the\nPhoenix city grill or the basement room at ceremony to put six or eight or ten people together and see if we could get something stars Rosie on

[laughter]\nI remember those might have been out of the day so my butt\nAt your good quality pain at a retail level um this is going to cost you around twenty five to yeah forty dollars a gallon depending what quality\nAnd then the last time I paid in my house I just for giggles added some of the additives that you can add to your ... I didn't see where it helped at all the idea about top drawer shelf paint and then I added the flow of flows all flow of Charles ... and I I didn't see where it how much\nYou can add a flood troll helps you to work with the pain better it helps to make it more ... in jail to apply to add a different types of ceramics which are supposed to keep your paint job cooler but I still think we're in the beginning of that technology\nI'm Glad to hear you say that because we're asked that all the time and I encourage people stay away from the ceramics\nLike somebody else be the laboratory right [laughter] yeah we're going to we're going to get to that route at some point the technology I don't think it's quite there yet what and then you buy this ceramic impregnated paint and I mean you're you're north of fifty bucks a gallon I just can't see you ever make it or turn on that investment\nYeah and the problem here in Arizona is you're going to get fading with regardless of what product you use so you know even even if you do go with that paint you are still going to get some fading in and you are going to have to repay around the ten year mark with with a product like that\nThat ten year mark is an interesting one because we have said here roses on the house for years that you really stucco application using next year could pay you really need to paint you're stuck go about every seven to eight years\nAnd then I was called a shill for the paint companies [laughter] and then you guys came out with your tenure word\nYou know it just depends on the product and I said that the technology came up with a new product that allowed us to to do to full coats and the the the product we're using with that ten year warranty is twice as thick as normal normal paint and we're doing two photos of it so that's why we're able to offer that\nLonger warranty okay now we're talking about paint life\nAs it relates to being applied on a wall we had a digital question come through and

crack and keep the hills and valleys\nYou know make sure you have hills and valleys because it takes a little bit of technique it's really simple but I I see some painters I go over their blood on with a brush\nAnd I call them snakes you sue snakes running down the wall and it looks horrible\nBut if it's a it's an easy ... or ... it's an easy uh\nUh application as long as you keep those hills and valleys look in the same which camouflage is there a ... yeah exactly and then when you put your finished coat on it you shouldn't be able to see it\nNow when I'm feathering that with an older brush it I'm putting it in the crack I get the material in the ... do a feather out an inch or two on either side and just kind of go\nOver the top of it Yes sir you're you have to figure it out if you keep it blah be right there you're going to see a bloody mess at the end of the paint job has got to have the feather it all out and make it nice\nOkay so we've taken care of the cracks a very
