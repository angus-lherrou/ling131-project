California and\nLiterally spend hours on the phone with him in the fields guiding the on how to select what to do and it was just a a lifelong process and next to my daddy had more influence on me than\nAny one man in my life and we lost ... five years ago and we continue but uh we have a very diverse set of genetics we have the largest\nGene pool of capital Manama in the world and we do more research than than anybody at any research station any college\nAny university or anywhere and I don't mean that arrogant that's just kind of what's happened and so we do we were blessed we get to work with Dr rod wing here at the very end of the molecular division and Steve Hansen was my producer division in Mexico state\nWhat you're looking for it all the molecular study of [laughter]\nThat's\nFun\nAre we looking for oh\nWell for one thing you know the basics good question the basics number one we're looking for how you all for the grower and what really put put us on the map was in the early nineties uh the the Chilean history is growing and as you guys know you get\nIf you get on one plant you might get some hot chili and you might get some mild\nAnd is this and I didn't know yeah absolutely and the early days that's the way it was ... he consistency was very difficult was nature's box of chocolate you just never knew what I mean it it it it you just never know and and for this ... industry to spread and as we all know\nA Mexican cuisine has really grow\nAnd for it to grow into the north and east\nWe couldn't burn people up because the first time somebody got hot chili they were done you know and and and I got some hot ones in her will will talk about that in a minute but you know you can just smoke somebody and that's that's tough they don't want it after that uh\nSo what are what really brought us to to the forefront and breathing was we were the first ones to come other stabilized heat level genetically so that so that this industry could spread and it did in in\nOur our first friday was Arizona twenty in Arizona\nVery stable and he almost two mile\nGrassy uh it it it it the heat in itself\nA there's many is the number a reference to the heat index school the school you know okay come on it but but then inside the Scoville unit is there's there's an hydro zing die hard ... and we all know that you eat one you know like a jalapeno hits you one place in your mouth or\nOther chilies hits you in the back of the throat some Chile you eat it\nAnd five minutes later and go ... you know I think that things getting hot little bit on the meal is getting really hot [laughter] so the whole ice cream that bad yeah exactly you know ... you know it's always interesting fruit because it's the only thing we that gives us coming and going into what I mean\nJust a little bit of humor\nWell hey and run our family is going to lead to try your chili peppers and because they love to cook and you guys get pretty spicy right\nYeah they don't like it they heat and there's a lot of good recipes right there on your on your plate dot org with you can\nIf you need some ideas for that yes he is chili peppers and the only thing that's lacking right now that ed promises me we'll get those on there is some recipes from his sister and his wife that can really add an enhanced that whole list of recipes that feature\nAre Arizona chili peppers and so\nWe're talking about the different types of chili peppers and we're talking genetics one of my stat sheet there are how many different sets of jeans and a chili pepper well\nYou know that's a that's an interesting question first off I'm going to ask you how many genes do you think Romeo human has\nYou know I've only got four [laughter]\nI'm up by Sunday I area but they I think we're going to have these laws back to the subject\nLevis language and exactly\nA human has roughly twenty two thousand pairs of genes I mean there's there's there's\nI have more in my class and she has more and her father but you know technically the real science says Nineteen thousand five nine hundred and something I forget exactly but give or take twenty to twenty two thousand genes and we learned more all the time pepper [noise]\nMy original study showed forty two thousand and that's what I talk to kids in classes for years uh but\nRecently UC Davis that a new study and comes up with that there's a little over thirty thousand but nevertheless whether it's thirty or forty thousand\nIt's still much more diverse than even we as humans and our job as breeders is just to separate those gene packages out and I love to talk about Jean packages 'cause it's really fun if I say to your roaming\nAround as you say what her brown or if I say to your blue eyes you say what ... ... if I say red hair you say what fair skinned right typically and ... and ... so my job is to make a Franco brunette\nYou know [laughter] my job is is to take these gene packages and and and because the they run in packages\nAnd we're trying to take the best of certain things and put it was the best of other things and leave the genes we don't like behind its fun guys I'm telling ya gotta live to be a hundred and fifty years old to get some of this stuff figured out it is fun\nAnd and you know to me if you don't see God's handiwork and what I Do boy you you're pretty blind because this thing there is the first genes in saying it's amazing\nAnd you're a fourth generation farmer yes or a no disrespect but I'm going to just go out on a limb and say you're probably not going to make it to a hundred and fifty do you have a fit sign of racial coming up hey we're learning from yeah\nWhere are you in Chile this one has more vitamin C. than to oranges and we make it you don't have a lot you\nOr you just slice ... what what are your show and you know what I was going to show you\nGood question what I was going to show you is and this one's not I thought I ... I Know I've got one in there that's hot but this one's not very but the kept science and runs down the placenta wall and and so anytime\nYou want to fool your friends and and make them think you can eat hot chili used to take the slice that doesn't include the placenta wall\nAnd and and then give them the placenta wall and they're going to get the cap science and medicine a wall is that ... that in the right side regret that's where the cedar develop you know an interesting thing most people will tell you hold the seat is hot in and of itself sees Moha\nIt's only the the reason the seed is often perceived as hot as because it kept science and has developed on the placenta wall or the seed is attached and it spreads to it\nNow we have a mutation that we're having a lot of fun with right now and that is it starts ... vein a vein that never that's a that's a medical term it basically means that it it doesn't quite mature\nAnd and the sexual organs it's actually a medical term but at the same and plants and the placenta wall when it doesn't quite mature\nThen it sends these these these faults percentage down but it's also sending kept science and we've had a lot of fun with those because to have a chili with the heat in the meat is is is very different\nOnly roads are now so you get on our birds bees and hot peppers and\nAnd I try to get it All right here\nAnd Ed Curry is my best example of a farmer with a lot of enthusiasm and in this case about chili peppers\nDo you suspect that your home is settling cracks in the wall or sloping floors doors and windows out of square

pointing out something on the hills on the yeah OK\nI'm holding in front of you all like a\n... a project we'd been working on twenty five years this represents twenty five years of selection and crossing it's it's a a\nA\nYellow bright yellow pepper it we have it in hot mild some medium\nIt's it's we really haven't releases burger yet but some of our tests have gone have showed that has a [noise] a nutritional value of a hundred times that of spinach and that basically what you're looking at is the lieutenant as he is an some panels\nI didn't need another excuse not to finish what I got another one now\nNow he's just really did have to eat a hunter down to the Spanish State to one ounce of this chili that\nTraditional value and in in in fact we we've had a lot of interest on that soon and and I need to clarify not all the tests are that high that was the peak it's fun to talk about that one because that one was the ... but the handle\nOf looting that's the one thing that that our listening audience I I really like to share this is the nutritional value of Chile the the\nAntioxidants the vitamin C. the vine may the vitamin D a peppers are very very very healthy and uh and and this has been a fun project because genetically I\nWhat do you try to do when you say it's a project is it that color or is it the the nutritional value or is it the flavors that all of that rosy what are we trying to accomplish with that pepper\nThis flavor is unbelievable I and my sister roasted sermons or my mom and dad are yesterday or day before some of this 'cause I I wanted them they obviously they've been in the chili industry for many many years and\nThen and so I take my new stuff down to them hey what do you think you know this thing is unbelievably sweet I'm ... probably most folks have either a yellow tomato or or a yellow watermelon kilometer watermelon\nWell this is kind of a twist on that\nI was actually looking for the color originally don't want to use this for when I lecture to the ... students in New Mexico states students that come to the farm and and when I uh I could show them a block of this and show how breeding works and show how separates and show that typically if we make across\nLet's see we take a\nYellow bell pepper and cross it was a purple bell pepper\nThe first year you're going to have a hybrid enough one and the hybrid is going to\nGoing to pretty much whatever it turns out it's going to look pretty much consistent but then you grow the two and then it starts split up and that's the fun part that's the ones that are and says because twenty five percent of them are going to be purple twenty five percent of them are we going to be yellow on the plant\nBut then in between that fifty percent is all kinds of bland and that's where I call during the gene pool up\nAnd then we start select and then I have a team I have a minute around ... and David Corn meal in a a nine year old daughter and then an an an another fellow Ramon that work with us and they've been with us for years and they love it we have so much fun guys you know my growers in New Mexico\nUh because we furnished the seat or whether it's kinda fun in the fall they get\nMostly done with harvest in there on the mountain hunting milk I tell him all while they're on the mountain ... milk I'm In the field hunting chili 'til their lives can be better\nAnd and we love it and and and to be honest I don't want to go to the mountain and hung out I Want to be in my chili feel that we provide our own entertainment you know what I mean I Love what I Do if if you don't go away with anything else did they know that if I die tomorrow\nI Love what I did in life\nIt's it's absolutely fine you know what I my conclusion is chili peppers and allowed you to play lay goes as an adult\nYeah pretty much genetic lego genetic absolutely any genetically modified\nWell not as a gym or like something shot this is all done ... ... it's all done old fashioned that's why it's taking me twenty twenty plus years to get to this\nBut as as I was saying here in the legal field when I Would show that the kids when the classes would come well it was real easy to see a red and yellow chilly it was real easy so I could show them that twenty five percent of one twenty five percent another in fifty ... it was a great teaching tool\nAnd I love to teach I mean that's that's the joy elections to watch these kids later we host FFA feel they ever ever first friday in November\nAnd and kids come from all over and then they compete and we get first place prizes and the fun part is we have a hot chili eating contest now that is the challenge three years ago a little beautiful blonde haired girl was winning and I'm telling you guys in boys were trying to outdo her and\nAnd and they were eating hot chili tell finally they were uh you know what I mean it wasn't staying down I'll just say it that way on the air\nAnd and uh but it's so fun and the kids love it in and they leave the farm understanding a little bit\nAbout what it means to select and and and pepper is so diverse\nEvery country in the world except for the the ones around the Arctic Circle in the north have their own pepper every country while I imagine\nSo so when you travel Mexico and I've I've I've I've been in lots of places in Mexico looking for chili then it's so fun you get in there and there's these little villages a column I he those\nAnd they're proud of their chili because their ancestry selected in selected in selected not knowing anything except for that certainly better\nThan you know what you can hurt a set of genes even that way\nThat's why it's really bad when the big tall guy ... tooth woman you know\nYou get kind of a funny or you know for humor for the day before I got there I'm picking up chili peppers in bags\nThe biggest music festival of the year and it's coming to the cw radio music\nYou'll miss the iconic performances ya\nTo miss [noise]\nAh because I started getting the point

you can talk about a chili recipe will now you know why we have egg curry curry farms and Julie Murphy with\nArizona Farm Bureau it's our first Saturday of the month we always bring in somebody from the farm bureau and Julie you sent me a list of chili pepper facts we cover a couple of more of those cars I\nThe details and and I don't know I'm ...\nYears ever won surely fact I'm going away with today you spent Fifteen to Twenty years developing a genetically specific\nPepper that you're growing at one bumble bee can mess you up\nOn my game the mind is that I went out to Chile and that equals a hundred announces a spin it you're good for\nAlright generally what you really well one of the ones that I thought it was pretty cool is how\nLong they believe that the chili said and chili plants have been around and I think something like six thousand years so ed can you have nothing on some some of the ancient tribes that have developed they said over the years but you're the guy that really made it\nMade it pretty unique for what we do here in Arizona and the other thing that strikes me about everything that ed told us today is how farmers really help one another and our dependence on another we may be ... developing a lot of the genetics here in Arizona but it's our New Mexico farmers are growers that are\nProducing it and making sure that it gets on our shelves so and let\nMe throw in Colorado and my taxes and you're right on your neighbors and and my ... and\nUh the growers in Mexico\nThat do quite well Julie one thing I Want to bring up as we recently did something really fun or we might what the diamond backs and a\nA young young lady maim madly in another Morgan or I Believe a fellow named David David on the chef named Steve who is over all the restaurants

us there's more to thanks for having me I really appreciate it\nAnd give me that title again\nIt's not easy [laughter] it's either a noble energy technical specialists and could only ask him technical questions so easy ones\nSo with that said\nThere's nothing in there that says rate select her [laughter]\nI Do have ten years of experience working with rates working with ... bills working with energy efficiency\nFor the longest time my job was to ensure everyone paid the utility as little as possible and use as little energy as possible you you're fairly new to the yes but again in the industry for you up at a silver springs go up yeah OK and he even knew\nWhat right by Mr curry was [laughter] how you said your your job is to get them to use as little as possible in that area electricity for pumping water vital yeah water in his area is a guy they might be in a non expansion area I Can't remember but water\nWater for fighting whiskey for drinking right that's right that's right well we do get a lot we do share a lot of information about a technique\nThat of of a good friend of mine I'm a people called me the father of super cooler but I'm not I'm I'm the steps on a street cat\nIs the father of super cool like they were just a voice for hours the voice for it um he convinced me early on ours is almost Twenty years ago or when the when the time of day plans first began to get introduced\nHe's the roses I I think it has something figured out he says uh\nIf you have a fairly energy efficient home\nWe can\nConsume a lot of power off peak\nFor one for the price\nThoroughly store it\nIn the building and the furniture and appliances and the\nDraperies and the clothes in the closet and get our homes comfortable off peak and when that aren't peak period hits let's just ask her house to go to sleep and wake back up\nWhen the on peak off again brilliant\nSo we introduced this cause so I tested it at my house\nAnd at that point I still had six kids at home and\nAnd my kids never lived at home without for their friends [laughter] so it was like Grand Central station fifty people split in the pool in and out the doors you know I I could scream and yell about closing their doors in August but it wasn't a demand a good [laughter] I I Would have just lost about ...\nSo we started experimenting and testing this super cooling technique shifting\nAs much power consumption off peak as possible and I got criticized early that's the most selfish greedy thing you could do and my point is you know it's probably one of the most green things I can do because I'm now giving the information back to the power suppliers that hey I you you can ignore me at peak yep\nAnd that's what utilities have to build for is picking restructure peak demand so you're helping out the peak is what drives that next power plant construction\nBigger conductors more are\nJust more juice on the system so the more we can cut off that peak and the utility companies are becoming a little bit more aggressive about this over the last I Want to say the last Twenty years\nI checked with us the U.S are yesterday because I put myself on the peak demand program a free T are all owned a house in three or four days and then I'm going to be on that rate and\nSo I wanted to be able to talk to talk and walk the walk and I just think it's it's it's a good thing for everyone to go to go to\nI Do believe that in ... you have to opt out of a ... a teal you program now but I I'm not a hundred percent sure I I just did some reading on that earlier and I wasn't able to check with the CS are so check with your local a\nCustomer service rep and whatever utility Iran and see if that will work for you see if he has a nice website that covers a lot of information\nUh and so easily they have the gamble now the couple it is well it is I was on it last night for a little a little off\nThe one of the things I Want to talk about how how big the customer base the all have [noise] so we've got about four hundred and Seventeen thousand customers for T. P. and y'all are primarily Tucson metro Tucson metro and we go down south near a\nGreen valley Kobe up and around ... there's some have snakes around will go down a cut in Santa Cruz county um\nMaybe touching a little bit of coaches county okay\nAll right and so of those four hundred thousand customers\nHow many are on a time of day do you know so as of two thousand Seventeen there were about ten thousand\nOut of four hundred thousand yeah yeah or on time of day yeah\nThat's disgraceful\nI Know that um the information I got was from a website and it said that that's how many we had in two thousand Seventeen while I think that they're they their market and marketing get aggressively or idle they'll we'll see\nFolks I if if you live in a Mosley well built home\nAnd you can push your power consumption\nOff peak you can save money I think so\nIntimately familiar with the peace power structure but\nHouse three thousand square feet with an air conditioned garage I can\nBe at eight cents a kilowatt\nAnd they're just they're there's hardly anything you could do at your home to save more money than that and it's just one be on the white rate plan yeah to\nBe smart about how and when you consume power yet and you're going to save money yeah they'll save a lot of money but\nOn the corollary to that if you don't plan if you did oh you're going to get hurt it's going to be painful it is and that's what that's why three hundred and Ninety thousand of your four hundred thousand customers\nHave jumped for its army used they've got a little bit of a fear of the ... but I think with with programmable thermostats making that jumped into whether you can\nReach them with your ... your smartphone or a\nI think appliances or going that way I think it's just it it should be the wave of the future it is and if you want to be a green energy consumer you will go to the time of use and you will move your power consumption too off peak and I use as much or more power\nI just use it a different time a day and my bill is about thirty percent lower than his bill\nYou can work harder you can wear smart\nYou're working smarter at that folks were here this morning it rose you on the house broadcasting live from the Tucson convention center for the southern Arizona home builders association the show opens at ten we have open the doors early at nine those of you that requested early tickets we do have someone at\nThe door it is on the south side of the building the far east end of the ah ah loading rap\nWe're all the food trucks are generally lined up parking parking lot be come all the way down the ramp to the last door on the east end of the convention center that east into that loaded grab and we've got your tickets for you that you can also join on air borne triple eight seven six seven for three four eight that's one triple a rosy for you\nText questions to Fort one one nine to three and a email info arrows the on the house dot com where again live at the Tucson convention center\nFor the ... show folks if you all are in a car show\nYou cover in your book will retain the value of your home and do the easy to convert back to a swimming pool\n... fool covers it far too old to three to twenty four thirty\nAnd five two to three to twenty four thirty for\nOr of the three one six five three zero\nHere honey happy anniversary which says\nIt's not our anniversary or anniversaries in may remember maybe yes and maybe no\nYou're my work wife too and it's a lion's roofing twenty fifth anniversary that's right twenty five years wow we really have so much to be grateful for go head open your gift\nCheck to the Arizona animal welfare league for a hundred dollars I thought we should instead give back to the community that has supported us all these years and I know you love those four legged babies what a\nGreat idea let's expand on this let's give a gift of\nOne hundred dollars for every roof purchased throughout this year to one of our four designated charities I Love you my work wife I liked the way you think and you're still my sweet and salty get very sexy work how the work and life if you want to learn more about or give back to the community program\nGo to L.

is a severe shortage of home inventory\nValley wide typically we would expect\nOne point six percent of all homes to be for sale but right now less than one percent actually are\nThis shortage combined with red hot buyers racing to beat the interest rate increases is causing bidding more than increased home prices potential sellers who have been waiting for home values to return are likely to catch on soon\nSo John is recommending that potential sellers strongly considering lifting their home during the summer selling things than before the market is flooded with new lifting\nA free no

E. pi we talk a lot about how people can cut their in particular there's summer cooling bills by easier\nAnd the technique or and or a strategy\nCalled super cool it and we\nWe have fine tuned it for a PS because that's all the properties I own or in a PS zone so I've got several\nWays I can model the plan and and and sort the information and outsmart the supplier so to speak to get my bill as well as I can and we don't have\nThat I'm paying over nine cents a kilowatt for and I didn't spend a lot of money doing anything other than just making sure I was on the right plan and energy management computer and bought a being\nAs low as you can get and people say oh boy your house must be hot well let me tell you something folks\nAt my house the temperature is set at sixty eight degrees through the middle of the summer\nMy wife wears a little light show in and around the house almost all day long and I'm Still at on her nine cents my three thousand square foot home which is in a big home it's just three bedroom two bath\nBills this year we're under three hundred and twenty five bucks okay so I'm consuming about thirty six thirty eight hundred K W\nI'm doing at about nine cents a kilowatt and that's in the peak of the summer my bills I'm dual energy so we cook with natural gas we heat with natural gas with barbecue with actual gas my summer electric bills\nDrop through the floor I mean they're like they're like Seventy bucks a month or nothing [noise] so\nWe're getting inundated roaming\nWith information about prop one twenty seven\nWhat she how should we vote for one twenty seven now I Know it makes you nervous and I know it makes your mom nervous anytime ... goes to politics\nI'd like to just give up my personal cell number so I could just tell everybody how to vote on everything on the ballot would that be OK [laughter] listen folks when it comes to prop one twenty seven which is it is the renewal energy standards proposition okay\nThis is written by somebody that has an agenda we currently supply about eight percent of the grid with renewable energy and it's twenty let's just call it twenty Nineteen okay we're just a couple of months away they want us to do that\nThey want us to increase from eight percent\nTwo fifty percent\nIn what timeframe twelve years [noise]\nLike that's doable that's doable we can do that\nBut they want to do it and here's the scary part they want to do it and this was written in to the proposition one one it's a constitutional amendment so that makes me nervous anytime they want to amend the constitution then I start getting a microscope out and I look at every single word okay\nAnd there are a couple of propositions this year the constitutional amendment this isn't the only one\nSo I'm looking at the microscope proposition one twenty seven wants to take a renewable energy\nFrom eight to fifty percent in twelve years here it is irrespective of cost to the consumer [noise]\nHere it doesn't matter how much is going to cost the consumer [noise] this constitutional amendment will mandate it\nDoesn't matter what it costs the consumer if it was affordable right now it'd be reversed eight percent would be new killer in Ninety two percent would be alternative energy source that they don't want to measure what's currently being supplied by the state of that has to be new sustainable and it goes [noise]\nSo I'm not telling you how to vote for it [noise] I just tell you what if\nIf your homes on a property that has a septic tank buried underneath it and you're still utilizing that septic tank requires a fair amount of maintenance and service and I don't know about you but that's not really a whole maintenance task guy tack on myself and you haven't checked years out and while they're done

[noise]\nI don't remember exactly [laughter] I don't know that I can say it on air and she said she gets that side of that host\nWell one that we added last week was a flip tray and this one was an immediate hot so we had to order right away is that was that on the back patio backed by the office on top of the ladders is a tool that goes on top of a frame ladder yeah not a\nExtension Labrador a frame ladder it's got to side you pull it out makes in a in the ... side very there are some that are made to climate both more often than not for weight and portability it's one side and it's a trade that goes on top and then it flips over\nSo you can have more of your tools you hold the drill a tape measure paint it really cuts down on the ... lit up and down that law does and that's the number one uh\nI I don't know if this is still current but at one time falls off of the latter was the number one reason for emergency room visits for home all that's right and like\nAnd it's more often than not climbing up and down ...\nSometimes we're leaning too far one direction and the other and [laughter]\nThe number one reason is because when you're up on top of the ladder you turn away from the ladder to come down and you're stepping on your shields on the way down that's the number one reason people fall and they're wearing a flip flops [laughter]\nYou'd never climbed a ladder flip flops and you never face away from the ladder to rules on and they frame letters and there's more rules would extension letter\nSo that a flip trait will help you eliminate ... reasons to go up and down more often if you're working on a lightning fixture hanging a light taking on the ceiling fan or whatever it is you need to work overhead for\nAbsolute doubt on that ladder and on that flip tray it kind of applies to what today's topic is on our blog key things you need to know about choosing pain for your homes exterior and we've got lots of information on our site about\nPainting the outside

old days hang last\nPaper on top of the sheeting or on top of the studs and then we would stretch chicken wire over the top of that and then we would apply three coats of sand submit base plaster we knew the moisture was going to get through the stucco and that's why we put\nPaper on in a very strategic application method that once the moisture got through it would we down to the bottom of the wall and we had little weep speeds down there that would allow the water to vacate the stucco wall so\nYou need to know stuck go is not waterproof\nWe tell people you really ought to anticipate ... painting a stuff go home about every seven to ten years and people say much cycle has been painted in Twenty years I get that there's a lot of stucco homes have painted in Twenty years\nAnd there's I
