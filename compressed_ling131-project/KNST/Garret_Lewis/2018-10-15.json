C. about Kim Jong il I mean we have highlights coming up because it was it was unbelievable it was about what Trump is going to be in a in Mesa on friday stumping for Mick Sally\n[noise] how about that man oh man oh man uh and we have that in third thing\nI think you need to know and there's a lot of stuff and it may rotate but\nThere are a lot of stories coming out now about Democrats scared about election day it might be twenty sixteen all over again more stories about the lackluster so Latino support so that will be why they lost apparently you have that huh Hillary of the kiss of death\n\nWow so all these things are going on we'll get it all these stories three things I think you need to know before you the highlights and accusing cinema stuff and everything so this this Washington Post\nColumnist that disappeared looks like may have been murdered by the uh the Saudis\n... that's his name\nIt's so telling isn't it that the media is in an uproar about this because Trump didn't come down by the way without without\nAll the evidence yet now looks like they did a chore but until there's a hundred percent evidence is that like you tell you make a statement about an ally saying they are the ones that killed this guy and chopped up his body\nI mean it's brutal what happened to this guy if\nEverything were hearing his true right it's absolutely brutal however even telling the\nMedia is so up in arms\nOver the death of this guy and we need to get the bottom of it we need to find out what's going on\n\nYet they were complicit in helping Obama tried to change the story and cover up what happened in Benghazi\nAnd fast and furious these same journalist couldn't give a crap that for Americans were killed under Obama Hillary's watch because they were irresponsible and the protection and they ignored or any protection calls 'cause they don't wanna offend the people that were living there by having extra protection and things like that they don't they didn't care they didn't care one bit\nUnder Trump is journalist is killed we think by the Saudi Government and Trump is said though the entire time if they did this we're waiting we're going to find out very soon he said just luckily so we're going to find out very soon very soon\nWho's responsible for this\nOr leave it to the media again this is just exactly what they do they don't care about America they want Trump to jump to conclusions just like they ... they jump to the conclusion that Brett Kavanaugh was the sexual deviant or rape is the guy that drug women without actual corroborating evidence there was no evidence whatsoever zero zip builds none\n\nMedia just wants heads I mean that you are getting everyone everyone wanted to college they said you're not only have to double check it to triple check your sources and I left that back then and that was a while ago\nAnd obviously it's all out the window because the media is saying that Saudi Arabia did this and Trump needs to like blow 'em up or do something um and Trump jumps just a sucker and he's in with Saudi Arabia and this is what's ... duty is called for OPEC\nAre just not being a cartel he has called for America to produce our how does Trump helping Saudi Arabia by having an war open and having more competition and more oil drilling\nIn America which would lower the price and take the power away from Saudi Arabia and all those Middle Eastern countries how is he a friend of theirs by doing that I'm just I really\nMedia so they're so dumb they're so one sided it's insane it's insane right um [noise]\n[noise] it's it's just it's incredible and by the way Trump was literally on ... points\nLike this guy almost two years into it and it really I mean she's used to it which we have another three months I mean he's a year in nine months into this job and he is comfortable ... he gave it to Leslie stall yesterday he just yeah just jabbing jabbing jabbing jab and uh I mean it's it's really good\nWhat he is doing its he doesn't care he has thrown a right back at him\nAnd that's the way it should be\nYou know let's look at climate change let's spice them soundbites Michael okay\nThey were all kinds of subjects brought up climate change illegal immigration family separation Kim Jong il Russia all this stuff right all this stuff\nAnd Trump was literally on a ... way go on to flag with by that the first one ride the yes Trump was asked about climate change she Leslie stall a sixty minutes of fame as the Trump stir do you think climate change is a hoax\nAnd\nYou gotta here is the answer they won't play after that too because I mean they just try she's just right there you listen to media is used to a Republican rolling over and doing whatever they want because they don't want to look bad in the eyes of the media I I Can't have not like me\nI Can't be framed that way I can I have to have to just have to take the popular or the media and on the popular the media's take on things I have to do that give me a break this is this is what Trump said when he was asked if climate change is a hoax area listen\nLook I think something's happening something's changing and it'll change back again I don't think it's a hoax I think there's probably a difference but\nI don't know that it's manmade I Will say this um [noise] I don't want to give trillions in trillions of dollars I don't want to lose millions and millions of jobs I don't want to be put in a disadvantage\nI don't mean put her this man it's not worth it it's not worth killing the economy so then of course Leslie stall follows that

Sorry on CNN they have a what's the difference they have a an anchor named Anna ...\nShe was talking with Marc Lamont hill easy a liberal professor everything's racist and they were talking about a woman that apparently called police on a black man babysitting too white kids which is the dumbest thing ever what ... what it is yet this anti corporate or on CNN lied about what Donald Trump and Don junior said\nOr listen to this year we go over there we cool thank you\nPresident Trump has signed on June here said this plant white man had a lot to fear right now here's\nWhat white men have a lot of fear right now\nNo that's not exactly what it's actually it's not even know what they said listen right here listen years where they actually said you you were in a\nWhile I say that it's a very scary time for young men in America when you get the ah you'll see of something that you may not be guilty of this is a very very very difficult times\nGot boys and I got girl I Want to see what's going on right now it's scary for all things I mean I wouldn't want to rise who are you scared most for your son or daughter I mean right now I'd say my ... on the other problem is that for the people who are real victims of these things when it is so obviously political and pay some of it is it it really diminishes the real clams\nThere you go this is CNN white men have a lot of things to your did you hear that at all good rich did my years lie to me did you hear it Trump or trumped duty talk about white men like that chick ... did you hear that\nI heard that there's something wrong with you [noise]\nNothing could be further from the truth you're glad that\nAs they age sorry the cell phone so\nIs the nature of reason yes well be why because you could hear it yeah yeah or you go yeah just

[noise]\nThank you good rich no my eyes did not deceived me there was nothing there said but she lied about that and by the way she's never corrected what she said why should she that's why people watch CNN and they believe that stuff and they wonder why people chant CNN sucks CNN sucks CNN sucks\nThere we go All right let's poison Jeff Flake stuff or I'd just like really really you know what actually before we get to the Jeff Flake stuff let's go to number three let's say Trump don't get the job like Trump on climate change on sixty minutes or he's asked by Leslie stall of climate change is a hoax\nRight listen to what Trump said here we go you're ready for number three you cool you got it\nIs it I think something's happening something is changing and it'll change back again I don't think it's a hoax I think there's probably a difference but I don't know that it's manmade I Will say this um\n[noise] I don't want to give trains and trillions of dollars I don't want to lose millions and millions of jobs I don't want to be put at a disadvantage\nBecause we put a disadvantage ... everything that the Paris climate accord\nWas going to be no\nAnd then he sticks up for a for everything got them for a number for you know mind and then we're gonna play Jeff Flake on climate change number four here we go Leslie stopping them but but but wait here we go listen\nI Wish you could go to Greenland\nWatch these huge chunks of ice just falling into the ocean raising the sea level and you don't know whether or not that would have happened with a with a man you don't know when you're a scientist and your scientist that no no I haven't had that disagree with that you know I I was thinking\nWhat if he said now I've seen the hurricane situations\nI changed my mind that really is climate change and I thought wow what an impact one and then when I think I'm not denying climate change\nBut it could very well go back you know we're talking about that I don't mind they said that we had hurricanes that were far worse than what we just had with Michael says that they say well I'll say they will let them on the scientists who say it's more of a\nYear ago and have to show me the scientist because they have a very big political agenda Leslie camp just also has a political agenda yes they do good for him for pointing out that stuff to\nClimate change it doesn't mean man does it how did this a hair a go from an ocean to a desert\n[noise] let me know all these warnings ten years we have ten years and years ago or eight years we have twelve years we've ten years ago you know ten years is a tipping point my favorite is Prince Charles\nTwenty Seventeen was it and then a twenty Fifteen said you know we have to twenty fifty because it wasn't quite doing what he wanted to do\nYeah [noise] so Jeff Flake let's play Jeff Flake or he's on ABC's This week number Eighteen Jeff Flake talk with George ... gets on climate change he is really wanting a job in the mainstream media here we go to\nLarry Kudlow downplay valence findings on on climate change dramatic shifts and how Republicans think about climate change over the last several years I think going in the wrong direction [noise]\nI think so I think that to how we got there I mean there's been more recognition among Republicans the ministry of housing taken the view of some of us that this is something we really need to deal with a mild so we can move along with the rest of the world and address this\nUm what are you going to travel and trade obviously that report that came out is for is pretty dire of up there are things that we can do and shouldn't do like that are Republicans need to be at the forefront if we want to keep uh keep our place and keep our saves\nSo their ego report we there's another loser idea from an establishment guy we need to be the forefront and we want to keep our jobs\nNot people you've elected Trump because we smell BS on this we do\n\nThe Paris climate agreement was a wealth transfer our wealth going to other countries and to knock us down a few pegs because China and indeed and if they do jak squat about the environment give me a break with Joe oh yeah we need we need to do this nobody cares what you think you're a loser\nYou're done why you didn't run for reelection you gave up over a year in advance\nSo\nAnd so dumb uh one more highlight we'll get to other stuff from the Trump stir number number a number ... which which one is which which I I like ... where's the other one\nUm oh yeah yeah there were seven Trump on it 'cause I just played you have a media line number seven lovely still asked Trump what are the things that you learned since you've become president this is the second thing is the first is DC as vicious horrible people is the
