alright three things that I think you need to know number one this is not really being reported a lot but there was a story in the Washington Times and they got it from a Mexican and newspaper\nThat the caravan is now up to fourteen\n[noise] people [noise] fourteen thousand people now who in their right mind\nWould be like I'm OK with fourteen thousand random people coming into my country who in their right mind would be that way so I'll get you that in that insane a second thing that I think you needed to know is that there are a lot of\nPreviously deported people\nIn this caravan people deported five six seven times five I mean this has been five six seven times\nWhat I mean literally no remorse nothing zero zip zilch they're just doing it again which is why we need a freaking wall\nAnd I was so damn disappointed so damn disappointed I'm with is a ... with with mark ... again I my like Mark is a nice guy I was so disappointed he can't even just come out and say yes we need all we need that we need a whole lot more why why why not just said that right why not just say that a third thing\nThat I think you need to know\nIs that it looks like the market's going to have it down day to day\nA big drop triple digit losses a future for down over four hundred already and uh apparently part of it is\nI mean I don't understand it it's not America it's [noise]\nIt's around the words global we're actually doing well it's\nBased on China China their economy is crumbling that's a big big big\nPart of it so businesses global business are not getting the same returns they were getting from China and now a it is causing a sell off China stock market fell over two percent\nAs trade concerns are the big thing that we're breaking them but the media is not going to report it that way why should they three things I think you need to know\n[noise] um [noise] so this Caribbean situation is really uh it's really it's really sickening\nDo you know the Democrats are not even talking about it shouldn't be surprised we briefly mentioned it probably should have done more\nLast week a there was a memo sent around by the center for American Progress and very big a lefty group and they put out a memo to all Democrats and said do not talk about immigration\nIt's a losing issue for\nUs to not talk about it avoided that's where the Democrats are literally braved the Democrats here we go again\nTeaming up with the media\nThey are trying to build the narrative they've tried to push that it trying to create a narrative you know what they're trying to create that people care more right now about health care\nAnd Social Security and Medicare\nA ... billion dollars in return\nSo the government sort of a sudden said holy crap we can't let that happen we need to get our cutting there as well\n\nSo anyway the Democrats are really trying hard really trying hard to try to make this election about something that nobody cares about\n\nThey're trying to make it about a they tried to make it about Chris Yogi no offense\nDude was killed was he a good guy a bad guy I don't know do there will be killed probably not obviously not\nI'm a ...\nYou had a green card or he was a Saturday and he got killed by the Saudi Government in Turkey and they're constantly was murdered he was brutal was terrible they are not good people in but we can't people in the X aside from Israel in the middle east you can't reason they're a different culture they think differently it's it's a totally different situation\nThat was George W Bush's biggest mistake but anyway I get the focus really think it's a terrible thing but Americans we look at it as what impact will it have in my life and the ... situation has no impact on my life what does\nIs the caravan of now fourteen thousand people\nThat's what has the impact on my left the fourteen thousand people that are now headed this way that's going to be a big ... the Democrats don't want to talk about it\nAnd the lame statements that\nSchumer and Pelosi of put out there I mean this I Hope you're sitting down I Hope you keep both hands on the steering wheel if you're driving right\nNow because it's one of the I mean you're like really are you that out of touch with this whole situation right now I'm just I'm just curious um over the the the statement put out by Schumer and Pelosi was Trump is desperate to change the subject from health care to immigration\nBecause he knows that healthcare is the number one issue Americans care about\n[noise] you guys ruined healthcare [noise] you guys ruined you ruined it [noise]\nThey destroyed healthcare and we're supposed to look to them to fix health care I mean it's again this is the dumbest thing ever or something else to think about because you hear about these wave elections ride the wave things when\nDid the waves happened in Ninety four you know six I mean very windy twin twenty ten football game yeah there you go maybe they still happened unfortunately in twenty to what happened in Ninety four why why did we get Newt Gingrich and the Republicans taking over what recession\nOh six what happened why did the Democrats take over the Republicans the economy was about to collapse and the media convinced people that didn't have a clue that Bush was at fault\n[noise] twenty ten [noise] the economy was still garbage we were still in a recession and the government literally took over health care\nThere has never been a wave election that I can recall you knew where the economy\nYes and pay five hundred is looking up and down forty five the Dow

I. S. dot org works with a good friend Jessica Vaughan joined us this morning Todd thank you for the time I appreciate it\nYeah no problem show up first off before everything that you're reporting a and and you you talked about this to your reaction to Jeff Flake and I know you have a whole blog about there's a link to it on my Facebook page or Jeff Flake basically mocking also the president saying it's a ... that there could be terrorists in this uh this fourteen thousand person ...\n[laughter] no well of course it's not a ... uh as as I've recorded and written about uh for quite some time there are middle Easterners or north Africans\nA people from South Asian countries like Pakistan or Afghanistan who are are regularly traverse seeing these same Latin American countries on their way to the U.S border and they do reach the U.S border from those countries using a long haul smuggling organizations\nOn a regular basis and some of them have been um [noise] a flag as a connected to terrorist organization some cash this is not an art\nThis is a a homeland security issue\nThat men and women are cost the homeland security enterprise are working on diligently every day uh they be offended to think that a a a member of Congress were saying that\nThat all of the work that they're doing a is is amounts to a a steak threat and that kind of hard\nI mean I saw how incredible is it ah that you're in a United States senator\nWould actually say that you think and we don't we can get in the mind and Jeff Flake I don't think there's not much in there I think we get all fit but um do you think that he is purposely lying about this because he hates Trump or is it possible that the United states senator doesn't actually know the information that you know\nI think that uh most most members of the Senate and congressmen and women are unaware of this threat issue and I think even the White House\nIs not very aware of it I I\nI I kind of have this feeling that uh because most of what\nHappened in that threat Rome is classified\nOr law enforcement sensitive because it involves active investigations the general public just doesn't know about it if the general public doesn't know about it than there is not going to be a lot of phone calls and emails and a Twitter to ah members of Congress so I think it's quite plausible that\nThat uh he just doesn't know about this traffic or this threat problem or but it exists it's there there's traffic there are hundreds of uh people from those countries who are reaching the border that that they that they would uh joined the caravan is absolutely within the realm of possibility\nMan this is this is really incredible Todd Benjamin is with the center for Immigration Studies he's on a ... am seven Ninety so in in your estimate I mean I mean do you think that this caravan by the way he's up to fourteen thousand like the ... newspaper says and ah after that\nOr do you think it's possible I mean it got to be now to be possible there could be people that are terrorists that are just I'm just trying to hide and act like they're not that are part of his ...\n[noise] well I think I think that that what we can say for with some certainty is that\nUh there are people from those countries who are traveling with the caravan it's been reported Univision had a reporter uh with the caravan that put on air Univision a reporter by the name of Francisco Santa Ana\nAh that that he spotted Bangladeshis with the caravan a banquet that she's of course are us what what we call special interest aliens come from a country\nThat is a afflicted deeply afflicted by terrorist activity ISIS and high to uh all through Bangladesh\nAnd also many Bangladeshis going to Syria to fight and return or if Bangladeshis are coming from Bangladesh a through Guatemala and Honduras or on their way here than you know we need to know about it we don't necessarily know that they are terrorists\nOr will say that but what we do know is that uh we are obligated to investigate and vet them to make sure that we know exactly who they are and what their backgrounds are before we uh catch and release them into the country like we probably will with most of everybody else ... caravan\nYou know and you talk about the Bangladeshis I think there was a story right here in Arizona or something like a or it was it in the south Texas border one of them my son was about a week or two ago and Breitbart there was something in the neighborhood of six hundred and something Bangladeshis caught so far uh I Believe this year\nWell it's true or if I was watching Laura Ingraham last night and she had\nA low rate of sector border patrol chief Jason oh in on the air and he said it was six hundred and eighty Bangladeshis alone in his sector knows what it was in twenty Seventeen and there was another two hundred and\nFifty just in the first quarter of this year or so that gives you some that's just one sector so that gives you some idea of the traffic flow\nFrom those countries into I'm into the U.S border sectors and Texas a there's going to be Arizona of course is is gonna be a high traffic area and also the San Diego sector if California so\nSo to hear people like Jeff Flake or you know a Jake trap or on CNN sort of ... all of this uh just sort of is bewildering because this information is being provided to write to them and all they have to do is ask\nA and and you know this is really incredible stuff a is a story in the Washington Post a political analysis of course by some you know fill a bump welcome to the the

Arizona itself a as a stay at home mothers\nA union military members Kim thing they commit acts of terror I mean the chicks nuts and the media protects or they don't like Trump was right and I said it forever there and that they're hiding her past they're hiding her past so I don't know they are they are\nHave but but the thing you need to know the Rio border patrol border patrol agents love your show so much so that when ever you guys asked me to come on come on and and I'm On you guys know that I'm On Fox News all the time but your show is the best I always come on your\nShow well thank you manage resume that I that I really do long that's how we know you're not busy brand new receiver [laughter] and I'm like oh I'm going to Texas guys who have Ryan literally\nSaw you on the TV and hear took the screen it if you're just inside baseball Ryan took a yeah he was waiting for multiple pictures and hoping to catch you in a really bad awkward facial expression which he did and then he takes it to you [laughter]\n\nSo we have Brian love me he knows he does not here in Anchorage millions of a man crush she's got a thing for both people hair it's when [laughter]\nSo ah All right let's let's talk about this uh this ridiculous caravan 'em by the way thank God for your your border patrol colleagues many they are awesome I Know that they listen a lot I Can't think of enough for that they are are they are awesome I have friends\nThat are border patrol agents they show up to the club for men they do all these things and and and they are doing I mean the toughest freaking work possible\nBut there's really no way we can actually stop this caravan because of our laws right\nYeah so so on a serious no you know President Trump says he's going to send the military down order which I Want one hundred percent but let's talk about what the military really is going to do there's nothing that we can we can hold our arms out we can we can put the military hand in hand across two thousand miles before\nBut if somebody put one foot into our country illegally we have to take him into custody and when we take them and see that kicked off the asylum process once we kicked off the asylum process we know darn good while that they're going to be released into the into the country and they're ever going to show up\nThere they're quarter parents as you know it was estimated for years upon years that we had eleven eleven million the illegal aliens in the United states now it's estimated that we have twenty two million illegal aliens and we just continue to add to that population because we don't change our laws and we don't have the right people\nWe don't have the right people in and and for all of your voters out there that's why you have to vote\nFor makes Sally so that we can in fact change the laws we have to ... came to the uh you know we have to have the people that are going to vote for the right laws in the Senate we have to have the right people that are going to vote for the right laws in the in the house and if we don't we're just going to keep this stalemate and we're going to continue to add to the illegal immigration population\nNo man so we you know we really need a wall disappoints but even if we did a wall I mean with the well I mean it if they just continue to go straight to our ports of entry and claimed that they have a credible threat\nI mean it's ... it's just basically a roses this month\nWell yeah let's talk about that and let's let's talk why why why why would in fact ... so if they come to the ports of entry and the ports of entry are just too busy they can turn on the way that that's a legal right of the United states\nSo let's just say that these individuals flood or the no ... for the country no that was part of venture can say look I can only cross the\nX number of people and they can turn the rest of them are white that is a legal process to do and if we did that\nYou you would have people stacked up on Mexico is on the Mexican side and the Mexican government would then have to deal with these people so that's something that we want we want to see that happen and a wall would it would force them to do that but again so let's go back to the military\nSo although the military would not be able to keep anybody out like a wall would what the military does do is it does allow us to deploy our resources to the right location it doesn't um and and it doesn't allow the cartels to create these artificial gaffe yes they've\nAlways been creating these these cartels they want these caravans even encourage future man because what they do is they use them as pawns\nThey forced these these people who need care ban to cross the border illegally and and what that does is it forces us to send our resources that location\nWe didn't take him into custody we report resources out of the field because now we have to process them and then there's these huge gaps that are left in in in order and the caravan\nCan cross the higher um I'm told her products such as opioids or a aliens from special interest countries or criminal aliens is higher value product they they create these artificial gap and then they cross them and the military would stop that so although the military wouldn't be able to stop these people\nFrom putting they're put into the country and forcing them to take them to have him put him in the asylum process what they can do is they can put a dent\nIn the in the cartels profit and if we can put a dent in the cartels profits we can start to control the border which we need to do\nMan it seems so simple brand enjoyed a president of the national border patrol council ... am seven Ninety\nAnd you know let's go back to just one step up because I Want to talk more about that as well but just go back to the asylum situation so\nHe's the only place where you can actually ask for asylum at the port of entry and isn't that the case or can you I mean so if they literally are in the middle of the desert and they cross over a it's not an you know just middle of nowhere and border patrol you and your guys go up to them and they go I'm scared\nI'm I'm I'm In I'm In danger in my country is that the same as if you would do it at a port of entry\n[noise] it ... it is except for the fact that you broke a law prior to ask for asylum so if you come to the port of entry that legal\nUm that's illegal place to enter the country at if you cross the border illegally you committed an illegal act um which we can then prosecute you for 'em but you're asylum claims you'll have to go forward so they can claim asylum\nTo any immigration officer um but but they did commit an act and we then can hold them in custody for as long as we want pending their deportation proceedings but unfortunately we just don't have the resources so they ultimately end up getting really\nThat's what we don't have the room there's no room to hold them correct even though legally we can hold him for the next three years if we wanted we have no place for ... you\nKnow we have a lot of empty buildings in Tucson because we already [laughter]\nWe we have a solution we have a freaking solution we need people
