what are the Democrats said they're going to do to make it better for people\nSo when they see this headline you know you have the jobs of course two hundred twenty seven thousand added in October September by the way we're buys upward\nUpward\nThey weren't ... they they it was short to Eighteen to to thirty two hundred thirty thousand so you have this other story CNBC wages and salaries jump by three point one percent highest level in a decade\n\nOverall compensation costs were up to ... percent ahead of Wall Street expectations\n\nWages have been the missing piece in the economic recovery either the fed has been raising rates to guard against future inflationary pressures but three point one percent and the third quarter they gone to a higher than a decade um\nThis is incredible incredible stuff\nWhen I came up after your first question about the Democrats said they're gonna do sure when they were gonna you know undo the the tax cuts that Donald Trump gave us\nWhat are they going to do they're going to take them away Davis sucked crumbs not that much anyway what else wasn't listen you know we'd we'd be at least and Nancy Pelosi and I would do much better with your money than you would with it\nCan you imagine I mean you mentioned a neighbor and knocking on your ... indoor hey um I think you should give me your money no one else would you vote for Nancy freaking Pelosi to just take it\nLegally so dumb\nSo dumb this right here on the website or get raise income and restore way wrong thing no no no no no your ego yes\nUh don't where they're gonna go their papa John's slogan okay I Want to read all of his clothes the racial wealth gap didn't Trump do that that's one of their goals\nIn Trump do that so All right we have that kind of stuff about what let's talk about the migrants real quick migrants as well get to the Halloween stuff again uh the migrant caravan did you hear this number ten drift drink it's doing great work\nWhat a job by the way I imagine being freaking embedded with the ah the migrant Caribbean down their holy smokes it came out yesterday that we don't know who's providing this maybe it's the Mexican towns like get these people out of here I don't know\nBut apparently the migrants no longer walking as much they are getting bust coach buses now there it was reported today that they saw the coach buses yesterday but there weren't ... they were they were like eleven eighty eighty apparently to get everybody so the restaurant like we're waiting for buses to and of course by the way the men were just\nBut no way in their these great guys women with strollers\nNow not so much I'm listening to grip Jenkins report about the buses they haven't seen this before or listen to this\nShow you something new that's developing here and that as we've seen the\nFour or five thousand strong caravan walking to the border but it seems now they're doing more of waiting for a ride to the border this is the only time I've seen since I've been here and organize bus operation\nFrom this data wild hog are actually getting volunteer buses to put people unload on them and take him to their next location and that's very significant now because\nYou know these towns they can do to help them when we began this ah way back a week or so or more when the Mexican police were trying to dissuade them from coming across the water all Mexican border it seems now some of the least in towns are really assessing then to make known way now there's been a little bit attentions on some of\nThese because they're trying to get\nThe buses are women and children yet I merely but in many cases the husbands with them or the\nFather and they don't want to be separated and in some cases just the men were drink up at least ... percent of them in an entire Caribbean or more wants to be in there but here's the real problem is only eleven buses so far that we've counted it we're told is coming and he would made upwards of eighty or more buses actually we've everyone so I Am going to get rides that's going to make for\nSome as they go next to the next up you get a Hoosier Don Was about thirty miles from where I'm standing and we'll get back the way they want to go to Mexico City and then they want to get the U.S border theater there you\nGo\nWell see this baby buses and again the Mexican ambassador\nSet an NPR that some of these uh migrants they are very violence\nGuns of mixing police confirmed guns they're throwing rocks at the Mexican police very violent let them all in about oh did you hear this United Nations the United nations refugee agency is now demanding that President Trump allow these migrants\nInto the United states un telling us what this is why the un sucks I Wish we could just defunded\nLetterman how about we just put them in your country\nUn says they're fleeing persecution violence no we played a thousand soundbites on this show\nThey want jobs and he'd work I Need work we need jobs no there's no work\nVoice of America and interview voice of America Andre may make whatever spokesman for the un refugee earth Fiji agency said\nOur position globally\nIs that the individuals who are fleeing persecution of violence need to be given access to territory and protection including refugee status\nThose entering the U.S need to be provided access to the American asylum system\nSo what about the ones that are like in Africa or be made to the diamonds and if you don't dig fast enough to cut off your fingers or your hand or your foot or your family away and kids listen listen\nTo the same un that again has a China or an Iran on the human rights council so full of it and you wonder why you know this is my Trump Jack's with the UN as he should as he should\nYeah\nSo nice right now a one more one more real quick we have time I think I think we have time\nI think we have time for this um we'll get back to the Halloween stuff we have some great
