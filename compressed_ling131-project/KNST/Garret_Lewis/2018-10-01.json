Chris don't I don't care if it's something that like I said first flake later [laughter] so\nApparently those two guys got on stage 'cause he's a superstar now Jeff Flake right soon as it gets on stage at global citizens best they love me now because I screwed\nOver Trump in the country and screwed over conservative oh yeah\nBy the way here and Jeff Flake talk it's like it's like demands on the toilet struggling to get one out so much for the show is that is what he said\nI just I just don't think that the countries being torn up artist who talks like that\nHe does\nAnyone not to gross you out this early in the morning but it's\nSo anyway Jeff Flake apparently yelled out to the crowd I got to find this on YouTube and by the way this is important PG media good job for them Jeff Flake yelled out to the crowd on stage with and get ready to be mad with Chris Coons quote\nYou can join me in an elevator any\nTime yes yes\nYou can join me in an elevator anytime meaning when he got yelled at by those women we played at the end of the show on friday right we he got yelled at by those women and those women think that he changed his well they probably did like Lindsey Graham kind of listen to the women and said okay I Gotcha in just kept on walking\nAnd Jeff Flake set sat there and took it and apparently he can be he's week week yeah and it can be influenced that way\nWe Jeff Flake so that this do\nStand on the stage you can join me in an elevator any time yeah a\n... a\nBunch of young people that think Bernie Sanders is cooler applauding the city it\nThey don't even know who the hell he is Jeff Jeff Flake is ridiculous\nWho's the other guy you wouldn't get into the elevator with in Congress oh John Conyers hunter\nYeah you can join me to later they away from John Wayne\nWhile at global citizens festival apparently one of the one of the performers is Janet Jackson the throwback Thursday Janet Jackson she got on stage and said quote I'm sick I'm repulsed I'm infuriated by the double standards that continue to threaten women as second class citizens\nEnough [noise] um I'm asking all women maybe even you it is you are you treated as second class citizen what rights have you lost I'm curious about that\nWe have we have another woman in the studio today go undergoing training\nAlexis grabbed the microphone real quick\nOr you treat it as a second class citizen in this country\nEven though it being treated as second class status in his life now [laughter]\nI don't know that they make you sit in the back of the bus do not get the fair treatment as other people you not only to get on the ... do you do not even sure I used to think that they well they say you know it's a little frightening sometimes isn't it yeah yes so you do not do you do not get a fair shot in this country\nNow I like that but that's\nOkay thank you thank you very much Alexis alliance it started off the microphone I'm just [laughter] it's just funny to me to keep\nDoing this so because I called her Alexa one time one one time and it's never going to be forgotten you could do something out of it no no no wait till the break\nSo Janet Jackson's there's a saying that stuff and again this is where Jeff Flake is Jeff Flake is literally hearty he's so upset about the country being torn apart he's partying global citizen festival\nHe has morphed into I mean we knew he was John McCain but he literally has morphed into John McCain\n... this this is the ultimate this is the ultimate let's do a number of Ninety two on sixty minutes last night the man who was born with a painful look on his face and he can't lose it just like like give me a guinea just have to look ...\nJeff Flake speaking with ah I forget what whatever sixty minutes guy who apparently really talks in the same cadence and tone which is so unrealistic anyway the guy from sixty minutes I forget his name 'cause it's irrelevant to me or listen to this year ago\nSenator Flake you've announced that you're not running for reelection\nWonder could you have done this\nIf you were running out of ... you know a jazz show\nBecause politics has become too sharp to Oregon there is no value to reaching across the aisle they're so currency for that anymore there's no incentive\nSo the moral compass because you know he wrote his book the conscious of the conservative which so like Eighteen hundred copies\nSo this guy that is the moral compass right Trump is a jerk he's in he's terrible he's a brute he's all this stuff Jeff Flake I Am or we need better we need to do we get the big speech against Trump we need better right we need better\nApparently this guy that is such a big moral compass would have not said we need to do better and work together if he was running for reelection\nSo the only reason he actually did this is because he's not running for reelection honest Jeff Flake like honesty as any ... so you sit back and say wow you are such a fraud you're such a such a joke you don't have the guts to stand up for what you believe\nYou don't if you're you could just admitted it so now I Want to know what are the decisions have you made Jeff\nThat\nThat maybe you would go back on because you were running for reelection what would you have done differently what else would you lie to yourself you're willing to sit there and not do the right thing you do you think this is the right thing in your mind but you wouldn't have done the right thing if you were running for reelection\nA Jeff Flake and Chris Coons by the way another like a whole bunch of ... you go to a concert a money go to this concert his global citizens festivals whatever\nAnd and you're out there you're waiting for the next act to begin you're sitting on a lawn you haven't probably fourteen dollar beer\nOr whatever it is right you know you're just you had to the back maybe just smoke and a little any and all of a sudden to politicians come out and you're like really nothing nothing kills your bus more than a couple of there'll be politicians coming out a couple of guys and slacks\nThe or the shirts tucked in one guy with the sleeves folded up all fits right in\nAll of a sudden you you know it's a it's Batman and Robin is Jeff Flake and Chris Coons the odd couple maybe not so odd listen to this year we go\n[noise]\nSupport bipartisan leadership on foreign aid [noise]\nWe need the rest of the world [noise]\nIt's the democracy working here at home and reaching out because we hear you on democracy and we need to keep hearing\nFrom you at all to say don't feel free to join me in an

January that this happened they liked me it really really liked me\nGet really quick head of this all start uh I Want you to play a sound bite form if you don't mind Alexis a number Ninety One Chris Coons Chris Coons talked about the situation on sixty minutes with the guy you know it's the guy that had failed at the CBS Evening news job\nOr if it's his fault they're not nobody really watches network news anymore but whatever uh this is what this is what took place here we go\nThere's a moment in the hearing in which Senator Flake walks by essentially taps on your shoulder and the two of you walk out what happened when you walked out of the\nFallen Jackson to the ante room and he said very intently is tearing our country apart we have to do something we have to do\nSomething okay that's all we know about you know there's no Democrats said this is bad we have to do something we're destroying the guy's life we have to do something by the way Jeff Flake again if you're running for reelection would you not care for the country being torn apart and you're ... you're not care\nFraud fraud or we have so much more to get to a including ... will get your comments later about Jeff Flake\nWell you sound off on that I keep it clean though keep it clean\nSo we have that we've got to get to ... ... blowing up the Internet because he decided to go on to SNL after the show and wears

[noise]\nThe physical activity a day in eating well get your child help keep them active and eating well every day\nGet ideas get involved get going and let's move dot Gov\nMatt let's move down the old the message from USDA ha gentleman and he had council\nAnd it's gone from the region will studio your local sushi areas where you can well darn calm KNX deep into the night and I are radio station [noise]\nIt's back to work at the Supreme Court I'm Dave Anthony Fox News and Brett Kavanaugh's not they're just eight justices will hear the first two cases of the new term it starts as ours the FBI continues a week long investigation and Kavanaugh's second accuser was interviewed yesterday Republican Senator Tom cotton supports the nominee and told CBS\nAh in about an hour we're going to probably carry some of the Trump press conference because there is a been a deal reached with the U.S and Canada new trade agreement NAFTA by NAFTA NAFTA's going the way of Jeff Flake which is awesome so why it's going to be better for auto workers better for farmers were going to more access our dairy farmers more access to\nAnd then there are more ... car parts can be built in America more in Canada as well so it's good for everybody right good for everybody second thing another promise kept by the way the second thing that I think you need to know I'm\nThe woman that was a prosecutor asking questions of Christine forward and Brett Kavanaugh Rachel Ford I'm Sorry Rachel Mitchell the one that was up in America the county's limit to D.C she put out a mental extend to the to members of or the Republican members of Congress\nWhere she said in it she did give details as to why she came up with this um this belief but she said this\nCases even weaker they said she wrote there is a he said she said case they're incredibly difficult to prove but this cases even weaker than that Dr Ford identified other witnesses to the event and those witnesses refuted her allegations or failed to corroborate them\nDo not it's all you need isn't it so she said\nI Do not think a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the committee nor I Believe this evidence is sufficient to satisfy the monitoring of the evidence standard so what she's saying is that there's nothing there yet there is a freaking FBI investigation for seven days\nSeven days seven day delight\nAnd Jeff Flake couldn't figure this out by listening to her questions than answers what are they paying attention we'll get to that third thing I think you need to know\nRight third thing or is that I'm\nSorry I'm getting Texas is all happening and it's loud and my eight year how to turn my phone so the third thing that I think you need to know is that jerk Jeff Flake admitted in on the sixty minutes show last night he admitted that he never would have called for a delay and reach across party lines if it was running for\nReelection but the the country was being torn apart something must be done but\nYeah I guess he believed that who knows but he never would have done it if he was running for reelection honest Jeff Flake typical lion corrupt politician right three things I think you need to know\nA so this is what I'm Wondering to see it ... I watched the hearings I don't know if you watch the hearings you get the highlights of the hearings everything else really quickly get to the ... stuff all that stuff\nBut the biggest story in the country besides the trade deal should be what this Rachel Mitchell wrote down as to why she wrote why she came to the conclusion that there would not be a reasonable prosecutor that would bring this case based on evidence before the committee and it's all based on what she asked Dr Ford for all those hours\nSo you have flake that phony phony Jeff Flake\nHe was one of the senators listening all these Democrats that of corrupt as hell I mean they're just they're just in a power grab yeah these Republicans you have these do you have the Murkowski and you have and you have Susan Collins\nThey're all listening to the same questions and answers that this Rachel Mitchell is saying and that Christine Ford is answering and yet only Rachel Mitchell came to the conclusion well compared to these other people she came to the conclusion that there is nothing here\nAll the witnesses she identified refuted ... allegations are failed to corroborate them nobody would bring this case based on evidence nobody would so she did that based on the question answers so I'm Wondering was Jeff Flake sleeping with his eyes open\nWith these Democrats paying attention or they just so damn corrupt and stupid\nMean they're sitting there listening and watching the same thing as this Rachel Mitchell who was asking the questions\nYou guys are getting paid a hundred and Seventy something thousand a hundred thousand bucks a year to be senators you get the best benefits in the country best health benefits best ... you get a pension after five years you get paid for a life after serving just five years\nWhere are you paying attention at work were you on Facebook\nYour hands down on your phone playing like I don't know what are these we you play Fortnite on your phone can you do that can you play for down on the phone you can okay well you're doing it\n\nIt's just freaking obvious\nThere's incredible information ... you know what's crazy is that it's stuff that you and I both\nKnow right we know\nHere's a one of the things that Rachel Mitchell Roach Dr Ford struggled to recall important recent events relating to her allegations\nEntered testimony regarding recent events racist further questions about her memory Dr Ford struggle to remember interactions with the Washington Post Dr Ford couldn't remember she showed a full or partial set of therapy nose to the Washington Post reporter she doesn't remember whether she showed the post report of a therapist notes or her own summary of those notes\nWashington Post article said portions of her therapist Notre provided by Ford and reviewed by the post but her testimony Dr Ford couldn't recall whether she summarize the notes for the reporter or showed her the actual notes\nWe'd go on and on we can do it all I\nAll of these things you would go number five Dr Ford to count the alleged assault has not been corroborated by anyone she identified as having attended including her lifelong friend\n\nDr Ford named three people Kavanaugh judge PJ Smith enter lifelong friend leaned Kaiser\nFour testified in another voice into the parties couldn't remember his name and all of his came forward all three eyewitnesses named eyewitnesses submitted statements the committee denying any memory of the party I mean what more do you need to know right what more\n\nThis is craziness absolutely craziness\nEight eight zero can as the eight zero five six seven eight and my wife and I Saturday morning [noise] kids are eating breakfast actually had a breakfast before that I had to get my son to soccer pictures came back were in the kitchen all of us\n\nWhat we laugh at me for it 'cause I couldn't make it play soccer no no somebody semi your taxes is Trump's magic wand Obama asked about and it's a picture of a spine nah nah [laughter] there you go so no shouts so um\nWe're watching then we're what we put on Fox's were sitting there eating breakfast or having some coffee in the kitchen\nAnd Lexus need to be a soundbite 'cause it's just relates to everything it's like it's bizarro world number Ninety eight please Neal ... on Saturday morning on Fox my wife and I are watching this and I just like to gauge her reaction because she's a big litmus test she doesn't think she should agree with more of what I say she likes to argues me sometimes but would expect rights marriage\nShe agrees almost everything I say and that's why she's wrong about some things but there's kudos show on Fox and\nA couple of attorneys one obviously Republican attorney one democratic attorney\nOf Angeline Gomez\nIs obviously the left leaning attorney that hates cabin on Trump and I left the question from ... who do and they're just so everything is in contact you don't think I'm making up this stuff this is one of the most incredible things right this woman's lawyer listen to it it's all about cooperation and evidence listen to this area\nOf the water or through the series of interviews confined no core operation for Dr forwards charges or something real happened or what but the FBI and so we can find no core operations out it was indeed\nThe judge on I think what you're saying it's a great point I'm feeling old cooperation in regular\nWeight alligator alley animals they're on like how ... how to end it fine corroborate are you\nKidding me right now go go back to about\nRight after ten seconds going to drag that back to about ten seconds you don't mind just just just to play one more time 'cause that actually happened here we go and play play\nThat it was indeed the judge on\nI think what you're saying is a great point I'm killing ruled cooperation in\nRegular we only have a copy corroborate ... hot and to find her own\nI mean do you really need cooperation yes when ... when a woman or anybody accuses when anybody accuses us by a person of a crime yes you need corroboration otherwise people would be thrown in jail counselor based\nAnd someone saying something isn't that you're saying when are you I mean I heard my wife was losing your mind at that point I was losing my mind at that point I\nMean do you really need cooperation I mean this woman said that he did this isn't that good enough no no no ... no and it was the definition of preparation I Believe they are only is one definition of cooperation\nThat actually happened\n\nOh let's go to go to Charlie take a call why not controlling what can they can as the hello\nAnd thank you for taking my call your um [noise] I just want to make a decision I went to the University of Virginia and I pay close attention to the gang rape case that happened here several years ago\nAnd I think the Democrats run from that case was either a room Jackie specific allegations and recollections eastern that have happened at a specific fraternity or specific Carmen that there was a party\nHi Garrett Hi and that kid a couple of weeks ago drawn down to low [laughter] talk to carry out it\nWas it was it was it a good meeting or a bad meeting I don't know I enjoyed it too\n[laughter] hey listen I is\nJust merely pulling my hair out every time I had the media or whether it be conservative media regular meat it came came over to facts of her not remembering\nSitting there mhm and the cabinet issue and getting home and it it it occurs to me that that is the key to the entire thing because she has in her memory\nIs that you know but she can't remember you know why she can't remember 'cause she wouldn't have name who brought her her how she got there and they went and the terror witness that if she had to say how she got home if she walked six miles home she would remember that she\nWould aren't are handy and I'm gonna hang in Louis ... came\nUp a new name who took her home so that's another witness isn't it can be that she doesn't remember how she got there has to get home because if she did and they would question those people and they would have to live as well as\nShe conveniently doesn't remember though do you think that I think those are the big issue here that everybody overlooking just coming over that\nNo it's a big deal and may maybe she doesn't remember it because it never even happened either\nThat's what I'm saying I don't think I'd ever happen and all my friends\nAre talking about today says they're just so many holes in her testimony and what she said that she doesn't remember it's really convenient that she you know has got all the home and then of course the the psychologist who came on and said when you go undergo I'm a ... know\nThat they can plant actual memories ...\nDuring that time and that you know for the fact that in her report Brett Kavanaugh was named as never mentioned as the\nOne who is the one who\nThey are so many issues that we're hearing a lot of my friends are just like hopping mad out\nHere and and you know like your your two points are great and your top that often I think even more important than yours are right up there it's like one in one a one anyone be is the fact that no witnesses corroborate her story or can backer up they say we don't know what the hell she's talking about and then she has\nThat sweating because those are the ones that everybody's getting over how she got there and how she got\nHome there you go and and that's why you sit back and say Jeff Flake you called for another week or you're not listening to the words that she says and I wish that sixty minutes don't would have said you know listen to everything that she said\nBecause I'm trying to make a John K yeah on land where down is\nDown in what he's doing he's he's trying to get some attention he's always been an attention getter and Michael Savage said it best liberals have mental disorder\nGo out to see the next beer club lowest thing and then\nTake care of the women are invited now again you know get to more of your calls but this this is what's just insane if I were able to talk to Jeff Flake that probably my first question now why do you do this I'd say did you not listen to the questions and the answers\nBecause if you did there's no way you'd say we need another week of investigating you'd say man maybe something happened to her but she has so many holes in her story there's no way in hell and we can hold this brand cannabis Kevin Guy accountable which is exactly what Rachel Mitchell said\nSeven thirty three will continue

she exonerated\n\nHere's my bottom line he said she said cases incredibly difficult to prove this cases even weaker met Dr Ford identified other witnesses to the event and those witnesses refuted her

quote the U.S Senate me yet confirm Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court but he should stay off basketball courts for now when kids are around so they're basically saying that he's like a pedophile or something like that\n[noise] [noise]\nYeah so the Internet blew up on Saturday ...\nThe guy wrote to the nation is deeply divided sometimes it feels like we don't agree on anything anymore would

happened credibly accused sex offenders\nShould not coach basketball girls or boys without deeper investigation can we all agree on that this guy wrote\n\nYeah uh he wonders how Kavanaugh can actually interact with these students student athletes at all all this stuff\nAh then after the Internet blew up they took out the part where they hit that that he is kind of a pedophile they can do that\nAnd
