take us back ah when Trump pulled us out of the Paris climate agreement I Know that had to wear exploding\nYes uh back in two thousand Seventeen died when Trump rescinded the climate agreement\nA Pima County a board of supervisors in June of two thousand Seventeen they passed a resolution that they were going to support that climate change resolution and now they've come up with an a a sustainable action plan to meet that climate change\nAnd one of the requirements is there is to reduce your carbon emissions down below that two thousand five level by twenty six to twenty eight percent\nSo that's one at the uh goals set the Pima County sustainable action plan [laughter] excuse me which was passed yesterday and ah which means we have to reduce our projected twenty twenty five\nAh emissions I a fifty percent\nI twenty twenty five and eight you know and the next seven years and you start looking at this and that plan and it's a very detailed plan that covers carbon water landscapes and material that we use\nAnd some of it is common sense things that anybody would be doing like recycling reuse fusing reclaim water those kinds of things makes sense to me but then when you start talking about\nAll of these you know lead silver LEED certified buildings you got to look at the trade off with a ...\nAnd I did ask Huckleberry a couple of questions yesterday one of the things they want to do it by ... open space okay and we are already young almost eighty four thousand acres of opens\nA window unit and by who owns that land right now is it it just people just the federal government the state of Arizona where they buying it's owned\nBy Pima County and that's dedicated in perpetuity can be preserved is natural open space and so they want to get more open space and as you know it's like between twelve and fourteen percent of the land and Pima County is on the tax role so they want to take even more land up the tab\nYou're going to say so they want to take that who who owns that land right now in the county\nWell this land is owned by Pima County because over the years a Pima County has bought up all of this open space land and we'll be dedicated to get this that section pen her met a guy from the federal government\nSo were they were they buying it for like they're buying it from themselves\nOh yeah he's a county than buying this land and and it was you know the tax payers devoted to buy all of this open space and so it's like a you know we thought a lot of ranch is weak back you open space in general\nAnd what was the point of that was it to make sure that nobody would buy it and like the old on it or they don't think\nIt's part of the ... desert conservation plan guy which show was it proved to years ago and people want it to preserve that Lance people want a more open space here which has happened\nBut you know you start looking at it and you go why are we going to be buying more open space and you know wildlife court or linkages and that kinda thing and\nI don't know if you're aware of it already up in ... valley you know they built the wildlife bridge\nOh yeah and the residents\nAre pretty much all up in arms because apparently they're having problems getting the animals to use the bridge\nOr even heard that\nIt's up around residential areas that are kind of ugly I guess and the residents are very upset about that they don't want 'em around their yards or you know looking out the window and looking at these ugly fences which are rallying the animals trying to force\nThat bridge so it's those kinds of things and uh you know I just looked at it and I said this is going to cost a fortune yeah they're they're having all kinds of managers are heading outreach programs education programs\nUh all of these things that are going to cost a lot of money at electric cars\nA silver LEED certified buildings\nAnd so I'm sitting there thinking yesterday I'm going okay electric cars why don't we start with let's buy a whole lot less of these cars there were three supervisors\nThat have a county car there are a lot of managers down there that don't need it county car I had one when I first got elected and I realize this is a way we don't need these cars we don't need to be paying for cars we don't need to be\nHaving a county supervisors managers county attorney than they thought that ... county ... only ...\nYou know here's the thing they do because you don't have a car my I have to drive to work every day yeah why why do I you know so you do the public's were go get a job in the private sector then yeah I mean\nYeah there's things like you know the sheriff's department vehicles and you know a vehicles\nThat need to be used for waste water that kind of thing that we do need but I think we could cut out probably forty to fifty percent of these vehicles\nWill let me ask you this to about ... supervisor ... game seven Ninety eight years he revise or do you I mean do you put on a ridiculous amount of miles is it unfair if you don't have a car\nNo because you can turn in your mileage and get reimbursed for it they have you know so I drive my car I don't turn in mileage 'cause it's just easier for me to just drive\nAnd it it's more hassle for me to do their work but driving around the district I mean if I have to go to a meeting and on the way back oh stop at the grocery store you know that kind of close to where I Would have gone anyway\nSo I don't bother a very seldom do I turn in my life to report\nThe Sharon Bronson epic Oregon\nYes she does um I was surprised I thought she I didn't realize that she did that yeah we just got a report on the county cars they haven't been through it a completely to get the total number\nShould yeah go through and I'm kind of drivers course after she wrecked won by driving into a wall of [laughter] I mean I usually when I hear your ear to take a course here in our media every year we've done nothing wrong with the girl that I have to take all these different courses\nAbout rules and blah blah blah blah you know she literally destroyed a county car by driving into a wall of water yeah you know shouldn't watch a video or be told by someone as you should sign documents that have happened\nBut I I Do know they have a program if you're going to be driving a county vehicle you are supposed to take a course\nAnd I think it's a one at one hour course or something at the online thing oh yeah they are but\nYou know one of the things they're talking about is you know we've got to have less carbon in the air well I got a plan for your check how about fixing the roads how about widening thorny delta four lanes like should have been it's been on a plant since the mid nineties\nHow about doing that instead of having these traffic back that these are things we can do without implementing this whole plan that will actually have an impact at some colder\nWhere these roads get blocked off every time we have a rainstorm and the other issue we have with that is we have this heavy equipment\nGreat big old those are I Know a lot where I live there out here for days after every rainstorm pumping carbon into the air is they're cleaning up the dirt that crosses that were out there's there's like truckloads of Sam that they have to clean up every time those are just\nYou know kind of minor things that they could do that would have an impact a you know and and going to all electric vehicles as you know a hybrid and electric they're already has been moving in that direction well they don't pay gas tax\nSo we've got to make sure the legislature passes something to start charging these electric cars and these hybrid cars at the for driving on the roads because they're not paying for um\nWell you know that by the way I mean I I I'll send you this do you should probably and and I'm sure to have no impact because they are going to vote the way they're going to vote and Germans three two yeah but there was a study from Bloomberg new energy financing barrels strategy out of ... advisors\nOr the another study questions electric vehicles are good for the environment because apparently the manufacturing of the lithium ion batteries that power it it takes a so much energy or it actually there's so much carbon dioxide produced\nThat does anything by the way to the environment but there's so much carbon dioxide emitted into the production of these batteries that it it it's actually worse to ... I had heard about that and also\nSo that people aren't driving extra mile their vehicles are sitting there idling\nBut you know these kinds of things they don't really care about they want to work with the EU as a research projects they want to build silver LEED certified buildings\nAll of this costs money and when you look through it the plan is on line he has it up there there's all kinds of implementation programs outreach programs\nEducation programs up just to develop the plan and they had at least Fifteen department managers and their staff attending\nFifty meeting oh my God yeah that's the hours and hours of employee time that it costs money none of this is for free yeah and you know we've got all of these other pressing issues they really you know there are number one priority is fixing the road no you got to pay an extra tax to fix the ...\nAnd that's the thing it prompted a profit for sixty three where they want to raise taxes again just fix the roads yet\nThey want to fix the roads little creature taxes for that but meanwhile we've got all this money to burn yeah on\nOn these kinds of initiatives and it's common sense folks we don't need to create these color binders and have all these meetings it's common sense\nThings that we need to be doing that we could be doing within these departments right now without having to spend a whole lot of money and trying to uh you know meet the Paris accords yeah\nThat's that's if we try to if we truly tried to get there it's going to cost us a fortune and um you know and and that impacts\nThe taxes and it also impacts any businesses coming in here we already have three times the tax rate of Maricopa County\nAnd we have to subsidize businesses we have to build them buildings worldview for example Seventeen million we at that built caterpillar eight fifty million dollar ... a re a new way though did that Pima County gave them face to stay and until they get that building built at four to five million costs\nPeople think that we can continue to do this to pay companies to come here uh we can't afford to do this and eventually they will run out of taxpayer money because people are getting really sick of getting nothing for their taxes\nAnd this is just another step in my opinion\nIn the wrong wrong direction because they're focusing on things that are are going to cost money and add to our already overburdened taxpayers rather than look at the common sense things and they keep saying the roads are the number one priority but if you come to the board meetings you'll see every week it is not\nTo do anything but the roads and real quick they so they want to build new buildings county buildings as silver lead and I think\nWe are so many empty buildings as it is what why do we need to keep building more county officers and buildings we have enough of them\nYeah meanwhile they buy a bowling alley that's full of asbestos than in Brighton heights and we're going to remodel that that makes sense and no four to five million remodeling it uh it it they do not walk the walk you know they they come in and say you know we're doing all of this to appease the environmentalists\nAnd then they're off doing all these other crazy things and uh you know ... or ... acquiring golf courses that we don't need yup uh and and that's going to cost us you know it's at least a hundred thousand a year just to maintain that plus we\nHave ... you know it it it never ends and do you start looking at\nThis and it's very frustrating to sit there and watch them make a big deal out of this when in fact the United states is the number one\nCountry and reducing carbon emissions and all we have to do is follow Trump fleet yup and do the right things and and let the market work and and just look at comments that no one is against recycling\nProtecting the environment everyone wants to do that and and just make sure you're doing the right thing since ... out this really expensive and shit us\nAren't real quick I get twenty seconds because people are going to say what can we do I got a mad and you got above the right way but he is there anything else is there is there there's really no way to reach these people as there\nUm you know I I I always ask people contact your supervisors not just me contact them let them know what you're feeling and I think you know and twenty twenty five supervisors are up for election and people need to um\nPay attention we had hoped last election and twenty sixteen that we would get a change on that board it did not happen yeah and that's the sad thing\nIs that people don't pay enough attention to what's going on here locally and your property taxes are a big part of your bills every month and so you know I guess how people are really awake and paying attention to what's going on\nI did have a gentleman come up to me yesterday going I Can't believe what's going on here I have no idea what the man was\nThat he was sitting back he walked up to me he was in shock at what he was witnessing when I ask them questions like how much did the sacred cost us oh you'll have to add up the numbers from all the bond election how much where that data for fourteen million you say we say you can calculate that\nThey don't even give it to you know no no no uh Huckleberry refuses to give them the information whenever I ask for it done he teases me interfering with county employees and that it's too expensive to get the information this is what's going on with your government\nAnd by the way is Steve really quick I'm going to talk to you Steve Christie backing you up and saying we're just information as you do just sit there and just be quiet\nNow he doesn't he doesn't ask where the man what a disappointment African guy as well have you know some guy he's still on what he thinks he needs to do a and ... cronyism soul there yeah I'm I'm pretty disappointed might have like an alibi horrible yeah um so what\nWhat we're doing is trying to do the best we can to get people educated and I am absolutely against that prop for sixty trade because why get a new tax when we have money to burn on these kinds of\nThings and and I hope people I think people everyone I talked to they're sick of being taxed and um you know people are telling me they're voting now ...\n... and I hope they should they and they should and I was I'm just

the caravan will talk to Jessica Vaughan is just a second from the center for immigration\nStudies to find that if this is even possible\nA third thing I think you need to know America once again amazingly enough once again is number one in the world the most competitive economy haven't been that way since two thousand eight funny never happened during Obama huh yeah uh three things I think you need to know so it all of this caravan stuff going on\nI mean we need to talk the expert the best of the best uh and that is\nDirector of policy studies at the center for Immigration Studies Jessica Vaughan Jessica thank you so much for the time today how you doing\nGood to talk with you well same here let's start before the Caribbean a European email you were in Phoenix and you actually experienced rain would shock to you you were not expecting that a lot of ... when it when it rains it pours year when it doesn't rain often so I knew you send me a pictures and these are just unbelievable\nYou were in Phoenix you had meetings and then you went to the greyhound bus station in Phoenix\nRight well that's where I was told that uh all of the hundreds of cases that are starting to show up in the Arizona border factors were being dropped off now by on the border patrol\nAnd sometimes I ah because there are so many people coming now through Arizona that they have nowhere to put them and they are forced to get\nThem they were taking them to the bus station dozens and dozens at a time and most of them are not staying in Arizona they're headed toward town near me I mean ... ... and ...\nIt's it's a pretty interesting site um it's it's very alarming that first of all that it's happening in Arizona now because almost all of it this was going on in South Texas before\nUh and now they there there must be a new smuggling operation that's opened up with a new deal with a different cartel or to get over the Arizona border but that's what they're doing and of course\nYou know they just need to say that\nThey need to bring a child and say that they have a fear of return and our uh our policy right now to just release them into the country drop 'em off at the bus station the humanitarian groups that monitor these things were complaining that they were being dumped at the station without um you know\nFood and water and now us taxpayers are giving them plastic bags full with a with a box lunch and a bottle of water\nAnd you know you can see them with their on below you know with the department of homeland security feel on them that says that's that's their permission to be here now and they're off a two communities all over the country and um\nWe probably will not see them show up according to ice only about a third of them will cut off the ankle bracelets that they are given to monitor their whereabouts you know from the get go\nMost of them don't file an asylum application and those that do half of them don't show up for their immigration court hearing so this is basically um you know kind of illegal immigration and illegal settlement happening right in plain sight\nUm with with no resistance from the government it's our policies that are anti seen them here and that's when you know of course a wall would help too\nI was gonna say what a wall I mean it'd be just wrote up to a wall they couldn't do anything right it is with nicely\nThey they'd have to go to another place to cry that that might be more difficult and maybe they would you know realize that that's too dangerous to do a and but it it's right now out of control\nAnd uh now of course we have this caravan coming up from Central America forward\nAnd before that real quick and this is just going to you're listening to she's with the center for Immigration Studies a C I F dot org or is the website 'cause people listening right now you know they're saying what does the Trump do something about this is there any I mean because we've been reading stories last two or three weeks again like you said people are charging the border\nAnd you're taking advantage of the system and we're being overrun we don't have the facilities to hold them so we're just releasing them so is there anything that actually can be done in anything can Trump do anything I think there are\nThings that can be done I give the administration credit for doing the attorney general Jeff Sessions has has um\nHold a vote to adjudicate asylum applications that they need to get back to what the law says and that means only people who are actually being persecuted by the government in their home country which is not the case with most of these people and they you know they're working with\nThe courts to try to overturn\nSome of these ah frankly irrational decisions that have been made by nine thirty nine one nine circuit judge 'em that limits how long they can detain people who come with a child\nBut they have to do more CBP needs to step up and actually start taking some responsibility for these cases instead of just dumping them on ice and into the immigration courts that's not enough food\nCan they do I mean can you can you hold on can they hold them and they turn around and make them go back with what can be done\nI think they should try the best thing is that they do not make it\nInto the country at all to the border at all and the president is putting pressure on Central American countries that didn't seem to work too much and also Mexico now I did read this morning that one of the organizers of this caravan that's coming has now been arrested\nYes in Guatemala Honduras horn on and on your it you'll get\nYou know we don't read too much about deportation from Guatemala but it happened apparently and Mexico doesn't have to let them in Mexico under Mexican immigration law if they enforce it they people have to have a transit visa\nAnd so they don't have to issue them transit visas if they don't qualify under Mexican law which apparently they do not but again you know\nHow susceptible are Mexican immigration officials to look the other way for some of these people we we don't really know but now that at least there's a lot of attention\nOn Mexico to see what they're going to do and they're going to be implications for our relationship with Mexico if they are not seen as a good neighbor so I'm happy to see the Trump Administration actually saying\nYou know we're ... we're not happy with this or something you can do about it we're going to hold you accountable for it in other ways one I don't have finally has to\nDo crazy things that you have this on during the former Honduran lawmaker obviously a nut arrested in Guatemala\nBringing these people over it's obviously Guatemala and Honduras want money from us which is why they are willing to arrest this guy and maybe they're going to stop this Caribbean I don't know if they can but then I read also that China is trying to get involved in China seems like they're willing to pony up some cash\nSo almost as saying well Guatemala and Honduras the u._s. just stick it will cover your losses with them\nBecause they want our ally China should take the migrants then I I agree\nBut in China will do it they'll stick them in in ... they just want to pay them also there are a peanut butter ... and I think China just messing with us obviously\nYeah well if it gets to the point that you know these governments don't cooperate will deal with that but when they get if they get I think actually I think it's when they get to the border some of them are going to make it for various reasons\nWe need to just say enough is enough\nYou're going to sit in temporary holding facilities until we go through our due process and make that due process last a couple of hours and then you're going back that's the only thing that I was going to deter people is to have them going home\nOr they're not going to be allowed to stay here for years on end you know and cut off their ankle monitors we have to simply say do not have a credible fear of return we're sending you home and if these governments don't cooperate\nWith their swift repatriation at that point we need to say okay we're done issuing visas or we're going to pack up our consular section in your country and come home because you're not cooperating under US law that means visa sanctions\nAnd it you know we get about your trip to Disneyland forget about your trip to Vegas you know any ...\nAny of that ... is that one of the problem because now we have the the chamber of commerce people saying man you're really going to Screw Business do these gonna lose out biggest is going to lose out ah people coming to see the Grand Canyon in Arizona are going to lose out they were gonna lose touch with you if you just don't ... to show that they would\nAct payers are losing out in a very big way I don't\nThis whole thing is costing American taxpayers\nBillions of

said ah\nThat the\nPorn stars a horse race what do you call her a horse race [laughter]\nThank you saw me\nSo he called Stormy Daniels for space and why would he do this what's going on blah blah blah do you still not get it and it's okay but all explain it again some people are upset I don't think that was good it was just low was this if he didn't call her story or if you didn't call her horse face\nThe media would not have said anything about Stormy Daniels and the fact that her joke of a lawsuit was so bad that the judge said I'm dismissing it and it's so ridiculous beyond the pale that storm you're paying his legal fees you're paying Trump's legal fees if Trump didn't ... just like when Trump if he didn't say\nIn the Trump way what he said about Christine for all the holes in her story wasn't mocking you're just saying with humor what a what exactly she said\nI don't know what had happened where it happened how I got there how I left it if I had a beer these details the media didn't cover of Trump didn't mention that it never would have been known never ever ever would have been known whatsoever right so the reason that Trump called her ... a stormy horse face\nIs because the media wasn't going to what they don't want people to know that her lawsuit was so pathetic the judge threw it out\nSaid you have to also pay Trump's legal fees that's why he does this stuff to make the media coverage\n\nYou don't do just to be outrageous oh and by the way I saw some adult on shockingly MSNBC say oh what he is doing his is beneath the dignity of the oval office\nI'm so sick of hearing this crap all these trade deals set of screwed over America put American Jobs overseas but Americans out of work is that is that worthy of the oval office bend guys were Americans were

this to this is great it doesn't say it doesn't get covered just the way it is they hit again the market drop last week Thirteen hundred points lead story\nEverywhere 'cause the the media when people start to think Trump's in eighty so close to them it terms I shouldn't electric to me the market's gonna crash he's killing everything is as bad as\nTwo days you know a correction is ten percent drop like two percent two or three a market goes up five hundred forty seven points yesterday no one mention of it on the network newscasts so they lead and pounded into the sand that the market drop Thirteen hundred points for two days last week\nGoes up five and a forty seven points yesterday not a peep not a peep zero that's\nDrudge fell for this and I I'm like really click bait is this what it is the Associated Press did a forty minute interview with Trump in the oval office\nHere's the headline from the Associated Press Trump tells a piece of sea to press he won't accept blame of GOP lose his house and you look at that and say what's\nAnd first off when I saw the headline I'm like well first off you can't blame the guy I mean he's saying run on these things and you have some some members of Congress that are refusing to do it they don't have the guts that Trump has\nBut then you actually read the story you don't do it for what Russia has which is drive by and read you read the story facing the prospect of bruising electoral defeat in ... elections really President Trump said Tuesday\nRyan was alerted through a friend that was the state troopers association the Arizona State troopers association that's right like their union or they came out and endorsed Houston cinema\nAnd apparently there is a crap load of backlash a crap load of backlash\nUm we're now being told by people that there wasn't even a vote these were the were the other thing that you have I don't get the action the corner and it'll bring up yeah OK the original thing I'm okay this is what we're being told now are there is a major demand for resignations because the executive board\nDid this without any vote\nThey didn't ask what the actual union members wanted with the troopers wanted they just did it themselves now there's a major demand for resignations um and apparently they use to back in the day\nAdvocate for pro law enforcement positions not\nCandidates because they were five oh one C. three so everything is political nowadays\nEverything it's oh so that that's just the latest there just\nWhat it is these people think they are they can get away with this stuff I mean what what are they thinking\nThat's the problem is that they're not think at all so that's that's the latest uh when it comes to that whole situation\nAnd you know we didn't take I think only took one call we rented a time or the interviews ... dot com and on my page uh yeah I can see that coming our radio dot com of what we had with Jessica Vaughan and Allie Miller in the alley Miller interview was really incredible and the fact that she said\nThey are ... they they voted yesterday at the same kind of go to supervisors to have us abide by the Paris climate agreement\nInstead of actually widening certain roads and fixing the roads so cars aren't stuck in traffic idling and of course the emissions happening or they just want you to stop driving overall and they want to take money ... he wants to take money and buy more open space open land\nAnd they want to build really expensive environmentally friendly buildings we already have in the buildings they bought a freaking bowling alley what\nThe hell are they doing and you know Steve Christie just sat there and shut up apparently what a disappointment Steve Christie is supervised Christie what a joke\nAnd again you know we'll play some highlights coming back because\nI only Miller's asking will you claim as the saving money of any evidence of this any this and that nothing there is zero zip zilch nothing so we have that and we'll also get to the uh the caravan of migrants\nBecause that's another crazy story in of itself\nNow I mean you care about your money we talk about the money to wasteful spending at Pima County and things like that and what about your money okay what about your money or do you have investments you have a financial broker an individual person who who\nIs in charge of that how much are you paying them brokers get paid commissions this is what is very important brokers get paid commissions\nKnow that against them it just seems a bit outdated does it do they get paid commissions\nAre and what does that mean that means there are more motivated to sell you something that's gonna make them more money than look out for your best interests and that's where ... where he's coming okay ... our financial professionals that are legally bound to put your best interests first they have to do it or they could be sued\nThat's a big deal right doing without putting your best interest first not their own a commission first true aging wealth right here in Tucson or at ... swan [noise] do you know what they do they don't charge commission they are their feet\nThey get paid to manage your portfolio low flat annual feeding you know about it up front\nAnd since they don't have a commissions and they don't have their own product line they talk to you they gauge what you want you tell them
