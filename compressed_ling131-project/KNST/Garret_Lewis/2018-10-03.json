tuning in this is a major situation going on\nUh the the FBI according to reports that Fox News has says they couldn't finish up the whole a cabin on everything the questioning by today\nWhich of course people that don't know exactly what happened or anything will say that's too quick no idea what's actually going on in the war but it's just too quick because those but the narrative right not at all\nAnd now that you have that's what Nick chick a totally go back on everything that she said even NBC News said you're not credible we can't find anything this is this is just you know you all the people that you said went to these rape parties nobody no one's dead one doesn't even know you to own calls back you give us for names\nSo she is a she uses credible as Rosie o'donald\nTelling you how to eat healthy but that was a ... a person right yup yup that was a nice person and he brought her before he brought her for what he said that she had the bitter tons of witnesses better yep so how's he still are barred not for me it's lawyer lawyers protecting lawyers\nYou know they get this ... you know they should just this borrow maybe you think so but it should be the free market and say why would I ever want to hire that guy is an attorney\nYou know I mean he's he's a he's a liar easy to dirt bag you dirt ball which is why those kinds of clients the porn stars these people they go to him to go to him mommy porn stars be loyal and and then there's guys like him yeah and that that's where the credibility goes All right\nOr maybe they will I don't I don't know they they ... they could say this guy's a joke to our ... or to do our industry get outta here I'm I don't know get out of here uh and then you have the story again about a Christine forward and that's why I get in so the sweating falling apart Christine for a Fort seems to be falling falling apart which\nIs why all they're talking about now is the temperament of judge Kavanaugh uh and of course they're not bringing button none of these reporters none of these people in the media to these people the boxes and television\nAre asking the question of well you might say that he was a bit sharpen a bit mad and this that but wouldn't you be mad if people said that you were a gang rape is that was drugging girls in order to rape them\nWouldn't that make you mad nobody\nIs asking that question that would make any normal person Mitt if Brett Kavanaugh\nDidn't get mad I'd say how can you not be mad\nBecause it's more than just the Supreme Court see look you want him on it I Want him on it I get it but personally I mean if this was pure and Brett Kavanaugh's shoes you say first and foremost I don't want people to think this is true and I'm mad as hell that I'm being labeled as a gang rape is based on garbage I don't even know these people\nSo that to me that that's what this was about and that's what this is about um\nBut like I'll give you an example to number one twenty nine Patrick Leahy Patrick Leahy senator democratic senator from Vermont he's a thousand and four years old he said this about uh about cabinet here we go\nIt's a hard question [noise] dry and 'cause\nIt's a question of whether he wears truthful to they're committed it was ...\nWhat was he not truthful but so now it's not what was he truth truth about what I thought it was that he was just a guy that went around or raping chicks and you can't have a guy that did that on the Supreme Court that's what this whole thing was about to start right notice it's changing\nIt's changing a lot one thirty let's do the crazy I'd Cory Booker crazy I'd Cory Booker one third year ago Cory\nBooker under credibility has been challenged by intimate people that knew the Kennedy well as a classmate again by the positive that\nThey can't produce any witnesses to corroborate everything needs anything they've said well there you go to anywhere you go\nWhen it ... it has been review a motion moment ah where do you use language that that frankly shocked a lot of thought\nShocked us but again he has no right to be shocked and outraged that you literally called him evil Cory Booker we he did you call them evil a human being evil 'cause they just re political\nUh and then on top of that um\nThe guy you call them at you you you put it out there for everyone to believe that he was a guy that drug to women with queen ... and then raped them and they got his buddies to do and it was a trained to do it right there\nThat you know it's just sick\nIn America now you don't have the right to be upset about that you should just take it right in the shorts called today it's insane isn't it and then he had this Christine forward\nThis is ... is this this is really incredible stuff I put the story my Facebook page Facebook dot com slash Jerry Lewis radio like it and follow it I got to read it to Christine Ford's ex boyfriend he doesn't put out his name was redacted John Roberts or Fox News got the letter\nAny rights I first met Christine forward Christine Blasey Ford now productive roasting poured in Nineteen eighty nine and Ninety and California from Ninety to Ninety One I was just friends with four different practically Ninety to Ninety eight I was in a relationship with Dr Ford I bought her truthful and maintain no animals towards her\nDuring our dating or time dating Dr Ford never brought up anything regarding her experiences as a victim of sexual assault harassment or misconduct\nDr Ford never mentioned Brett Kavanaugh during some of the time we were dating Dr Ford lived with Monica el McClain\nWho I understood it to be her lifelong best friend during this time it was my understanding that McLean was interviewing for jobs with the FBI and the U.S attorney's office I witnessed a doctor for to help McLean prepare for it potential polygraph exam\nDr Ford explained in detail what to expect\nHow polygraphs worked and helped McLean become familiar and less nervous about the exam Dr Ford was able to help because of her background in psychology Guerra what the hell differences that matter she helped out our friend Ryan I Need one twenty four\nIs what happened last Thursday under oath being questioned by Rachel Mitchell here's Christie and forty ...\nHave you ever had discussions with anyone um besides your attorney on how to take a polygraph\nNot that and I don't just mean counter measures but I mean just any sort of tips or anything like that\nNow and it\nScared the test itself that\nWas ... below that I can tell the information and it has to address the or whatever is going to reveal I didn't expect it to the as long as it is going to be so it's a little bit stressful\nAnd you have you ever given tips or advice to somebody who is looking to take a polygraph test never\nWell then again let me just one more time I witness Dr Ford helped McLean prepare for a potential polygraph exam Dr Ford explained in detail what to expect polygraph\nAnd helped McLean become familiar and less nervous about the exam Dr\nFord was able to help because of her background in psychology\nDoesn't this go to credibility how come there are Republicans\nScreaming and Republican Senator Charles Grassley said we need to find out what the hell's going on he sent a letter but this is what garbage you sent a letter to her attorneys demanding that big of a medical ...\nDamage is done stopped sending freaking letters learned to play the game in get on TV and radio\nHold the letter in your hand and say how can we take anything she says she says she didn't remember where the house was how she got there how she left a every witness that she said so and was there that this never happened I came corroborated\nAnd our ex boyfriend says well I actually witness or help her best friend prepare for a polygraph and then she told she told\nRachel Mitchell I never did this and the reason again is that the Dems are making a big deal well she took a polygraph\nAnd the polygraph show she was telling the truth about Burr capital\n[noise]\nGeorge stanza it's only ally if you believe it or it's not a lie right not a lie if you believe that is what it's not a lie if you believe that can stand before you can stand yet uh\nSo there you go there's more to by the way eight zero can as the eight zero five six seven eight you could come and what do you want to see done here\nAnyway apparently know who the or the boyfriend is the ex boyfriend Bryan Merrick post very a great investigative journalist weeded out September twenty nine FBI to also interview Ford's ex boyfriend Bryan Merrick\nForge ex classmate least ever and Kevin O's best friend ... or go in addition to mark judge in others but wait a second you have that\n\nAnd Brian America was interviewed by the wall Street Journal for their article and Christine Blasey Ford back on September nineteenth\nOh eight days before her or hearing and then get this September twenty six the Malibu times did a story about Christine forge relationship with Brian Merrick\nThis is the guy who wrote the letter apparently Ford was a Malibu residence she attended Pepperdine University in Nineteen Ninety One received a master's degree in clinical psychology she later taught at a university for Ninety five Ninety eight during this time she dated fellow Pepperdine student Brian Merrick\nWho is part of one of ... found Malibu spanning families as the youngest son of late judge John Merrick\nThe too dated for eight years\nWhen he said Ninety to Ninety eight six years in the ... and ...\nAs reporter by the wall Street Journal during the relationship marriage status Ford had never mentioned the assault\nOh and by the way you think it's possible\nWith the questioning that Rachel Mitchell did she had to have known that at some point I mean so there's ... so that primary was no eight days before the new judiciary hearing on September nineteenth Wall Street journal did a story\nRepublicans contact is Rachel Mitchell she's going to the questioning\n\nYou don't think there's any chance that actually prepared for this she read these stories about her contacted people that knew her and ask questions\nWhat would make Rachel Mitchell asked that question can you play one twenty four and more time this is my point she had to have known about this and she had to set it said this way to know that that Christine Ford was going to lie about it because again the Dems are making a big deal Christine Ford took a polygraph\nIt's totally fine juggle polygraph passed with flying colors\nSo she's telling the truth and remember the question here we go\nHave you ever had discussions with anyone ah besides your attorneys on how to take a polygraph now that and I don't just mean counter measures but I mean just any sort of tips or anything like that\nNow and it scared the test itself that ... ... all of that I can tell the information and it has to reveal whatever is going to reveal I didn't expect it to the as long as it's going to be so it's a little bit stressful\nAnd you have you ever given chips or advice who ... who is looking to take a polygraph test never what would\nMake her asked that question she had to have known she had to talk to this primary and now this lady is caught lying under oath bring her up on charges it's not a lie [noise]\nIf you believe in very good point but it's still a lie\nRinger up on charges what do you think age zero ... five six seven eight we'll get to what a\nWhat a jerk Jeff Flake said ah if you missed that ... uh the\nWhat Grassley wants to do Alexandria Ocasio Cortez so much more don't go anywhere there's Fox\n\nFox News radio unruly and Lou where is the place I don't remember how many years ago one morning after president\nTrump ridiculed his Supreme Court nominees accuser another Republican senator ways in the president's comments or just plain wrong\nThat was Senator Susan Collins of Maine joining fellow Republican Jeff Flake and several Democrats in criticizing comments made by the president at a rally in Mississippi Senator Mitch McConnell me mom saying he's certain the FBI report will be finished and the Senate will vote on Brett Kavanaugh's nomination this week\nAnd in the investigation into suspicious ... suspicious ... tend to the White House and Pentagon Fox News hearing from us
