it on my page ... dot com however\nOr even the Arizona Republic editorial board wasn't asking the right questions it is relevant about her mocking Arizona's hating Arizona calling us extremists telling other states not to be like us are calling a American Soldiers terrorists\nThese are big things big thing nothing nothing\nSo I Want you to hear this first they actually did ask though about the Taliban comments\nThere is the first thing I Want you to hear a from here in cinema okay ah this is a her ... answer to the Taliban comments and say what what do you what about the Taliban comments this is such gobbledygook is is Obama ask BS Obama asked time filler listen to this year we go [laughter]\nUnderstanding that context Iraq [laughter] conversation a car and I don't know if it had an opportunity [laughter]\n... [laughter] very interesting how it went very [laughter] I really liked about what I Want to talk about not comment on track offhand what [noise]\nWhat I'd like to try and I have to show what what I was part of our hair and when I [noise]\nI ... [laughter] she's ... [noise]\n[laughter] [noise] ... [noise] I [noise] I was\nSo she says every time she is creepy mandate is creepy to hear this creepy\nYeah [noise] so there's that that's one\nYou want to hear the context of it by the way this is what the two thousand three radio interview sounded like here we go\nBuy more he has an individual if I Want to go fight in the Taliban army I go over there now you know I'm I'm fighting for the Taliban that I'm Sorry that's personal decision and I asked I Want to I'm Wondering if\n[noise] yep and mix Sally by the way put out a thing on our website or a tweeter whatever about uh the definition of\nTreason and basically what it means in encouraging people to fight our own country and kill our own people just exactly what she was doing I don't care if you go fight you know joined the Taliban to fight American I don't care when he joined the Taliban your goal is to kill Americans that's what it comes down to and she said\nYou hear about that she was fine with it it's a big freaking deal why do you notice or an answer was different set of his answer was different I was trying to get something back on track was hard to have a conversation it was an offhand comment on what she said when she was asked about the debate you want to know why 'cause they had a reef fine her answer 'cause she's all crafted phoney and fake\nWhen it comes down to very crafted very phoney very very fake um let's bring up this was toward the end is one of the videos is toward the end of your number twenty five\nMartha McSally at least more than make Sally or got tough and\nShe called accused in cinema for going after American members of the military and of course here since ... played it up my brother served and he served ... if you'd probably if you care too much for your brother why would you actually put out a flyer\nSaying American military members are causing terror in the middle east you think your brother's a terrorist she's not man okay listen to the mix failure ago\nYou know when you were handing out a flyers in these multiple protests that you had at the time ... and one of them were you were to leave like you were many times you pick that our troops as skeletons and said stop the U.S terror and the middle east again this is another CNN story that was broken\nAbout this uh and so when you talk about can you you know\nCan you separate protesting the Atari accent from denigrating are too\nIn that case they were one in the same the flyer for her protest I don't remember if that was the thing to do one or not or whether they're picking our troops skeletons and saying we were the terrorists like I I'm not making any of this up and I think it's really important\nFor the voters to know the full history of both of our lives and and what we have done in our lives what we have led on what we put our passion into and these many years cast and uh that you were out of the mainstream uh protesting advocating the SAT down and look this entire pattern or over many many\nMany years at least she called her out for that I don't want to people will be I mean I Know other people at the Arizona Republic didn't want to ask about it because they don't want to make Sally to when I even have in the ...\nA a columnist who's on the editorial board for the Arizona Republic tearing into\nMore than make Sally her name is Olivia de ... on the bottom of this it says that that's why I notice she's an editorial columnist for the Arizona Republic or peace is Martha McSally think Arizona voters are stupid you bet she does and I'm like\nWhy\nHow 'bout does cinema think Arizona voters are stupid she mocked the hell out of us made fun of us was ashamed of us for years we played the soundbites how to turn this around\nWell this lady right there was a reason Republican Martha McSally accuse her democratic rival of trees and against the u._s. in one second of a sixty minute debate excel a grim national headlines are desperate quest to when you ascendancy from Arizona\nMix alleys reason she's counting us the Arizona voters to be stupid enough to believe her unsubstantiated accusation against one of the most moderate politicians in the states recent history wow and then she writes Martha McSally has come on ... this is what's in the Arizona Republic\nAnd you know I'm not the biggest Martha fan but this is crazy this is crazy one of the most moderates she's anything but moderate you figure\nThat well she voted a you know only sixty sixty percent with Trump and you know and really that's what you're going with she devise real Democratic Party to vote with Trump sixty percent of the time why wouldn't Arizona's one senator who can be disciplined and thoughtful with our messaging\nYou choose creepy\nMatter of fact really quick let's play brand Resnick again on MSNBC twenty six brand Resnick political reporter for the Phoenix NBC affiliate invited on MSNBC to talk about cinema and make Sally and Chuck Todd distorted and listen to what Resnick said here we go\nOne thing that's also come through and talking with voters even ones that I think have already decided who they're gonna vote for\nWake up in Canada they may vote for they don't feel like they know either candidate\nA no they don't look at here since ... right now this appears in cinema circa twenty a chain of running against here's some cinema two thousand two to twenty ... when I got three and ... a cinema Congress only cinema it's not really put herself out there for people like me reporters we maybe four minute verse\nWhich is\nIf lifetime could actually make a candidate to run for Senate it'd be care since then\nI could see the movie doubt\nStarring Tori Spelling and every other I Know to cast off\nOkay were popular in their day exactly and now they have to do this I enjoy hearing could be like the husband or several things [laughter] after dark NATO Jenny guards could be like the the opponent she could be the mic Sally\nA Luke Perry could be some guy in the media but anyway uh All right uh I'm dating myself which is terrible I Want you to us by number Nineteen real quick here is the creepy sounding lifetime lifetime channel candidate here's to send them a year ago\nWhen we serve together for years we actually used to work well together\nI'm incredibly disappointed with the ... the path that Martha has chosen home life from the very beginning she has chosen to run a very personal very negative campaign and I don't believe in that scientists have pointed in her twice it is her choice she can do it if she wants to she thinks about how the Cadillac tense\nBut I think it's wrong for our state and for our country and I think it's\nFrankly beneath us to call each other which I Do not do\nOh personally petty and mean names which she can tell if she wants to and she says has had to and to attack me with knowingly false attacks and divisions [noise] this is a choice I personally do not subscribe to this type of politics and I'm disappointed\nThat we're at a place in our country where it is considered acceptable to engage in that kind of behavior\nLike freaking Hal in two thousand one don't talk to Maxine Waters right yeah I Know [laughter] I ain't below sea\nSo I'm more than that point that was exactly when Houston stopped and Martha snap back and said this\nIs his name is ed calling me morally bankrupt talking point that she is repeated but kissing this isn't personal isn't a personal at all you need to grow some things can you want to be and I didn't and then and there there's a lot of fights out there and there's a lot at stake this is nothing like finding combat okay not personally\nI think the Arizona voters deserve to know the fullness of our background there you go\nOh we'll have more on this we have to get to some more curious than being completely wrong about the war by the way in this in this\nThere by the war in Afghanistan and Sally owned or on that which was really good which is another reason why they never brought up the military or anything of that horrible debate on Monday nights now\nAre there was also parts where the moderators ask or there's a Republican a tour of or ask your cinema you're against the uh the Iraq War and the Afghanistan war all this other stuff oh you know do you think there should be conflict she goes yes I think that we we should actually uh have\nHave use our military ah in certain parts of Africa she they she actually yes in the Sudan\nWow really okay\nSo we have that and she also said Syria Syria as well so anyway we'll get to all this stuff
