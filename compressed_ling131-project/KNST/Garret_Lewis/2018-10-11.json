[noise]\nWidespread devastation I'm Dave Anthony Fox News\nThis hurricane was an absolute monster and the damage that students wake is still yet to be fully understood governor Rick Scott in the morning after Michael was hit this morning Florida's Gulf Coast panhandle in big banner waking up to ... a magical destruction so many lives have been changed forever\nTV ads by money from Leah Marquez Peterson and they they see the polling and they say well it ain't worth it she's pretty much toasts by by uh and that's you know what its success with the Republicans gave us down here they gave us Leah Marquez Peterson we're much more Trump being candidates that were running against their\nBut that's where the establishment in this this they want until there's a shake up where you have the people that run the Republican Party in Arizona you got to lose the McCain nights and then maybe we'll get some change but a GOP said the loser is a loser and Leah she has no shot unfortunately too wacky and Kirkpatrick holy crap so they're yank it all the money you're going to spend it somewhere else where they can win\nSecond thing I think you need to know do you do see according to the Arizona capital times oh age in ah insightful\nHe has a Seventeen point lead over David Garcia for governor [noise] not a surprise by me but again when the pundits around the country in boxes on TV till you're willing to raise their ... no it's not shut up third thing I think you need to know overall how about this one\nStory I'm going to talk about this story and a hill geo PCs new hope to expand Senate majority\nWeight by where's the blue wait wait what [noise] no way Oh yes way [noise] yes way [noise]\nThat they're seeing that plus there are these new pulling out showing that Republicans and even independents are mad as hell and more fired up their vote than ever before because of the whole Kavanaugh situation will get to all that three things I think you need to know All right so\nThis story is really really pretty cool and I put this on my Facebook page Facebook dot com slash Jerry Lewis radio\nAnd follow it a Republicans are increasingly optimistic about their chances of expanding their narrow Senate majority\nAfter this whole Kevin ... right that's what it's saying\nUh the G ... candidates in Republican strongholds of Texas in Tennessee ... despite Taylor Swift saying oh man I don't go for Marsha Blackburn a Republican in Tennessee go for her democratic opponent\nPut it on her social media to a hundred million little girls and apparently it's not enough um\nAnyway in Texas and Tennessee the Republicans are strengthening their positions the upset bathed by Democrats there are now on hold no kidding did anybody really think bet do a ... a Robert\nO'Rourke was going to actually be Ted Cruz I mean that the media try this is the fake news again the media just wanted to push that narrative so you're starting to believe in no chance man no chance\nThe Republicans are bullish on their chances of gaining a seat in North Dakota where Heidi Heitkamp a Democrat\nHas seen Republican representative Kevin Cramer pulled ahead in polls yeah maybe that's why I Can't voted against cabinet last week she wanted to drum up the craziest hopefully to fire her own base up of Democrats\nTo bakar 'cause it's a last ditch effort good luck with that when they were hiding or Republicans also believe they can divvied democratic Senator Claire McCaskill\nIn Missouri remember both of those McCaskill and I can't voted against Kavanaugh\nMet Mick ... GOP strategist said if you look at the polling we've seen the last four or five days it's become clear states like North Dakota in Missouri are moving in the Republican's direction\nAnd of course Democrats in Texas Tennessee look like they're on their way out he said in Arizona and Nevada we talked about this\nAh an Arizona Nevada widely seen as the best pickup opportunities for Democrats recent polls suggest the Republicans are holding their own I told you yesterday I'm Sally up by six in the latest poll oh yeah a Nevada Dean Heller who was never Trump her\nNever Trump or all of a sudden Trump bless you Trump goes to Vegas has a rally all of a sudden Ehlers beating his challenger no way Heller has been seen as the most vulnerable GOP Senate incumbent\nNBC News Maris poll earlier this month put Heller\nAhead of his Democratic challenger by two points well doesn't mean they're going to we don't get me wrong but all of a sudden this stuff is happening West Virginia another pickup chance\nAnother pickup chance Joe mansion ... we'll see but so Florida works out to for their governor Rick Scott who's running for Senate against\nBill Nelson was ... I mean they all just go\nFar far far left and if things real the stars really align there's even a Senate race in New Jersey of all places blue high tax New Jersey you know to Jersey they tax you for leaving the state\nYou decide to move I Can't afford to live here anymore they literally tax you an it's an exit tax\nThey say you're leaving us you've got to pay to leave New Jersey [noise]\nAs if the smell wasn't bad enough\nAnyway or a Stockton University poll released earlier this month showed a statistical dead heat between the race and the race between Senator Bob Menendez Bob with his his\nBuddies to fly down to the island and hang out with the underage prostitutes and things like that oh yeah Bob and that Bob Menendez\nAnd his Republican challenger Bob hugging or the incumbent Kerry just a two point lead that's the statistical tie\n... remember Menendez reprimanded by Senate Ethics panel in April because the feds put a corruption charges against him somehow beat the rap but the due to bad guy again this could be all different but I'm just telling you\nIt's all of a sudden these stories in the media are popping up Republicans see new hope all this is happening but maybe 'cause the media realizes crap if we were wrong and twenty sixteen and we were wrong in a very very big way like it was it was really bad right it was really bad\nPeople didn't like us they don't like us now now for a good solid Eighteen months we've been telling people that\nTrump's gonna lose a lot of power there's going to be a big blow away people hate Trump blah blah blah whatever what if it doesn't work out that way again now all of a sudden you're going to start to see some backtracking and the media to try to cover their butts little CYA action\n[noise] oh yeah yeah that that is what you're going to see\nWe'll see why you hear little CYA there because they need something right they need something\nYou do see yesterday Trump's an eerie Pennsylvania Erie, Pennsylvania\nOnly was it beyond sold out and they don't sell the tickets you got to get there you gotta wait in line this stadium the arena was filled to capacity and then the overthrow overflow crowds even Trump put a video out\nOf the massive overflow crowd that was an eerie Pennsylvania\n[noise] I I mean Trump is the ultimate get out the vote car I mean cabin on is what Trump going around doing all these these appearances and all these battleground states where it'd be so cool of our buddy Lou Barletta can knock off Democrat Senator bend a Bob casey\nIt'd be so great if that could happen we talked to last month in Indy seat loser cool do ... he's been he's been a great guy for years\nI don't even say I don't like a lot of a demo a politician's Lew is a great guy\nBut ready for this\nYear we go multiple polls have found results similar results regarding voter enthusiasm amid the cabin our\nBattle that should have Democrats are very worried remember we I just wonder I talked about this I Want to bring it up to you again the NPR PBS NewsHour Marist Poll came out last week\nJuly there was a ten point gap between the number of Democrats and Republicans saying the elections are very important\nIt's down to two points which is a statistical tie a statistical tie\nEighty two percent of Democrats said very important eighty percent of Republicans now say it's very important this is a big freaking deal you ... you know\nAnd now Rasmussen as new information out there\n[noise] [noise] right [noise]\nRasmussen did some polling new Rasmussen Reports national telephone and online survey finds\nFifty four percent of all likely us voters say they are more likely to vote in the ... upcoming midterm elections because of the controversy surrounding Brett Kavanaugh fifty four percent more likely to vote because of it just nine percent say less thirty four percent said the controversy had no impact\nSixty two percent of Republicans are more likely to vote because of the cabinet controversy\nCompared to fifty four percent of dams and forty six percent of independents\nSixty two percent of all voters were angry about the treatment of Brett Kavanaugh forty two percent very angry so congratulations Democrats you have fired up the base you have what you have woken up a sleeping giant and he knows\nEven listen he told me about it if you don't mind even Joe Scarborough is face\nTo admit that I Want you to listen to this really quick okay this is Joe Scarborough little montage of him\nAnd\nEven he can't hide it here we go\nWell I I see right now the Republicans getting a huge bump a out of the Kavanaugh hearings I think a lot of Americans especially a lot of Republicans or they didn't like what they saw during that those hearings are coming from from the Democratic side of the I agree\nWith that I agree with you that the the capital hearings had are dramatically a positive effect for Republicans boy\nLooking back assessing what went on a hearing so there is no doubt or as somebody that uh you know studies and branding there's no doubt that at least for Senate candidates ah ... the Kavanaugh hearings were disaster for the Democratic party\nI really can you play for me are we going to talk about the media and the media\nA swing and missing a lot and already having story saying well maybe the Republicans will actually hold on to the Senate may as well it's so bad for the Republicans ... I Want to hear the montage 'cause I Love montage is when when it proves me writes ah there is a essence number sixty nine\nThe media about Brett Kavanaugh what they predicted what happened with the Brett Kavanaugh situation listen to this year we go hang on a journey messed up again it up oh Adrian it is a terrifying part\nIt's even possible that President Trump than Republicans never get to replace retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy that they're going to serve an attack\nReporting and ... and then I'm getting this is a moment in history when Brett Kavanaugh could actually may lose the nomination may lose the company is the Brett Kavanaugh nomination um\nIs now hurdling into the sun which is what I think I think Kevin always finish\n... her telling a story\nIt will be fan now and I don't think that Republicans are going to be able to overcome\nFifty fifty I said after four testified he would not be confirmed highly confident and the accusations that are going to be made\n... is a bit of a shell man has represented a women's stories have turned out to be too and\nI I Know you probably don't want to show your ... your car to her but [noise] um do you think that by Saturday evening will be saying justice Kevin [noise]\nUm you know I'm a prisoner of hope now you've already Booker Spartacus\nSo we have that which is nice for the media swinging and missing vaguely\nAbout cabinet no way he gets for no chance no how no way no so Trump couldn't win capital kinky confirmed big blue wave how many more times will they be wrong maybe there'll be right about the ... who knows who knows however there was a tweet out from Rona McDaniel there were there were Republican chairwoman Republican Party chairwoman right jeeze\nShe's the big boss she tweeted out the left angry mob has Republicans energized and the first week of October we raised to five hundred percent more online than we did in the first week of September\n... that's a big deal or a\nMore than a thousand new online donors registered and contributed to the party according to the RMC\nUm that was to be somebody to September are they the reporter more than fifty million voter contacts that\nSurpassed their total for the twenty sixteen presidential election cycle wow I mean it all this stuff is happening the Dems are getting a little surge to apparently they raise foreigner grand for house races for point\nThree whatever they they did some of that too so they're they're getting some extra money\nBut me and the Republicans are really really energized really energized\nSo we'll see what happens you can comment if you'd like your take on it eight eight zero ... five six seven eight have to also get to this awesome story we'll play the Houston cinema more and more terrible news for cues instead and we'll get that ah you know who you know two thousand three protests the two two\nWho she is a radical she's trying to hide who she is she's a radical uh who did she invites one of her protests oh where do you hear that one and the secret plan Obama had if Hillary won in Trump didn't accepted you got to hear what the plan was this was ethically funny and it scared but funny it's coming up right now it's box [noise]\nFox News I'm Chris foster search and rescue teams right across the Florida Panhandle looking for anyone in homes damaged or destroyed by hurricane Michael at least two people have died one in Florida one in Georgia\nThe event is still going on and going for citizens in North Carolina and South Carolina please make sure you're listening listening to all the local warnings that are that are pushing forward\nAdministrator Brock Long they're an eighty mile stretch of interstate ten in Florida's close both ways until debris can be cleared President Trump says on Fox and friends about a Saudi Arabian journalist who disappeared after entering the Saudi Arabian embassy in Turkey\nWhere we're looking at it very very seriously I don't like it at all now you know you don't have American citizens with that in this case doesn't matter I don't like it I don't like it with respect to reporters it's a terrible terrible precedent\n... he was critical of his country's government he disappeared last Tuesday [noise]\n\n\nThey're going to do it I'm Bill lashed ...

N. N. G. Kanye West black guy because he likes Trump a debt that didn't hate the guy's terrible this is what happened on CNN if you miss it here we go\nKayaking is what happens when negroes don't read 'em and and we have this now and now Donald Trump is going to use it in perverted and he's going to have somebody who can stand with him and take pictures down limits laughing and it's funny that God [laughter] that's funny [laughter]\nLet's say and black folks are about to pray Kanye West and the racial draft okay they've had\nIt with him and he's an attention more like the president he's all of a sudden now that that the model spokes person he is he's the token negro of that of the Trump Administration this is ridiculous and no one should be taking Kanye West seriously he's clearly ... she's he's already been hospitalized\nSo he is the worst ... Taylor Swift soundbite up too so uh Taylor Swift goes on the American music were by the way the worst ratings it's ever had all time lowest rating she opened the show and she closed it with a winning what some award and she said this listen\nIf you sign up for this and I wanted\nIt different ward and every single word given out tonight\nWere voted on by the people you know what I'm\n[laughter] [noise] challenged\nWith celebrated by the media oh she's so smart she's so good she means so well because she wants people to vote Democrat Kanye loves Trump that stupid guy token negro that's what happens what negroes do read that's what they said\nYou see the two totally different treatments huh not racist that was just it it's politics yeah but the media we should we shouldn't go on big news right I'm right yeah okay well coming up\nNPR moaning cup of Sean [noise]\nIs a show on Saturday morning I got to admit\nAfter nine eleven I thought ... was a great idea never having any any belief\nThat it was possible as naive as I guess I was that we would have government officials at the top upper echelons within\nThe intel community the FBI and the de OJ that would literally be weaponized seeing the powerful tools of intelligence that we give them to protect we the people that I never in my lifetime thought that a\nPolitical candidate him put together a flimsy dot CA with Russian sources and it becomes the basis of buys a warrant application but not one for\nGood or service under crowd meets later today on the show on Saturday [noise]\nHey if you or a loved one struggles with leg or foot cramps you guys\nMaybe she ... she doesn't come on your show 'cause you asking the tough questions and and I get it and he he writes this was the gal said grow their ovaries you to combat fighter pilot but even in combat yadda yadda yadda yadda but that previous caller's maybe she want to come in the show because you're a little combative please\nYes exactly exactly um yeah\nSo we have to hang on a sec three things I think you need to know number one leader Marquez Peterson the Republican candidate to see two are already being dropped by the Republican Party they are said they're going to stop giving her money no more money for you to buy TV ads because apparently in Kirkpatrick crazily enough years running away with it which is quite frightening I Wonder what the people think here\nIn ... crazy and Kirkpatrick Obamacare Lebanon Ann Kirkpatrick who wants to Medicare for all we get a cramped candidate Leah Marquez Peterson and this is what happens Mr quick told me to run and I said Yes sir [noise]\nSecond thing that I think you need to know is Doug ... he's got a Seventeen point lead over a crazy David Garcia for governor Seventy point lead Arizona capital time's poll beautiful third thing I think you need to know is\nMan oh man Republicans are all fired up\nRasmussen did a poll sixty two percent of Republicans are more fired up\nMore angry over the treatment Kavanaugh they are going to they're going more fired up their vote than ever before that is huge\nThree things I think you need to know right before you go any further uh Ian listening on the I heard in Phoenix in what's up with McCain\nComeback what's up going back breakfast they doing man\nIf you want to feel really short\nBecause she's been on the radio show uh down here in Phoenix twice\nOh mix Sally has yes I'm sure they're asking excellent questions that's fantastic I don't really know what is your favorite color\nWhat is your calls side [laughter] do you like bowling or ping pong yeah it's just fantastic our idea of what else to go to go to go down to you\nKnow just you know just want to feel a little a little shorter this\nDoesn't make me feel short makes me feel good [laughter] and again listen you've got to vote for her over the the two two but at the same time what do you do what what\nAre the worst Senate candidate choices in the world\nYes yes we do yes we do but again it is illegal or\nNot we don't know about that but they do and and I appreciate good every time I got a buddy you we do know that good old Martha I'm In ... she has a giant pair ovaries\nGiant their ovaries a and she's not afraid of anybody listen to it just boosts my own ego is if I needed enough and I'm not out this to try to get somebody I Want to ask the same questions that you want to ask that's what makes us so good that is why you like me and I like you\nI Will ask the same question to you how do we really know that you're going to support Trump I listen you've got to play the odds I feel that she's going to support Trump a lot more than\nThe two two will just me\nTaking on terrorists in combat\nThan the Senate wants to scare me one that\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] maybe she could fly and ate and ate ten straight down or barking loud\nYeah she probably could yeah I Know what a pastor\nAnywhere I can go would ask me questions that don't really say much anyway so we have that uh and yet again the other the other one to to to play the to do from this morning\nFrom two thousand three we we we have this is my page came as the dot com here's didn't send them a inviting all kinds of people who were anti war protest in Phoenix in two thousand three two thousand three here's the two two\nGreens independence anarchists socialist communist whoever wants to come there are lots of tomorrow and the other side are well you know my personal opinion is that what matters here so what I'll tell you is that\nUm I Know that in talking with groups that are coming I said think about how the police can react to what you're wearing like Oh yes and whatever decision you make is your choice\n[noise] [noise] yeah it's not even a question I can sit back and talk about\nMic silent avoiding everybody else like the plague and it's not just me again the Arizona Republic national a political reporter said that I Can't even get ... or ... years consumed them on days\nI'm too busy getting up my message said that ... people aren't whatever um\n[laughter]\nSo there's that All right so we have we have other things to play to well now the the other side of getting this this is part listen to to to she is one of these crazies she's a wacko if she wasn't running for the Senate she'd better than DC screaming about her ovaries and Brett Kavanaugh affecting them somehow that's what she'd be doing should've been doing it\nSo you have this and then those same group of crazy door she'd be yelling at Ted Cruz to his face while he's having dinner at a restaurant do you see that's what she'd be doing a but apparently on CNN where they have success in ratings and money apparently interim\nThey had a big debate it for people in boxes on CNN Don Lemon the dumbest men on TV\nWho laughed when Tanya was called a a token negro and is what I was a negroes don't read the letter funny mhm\nUh Don Lemon was arguing with a a conservative writer not a Republican because every guy Matt Lewis about basically the definition of a mob\nNow remember the story about Ted Cruz the giant group of people that wouldn't be the restaurants are yelling at him that's like a mob right I mean if you consider him a mob of people they're crazy they're ... they're not they're yelling there who knows what they're they're mob mob are the ones you only and here's the Nielsen their mom it's a mob of people\nRemember CNN very upset at the idea of a mob oh Don Lemon didn't like the idea\nOf calling these people are not what they simply are protester is not a mob ... listen to the what positive for for reaction listen to this on CNN ...\nIs it my behavior no it's not ... ... people who are ... and they're angry with the way the ... the way the country's going and all that they were not for those who have before you jump in okay I'm ... why I Can't make it you know keeping Iraq thing that\nYou know you're you're making a point are you the moderator or the host or are you are giving a liberal\nAnd the host of this so I tell you that you're giving law I'm tell her why it all I think it's\nThat I'm like look up the word mob and the dictionary definition\nThat definition Ryan has enough for me mommy large and disorderly crowd of people one bent on writers or destructive behavior\nLet's go to\nLook up the word mob and the dictionary definition\nLook up the word mob in the dictionary and you should also as a Republican look at the constitution and look at the ... or whatever it is you are whatever it is you are look at the constitution of you\nThere you go by the Milan he also said that she doesn't trust a lot of people that work under or for President Trump in the west wing don't trust them\nWe'll find out more when that happens and the media will look for every word and twisted and can toward it\nIf they're going to do but I I Love that how can a Loni and not be with women what are you talking about a guy had to start the story in my in my prep for days now it was from the Washington Times false reports of sexual assault not as rare as claimed\nStudies show meeting and happens more than you think oh\nBrent eternity criminologist wrote a book and twenty Seventeen dispelling this notion is research and the two coauthor cited statistical studies and police crime reports one academic study get this showed as many as forty percent of sexual assault charges are false\nTurvy wrote that the FBI in the nineties take the fall city rate at eight percent for rape or attempted rape complaints quote there is no shortage\nOf politicians victims advocate to news articles claiming the nationwide false report for rape and sexual assault there's almost non existent presenting a figure of around two percent\nJust figure is not only an accurate but it also has no basis in reality set reporting it publicly as a valid frequency rate with any empirical basis is I just it scientifically negligent or fraudulent wow as much as forty percent\nCrazy isn't it\nSo it happens a lot more than you realize that people are wrong or the liar falsely accused or who knows what what you gotta just believe everything they say I mean I have another story my prep also yeah that one I have that story apparently a lesbian at Ohio University\nAnna airs sent her cell death threats she found in her desk drawer what yes she is an algae B. T. Q. Ohio University student Senate member she received a death threat originally\nBut now students Senate leadership believes that the threat likely came from another Senate member watch what's\nShe's the one that did that she said I found these hateful and harassing notes I found them they called me a derogatory term I found them in my desk well now it turns out that she actually was arrested and charged with three counts of making false alarms\n\nPolice found out she plays the three threatening notes herself ride reporting them to police [noise]\nYou don't doubt everybody but I mean just because somebody says something doesn't mean it actually is going to be true hey by the way the Democrats have a phenomenal message to win the midterms phenomenal you know what one of their big priorities is going to be if they win\nGoing to help your life and so much you know do you know what Nate suppose you said the big thing they're going to do one of the big things I'll tell you about coming back nine thirty three right now in ... states box [noise]\nOff Suzanne I'm Chris foster hurricane Michael's moving north there's flooding in North Carolina already\nSeveral water rescues are occurring in the west governor\nRoy Cooper there's stretches and the Florida Panhandle where everything's pretty much wiped out Florida governor Rick Scott tells people living there\nKnock it out on the roads today do not travel home today roads are not opening and you will not be able to get home if you're living in or near the coast\nAt least one person's died in Florida and also won in Georgia search and rescue teams around looking for anybody hurt or trapped storm surge weeds fourteen feet in some places when the storm hit hospitals in Panama city's a day or ... patients because of the damage President Trump signed the save our see that it's a bipartisan bill promoting international action to reduce ocean waste\nEvery year over ... million tons of garbage is dumped into our beautiful oceans\nBy many countries of the world\n\nThey're going to do it I'm ... the news Republican Martha ...
