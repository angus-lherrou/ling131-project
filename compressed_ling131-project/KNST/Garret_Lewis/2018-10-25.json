and a much faster pace because that's\n... just telling you I'm I'm just listen\nUh it's look at this hand while your hand does something else say we'll go get into that stuff okay we'll get into that stuff or second thing that I think you need to know is that the Arizona troopers association has withdrawn their support\nOf cures dean cinema\nBecause it was just some random people on top and everybody else the members were mad is really the Arizona State trooper who in ... and every senator or the United states so they withdrew their uh their support\n'em\nAnd and they're not supporting Martha but I pretty much if all of a sudden you like\nIt comes out no we do not support this candidate I'm pretty sure that means wink wink we support the other one that's\nJust me but again uh what what do I know what do I know right uh so we have that a third thing that I think you need to know there was this big story in the New York times\nThat Chinese and Russian Spies are listening to President Trump cell phone conversations\nThis whole big thing uh they don't have any actual named people that actually can say this of course in the New York times\nOr however the president did tweet that this is yes fake news that he doesn't actually use a personal cell phone use is nothing but government phones and very rarely you has one but he doesn't really use it a an actual governments are issued cell phone\nDo they just don't stop they literally just don't stop\nHe tweeted the so called experts on Trump over the New York times or along and boring article on my cell phone usage that is so incorrect they didn't have time here to correct it I only use government phones and I've only seldom used government cell phone story is so wrong\n\nYep all they do is attack attack attack attack attack anything they can and whether freaking out oh my God it in ... by the way in the store they actually said that Trump left his cell personal cell phone on a golf cart role playing golf leaving Secret Service to scramble to get it aides have told him really\nDidn't really Rocco Bob ... was made ... ... yeah yes they you eat it you know that was okay though he's like I'm not giving up my blackberry don't happen to know\nAnd didn't Hillary Clinton refused to give back in ... computer smashed into little bits for someone not godly reason that's a good point that's a good point but in the garbage disposal\nYou do three things I think you need to know by the way a couple of hours ago Trump tweeted out to our buddy Brandon Judd for as the United states we tell brand enjoyed is bald\nI'm just [laughter] I treat out Brandon Jake only gives his all of his friends and his brother they'll listen what I'm told guys what's on sale this\nBrand and I appreciate it brand and joined the national border patrol council he was on Fox and friends this morning rented ... of the national border patrol council was right when he says\nFox and friends of the Democrats inspired laws make it tough for us to stop people at the border must be changed of course he spelled it incorrectly as well get ripped for it you must be ... C. H. A. N. D. V. D. and said gee end of the world must be changed but I'm bringing out the military\nFor this national emergency there'll be some so he says he's bringing up the military\nWe'll see you know no actual coverage of the of the Caribbean and the last you know almost twenty four hours right nothing nothing nothing\nThat I Know of ... are you texting brand and right now no ah somebody else for a piece audio ... okay I go\nThere so ah but I can if you like it would be funny though\nA brand in like I heard and I got going to take\nSome go seriously Don tweeted you he talks about you showing the picture of my son buck naked with the make America great again yarmulke\nSo I ask how much that in a secure the border Byrne that's okay ah so listen\nI Hope you know uh you you and I probably on the same wavelength here\nWe see these stories about these packages where these aren't even actual bombs they're made to look like bombs they have no debt Nader's there's not I mean there's nothing to them they're all sent on the same day\nIt appears because they were stopped yesterday to stop this morning and so they whoever did it fail dumped him in the mail the probably the same time\nSame kind of packaging every expert that I've seen and heard\nAnd I listen to live in a a dam bond Gino on yesterday former New York a police officer former Secret Service guy he knows about these things and he's like this is just amateur hour ... this is something that somebody is doing is they're either the dumbest person of all the time or they're just trying to create chaos in a diversion and\nI Know if you don't agree with me listen to this show there are plenty of people listen or even in the media you know I guess this is Craig how can you actually seen as scared that you think this might be set of before I even get to my ah my my explanation about that just thinking this okay if you don't think that the Democrats would be so desperate\nTo distract and change the narrative of news because they realize man even Democrats not politicians but people Americans do want fourteen thousand people storming the the border demanding entry\nThat we don't know who they are with nobody wants that nobody would be like if there's random people walking in your neighborhood is Fifteen people walking in your neighborhood and they're going from door to door would you open the door and let them in\nWould you be okay nobody would nobody would\nSo if you think that Democrats wouldn't be desperate as there are realizing this whole blue wave\nIs non existent non existent if you think that they're desperate to do that\nThey lied about four Americans being killed him and guys they lied about why it actually happened they arrested a guy for making a video and tried to put the blame on a on a guy\nWho made a video\nAnd of course it came out when Hillary was question for eleven hours in the media didn't really we have the audio of this media didn't really want to make a big deal they covered\nFor her when they actually one of the congressman actually said there are over six hundred emails addressed to you about security concerns from Benghazi they said we need reinforcements we need this many this why do these go on you know not addressed what would what is what is going on\nThey knew for a long time that\nThat was very vulnerable was ripe for attack\nKnew it and Obama sent out Susan Rice on five Sunday shows to lie and they continue to lie they do it if you're sick enough to lie about Americans being killed ... members of our military\nAre heroes an ambassador being left out they're ignoring them as they are under threats if you're sick enough\nTo actually say um that you know what this was a horrible horrible mistake about but you're you're willing to just cover it up in life for it yeah you know what you are sick enough and they had to say you know what we need something crazy seven to distract\nWe obviously screwed up with the Kavanaugh situation and and we couldn't paint him to be a bad guy Trump far back America's America bought it we screwed up we look like idiots\nIs old migrant caravan thing we can't look sympathetic anymore because Americans even if they're Democrats don't look at this as well let them all and it's okay it's just not what you do in any country it's not what you do\nSo what can we do you know what last ditch effort\nLet's tell people and try to convince them to not vote for any Republicans so Trump can lose power because he is causing crazy violence to take place he is causing what he says is causing\nPeople to put bombs in the mail and mail them to people that Trump doesn't like\nWas going to love you if you called ghetto right now and schedule a system we choose the nation is the best one hundred and twenty nine

didn't think he was getting a you know ... you know but you know hard core recording our reporting stories I just want you to know this Adam how's he tweeted out you have a lot of contacts and the federal government Adam how's he tweeted\nFrom fed source quote complete hoaxes\nTalking about the bombs the packages from fed source complete hoaxes multiple wires when the only when they only needed one reports of cell phones being involved with false so no intention of harm now the question dry run or a false flag from the right or left trying to mess over the other side\nOh\nSo Adam how's he that's what he says his federal sources are telling him Jake Tapper though fake news CNN tweeted out before that package justice or Obama's Clinton's Brennan here of CNN holder these devices for law enforcement sources were rudimentary but functional meaning the intent here was mass murder\nRudimentary but functional rudimentary but functional as a gym or\nScrew don't shoot up whatever from CNN said also\n\nA report that that time or had nowhere back actually hit on that ... that's exactly right arm o'clock alarm functions exactly right\nReally okay I can\nBuild ... good morning what's up and I think you're spot on I never thought of it now if you stay on it but I think you're spot on about this\nAll fake and and they're being generated by somebody trying to distract from\nThis caravan and all the other thing to do that over the here are we don't like that that all all seem to show that the way to actually get\nOn that\nAnd all of a bill they object to the gym that the Republicans are going to hold onto the Senate or they got to dry it got to have to drive the out there that the other way and um some of the vote away on the Republican\nOr maybe even motivates them Democrats to actually go vote or something like that maybe independence to go yet the trumps great great I think\nI think you're caught on to a ... not that may very well not not that somebody\n[laughter] we don't want to hurt anybody we don't want to hear Obama we don't want to hurt on the water we just want to send a a an opinion out there that it's gotta be somebody on the right yep we uh\nI think you're right on that [laughter] it sounds kind of your\n... you know and in ... thank you very much appreciate that you know the\nThe media will be like how can you say that that's crazy you got to take this stuff's seriously unless they don't take it seriously I'm just saying again\nThey're trying to change the narrative and give it to people to vote Democrat may have nothing else and this was desperate times and why would they not be able to do this after they literally tried to destroy Brett Kavanaugh as life based on nothing\nUnconfirmed reports and they kept lying about it and again in this they lied about fast and furious\nAnd what happened to Brian Terry with guns came from the light about Benghazi I that's just me will continue it got much more coming up right now there were a little bit late six thirty six uh you know the it was actually an attack you know that there was some\nActual poisonous material mailed the Trump but you probably didn't hear about that did you funny how that works I'll tell you about that coming up here's Fox\nFox News I'm Chris foster that knowing is suspicious packages center critics of President Trump today is former vice president Joe Biden in

play a million soundbites of Eric Holder you don't play the Hillary one real quick to go back to the hill remember the Hillary soundbite where she said we you know we shouldn't be civil until we get

anymore all about this no migrant caravan all this I\nJust too obvious to me I'll tell you that the second thing I think you need to know that my government is still working and the Trump tweeted out this morning or to our friend and brand enjoyed brand in general national border patrol council is right when he says on Fox and friends the Democrat inspired laws\nMake it tough for us to stop people at the border must be changed but\nI'm bringing out the military for this national emergency they will be stopped wow that's new bringing up the military\nThird thing I think you need to know the Arizona troopers association has withdrawn and their support for years in cinema\nApparently some knuckle heads up on the board of the Arizona troopers association or a couple of guys on their own said we like cinema and the the actual troopers the union members they got massive there was no vote so they withdrew it they got mad so obviously they didn't want to support cinema\nThey didn't say they support makes Sally but I Believe it speaks volumes three things I think you need to know so\nUh you have this whole situation going our ... just one more time this is just my quick hypothesis\nI we have this could be a lunatic we don't know this could be someone that's like I'm just so sick and tired of Trump getting attacked I'm going to just send these things to scare people but I mean ... you have to be sick free to do this kind of stuff to send these these fake bombs right you suspicious unlimited calling them suspicious packages they're fake bombs\nOr whatever so you sit back and say Garrett how can you actually do this how how how can you say Democrats can be behind it wouldn't shock you won Democrats ruined cab they tried to ruin it and it's a man's life for political power\nThey had no problem in front of his wife and kids calling him a a guy that drug to women to have sex with them\nAnd even worse\nThey have no problem doing that they no problem lying about what happened to bin ... leaving Americans including an ambassador to be killed by terrorists\n\nIf you know they're willing to do all this stuff you think they're not willing to stick some fake bombs in the mail to change the news cycle the chain to try to change the narrative\nSo nobody's talking about the migrant caravan and I think it's something that people are not realizing they're hoping this will be a way to try to get people to not vote for Trump or Republicans\nI think the Democrats I think it's obvious by we can get ... you know again play soundbite after soundbite after somebody because they were all the same\nThey were all the same okay let's Ninety nine Ninety nine let's do Ninety nine real quick and they were all the same Nicole Wallace and I'll continue on this Nicole Wallace a rhino working for him MSNBC's or she needs a paycheck she's got to say things that are crazy\nOr blame Trump just like everybody else here we go listen to Nicholas\nCountry has a long history of rough and tumble down on top I think is undeniably and a category of his own way today and someone who came to hang on to the right thing at a moment when he is sort of ... of our climate and he has contributed to more than anybody else in American politics\nWhoa yeah those were barred from the president largely and the teleprompter when I looked\nAt in there at the end because like he didn't really mean you know he's he's against violence it was only in the teleprompter\nSo he is responsible over and over I'm look I'm watching it and they also the same thing Trump's rhetoric can't be ignored Trump's rhetoric causes so you have all this so Democrats are hoping for is crap we we didn't get a Kavanaugh denied we couldn't convince the public that he was a sexual deviant and Republicans are because they back um\n\nUh we we can't we can't convince people are that this migrant caravan we need we need open borders that's not good people are mad at us they don't like fourteen thousand people coming to the southern border of America and demanding to be let in\nWe have no good economic plan we screwed up health care they're not buying the whole idea that they should trust us with healthcare we brought Obamacare that screwed everything up made everything worst what do we have we have not that I tell you what what is the only way we can get people to vote for us hey Trump\nGet it let's just put out these ... again this is my about this this let's just put out a bunch of fake bombs address to big name Democrats people that Trump has taken a you know as I said publicly that he\nDisagrees with now again Trump has not started these fights with these people these people started to fight to Trump but\nDoesn't matter big name people that Trump fights within public let's put them out there so people will think we can have Republican stay in power because we're going to have crazy things like this happen this I think is the last Hail Mary\nJust when we thought what else could they do after cabin on all this other stuff this this\n\nThey're hoping that they are hoping that people will actually sit back and say man Trump is causing this craziness to happen I I\nPublic and I can't do it [noise] that's my take on this it's just obvious these are literally fake freaking bombs and if you sit back\nAnd and not only do you use the same you heard it like an echo chamber\nAll the cable news channels and the network news Trump's rhetoric is responsible for this you can't deny Trump's rhetoric can't deny Trump's rhetoric these are people that Trump's email us ... you know what let's play number one hundred sleepy eye Chuck Todd this is what he said yesterday your ego ready to go\nBut let's be realistic it's hard not to say the obvious here at least politically speaking especially considering it was just going to last year Republican Congressman Steve ... was shot\nBy somebody from the left politically every one I just\nMentioned it's been targeted in this incident has been singled out by the president or strict defensively [noise] really [noise]\nHillary has said some awful things about from being a racist or sexist his the borders racist sex as big as this that blah blah blah\nLast week Hillary said we can't be civil until we get power back we played the soundbites for God's sakes so Hillary said that last week you have Obama\nSay in a a terrible terrible things about Trump\nIs this huge debts\nYou have Joe Biden challenging Trump to a fight you have Maxine Waters saying Trump's a racist or sexist we're going to impeach him needs to be out getting the faces of of people that support Trump getting the faces of people that work in his administration all that stuff\nDeniro saying F Trump played deniro got deniro bite by Bob De Niro we got to play by because this is very important\nIs is that the media is is terrible and and you see a nice ... member would deniro said this is what started the feud with deniro listen to this\nOne thing from [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nMm shakes his hand like uncle Leo and Raymond Raymond\nYeah so these are not people that Trump's saw it out to say I'm going to argue with you they all took shots at Trump they all took shots at Trump that's it\nTrump fired back at them Eric Holder all these guys they Trump fired back at them\nThat's it's\nEight eight zero can as the eight zero five six seven as the media as being one hundred percent dishonest with this whole situation\nI mean ... everything\nOh yeah yeah you know what Nancy Pelosi listening when ... he said last week listen to this good\nCall we owe the American people can be there for them for their natural ... ... ... and that country and there's some on\nCollateral damage ...\nPlus some others who didn't share veal well healthy at the head of the average purpose yeah\nIf you if you get hurt you don't share our view oh well greater good All right Ryan I just put in the control screen the Hillary member would Hillary said let's listen to this or we go\nYou cannot be several with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough\nTo win back the house and or the Senate that twin civility can start again but I feel that the only thing that the Republicans seem to\nRecognize and respect strength\nI think this is gonna backfire of the Democrats again it's\nSo obvious that somebody planted this stuff they're all getting delivered at the same damn time same fake stopped the packaging all looks the same\nYou know you need to thank for this a red backfiring on them Al Gore he brought us the Internet and now you can get your news sources from everywhere not just the papers and tell them ... ... you're the\nBest is spread like wildfire sure does but you sit back and say Americans are going to look at this and say again they went after Kavanaugh they say crazy things they have NO PLAN the Democrats and not the ones that actually condemn antifa have they ever came over the ever condemned antifa ever\n\nGive me one instance when Trump talked about violence no tell me oh you did Greg G and forty body slammed the report him up\nHe was being facetious you was laughing me a break\n[noise] that's why he shot us\nSo a reporter if you can't hear reporters ask Nancy Pelosi and\nWe've heard from her didn't give his right at the ... and we have heard comments from Republicans including Congress about vitriolic rhetoric from the left being in some way to blame I went to the uh the question in there and you'll hear Nancy\nAnd we have are sounds from Republicans\nIncluding Congress about Israel like\nBeing in some ways [noise]\nWell I think that you have questions an excellent one and I think that the comments made by magnet public ... colleagues are outrageous yeah they need to take many of the job that they hold any dignity and respect that we would like Congress to command\nBecause you can't blame Democrats for this guy shooting up people you can't you can't do it let's continue throwing back over there just doesn't\nHave their they say such a thing but it's so ... so this sick individual ... ... ... yeah and it was horrible what he did all yeah but then to all the sudden they sanctimonious as if they don't never seen such a thing before\nWell have and I don't even want to go into president the United states but in terms of some of the language that his you know again I\nLet's go there and the other day that since you asked\nHow could they possibly have such as first of all and the timing of outrage and everybody is so sad so concerned ... coming together\nWhy isn't it happening now\nAll of a sudden these random hoax bomb show up and you blame the\nPresident's rhetoric

Cuomo's office one Cuomo's office denied reports it had received a suspicious package but he said it to Cuomo announced on the air his office received a device\nLet me let me go let me go the British ... over the number one Cuomo is a sequence of events go into the media governor Cuomo's office denied reports it had received a suspicious package bend to Cuomo announced on the air is office had received a device number three NYPD said the packaging question was simply literature\n[noise] what he wanted so badly this is what his own brother report he was his brother was mocking him on CNN listen to this right\nA couple of the packages were hand delivered the post markings on immediate help to them in that regard the package center the governor who yes as my brother Andrew Cuomo is my brother\nThat package I don't even know if it's related based on the recording it I've heard off there was no explosive device there's no powder their markings on the outside that are not similar to what happened in other instances like what happened here at CNN so I'd go slow on seeing that as related\nHis own brother it's like I go slow I don't even know when my brother said was related in these packages I I'd I'd go slow\nI goes when your brother who's the dumb one of the family is correct to use the governor you know things are bad\nSo I'm In my kids' soccer practice last night and I'm getting my I'm getting a text from a buddy of mine who's telling me oh it'd be sending me stories and everything else any course everything in this world rub\nRelates to Seinfeld so my buddies like dude and I have to clip for you he goes when when Cuomo was you know right off the bat I got a device I got a device it reminded him of Seinfeld episode where we're Jerry\nRejected a package guy shows up you have a package you're rejecting this back Jim rejecting the packages no return address so Jerry rejects the package from a delivery guy and then as he rejected George walks in and this happens\nPlus refused that everybody loves the package\nWas weird crazy printing I don't know it's from\nSo what do you think it's a bomb\nIt's not totally impossible\nThere you go on you [laughter]

later on in the night\nLast night on CNN he's on his little brother show and it was really annoying they were going to little brother big brother a little while they were calling each other that on the on the it's like so let me let me straight I'm supposed to believe everything you say you think as a little brother you are going to rip your big brother even though he did say I'll give it to him you know I don't know if that the package my brother claims he got was\nActually related to all this stuff and it turns out it was an informational packet about a person\nI got a device abominable\nOh here's Andrew Cuomo again it's it's all Trump's fault that these random oaks bomb things are being sent that listen to this\nYou need is a big turnout he doesn't want to lose the Congress he wants to fire up his base and he's firing off his back\nThe lesson here is\nThat much hate\nMuch venom\nMob tell ya the bad people yeah there are people who are affected by that were emotional be [noise]\nAnd in this way down load from the Internet how to build the ball\nAnd when you are spreading that hate [noise]\nAh it's almost inevitable\nSomeone or some group is going to feed off\nSo there it is it's Trump's faults because he spreads eight and venom and everything else and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah\nOh the oh Trump's the one he's spreads that Haiti's spreads the venom he does he does all that stuff I mean I have an example of it here it is Trump spreading the hate [laughter]\n\nYeah there you go that that was mixing ... that was ... that that was amazing and it's like and that was Maxine knock off the first one to go after the second Trump and Pence and memory here's more from paid for Maxine Waters\nWe don't ask permission to protest [laughter]\nAmerica here at the

here\nYou're not welcome here anyway she bragging about threatening Trump supporters more I mean we ... we can go on and on if you'd like\nYeah why not well do it after\nEight until we got to get some calls and by the way there is a great story to you want to know why this is happening also the changing of the narrative and I think it's not just changing the narrative off the and it's like nonstop coverage of the freaking bombs right\nThese hoax bombs which I think they could be wrong but I think they're hoax bombs\nTerms of their real bombs they'd be talking about what was sophisticated about them and how they extended what they did it'd be everywhere\nSo it's not stopped coverage of this which is taking it off the migrant Caribbean even though we have not forgotten about the micro caravan and really twelve or twelve days out of election they were over a lot of us have already voted um but\nHere's a story in the Washington Post because again this is part of this story is to try to convince people to not vote for Republicans 'cause he got to take power away from Trump because he is inciting crazy people to send fake bombs or they think real bombs or whatever people\nTo enemies to silence them which is such crap we got to play the Trump soundbite from yesterday where he talked about all this stuff but he was a story for the Washington Post we'll get to this after calls as well ready for it ready for this just came out this morning the Washington Post ... are Democrats worry about twenty sixteen repeat in house races\nYou're ready for this after two years of energizing rallies fist pumping speeches and talk about a building blue wave Democrats in recent days have gone to feel a last minute belt of nausea wash over them oh no\nTerrified of reliving the G action they

points just a few weeks ago she said from a campaign headquarters\nSandwiched between the bake shop in a gun store quote the last poll we got back a couple of days ago at us exactly tied\nOh no\nOh no these are the ones that should be I don't want to say the easiest but really the ones that should flip from red to blue and this kind of climate she later said about district such as hers won by Hillary and twenty sixteen we can't do these ones on how on earth are we going to do the ones that are more read\n\nOf the twenty five Republican held districts that Clinton won Democrats are favored in Lebanon while Republicans are favored in three according to latest readings from cook Political Report which is full of it by the way but twelve are still toss ups and they're seeing a burst of energy and spending for both sides in a way that has Republicans feeling bullish and Democrats worried\n\nThe problem for Democrats says here their candidates are awash in attention the money is pouring into volunteers eager to help and many of these seats voters who live in the districts are proving more difficult to win over than Democrats once hoped\nMaybe because they actually like what's going on to the country with the jobs in the economy and they don't like the the author gutter everything that Democrats do with ruining Brett Kavanaugh organizing mobs not condemning this are being okay with people getting chased out to restaurants and yelled out in public places we don't want that in America\nWe don't want that so there we go there we go\nYou got to see this right you got to

I\nAm sitting here listening watching yeah that's Sarbanes urban thinking about a ... even though I never met him Ahmed all end with this kind of inspiration I Will go and take Trump out tonight [noise]\n\nBurn I haven't been earning were have meaning words have\nMeaning words have meaning don't take\n[noise] yeah [noise]\nWell this is why it's so phony it's so fake matter it was probably the montage this is so good\n... Jeff Flake space like ... like a male version of ...\nIt just occurred to me he is got this painful look on his face always ripping Trump only speaking in a monotone boring way always overreacting about stupid crap\n\nI Can't believe they are saying well corrupt I mean this is just outrageous you can have the why were sick and politicians get away with crimes\nScrew you Jeff\nOh way so a good old are you know Jeff Flake but we went on the\nView dude goes on the view you know what he says when he's on the view I I I'm really not sure if I Believe Brett Kavanaugh but I voted for him anyway\nWhich made all the crazies just lose their mind so they all love Jeff Flake 'cause he rubs Trump and then as soon as he says that they all turn their back he got attacked on Twitter by all the big time lives oh they went great you did just that they will they will throw you under the bus just as quickly as they praise you you do Jeff Flake\nAnyway oh yeah\nSo let's play the the awesome among Taj number eighty nine this is different members of the media yesterday blaming Trump's for these hopes bombs being sent nobody knows who sent 'em or why or how or what yet Trump's responsible listen as\nRhetoric senator against the news media CNN\nDebate of the American people for example faces I've asked do the violent tendencies at least in some people [noise]\nWhy I think that that's obvious I've ever concerned about this for a long time he thinks joke about it like in the Senate started in January of this rhetoric nobody's remember\nWe have a president who has talked for a couple of years now about imprisoning his political rival and Hillary Clinton who is encouraged violence against the media she's a last week talking about the assault on reporter by congressman in Montana and saying that he that he is kind of guy [laughter]\nHard to see this outside of the context of the president's still itty ability towards towards Mrs Clinton who tried to briefly speak towards unity towards rock Obama tours George Soros the closet has it in the fall is always there\nAlways are right there did they really say do you speak to the unity the watch because Hillary said that because you don't have these fake bombs are dressed her watch\n\nCan you play what's on the control screen you have to cancel this out can you put Hillary spoke last week\nHillary said this\nYou cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough\nTo win back the house and or the Senate that's when the lady can start again\nBut until then the only thing that the Republicans seem to\nRecognize and respect strength\nShe wasn't going for civility then now was she nope not until we get\nPower let's continue montage president and his allies they need to dial down to the political rhetoric they on making people let's say they are making journalists let's say and they were making law enforcement officers ... said oh\nWe don't know who are we don't know what their motive was\nRight but it's a very obvious thread and maybe it's meant as a ruse but it's an obvious threat the Obamas according to the armed Brennan's CNN um George Soros these are people and organizations that President Trump continually attack demonize them\nThey attack ... if you look at who they've targeted so far it's almost like they're following Donald Trump's Twitter feed and starting with Debbie Wasserman Schultz\nNot shake certainly one question for the president one question for the White House is the rhetoric the intense rhetoric that he has been saying and his supporters have been giving out over these last several weeks leading into mid\nMid term elections and certainly even before that is that contributing to any of this\nIt's really incredible really incredible stuff\nAnd he also said that Republicans actually won in person early voting yesterday in Florida and that never happened at all and the twenty sixteen election\nIncredible stuff you mean it really is incredible stuff I might have to go uh\nBy the way that call was a a what a text to voice message on our on our thing yes on ... and it said a fake news fake bombs what's next a flaming pool on the porch raining pooh on the\n... oh okay I Gotcha I thought he had cool I'm like what the poop poop poop ... let's play some audio real quick All right uh I Know I Know it's terrible [noise]\nHere we go again one old shoe a columnist from New York Post on MSNBC is miserable again if you ever watch me ... show\nIt's just a bunch of somber gloomy people that think the end of the world is coming over I mean for three hours\nJumping Horowitz Haiti's never\nTrump or allegedly conservative columnist I guess from New York Post went on to 'em again Trump's rhetoric is responsible here we go\nIn the United states right now\nWe have solid economic growth we have lower unemployment [noise] we have all kinds of social peace but we haven't had him and we do have a country in the post war era yeah low crime a female yeah we have a lot of places we have some terrible things the opioid epidemic I mean we have an al yeah\nThis is an unusual circumstances and that's one of the reasons that it is fair to blame in terms of the president's rhetoric not only the president's wherever it but the rhetoric all sorts of irresponsible rhetoric to sort of rhetoric that has led led a that led whole component to shoot up a correctional softball\nGame oh but still trumps responsible somehow but have you ever seen anything by the way if you've ever seen anybody in the cable news era\nRipped Democrats\nAre pushing people to act like animals during the cabin all situation the cabin or confirmation act like animals chasing Republicans out of restaurants and they ... this is not how we should live no they never do it but then yesterday all about Trump Trump is the worst I have more to get you to talk about\nUm [noise] we got we got to
