being in the year is a woman a record number are running for office some four hundred and Seventy six women filed to run for the U.S house this year that's nearly double the number and twenty sixteen and women make up over half of the electorate fifty three percent\nOf course that doesn't guarantee when for female candidates not all women vote for women\nAnd even though over half of women voted for Hillary Clinton in twenty sixteen that still leaves a sizable minority forty one percent that backed Donald Trump so our latest successful ask voters if there were two candidates and the only thing you knew was that one was a man and the other woman how would you vote\nWomen voters pick the female candidate by twenty eight point while men picks a male candidate by eleven\nOverall that puts the female candidate up by at ten point margin and that's a good sign for the year the woman be sure to follow us on Twitter or handle is at\nFox News hole I'm Dana Blanton and that's your poll furry [noise]\nOh what is up It's Tuesday it is October second [noise]\nWe're here if something is a pool that Sylvia dark outside [laughter] at six o'clock in the ... there's nothing I live at except for the fact is a very scary ... a parking lot\nExactly that's what I Know but other than that it's cool to get here are you voting ritual me Gerald Lewis came in the aims of Ninety two sons most stimulating talk a and shockingly enough there are three things I think you yes\nYes you need to know a number one well scratch this chick off the list\nSweat Nick Julie sweat big of an interview on NBC and contradicts pretty much everything that she said about bread cabin on the party and everything so they should yeah yeah this is working out well isn't it this is I mean this is going swimmingly right this is this is fantastic\nWe'll play the sound bites or just show it to you and improve it to you and and then you can hear it and you can have a lot of fun right yeah I have fun with that one\nSecond thing that I think yeah that I think you need to know\nIs this is very interesting this goes to show you that um [noise] information is power there was a poll done should read Kavanaugh will be confirmed\nAmazingly enough when the people in the polar told and this was by the way a Harvard Harris Poll yes or a Harvard Harris survey um when people are told\nThat every single witness\nOh Christine for the ... every single named ... put out there does not corroborate her story all of a sudden the can ferment Brett Kavanaugh part of the poll shoots up to\nOh you want to know that right now are no give me a suspense\nI'll get to that very good I'll get to that\n\n[noise] I've been actually no no it's fine okay when when the respondents are told the three name witnesses do not corroborate Ford's claims fifty seven percent say they're in favor of his confirmation\n\nIf the FBI finds no cooperation for Ford's claim sixty percent say Kevin ... should be confirmed\n\nWow now what does it before uh it's in the forties will get into that third thing I think you need to know and there's a lot of stuff here but here we go uh apparently the women behind the Jeff Flake elevator set up are far left is that worked for George Soros\nMultiple stories [noise] confirming this now [noise] they are far left wing activists either Jeff Flake\nFell for it or maybe he was complicit in it is well was it a set up\nThree things I think you need to know that maybe that should be number one item there's there and say hey hey yeah\nYeah ah\nBy the way the New York post has covered today\nSix percent of Republican women back Brett Kavanaugh eighty six percent of Republican women women [noise]\nThat's a big deal right big monster ball thrown out there so we have so this poll is really remarkable\nUm they they you know basically it's divided bipartisan lines this whole situation Democrats don't like 'em Republicans love them so Mark Penn to form a Bill Clinton pollster who has at least he's honest then he's ripped into Hillary and the Democrats for you know basically making bad decisions doing bad things he is the Harris Poll\nChair they reported that forty percent\nOf people that saw read parts of the testimonies last Thursday felt that only Ford seems credible\nTwenty three percent said only Kavanaugh seem credible\nReally\nTwenty seven percent said both seem believable sixty seven percent felt Ford was credible fifty percent overall said Kavanaugh was credible\nSo you have there's a lot of numbers but on the radio I get I get it but people were on Ford side\nBut that's again where it gets very interesting the credibility of the testimony doesn't appear to be the decisive factor writes Mark Penn you're not crazy ... the credibility doesn't seem to be the deciding factor\nComes down to cooperation oh again which is what we've been talking about which is what the Democrats the media don't want to talk about\n\nI mean one more time say and I said it in the three things when we say it again when respondents were told that the three name witnesses\nDo not corroborate what Christine Ford claimed fifty seven percent say they are in favor say aye I'm In favor of it was confirmation so when they were told that hey\nNobody backs of what she says than they were at then they were the they said\nThe FBI do the extra investigation and finds no crop ration it shoots up the sixty percent saying you should be confirmed\nSo that's a pretty big jump right there isn't it\nThe people that watched it said only ... only twenty three percent said he seemed credible\nFor people that saw read parts of it\nSo there you go um once people know the facts it's funny how that works isn't it\nI was talking to a listen again I I I Love my best friend is a good guy\nDoesn't follow really the news that much\nSo I'll give them a few days ago and this is what just disturbs me a little bit but it goes into my theory of not everyone should vote and my friends are very smart guy ah he's a physician's assistants um he does All right\nSo I was talking to him a few days ago and and all of a sudden the news right the news kind of came up and I brought up the Supreme Court thing and he goes man it's obvious is Kevin Guy says he's not a good guy\nAnd I said why would you say that was ... obviously I you know and I voted for Trump but he's just not a good guy and listen my friend is not a Republican he's not a Democrat is one of those guys that were I think is the best of me to vote for\nNo no it's not so bad at all but\nAnd I never lose the friendship over there's a lifelong friendship but he uh ... I said so you think that the stories are out there I said I don't know if you're if you're aware of this or not I said but every single\nPerson that this woman claimed as a witness said it never happened he went oh I said yeah and I said on top of that go do you think that guy looks like a gang rape is don't you think they would have come out earlier that he's a gang rapist drugging girls\nWell you know uh\nI just I just don't like any of these people and they're all corrupt above all my [noise] okay [noise] but I mean that that's what it comes down to is that when people don't know the facts which is why the media goes on these tangents I mean you will ever watch cable news\nThen you probably shouldn't have done you shouldn't they go to the people that go up on these tangents that make literally no sense I mean we put but we have from yesterday it's like one of my favorite soundbites we played it later on in the show from yesterday [noise]\nUm where the chick talked about ... um it's you've Angelina ... this was a yet the Ninety eight rate of Angeline going as a on Saturday on ... weekend Fox show this happened question answer go\nWhat if the parents ... series of interviews confined no corroboration for Dr forwards charges or something real happened or what but the FBI can so confined ogre operations out it was indeed\nThe judge on I think what you're saying it's a great point um can we need cooperation and in a way to allocate it what type of copper cooperation in how to find corroborating I didn't\nKnow there is a type of cooperation Bill Clinton yeah she's a lawyer I don't know there's a type of cooperation and I know there were like alternative definitions to cooperation pretty much cut and dry isn't it Gary what is the definition of is Keith [laughter]\nAnd then when you say corroborate each talking about like somebody like saying like I was there and it's true or like I heard about it I didn't see it but I just don't know I Would\nWatch what what what\nYou see you have that I mean these are the cruise the craziest things that he that I've heard about this they it's just the ultimate in India and again it takes all the credibility away from these these networks in shows that it's just time to fail you want people to say crazy things so we talk about it\nThere's nothing truthful behind it so Marc Lamont hill was on CNN yesterday Marc Lamont hill is a professor somewhere which is quite disturbing to be honest with you I mean it's really bad so he's on CNN\nOr you can do that and then talk about John McCain in a derogatory way than talk to ... to\nMexicans in a derogatory way that I just think that we've got to do better than that we uh we have referred to our opponents political opponents on the other side of the aisle as losers in clown\nSo he takes the liberal talking point of Trump's hate Mexicans mhm we know exactly what Trump said when he said they they don't send their best which we know they send drug dealers is on rape is in a some are good people that's what he said you know again here's Jeff Flake once you get standing up for other people or people other than Arizona it's\nSoul\nObama lying about Ben ... doesn't disqualify him for being president\n... worried about what Trump said about Obama ... ruin people's lives for years and that still okay and Jeff lakes mind Donald Trump is literally turned around everything and he just can't take it is so blinded by his hatred\n\nFor Donald Trump show blinded\nThat he has to say these things that he ... he just sounds deranged as any in a very calm way you know he can be very calm what he's saying well it literally makes no sense that disqualifies him so Trump by Obama lying about fast and furious Obama using the IRS\nTo go after conservative groups like the Tea Party groups that doesn't disqualify him from being president but Trump questioning Obama well that's that's just that's over the line\nObama spying on journalists\nJames Rosen AP reporters Cheryl accusation\nThat's okay\nThis guy is so I mean he is he ... over the cuckoo's nest [noise] we have more about him and they will get into the de de de women seven ten this morning the women behind it where the women that were there yelling at him\nWith their ties to George Soros in groups that he fun ... oh yeah so again you step to sit back and say was this just a big set up what is it\nIt's something you really have to think about those I mean really really so we have that you know what I have to some drinking stories about current Supreme Court justices\nI have some of those we'll get to that and ... a being tossed out of the club here which Snoop Dogg said about um some other people will get to that as well because he went full mega any

breaking story from the New York times\nOh man it's just stupid like I Can't I Can't tell you how stupid this is\nThe latest the latest claim is that back in Nineteen eighty five Brett Kavanaugh was it a New Haven bar and New York times found a police report that claim that apparently he threw ice that somebody\n[noise] yep bad person that well he's but he was at a bar where do you think these senators and Congress people go every single night [laughter] when did it going to a bar become bad especially when you're in college\nYeah or the New York times\nUh say a professor at North Carolina State University that was a former yeah classmate of Brett Kavanaugh was claim Kavanaugh quote\nThrough a beer in someone's face after heated exchange of words police eventually got involved want to Kevin O's friends spent the night in jail reporters obtained a New Haven police report detailing the incident only to discover that while police were indeed involved\nKavanaugh was questioned for allegedly throwing ice in another customer space for quote someone a reason\nAnd that a student named Chris deadly but in the NBA for a whole bunch of years for New Jersey nets and some other teams\nChris Dudley not cabinet actually the beer glass which hit the Twenty one year old victim in a year so you have this one professor that said I went to college\nWith Brett Kavanaugh and I know that he threw a glass at a guy's ear well it turns out the police report said Chris Dudley through the beer glass which hit the the twenty year old a Twenty one year old in the ear\nBy the crust only seven feet tall he's NBA was NBA player played a yelling Dudley the glass thrower issued a flat denial to law enforcement so they didn't do it according to police report Kevin refused to say whether he threw ice or not\nLike ice cubes Kavanaugh was not arrested according to New York times and the police report so the latest allegation is that he was not arrested for something that he didn't do\n[noise]\nThis seven day extension is going well isn't it [noise]\nAnd the guy that brought it up actually identified the wrong guy Kevin or through the glass\nLoose sports that it was ... recently told police I didn't do that\n\nThere you go hang on Frank last McKay NFC hello Frank\nBy Frank you and you're telling me to take calls which I Love by the way I Love taking calls eight eight zero

there like Lindsey Graham and say okay thank you for telling me this I'm Sorry this happened to you but there's nothing to do with Brett Kavanaugh\nSort of these women confronted flake a Washington Examiner reporter escalated the women who confronted you this morning did they have any role in changing your mind flake said no no really really\nWant to wait if you don't mind a Jeff Flake was in

that actually happened why is this not a sting headlines because it's for white people and anti Trump professor at Georgetown University\nDr Carroll Christine fair and associate professor in the security studies program\nTweeted out that a white Republican senators specifically Lindsey Graham who defended cabinet member that we played it white Republican senators deserve miserable deaths\nDo you want to know what the exact tweet is\nThis is what she wrote look at the end she I think she meant this but she rode the bus look at those chorus of entitled white men justifying a serial rapists

miserable death small feminist laugh at them as they take their last gas and bonuses they cast read their corpses and feed them to swine\n\nThat's just crazy I obviously she's been thinking about this very very long time like that yeah I mean obviously somebody dumped her and she got mad and uh this is this is really this is really gross really gross cast rate their corpses and feed them to swine\n\nShe didn't delete the tweet of course but it's the Internet is herpes it lasts forever\nApparently she went on a profanity laced Twitter tirade against Brett Kavanaugh calling the are calling him a rapist and a perjure\nOf course there's actually no evidence of any of that but whatever she described Republicans as quote F ing and death cult filthy swine\nGeorgetown University professor I Would think that she probably doesn't deserve to teach anymore at least if like if I was in charge of George W like this woman's kind of toxic we're going to let her go that's just me but you know it's academia so I'm sure will actually be okay she'll be All right right\nUm one student on campus reform about this I don't think that I don't think people at Georgetown actually employees should be held to a significantly lower standard clearly in every students that see this Rand are going to feel threatened if they have opinions that differ from hers now I think about this okay all of a sudden\nYou have people accusing Brett Kavanaugh of\nOf not having the right demeanor the right temperament because oh man oh man he he got mad as hell for being called a gang rape is that drug women\nA drug women and he and his buddies form trains to line up and raped women I mean I think that any of us would be pretty upset about it right\nThis woman is clearly disgusting discuss you weren't talking about temperament for the job\nYeah uh she told Fox News her tweets are her private speech and referred to a blog post she wrote on her personal site\nIn which she wrote she chose her
