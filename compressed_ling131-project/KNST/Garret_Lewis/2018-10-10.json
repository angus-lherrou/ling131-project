want to talk about that I mentioned with\nAnn Kirkpatrick\nA here's didn't cinema it's all up for you eight eight zero ... eight zero five six seven eight let's play some soundbites shall we we need to place them soundbites 'em and you know I'm getting emails and it's right listen if you've been listening all all the questions that they were asked\nThere were no follow up nothing like that you want to hear what you know one of the it's just like the biggest BS question some guy that works for the NPR station up in Phoenix ...\nAsked this question my wife was like where did he get where does he have this information from you number thirty nine I said this is what happens this is what they don't invite me to these things listen to the question that was asked here we go\nTo let you know community we do is not monolithic but as a group they tend to specifically opposed President Trump's plan for a border wall\nHow specific would you be as far as those and what to do community who see bigotry and the White House how would you try to redress up\nSo this guy is going on the assumption there not monolithic I Can't see that they all think the same and I can't stereotype but obviously they're against\nReally\nAnd not only they against Trump's border wall\nBecause they're Hispanic and that's what I was thinking and Hispanics have to be against the border wall\nYou know you could tell or Hispanics living her neighborhood because they knocked down the walls in between the houses you can totally I mean I think is that not true should we not go with that all Hispanics in southern Arizona\nIf they buy a house in you know then I suburbs somewhere and there's a wall in between the houses do they not knock them down because they're so offended by them\n\nThe dead giveaway there is a Hispanic right there oh boy the stupidest crap ever heard in my life\nAnd then they all think Trump's of big it\nWas when it comes down to they all think Trump so big so by the way I'll leave it up to you\nIf you you write if you're Hispanic and you\nYou have an issue with what Steve ... said right there that Hispanics are against Trump's border wall and I think he's a big it you could let me know and you could even maybe it maybe Steve all here to nose eight eight zero can as the\nZero five six seven eight but that's the quality of questions and there were some okay not one question about Cabot all about the protestors are about uh the uh the charges\nThat had no cooperation yet discovered it drags it might not one question from these people to Marquez Peterson or Kirkpatrick about that but let's let's continue shall we\n\nI don't know if you're aware of this but in her Patrick was caught we played it was hard to hear but she right at the Viking hotel she was caught on camera\nKilling a supporter I Will totally voted to impeach from ... like there's no tomorrow well she dodged the question was for a number forty eight real quick about this um number forty eight this is what you said about impeaching Trump yesterday here we go in for Patrick\n[noise] do you think President Trump has committed impeachable offenses and would you support pursuing articles of impeachment against him at this point\nYou know as a prosecutor I never interfered with the law enforcement investigation\nI let them complete their work bring their report to me and then I went to look at our and make a judgment as to whether or not I would issue that chart\nCongressman that hang things gardening impeachment there there needs to be hearing and we need to like I Am Mr Mueller do his investigation with no interference from the administration\nI see a report at the end of the day look at it\nTo make sure that public knows what's in that report and then to make that decision has to be a thoughtful studious very careful process\nUh she didn't actually answer the question so Leah Marquez Peterson dark credit again if if you watch you probably didn't we actually looked calm cool collective even though you know in a big fan but I got to tell you how it is and look very nervous she looked like a lady would go home to a car like a house full of cats like one of those crazy people\n\nI Want you to hear number and this is Leno's do number\n[noise] thirty seven she responded to that to what a what an said thirty seven years later\nI agree we need an investigation it's one of the reasons I was shocked when and as a former prosecutor was caught on tape saying that absolutely impeach President Trump\nAnd without any kind of judgment and I think if you want to hear the audio for yourself you can go to Ann Kirkpatrick dot org and listen to that idea on here who say that without any kind of investigation she would impeach the\nBoom good for you but let's get this out of the way you know he was on the show if you don't know\nAs a matter of fact Brian can you actually find the the soundbite we should've I should've ... during the break I Apologize the famous Leah Marquez Peterson soundbite when she acted as if she didn't know what chain migration\nWas she was on the show and it was right at the time when she you know basically make Sally was hinting she was running for Senate they totally blew it and make Sally and Peterson camps ... said I'm running for me family see before me soundly sort of running for Senate or Jeff Flake seat\nSo the big the big topic\nWas a chain migration Trump's going on everybody's going around saying we need to end chain migration and it'd be the diversity lottery\nWe didn't merit based immigration\nNot family you know because what happens if you don't know chain migration means one person to they could bring your whole family and can be it's up if they have thirty eight people in their family they could bring them on in aunts uncles cousins grandfather's nieces nephews\nThey could bring them on in one person allowed in bringing there's no limit on the amount of people right\nSolely uh when she was in Studio there it is right there uh I think it's the bottom one right there oh no no I'm Sorry I was wondering about that\nUm when he was in Studio I asked her about this and remember she was out of the Tucson Hispanic Chamber she hated Trump She was against the wall I mean I brought her she at least you got to come in I was like why are you against the wall it's a bad message for trading on trade they don't come across in the desert to come across the roads and on on the rail line the walls not going to stop that\nWell crap\nSo this is Lee on the show listen to this okay but\nBut when it comes to everybody's versus just changed I mean would you like to end chain migration\nWell right now it's based on the country you're in and there's so many beef as eligible and and there's such a small a percentage and those that when I come in from various countries I think we need to rework that entire complexes so would would you want to end chain migration though chain migration what do you mean by that no\nWhen one person has admitted here and they could bring it somewhere twenty to to to\nI mean they are they on average I think a person coming here from Mexico brings something close to six relatives here with them that's why the guy the guy that we did the terrorist attack up in New York you drove into people on the west side highway a guy out here in the lotteries right able to bring I Believe it was twenty two or twenty three members of his family here via chain migration\nHey I think the bigger question is how do we bring people here to work or perhaps when a rate getting money to do that that's\nSomething that make a big difference back in their countries and then I don't know if you don't you don't think this is a big deal with chain migration do they have their ...
