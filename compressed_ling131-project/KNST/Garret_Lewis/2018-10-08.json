that dog ...\nSecond thing [laughter] second thing that I think you needed to know is that the crazies as a result of this\nAre going even more crazy where Susan Collins\nAnd our staff are being threatened with violence threatened with murder threatened with rape you know it's interesting these uh these uh cabin on protestors a claim that he was a rapist me get a rapist there and then they were like I Hope you get raped that's what they're saying that that that's how much\nThat they're out of their minds they're out of their minds they're literally hoping people get raped because they disagree with them politically that's disgusting this is a third thing I think you need to know\nDo you remember that democratic staffer that ducks to those Republicans she was that we thought it was an intern twenty seven year old Jackson Cosco was going to put out the personal info of oh he did but I personally involved Lindsey Graham Mike Lee Orrin Hatch\nOn their ... pages apparently\nIt's being reported that he was also going to put out the medical information somehow of their kids\nUm now\nIt's also being reported by the tendency started this guy was not an unpaid intern he actually\nWashington Post says that he was actually a paid fellow\nFellow\nWas confirmed by cost goes lawyer apparently he said his client was a fellow in Sheila Jackson leaves office he was being paid by an outside institution and Sheila Jackson Lee leaned on him\nFor advice that's who's\nIn her office that's who she asked for advice\nYeah three things I think you need to know do more on that show it happened it happened uh you have Susan Collins and people are right you know people like rolling out the red carpet for Susan Collins I even got emails as soon as it happens to people you know you might not want to Colorado Beth anymore\nNo [noise] no Susan Collins could have just simply said I support him she was grandstanding and listen she gave a good speech as to why she should back this guy but\nEvery senator could've done the same damn thing she ... she wanted the spotlight she wanted the drama\nAnd it was\nFun I'm Glad she voted for him she should have voted for him there was no reason for her to not vote for him\nIt's not a hero\nSo I'm not even know if you're on TALK I Know you're you're a hero yeah yeah okay sure right I Am the anti hero exactly I'd rather be that way\n[noise] ah\nLike their pool so [laughter] yeah I mean enough is enough ... enough is enough ah this is just this is craziness as to what's going on she's not a hero she decided to spend an hour talking about why she was going to confirming when she could have\nJust said I support him she didn't have to do all this stuff she had to explain it to you and me and everybody and she\nFell I mean while the rest of them gonna have to explain it this was this was all just a gigantic stage\nDid she won it made me you know maybe part of it she just wanted a shoveled up the other side's behind in a way and that was a little bit of it and that was kind of cool about it but listen she is already screwed up enough things with her love of Obamacare\nSo I Know there's enough she did a good job on this let it go Jeff Flake I think that's the last we're going to hear a Jeff Flake and I'm Glad that Jeff Flake voted for for ah for confirmation that's great he's still a is not in my good house and never will be\nAnd I'll never be in his good house\nSo enough is enough you want to know how is how crazy\nPolitics is now and how it's so becoming pop culture forget about this story Taylor Swift has never talk politics and now she's come out against Republican candidate for Senate in Tennessee Marsha Blackburn she's backing them don't you love it there are all about gender and women and feed about female power and she goes against the woman to back the man\n\nIt's just it's not even worth talking she's just not that smart the only thing is she has a good feeling and followers on social media are they really gonna listen to her or the people that follow or in social media they're the ones who never even show up to go vote\nWhich I'm okay with me uh but yeah you have Taylor Swift doing that stuff but I'm telling you\nIt's it's interesting ... really quick there was a UFC fight was you know people watch UFC\nIt's hard for me to watch I watch hockey fight but then to see these guys just beat the crap out it's just not it's not my thing I'm not saying you shouldn't do it I'm not saying these guys shouldn't do it they choose to go do this as a career and that's just the way it is right so are you want to know how this has reached\nThe pop culture in more ways than just Taylor Swift\nNumber Twenty one there's a UFC fighter named Nick lens and apparently the newer fighter

I think a lot about\nHow they were changing our strategy around ... you know a lot of inside baseball and inside the beltway ... literally had that arm thrown around but\nThere are various ... organizers will Congress and I guess organizers outbreak different room for different kinds of strategy and what it is really about organized fall\nAnd and we're very thing about that we're organizing radical people ... taken action or ... bring together at ... strategy of putting pressure on the shoulder and only focus on the pressures in five ... ... that's really interesting thought\nNo it's not did you get that though\nBecause people like oh she doesn't know what you're saying what is she going to do how she's going to get worked with these people what's going to happen when she says there's very few organizers all this stuff the organizers what did they organize they were going to the protests the crazies the screaming they're renting the threats of violence chasing people down in restaurants kicking them out\nShe wants to bring that inside the halls of Congress that's the future of the Democratic party right there that's what ... is the head of the Democratic National Committee said she's a future so if you're a Democrat man he must suck to be you right now because I mean it really stinks\nThis is what the Democrats have someone that wants to bring chaos violence insanity you name it\nThat's what they want\nYou can comment if you'd like eight eight zero Cain has the eight eight zero five six seven eight ...\n\nThis is the best they can do I have more to we've got to get through some\nCredit crazies were out the anti Trump or his never Trump or his on MSNBC this morning ... we'll we'll get to wear what one who was on the McCain and Romney teams\nWhat he says about Trump but he wanted to Republican I'm a conservative and I want Republicans vote straight Democrats just stop Trump that's what he said this morning but yet to hear why we'll get into that um but the big story again besides Nancy Pelosi saying what you said in showing how corrupt the Democrats are and that's why again it sucks to really be a Democrat\nThe big lesson is that Trump fought back Jeb Bush\nIf he were president within forty eight hours would've called up Brett Kavanaugh said hey bread sorry buddy you know you're a good guy I Know there's really nothing to do this but there's a lot of heat out there and I can't take this we can't do is not going to change they have it out for you man I really\nAppreciate it sorry this happened to you I'm going to have to nominate someone else\nYou know that would happen Trump stuck this thing through we right right and I would just watch will get some sound bites he was talking to the media he he loves to do any walking ...

calling out everybody for exactly what they are\nWhether it's Lisa Murkowski whether it's the Democrats were whether it's the media what they draw due to Kavanaugh he is just on a roll you want to you know it takes is brand new to politics year and a half is president I don't think I've ever seen him as comfortable and smooth with his answers\nI mean he does things in his own Trump being way don't get me wrong or when he brought up with humor what he said about Christine Ford the holes in her story it was brilliant some people don't get it but I said he did it because he forced the media to talk about the holes in her story\nMedia never reported that she didn't say where did you mean we listen to and watch them any reports that you see where they said well there was a problem with her testimony because she doesn't remember where this incident happened\nHow she got there how she left it's a big deal but he is\nHe's sharp man he loving every second of it is [noise]\nI'm digging as well get the highlights that coming up and what do you think you think the Republicans are now going to finally realized we should fight back like Trump doesn't matter what the media says we could fight back and we can when you just proved it eight twenty will continue ... am seven Ninety two sons most stimulating talk so\nIf if he's just acting like this because it's it's working for a for for the dawn ... then it's not who we truly is this is Donald Trump when you see 'em yep rag and people going off script and and making fun of you that's died mhm if this isn't truly Lindsey Graham and he's not going to ... you're not going to succeed you\nYou're you're right and he'll fall short or did he you know maybe he thought you know he was basically looked up as it did McCain as a mentor maybe\nAnd McCain always said well I mean ... ... yeah it'd be a statesman you can't do this you can't do that he got to be friendly with the media got it and he saw basically the party turn on McCain\n\nSo is he looking at the same McCain never won he kissed the media's but he had these views Trump doesn't give the media's but he keeps winning\nMaybe I don't need to be like that maybe I

think it\nIs tied up and this is another thing that's going on here she's clearly made endorsement in a race where it is very type the latest Fox News Paul has Bill Bryson down by five points that's one of the less favorable posts or at least the polls that we went to spy on CNN\nIt's one of the polls we display we would never display the polls that actually show Dems losing we wouldn't do that and then they just continue to like it was nothing oh yeah yeah about ... to CNN and miss it everybody is in my page ... dot com or so before the break and we just got too tight to the\nTo the break I said if there's any Democrat after all the craziness that's going on I mean we play play really we have so much stuff to play by play really quick I'm playing I'm playing I Know you are playing your

the wrap up near a Metallica concert wrapped up near the smear somebody\nFalse alerts and all the rest\nAnd then you write it unless they reported in the press that this this this and this\nSo they had that down the ... that depressed report it to smear and then it's called the wrath of me and then the merchandise\nDepressions report near that we made and it's it's a tactic\nIt's a tactic so we said these random things that Kavanaugh was a rapist and stuff like that and he drug women and stuff like that oh yeah you said that you reported it became like you know actually real like it was true even though it's fake news it was true so you have protests in like echoing many enough to use audio below sea thank you below sea\n[laughter] cyber below sea admitting they're willing to ruin someone's life for political power so I just sit back and wondered and we have a lot of Democrats here in Tucson obviously and the greater Tucson area will put your right to the front how can you actually sit back and vote for Democrats again I Would love to hear from you\nAs to why you would and maybe you're just saying I just hate Trump so much\nNow Alex called yes and he was going to tell us why he'll never vote and then right again yeah I wanted to sell wind up with you maybe you want to keep voting Democrat or a while you'll never vote Democrat again because of this I'm just curious and so what happened I ah I must tied down to number on with my uh\n... fingers so Alex calls back I'm Sorry what did he did he would did he tell you why you know we're going I Wonder I I always wonder if this mighty sense if they're just lying\nNow he called before and he had mentioned that he was like he called after the Florida shooting thing and he was talking about that you remember all this stuff I don't he did oh I remember I was about to give you credit about something yeah I remember that it got away for a no free\nLunch ... eight zero can FCAT zero five six seven eight ... will put your right to the front if you have the guts to do it I don't know how anybody could actually sit there and feeling the bubble for a de knowing how insane how insane they are I'm just you know one

MSNBC one of these cable networks whatever yesterday asked about the fact that protesters were following Republicans to their homes to restaurants is this okay she never condemns you listen to this\nWouldn't want to ask you about is you know it is one thing to protest at the Supreme Court to do it at the Capitol that's done for for ... and frankly since it out of the country\nIt's another thing to run senators out of restaurants go to their home is that going too far\nI think that it will said there are a lot of people who are very very much ah I'm motivated it's not I was doing on because what might happen or just have an I ... is not a fair process or what the Republicans are far less than ... back and forth to\nQuestion was is it too far for people to chase Republicans out of restaurants chased him down at their homes is it too far he says well I think a lot of people are just passion that's that's not the question\nWhat the heck\n\nWe don't need any more she just ramble on and on and on and so that's that's where the Democrats are they're okay with this stuff\nCrazy isn't it\nAnd I have so many fun awesome soundbites\nYou know the protesters were being paid right released the organizers some protesters paid people organizing them\nThose people were their professional organizers\nRight they're Obama before he's president I Want you to hear reporter though MSNBC number nine gotta do number nine more time Michael\nVick Kara he's on with Chris Matthews on MSNBC and he tries to put this is a reporter and he's right there in in the spring court and he's trying to make it seem like these are actual real protesters that were just they just popped up just people angry just popped up but then he contradicts himself just listening here we go\nIt's a it's an extraordinary situation Chris you and I've been covering a capital for a long time and I have never seen a situation like I saw earlier today when it was almost an impromptu march they've sort of planned it up before hey I was privy to a little bit of that watching a plan on here on the east side of the capital\nIt was almost impromptu except for the fact they planned it because I saw it but I don't know I'm calling it almost impromptu like I Want you to think that people were getting paid but I Do is I mean they were almost like not organized and told what to do noisy\nAlmost it was almost a\nLocale meal except for the fact that it was fried cheese on it\nBut it's almost\nWhat the end yes people were getting paid one more Shawna Thomas vice news number twenty vice news that's where she is with and I think this is on MSNBC ... one of the there's so many shows so many so much we have today does even matter she's on one of the news networks or cable news networks has not box here we go listen\nAnd we also some people who are organized and that moment with Jeff Flake on the hell we talked to one woman who works for ultraviolet who was paid\nShe helps people in the right ways to be able to to confront senator were paid there were people who are paying yeah organizations like ultraviolet to to try to harness that energy in a way that would make the viral moments that we ended up saying yes\nAnd then one more just to top it off because it was so much of this stuff because they got mad immediate like how can Trump said that these protesters are paid pay by Soros and everything else so you just heard all the evidence the guy that MSNBC guy tried to make it seem like it was normal grassroots stuff\nAnd then he admitted it wasn't and then you have this woman from vice news which leans let those on HBO\nAnd\nShe'd been you know they're getting paid yet make his face and Joe number Eighteen they try to actually say that since Trump said there were actually paid protesters which we've just heard again they're actually ... it was when you say there's paid protesters he means you hate Jews you figure it out when I listen to this year we go\nOn Friday President Trump falsely claimed protesters or you will not right noted by their concern from my pay tax from billionaire and George Soros said quote one was that's a very old\nTired anti Semitic [laughter]\nArea very old anti Semitic or that people have said quote usually on the Internet make\nYes that's that's how it is Trump sits back and says how can I really hate my own daughter and son in law\nThat's why you got to vote for the ours you got to vote for Liam Marquez Peterson who is the never Trump or herself but she will not vote for the chaos at least I don't think she will\nSame thing here since ... we will continue she will get right in line if she wins right in line trying to stop Trump you gotta just hold the nose and vote for Martha well you've got to do are circling the ball it's only going to do\nIt in um apparently besides besides these threats the threats that Susan Collins has receipt remember\nThe wackos said that Brett Kavanaugh was a rapist and get no actual evidence of this but Brett Kavanaugh was racist which is why he's a horrible person shouldn't be on the court things like that Susan Collins who again by the way no hero by the way she she could have just said I vote for him she wanted a grandstanding get attention and all this up great what whatever\nJust yes or no that's you know it was good don't get me wrong she kinda stuck it to the Democrats but just yes or no but anyway she did not deserve these kinds of threats\nBreitbart News talk to the main Republican chairwoman Debbie who's known as ... as she said that senator ... had been physically threatened sent vulgar messages bizarre things sent them in the mail said the vulgarity is unbelievable things like I Hope you're right\nYeah\nI Hope you're right now getting their against the rapist but now they're cool with a rapist as long as the rape is rape to them\nYou want to be on that team I Hope that you're stuck with an unborn baby from a rapist that was another message\nSo ... yeah who says these things these out of control left there said even the Democrats can't control and you know Chuck Schumer di fire like man [laughter] we we got we can't get these people to back off and they're going to make more people not want to vote for us\n...\nActivists sent Susan Collins three thousand coat hangers accusing her of sentencing women back to back alley abortions because she voted for cabinet\nRight I mean it's just insane\nThis is what the other side is and you know we have a local version of that you do realize that right\n[noise] that would be Pima County supervisor Dick ...\nWe only have twenty seven minutes left in the show it takes too much too long too long to many syllables to go and Richard so he's Dick and then you have sharing the driver bronze another supervisor and then you have Ramon valid as they are the same kind of crazy I'm just letting you know but you already did know that you're ready to do that\nSo I just don't get how anybody could actually support
