that's what I said I said listen I nothing would shock me this is a set up it also could be just a deranged not job and it turned out to be a deranged not job and and there are people that are still not convinced by the way I'm just\nThere's something that's just not writes a third thing I think you need to know is that listen this caravan\nUm\nThis caravan is still about four thousand people or so and apparently there's a report out that\nThe people walking now through Mexico were offered housing in jobs in Mexico and they said no we want America we want America that's that's what they want

burials there'll be a there'll be people sitting ... which means you comfort you come for these people that have lost their loved ones um you comfort them with\nWith prayers with love with food that's what that's what I was used do\n\nAnd\nThis guy was just a flat out not see he said Trump is a global is not a nationalist any is controlled by the Jews\nAre just so you know because these are details that are not actually being talked about on the news on that if you watch the media about this besides the horror that actually took place\n\nAll they're talking about is somehow Trump inspired this guy to do this\nAnd it's sickening\nIt's disgusting it's gross there's no reason this should actually happened but the media is so blind with their hatred of Trump they're going to literally capitalize on these people that were murdered\n\nTwenty minutes twenty minutes is what this guy took twenty minutes he's walking in different rooms and just shooting people and and the original reports you had an assault rifle in assault going assault weapon assault weapon that's what assault weapon\nEvery weapon is an assault weapon and one one of the best things that listener ever told me is that as a teacher he said I told my students what does the salt loving me and I can pick up the stool and hit you with that it's an assault still\n\nGetting their Fifteen some hand guns\nAnd he\nJust went in there and there were different events happening one was a brisk which is when a child is eight days old and I'm\n\nA day it's it's a naming ceremony basically it is and it's what a braces and ah there's other things that happened that we won't get into um Ryan witness mice my late at night and my youngest son's\nWrists you were there you know it's very honored and thinking that the only thing I'm Glad you were there your good friend so we you know we personally have gone through this stuff\nAnd\nThis guy just basically said that he he hated Jews he hated Jews he hated refugees he hated migrants ... everybody and he also again hated Trump\n\nHe hated Trump he called the Jews the children of Satan\n\nOn some crazy social media sites\n\nHe said highest likes to bring invaders in that kill our people I Can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered screener optics ongoing in highest is the Hebrew immigrant aid society and that that temple helps people that are refugees\n\nHe said also there is no ... as long as there is an event to horrible word for Jews Jew infestation\n\nHe told that law enforcement they're committing genocide to my people I just wanted to kill the Jews\n\nThat's what this guy said there's nothing else this guy was jacked up in the head is Jack up in the head of the guy that shot up the baseball field with the Republicans playing on his jacked up in the head\nAs the guy that sent the the fake bombs uh the the the the look alike bombs\n\nTo Democrats these people are mental mental and what do we see on the news\nTrump inspired this guy to do its Trump's showing this Trump somehow responsible Trump's anti Semitic\n\nI've never seen such insanity in my life just when I thought I couldn't get any worse than the cabinet hearings and it was really bad\nAnd by the way who called for all those people to get crazy get up in people's faces\nI mean it's it's the Democrat he'd say it's a ... I don't hate it it is what it is the Democrats it's almost as if this was\nOnce again\nA team effort between the media and the Democrats because\nWhat\nI saw in highlights of the news and watching it and watching interviews and everything else throughout the weekend\nI didn't see anything about why didn't I didn't see any anger any reporter and he counted they were talking about this guy hating Trump\nIt's like they didn't want people to notice\nThey just said he was the Nazis full of hate and he's being and saying Trump's got some responsibility um all this stuff right that's what he does responsibility trumps the one who is ready to dog whistles that's what we have soundbite does this dog whistles that are doing this and it's as if\nTrying to team up and Democrats are saying the same thing the Democrats in the media are literally mimicking each other and one of the one of the talking points it was brought up was George\nRose George Soros is not a good guy\n\nGeorge Soros is also Jewish and the Democrats in the media all of a sudden\nBrought up this thing that well the Republicans don't like George Soros and Trump doesn't like him because he's Jewish\nIt's his face\nAnd I'm like are they really going there it's not the fact that he actually bets against America like the best in an organization that cause chaos\nSocialism\nThe man doesn't like America it has nothing to do with his his religion but all of a sudden you're creating this talking point well Trump hate Soros Seabrook saw a lot\nAnd he rips Tom Steyer this billionaire that was talking out and Tom stiers dad was Jewish\nThe hell knows that\nSo all of a sudden it's there's just this big talking point this big kind of conspiracy theory\nThat\nTrump hate Soros not because of what sources doing to America and trying to cause chaos throughout the world in Europe as well\nIt's because he's Jewish and we don't want to let you know that this not see that shot this shot up this synagogue is mass murderer\nWe don't want to you know that he age Trump because that would go against well everything you would say well wait a second how does that make sense of what's going on here and\nSo instead they just focus on this and it was like a team effort between the Democrats in the media to make that happen you tell me if you were watching where one time any of these people brings up the fact that this guy\nHated Trump never they didn't do it not that I saw I didn't and I watched a lot they didn't do it\nBut remember you know what the media did bring up that that guy that sent those uh those bombs I wouldn't

everybody hates Trump rights\n... not so much about the bookies the bookies are now given odds that the Republicans keep the house\nThey don't lose money they're not in the business to lose money and

on but I Want you to know it don't get to the media stuff\nA big story and they held the headline Trump can refuse to accept asylum applications\n\nWhy when here's Nielsen's like you can't stay here which you should say you can't\nI'm here we don't have to have just 'cause they say we want asylum doesn't mean that we have to accept it I'll get into that that's a big deal isn't it yeah you are a little bit\nAt least one other stuff to talk about we play in the last hour Trump right away condemning it not once but twice by the way he was in uh where where is the first one um I forget where the Kentucky somewhere then I went to Murfreesboro Illinois Saturday and he once again condemned the attack on the synagogue\nHe said and evil anti Semitic attack is an assault on all of us and that's just some of it that's just some of what he said he said he said a lot of things and\nUh it's it's just gross hearing what the media said we're going to get into that right now I've been teasing it throughout the morning there isn't who reads GQ you every GQ I've never I've seen it who reads your e and by the way do you get GQ for the articles\nIsn't GQ for like guys fashion or something like that apparently they have a political writer named who is Jewish Juliet you off\nLet's start with her one twenty four\nShe was on CNN sheets weeded out all kinds of crazy stuff she actually blame Trump I mean you can't make up this stuff she blamed Trump for the shooting you won't want to know why she said this guy decided to shoot up is anti Semitic idiot decided to shoot up the temple\nBecause Trump move the embassy in Israel to Israel's capital\nI'm not making that up\nThat's what she said she tweeted that and then she doubled down and triple down and people were ripping her and she said no no no no no this is true this is true\n\nYeah you can't make up this stuff so she was on CNN\nAnd despite all the examples I just gave you what was in a half an hour ago everything Trump has done for the Jews in America and in Israel\nUm I Want you to hear what she had to say about Trump apparently not being on the side of the Jewish community here we go\nI think that ... and heightened a lot of people who said the dog with all the adults all\nThey failed at that price approve fat fat as much if you look at All right commentary after ... Charlotte ... has inability to impel rarely for ... for like David Gale foreign ground with a KKK [noise]\nThey understand that and they understand the full on their side he's on the side of of\nFrankly at the Jewish community again everything I said that he has done\nIs done more for Israel than I can I can recall any other president in my lifetime\nSick sick\nSo uh she said that when Wolf Blitzer and I left it in here you've got to hear this she Dodgers of Trump's a to a dog whistle everything I've played by the way of condemning the attacks in the strongest way possible\n\nNot good enough so we'll brings up the fact that the guy and this is very rare that he actually brought this up that this this anti Semitic idiot hated Trump and listen or dodge it one twenty five listen to this area\nIs a shooter this killer a he posted a lot of anti Semitic posts on social media but he also went after\nDonald Trump or you said at one point a trucker surrounded\nBy then to use the derogatory word for juice the search for the tape or things that will say the chorus truck is a global is not a national is there is no ... make America make America great again as long as there is a derogatory or cable refrigerators infestation so luckily it was a great fan of done\nLately I think this rhetoric is out there in the air out their attacks on jars her as how that's how loud level at that wow how badly vows and they ... they are anti next ... at the president is half ... and hadn't traffic and [noise]\nFor at least that there has to start in right and that's not a coincidence that this will pick up on that and I think now if you're talking about that actually do something about that they get so around that that they don't like it has it's not enough\n[noise] doesn't matter\nThis was her tweet by the way on October twenty seven and a word to my fellow of American Jews this president makes this possible here where you live I Hope the embassy move over there where you don't live was worth ...\n\nYou can't get any more dumb that she was featured all weekend long the cable news\nYou heard the George Soros we're gonna play more of this this hour\nThere's this there's this ... it seems like collusion\nBetween the media and the Democratic party because nobody to media that was the first the only time you hear anybody Wolf Blitzer let it out and this chick couldn't address it which is why they're not talking about it\nI haven't heard anybody talk about have you the fact that this guy hated Trump because how could this guy he hated Trump how can anybody make the claim it it it defies logic how can you make the claim\nThat Trump actually inspired him to shoot up the temple\nIf he hated Trump how did Trump inspire him to shoot up the temple again Trump booted out the Nazi in Queens you move the the embassy which is what all Jews won most she was actually the ... most wanted\nA cutting off aid to the Palestinians are got rid of the Iranian deal and there's so many things that he's done and yet this is this demented with this chick said and wrote and everything and she couldn't address it because again it doesn't make any sense ... she brought up this thing about George Soros\nOh George Soros is Jewish George source is a bad man\nThe media is trying to make it\nThe moral equivalent now that if you say anything about bad about George Soros you're saying bad things about Jews which is the dumbest thing I've ever heard my entire life George Soros is a bad man he he is trying to he pays for chaos he pays for turmoil you profits off of it he wanted to happen\n\nSo if you rip George Soros it doesn't mean it's a dog whistle that you want anti Semitism to happen ripping George sources about George Soros not as religion yeah this is what the media is trying to push a matter of fact\nI have more of that let's get into it let's let's play real quick real quick real quick um one thirty seven Adam Schiff with Jake Tapper on CNN crazy Adam Schiff\nListen to what Adam Schiff whip to soundbites because one day to go to break right after and then we'll we'll continue with one thirty seven uh tapper brings up George Soros here we go listen to this\nUh George Soros a is a billionaire financier or his Jewish she's the founder of a lot of\nProgressive causes I'm somebody who's in the political arena certainly um you know open themselves up the criticism do you think all the criticism coming from the right about George Soros all of it is anti Semitic some of it ...\nUh well I don't know what I can say all of it or some may have a have an issue with George Soros is an open society organization or foundation but I think much of it most of it\nWhat what\nAre you kidding me right now there's one more that'll just knock off your socks and we're going to get that you only get back on the other side and about five um we got to get to that one and and you want to hear it cause you you were going to play under soundbites also this hour of the media saying Trump is inspiring this\nI have a soundbite that was on MSNBC where they called for somebody putting a bullet and Donald Trump\n\nIs not a dog whistle actually it's it's those words will get to all this don't go anywhere can as the Ames seven Ninety two sons most stimulating talk so\nUh people don't do fact checking so many things that they say it's gonna be taken at face value or verbatim or absolute truth nobody has any kind of or\nIt's a losing we just have to keep doing our ground or you appreciate you everything that you do for a little bit so we can all here ridiculous most of it and if you\nI applaud you for bringing us for the light and showing it because I Can't hear you everything myself\nNo you have a job I have a life this is my job\n[laughter] so fake but that's the reason they don't they don't want to have a discussion boy any kind of a ... I Know that some of these people they know that they're being over ... what's going on for whatever they um\nThat's how sick they are and then they got an X. level why going you know by going nuts with the Kavanaugh situation I mean again they've called Trump an anti Semite forever and its own his own family is Jewish or he's at least in one of his biggest advisors is Jared Kushner his son in law who is Jewish\nAnd this is they debated literally makes is zero sense but they don't want people you know that that's where I played Trump talking about or his condemnation of the shootings and then I played by no soundbite Trump didn't condemn the shooting what are you nuts\nHe's a great work keep exposing it because I Can't hear everything and the more you expose the more people see and see the real truth\n... thank you didn't take care man a really quick\nWe have the uh the style of the time so I play one forty one real quick Tom's dire billionaire left you know juggle have trouble he does is make commercials about wanting to impeach Trump I mean it's it's like a sickness Trump's living in his head rent free or Tom style goes on CNN and actually said this or we go\nI think his response to the tragedy is was appropriate\nBut something much bigger than that going on here which is the atmosphere that she's created he's a Republican Party has created terms of political violence oh look across the political fame what you see is routine systematic lawlessness an attempt to break\nSmall D democratic norms\nIn pursuit of victory at all costs\n... events where the Democrats are so you heard that right you heard that you're that he's creating a political violence let me bring to you from MSNBC and twenty Fifteen Rick Wilson Rick Wilson might be as Tucker Carlson said the dumbest man on TV ... dumber than Don Lemon one thirty nine\nBack in twenty Fifteen what was the primary in Trump is battling Republicans Rick Wilson was asked to comment on Donald Trump and the odds of winning and the establishment is on MSNBC and they still haven't back the Senate this year we go\nBut here's the thing Trump is silly very powerful force right now ... and he's still holding a lot of uh of of the the part of the base that is very activated by his message the native is the message that that that that's got a a fresh from the base very energized\nAnd the donor class can't just sit back on the sidelines and say oh well don't worry this all work itself out\nThere are so gonna have to go out and put a bullet and Donald Trump and that's a fact\nMSNBC yep yep yep yep\nWe have more violence coming from the rides a Trump gives anti Semite license to commit atrocities\nAll this stuff did you hear by the way Marsha Blackburn Congress woman running for Senate in Tennessee tried
