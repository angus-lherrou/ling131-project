I have done everything conceivably ...\nYes or no they they have to be you that's why you're fighting for this I mean if they weren't if they weren't stopping in interfering you wouldn't be all over the place saying I Need this money to get people safe so they are literally stopping or your your guys\nFrom doing their job which is to keep bad guys out stop drug traffickers you name it right that is correct so then they're they're interfering so you know what you would have such leverage ... says you would have hand\nAnd and you can sit back and say you know you're going to ... and ... are you guys going to really challenge me are you guys are really going to say that you have no problem stopping need from protecting the good people the citizens of Pima County because you are the resistance and you have Trump I mean you would when there's no chance that you would lose your\nA hundred percent correct they'll do it um it ... this stage in his autonomy thing the one thing that they've said needed Lee yeah that ice imbedded in the jail was these stopping block\nSheriff this these stopping blocked they said that before you did is correct okay now we've done that and so we're moving any other objections sooner or later the only thing left Garrett\nWell but now there you go at it so now that you did that right you did that why don't they say to you okay fine I have your grandma\nBecause that's the the one that's in the ... and the one that I've submitted the federal government is the two thousand Nineteen grant request I'm confident the federal government's going to award us that money the board of supervisors has the chance to do the right thing I have consistently done the right thing that you've\nDone it over and over you've given either find will get ice out of my jail which makes me upset\nMy wife upset which of course makes me more upset because I got to deal with that and then you have the situation of these guys all they do is move the goalposts like how can you trust what they say when they go back on their word\nOver and over there creating an amazing paper trail aren't they\nBut they don't thing ever happened to this is like with Hillary and the rest and we get done already because nothing ever happens\nWell to the thing that will happen is we're going to request um two thousand Nineteen grant money the other thing that we're going to do\nAnd the next several weeks is start doing what we're going to call the Pima County ... safety initiative where we're gonna have to fund this as taxpayers and Pima County which is unfortunate the federal government is begging me to take money to do these task\nI still have an affirmative responsibility to do them that has not changed so we're going to have to do a lot of what we were doing was stoned garden with local tax dollars and I'll find that money and my budget I'm good at doing that\nSo we'll start to point our resources as we have under stone garden but we're gonna have to pay for that as taxpayers\nSooner or later even the Democrats are going to get tired of this do you regret given the five million dollars back that you said you cut in the budget because now you're going to find more money to help pay for over ... I don't regret that because I came back about eighty eight percent of that came back to my people and compensation and I needed the money\nAnd I use that money as leverage to try to get some pay for my corrections officers one deputies and and people so no I don't regret doing that part at all because\nWe're really having a trouble recruiting and retaining\nHere's the thing share of is that is that all\nA lot of Pima County residents my listeners anybody else they see you giving in to these people and they haven't given an inch and we have done we as citizens we liked the fact that I was there so there's an illegal alien they hand them right off we felt better because of that\nAnd and we have done nothing wrong the only people that have done something wrong or the three supervisors had voted to say we hate Trump so much we don't give a damn about the safety of the residents of Pima County yet what you did is instead of going after them you've made us less safe\nNo we haven't um if I thought that was the case we would have never done that let's talk about the the actual space they had in the jail okay is under use cubicle originally conceptually what we thought would happen is that they would inhabit that about sixteen hours a day seven days a week ...\nTheir connectivity problems in the jail that made it hard for them to work there I could not use county resources to help them with their connectivity issue because but I Would have to go to the board for that\nSo they would say no we can I get why yeah that that are you know if that that is exactly correct so they could move to a different part of the of the jail no there's going to Seventy there were just as well when you get into the ... the jail in you're in the bowels of the jail and I had one on her use lies place so they were infrequently\nThere at best and um I came to him and said look we we before we had you embedded there and but by the way I think I'm the only share up in the state that had ice in bed and we like that I listen I only give a crap about Pima County is where I live right I wanted this there this was an unusual step and what we found\nOut was that was under utilized they were not there very frequently anyway\nWe've looked at how many people actually had ice dictators in the jail so in other words what were we really tried to accomplish here and I got the numbers here I very seldom make notes but I did to do is three point two percent of the population of the jail have ice dictators\nThe vast majority of those people are there on serious felonies charges they're not going anywhere anytime soon they're either going to be in cars to read it in my jail for a long time or they're going to the department of corrections\nSo this hand off while convenient and I liked to have an ice there it was convenient and we have a great relationship with ice nothing about the way we exchange information with ice our collaboration with ice the\nWay that we hand off ice detainees knew either nothing about that has changed just the physical location because it was an impediment to these millions of dollars I Want to remove all the excuses other than politics because once you do that once you've removed yeah what are you going to happen to that point 'cause you keep\nAnd I got one more forty two real quick forty two and they want to get your reaction to the sheriff of ... listen to this year ago\nWhen Ramon ... first meeting you know they they came in and and with it now and when he came back without it yeah it it they were saying they're going to work and if you recall\nAnd that's what they do it's intended Asian and where am I going to come to it in in September it was pretty clear why would he bring it back after seven months of approval on because they're scared you know they're scaring it and that they're going to do a recall on him and this is how it works in Qena county\nAnd how he said that this happened right out in the open you were there they were there you heard them threaten him if you go with you approve this we're going to recall you so what makes you think you could ever play ball with these people\nWell first of all I think the threat of recalls absolutely bogus a remote can stand both on principle and on law well apparently he he doesn't think it's bogus because he changes go back to uh know and is is scared I think he needs to rethink that I Do I don't sense I'm Out in the community a lot a lot further than his district I talked to a lot of different people\nThere is not this groundswell of support\nAgainst stone garden there isn't the even the Democrats rationally understand that there are transnational crime threats coming up from our border\nThat the federal government has been unable to address don't garden money simply channels money to county sheriff's border shrubs to allow us to interject into that environment additional resources that the county tax payer doesn't have to pay for that is all this is about ... except for the far left leaning zealots type Democrats\nThe mainstream Democrats they get this Ramon has no danger of being recalled and I mean that with all my heart Ramon if you're listening I don't know if you are not you're not going to get recalled you're not going to get recalled for doing the right thing there'll be people who make a lot of noise about this and you'll be uncomfortable\nBut the end result is you are doing the right thing for the people whose county into the broader sense everybody knows that\nSupervisor Bronson this money goes directly to help benefit public safety of her constituents more than anybody else because of the way her district has done is I've been out in her district\nDon't see people coming from me going share we sure don't want you to get that stone guard money just the opposite they want our debt but he's out there but\nThey know here's the thing is that they don't care bike sharing and and Ramona supervisors\nAll they care about is hating Trump and if anything that they think could do something to benefit Trump there again they don't even listen to their own constituents\nThat aspect this has nothing to do with President Trump even a union they did with Obama when they approved it on the consent agenda this was not an Obama appropriate program when they\nWe've been on the consent agenda for a decade I Know I Know that's why I'm saying is that and you gave in\nAnd I see why you did you think it'll hopefully you know mentioned fences and say hey look I gave in now you give and this is what you want it I did it now no sign over the papers to give me the but they're they're never going to do we have more ... you'd hang with me if you don't mind um and if you did you want to take off people or they wouldn't let it is that All right no I don't I don't generally want to\nTake a lot of calls but if you have questions for the sheriff\nEight eight zero can FCAT zero five six seven eight or don't ruin it for

I mean the security the border is the federal government's responsibility we as they've advocated for decades under multiple administration that's why we have the problems that we have\nUm so we need to do something um to prevent this yeah and um security on the board I get I'm a grown tired because I've been in this valley for thirty one years and um for thirty one years we've talked about securing the border\nIf we took a little car ride there are places were still the borders absolute wide open range just nothing there um and that's the see the underpinning of stone guard ... going back to that but I Know what the federal government realized was that they had failed and their responsibilities secure the border\nAnd this was causing collateral public safety a detriment to counties especially to your one counties border counties or thirty one of the ...\nSo they're going to give federal funding to those border counties justice system and maintaining public safety and their counties and that includes overtime for more personnel deployment and then the money for equipment good thing right ... excellent and we have accepted that ground for twelve years until now\nAnd that's why I'm pushing so hard on this not only is it is about the millions right now you're at but it's millions calming\nThe continued escalation of these funds over the period of the next few years it's traditionally been about eighty five million this year it's a hundred and ten million and it's going to continue and increase in the voters I don't care if you're a Democrat or Republican independent\nEveryone at Pima County should say you know what we want local law enforcement to have that money to keep us safer it just makes sense let me ask\nYou this man because you have this invasion happening and that's what this this is an invasion we don't know who these people are they're lying about asylum ended up there with their kids are they're not kid we we just don't know\nSo we shut down the border back in Nineteen eighty five\nWhen we had a da ... and it took Mexico ... about a few days to basically hand over the killer that that's that you know when we mean business everybody finally understand ... ... it's like why why don't we just mean business I Wish I Wish um that\nThat Trump would shut down the border because then ... crap we're gonna lose and a lot of money where you just it just needs to happen so anyway here's an Nielsen the homeland security has the power to ... ties local and state law enforcement\nIf you know we're we're ground zero whether it's Texas or it's they're coming right here at Arizona if ... Nielsen ... says a sheriff Napier I have to ... your your deputies we need their help to secure the border would you be okay with that\nWell the point is I don't have enough people I mean I have enough people to police Pima County I mean it's nine thousand two hundred square miles I have about roughly five hundred badge and gun type people\nUm so I don't have the resources to do that um that's the problem and that's what ... allows me to do is to deploy those resources with federal funding so I Need a supplemental funding to do anything substantive to the border\nMilitias emergency all of a sudden they're bum rushing election day in Fifteen days they get here we need your help to stop these people we need to arrest them and do whatever we need your up can you send a guy you guys down for a few days are you good within\nOh we would we do that all the time um we we always cooperate with our federal partners so this is not in ... and this was under prior administrators as well uh depicted as an adult I did it\nSo we always cooperate with our federal partners so I mean we have a strategic lines 'cause we have to there about four thousand border patrol agents in the ... or the Tucson sector we have a great relationship I have a fantastic relationship with chief parish ah you're not a beat regularly\nSo this is nothing really really new here I'm this massive influx coming up is something new and I think the federal government needs to take responsibility for that but\nClosing the borders is very complex I mean there are places outside of ... in our own county where the worst nothing it's very rural we need a wall there we need to to combine physical\nThat's one I mean he said let's let's look at people like people are fearful of the word physical barrier you want to say\nYou know is in wall is not a wall is just a bollards fence is it away because we know we need a wall plus we need drones plus we need sensors we need all the people want to hear wall because a wall cannot be taken away well what\nWe need is an impenetrable barrier and and there are places where that's going to be a wall but when we don't want to do in in border security is get caught up in the ... what is a wall\nThat that's a big deal to me it's counterproductive if that's the same as all like a chain link fence or a certain fence could be an impenetrable barrier technology could be an impenetrable barrier personnel could be in a dinner table barrier ... I don't but Garrett I'm less interested in how we do it then that we have got to do it\nBut here's the difference right we have Trump in there now see we get paid for the next one maybe the country and all these ships goes back and at the stroke of a pen\nYou get out of an Obama type person just decimate border patrol ice you name it and if there's no while they're not they're not going to sit back and go we're going to send wrecking ball to the border and destroy the wall once the wall is there it's not going away it's permanent it so that that ... that that's why people say we need the wall more than anything else\nThere are places because of topography and other factors we get it that if we're going to be really hard you know up in the mountains I get it but where it needs to be I mean it's it's something that's never going to be removed\nNobody's I don't think anybody's arguing against physical barriers walls whatever you want to call them where they make sense and there are places were positively they make sense in there there's a lot of good that they do ... we still got to shore up the ports of entry their major vulnerability a lot of people are coming through the ports of entry\nAnd just over stain but the other thing we got to look at is the larger scope of the drug epidemic I mean we're facing a National Public health crisis in the opiate addiction\nWe need to stop the flow of drugs into this country methamphetamine is on a trajectory that's very similar to opiates\nAnd this is I argue with my pure sheriff's all the time I talked to share back east and they said well sure if you don't understand you're always wanting that border money but we needed up here and I said well if you stop if I can stop it in my backyard people don't die on your front yard so\nUh by rejecting operations stoned garden funding supervisor Dick ally is sharing bronze Ramon Valdez making it much easier for math and opioids to get across the border\nThere absolutely and I know they don't like it when I say this but they're absolutely making Pima County last safety only argument that they could make against that is the one that I find to be offensive is that somehow the mission of public safety the plight of the undocumented is better served if the people in the county sheriff's department are not out\nThere they'd rather have beat people will be able to walk across the border they think it's something the poor people looking for a better life and let's just let that happen and you know drugs go through so be it\nThat's where their look if we enter decked and it sounds and consequential twelve ... no pills which of those twelve resulted in their overdose which of those ... was the tipping point to a lifelong addiction these are collateral costs that the people of the county\nSo then there is so there you go so can you then say that they have stopped you from being able to do your job I reject stoned garden money and if they're interfering through doing your job why can't you call some lawyer get them on your back and sue them over that\nBecause they don't back down they're not going to say fine will use taxpayer money for that there'll be outrage using taxpayer money to fight you for trying to secure the border well it will be a fight will be long and protracted all alone and then they'll throw them to call Monica ... come on or to the deal what I Want to\nDo is they have a legislative solution to this or a or a solution which they\nUnderstand that this money is fundamentally important to public safety in our county we're going to produce a in a few months here uh two thousand Nineteen grab request Sharon Bronson this is your district these are your people that were trying to keep safe from this isn't about politics is about keeping your people\nSay no but I'm telling you they're not gonna care man and and you know here's the thing you are you prepared to deal with the backlash when they reject the twenty nine teams don't garden funding again then\nWe go to another of the plant and with and that plan is suing them I I'm not going to schools that every chest move that I have in my head but I think that it becomes apparent the even the most ardent Democrat\nThat there is a person that is elected in this county to maintain public safety there is the chief law enforcement officer in this county that is me and if you don't like what I'm doing there's a solution and twenty twenty on elect me\nBut I'm doing my very best based on Thirty years of experience a master's degree living in this valley for more than Thirty Years' monitor standards of these things to keep us safe\nTrust the fact that I'm probably tied into this a little bit better than somebody on the board of supervisors is ... really quick really\nYeah and then one of the things that popped up on my radar screen I wanted to clear the air on 'cause uh I did a Facebook messages on this they're apparently something out there's a the cinema campus floating in saying that\nEither border sheriffs or or maybe even I have endorsed her that is not true I've never met her and and to her detriment as far as I'm concerned she's never reached out to border sheriff's\nNow really no she's never reach out to me I'm the largest border share up in the United states\nAnd she's never reached out to me to say sure you could I'd like to know more about border issues could we sit down and talk I Would have made time for very revealing um whereas a congressman Mick Sally gave me a big hug and prevent on friday and said she was happy to see me\nAh had dinner with her in Washington DC about three months ago uh she ... regularly meets with border sheriffs to try to better understand the environment down here so no ah we have not endorsed a cinema I don't know where that rumor came from but we need to put a stop to that they simply not\nTrue maybe it isn't as a big controversy the Arizona State troopers association came out and said we indoor cinema and we start getting messages that the troopers themselves like past because\nWe didn't vote on this yeah go on to a director ... in Phoenix on friday about that and he doesn't know where that came from either it's it's kind of out in left field sauce that's a big deal it's a big deal um it's a big ...\nAnd they ... him right sorry man that's what I Am not as though you're not appropriate amount all you know you're going to have me on more just for the entertainment value I Know that the valley of hanging out there but\nUm you know it's it's a problem and that's a very close race and it really shouldn't be I mean we're you know you look at the landscape down here I mean they've abandoned Leah Marquez Peterson yes I was that means anchor Patrick's gonna when we know we're not going to unseat ... CD three ... we're probably gonna lose CD one two oh Halloran\nAnd then we're right on the cost of turning cinema and mix Sally then you have ... coming up in a couple of years and he's essentially just a place holder and um we really need to think about Republicans about not eating our own so much\nTraining Trump Lincoln's is what they need they won't eat their own when they do a good job\nWhere we still in the you know if you do your candidate even though it's not a perfect candidate man I mean you talked to said they did is speak for the power of the people not be the chamber of commerce and it's a big difference when the candidates back Trump being ideas which is our ideas\nThey when when they don't I mean people are very distrustful of a mix Sally even though you need to vote for her every distrust of all because of everything she's done it or pass and all of a sudden she's going to one eighty\nAnd won't talk about it so yeah but you know the Dems don't do the same thing and that's that's why they're affordable for us because they don't go after their own uh in the primaries and then what happens in the primaries Republican gets\nKilled in the primary you know so you come out of the primary your battled and then you have a little you know from that that's the establishment because they've just shut people down her throat twenty four seven and we've had enough and they keep doing it so I mean I Can't blame him for that and you know the Democrats went through with Hillary and Bernie and with our social if they're trying to throw socialist the Democratic party saying\nWhat the hell what are we going to be either a weird laws either way I ... you're not and you know the best way to unseat\nWere although you move the liquor bottle a bit further away anyway or does it wait you couldn't go there so a really quick you also have meetings\nGoing on yeah we've got a couple of things coming up that are important one is that on November seventh um\nApparently attorney general sessions went to a department of justice the cops office in the apartment homeland security and said I Need to you guys to go to the border ask border sheriff's what they need and make sure that they get it\nUh the executive director of national sheriffs association called once you're up in the United states and I was honored that that was me ah because you understand so I've been plugged into these border issues for quite some time now so we'll be hosted a meeting here in Tucson on November seventh the border serves\nA federal authorities and this is another place we make the case for look I'm having problems with stone guard money that I should not be having\nThe should not be a political issue how can Washington DC help border share of because it doesn't do any good if you're going to send money my way that I Can't take right and so we need to find a solution that I'm the chief of the border patrol national chief a border patrol Carlo provost will be ... next month I'll be out there with her again to make the case where how do we fix this\nUm because sheriffs have an affirmative responsibility for public safety in their respective counties the Susan politics politics and public safety should never intercept each other\nSo speaking of that really quick jerk then we got to go you looking for a state fix or federal fix where all of a sudden maybe you can get the grants and not have to deal with the board of ... so\nI take either one because we need to remove politics from this equation\nI'm interested with public safety in this county I if I come forward and said this grant is fundamental to public safety in our county I should be able to undermine authority as elected official constitutional statutory authority the accepted grad and if the people of the county think I'm doing wrong there is a solution to that they voted out the vote\nYeah that's the thing we we didn't elect ... to be the sheriff we elected you have more if you don't work for them right for us I work\nFor all of you and I personally prepared my entire life for this job man I started as a cop and Ninety Nineteen eighty one I've done the things I Need to do to prepare you to be your share of\nAnd I'll tell you of all the honors in my life and I get choked up when I even think about this is the honor of being this year for this county I started as a poor little skinny kid in Iowa with not two dimes to rub together as a young police officer and I I didn't have anything I could not imagine life's journey and I I Do take that for granted any day I wake up\nI'm honored to serve this county's your share of ... we may not always agree I get that I understand that sometimes I'll do things you go what in the hills that do thinking\nWell just know that in my heart I'm always thinking about uh some always thinking about what I Believe to be right for public safety that small when he'd be on your show over an hour and a half\nThe good what your great that your number one thing is the Democrat into the ground and Barry Barry\nThat know my my I have to do the best show I can possibly do build let me ask you a question what do you do for a living\nI'd rather not say\nOh okay you sure you're going to bail you don't want to go to your job and just talk about how bad Democrats are all day\nI I'm trying to be so I I think that you I'm just trying to we're on the same we're on\nThat I Know we are but they don't give me this thing that I Can't make a comment about Martha make Sally 'cause it's gonna make you feel if Martha my family doesn't get elected that's Martha ... fault not mine simple as that you know I never I never\nSaid that either so we're in agreement on that bill I Love your buddy I listen I get it but don't say we don't need our own and just a sewing rush tears into Republicans you get a call Russian telling you shouldn't do that\nRush\nRarely if you don't yourself you know when when rush

their act together get capital confirmed they're gonna lose was that a bad thing to do\nI mean one of land and well you know\nWhen you're brave enough to see what you do for a living then you can let

President Trump really we took our kid out early we get up there we found a great parking spot right at the end of the line when he ran\nTwo of our kids had either a boat or a sprained ankle on their feet but we still can grab their white in line and tell you we waited probably I don't know three and a half four hours a moving just\nLike snails pace and then we all started moving really quickly and we were excited people around us people wearing flags people wearing crop hats Trump close\nThe camaraderie and they know but he was allowed nobody was really nobody was pushing and shoving we finally got to where we thought we were going to get to go in well of course our before that they'd already felt the hanger which only\nSeen it quite Eighteen hundred people that the rest of the twenty thousand others stand outside\nOh and they had set up a big screen TV but there were men out there there is no way for us\nSo much people tried to hold chip on their phones so\nOverall we hear bits and pieces of it\nThe cool thing was when he came up before he landed when he came in on Murray and went around they took him around so he can see the crowd so he knew exactly the type of crowd that live there but even twenty thousand others couldn't get in\nEverybody was happy to be there when it when\nIt was just great and and when you left a little bit early just because we were tired standing and we\nCouldn't really hear and but\nThey didn't win and had last year when Trump came in September we went up to see him and in Phoenix um and it was great we actually did get to go in and see him and that's how I feel like the crowds are getting bigger and bigger and bigger so I Can't wait to see the rally tonight I Can't wait to see\nThat and I'm joined that's why it just feels like something's going on doesn't it I mean all these all of a sudden you have these stories coming out a Washington Post I mentioned is the beginning of the show you're probably sleeping House Democrats

coming out of that on Saturday and a hundred thousand people aren't tickets to the end today\nOver ... yeah it's it's it's great thing about it [noise] people can't stand the media now more than they
