like that\nYou know when all thirty hours and whatever at the right ah apparently I I saw Chuck Grassley a and he said he's Republican chairman Chuck Grassley you said this is the only time a leader Mitch McConnell said this is the only time in the Senate that uh they don't know if they have the votes while they're going to a vote which is a bit frightening but I'm just letting you know\nThe latest there or Murkowski apparently according to at Henry of Fox News\nThere they think she's into your freaking kidding me\n\nWe'll get into that second thing that I think you need to know more than make Sally announced in an interview that if she were in the Senate she would vote for Brett\nKavanaugh [noise] that's kind of a big deal isn't it [noise] we should actually make the announcement of bit larger thing would help her [noise]\nAnd whatever third thing I think you need to know more phenomenal economic news that will be literally ignored\nA job growth is that it had like job growth swamps in September so yesterday the the eighty piece at a hundred or does he turned thirty thousand jobs\nOr the government says a hundred thirty four thousand\nJobs below the estimate a hundred eighty five thousand but unemployment filled a three point seven lowest unemployment rate since Nineteen sixty nine\nOr why only why so few jobs maybe because everyone's working a\nEarnings rose to point eight percent year over year which is a big deal hourly earnings two point eight percent so we have that plus manufacturing confidence oh my goodness this is where the jobs are manufacturing competence now at an all time high despite a workforce\nShortage I guess this is the time you want to legal immigration huh\nNinety percent of manufacturers projecting further expansion for their business positive sentiment among smaller companies is up to Ninety One point three percent I mean this is huge ... one of the best I looked for the group of seen in Twenty years fourteen thousand members take part in the surveys how 'bout that three things I think\nYou need to know now it's all situation with a with Kevin Oh\nI just don't trust Jeff like like I hate to be the I I don't know I'm just I'm just oh my God what is your got say my God says that it could just like they found that toward the end of the show yesterday and if you miss it I'll just tell you Jeff like made of a weird statement did lose a strange statement or he told the media\nThat I guess you read that FBI report\nAnd he said the FBI report finds it no more proof of an assault and I'm like wait no more ... there was never any proof to begin with\nEach other reporters that he agreed with Susan Collins the pro which thorough and produced no additional corroborating information\nWhy is the word additional in there there never was actual corroborating information and the first place\nRight there was nothing\nAnd I could just see Jeff Flake saying well I'm not going to get reelected anyway\nRight\nNot going to get reelected it's not going to happen I hate Trump's so much he doesn't care about you and me for his buddy John McCain he might wait till the last second and vote no\n\nI'm just saying and maybe that'll leave and the you know what that would leave you one short because and then what what are you going to have you can have Joe Manchin vote yes be the fifth one because if you have flake vote no and again ... at Henry this morning\nSaid that ah people in the White House think Lisa Murkowski the rhino Republican senator from Alaska is you know and I think the mood news travels so quickly\nIt's insane when I was speaking to the great people yesterday at saddle brook ranch\nA packed packed room I don't know a hundred fifty people it was pretty cool right uh everybody there by the way love Trump's blunt has wanted Kavanaugh they all said they'd hold their nose and vote for 'em\n\nThey would hold their nose and vote for mix Sally but I was telling the latest news that I was seeing\nAnd thank you and it was that Murkowski and Collins and Bethany [noise] they were\nHolding out and he seemed like they were negotiating like they're using their leverage to get something for their states and I'm like really you're going to basically denying a fifth can survey you know you're going to play and they play politics what they do but it's so ... isn't it you're going to sit back and try to\nTry to get something for your state's and\nHold the rest of the country hostage and that's exactly what they do I mean is Murkowski she may as well just change parties\nDon't even know what the point of her actually she she's a she's a freaking Democrat what\nThe hell does she do\nShe's got to be convinced every time to vote on big things whether it's a tax package who knows what Obamacare she votes gets oh you know getting ... she voted against repealing Obamacare sheet\n[noise] I don't know whatever\nIf they just get fifty them they could have ... the the fifty first about but a Supreme Court justice now I I Would care I don't think you would care either um\n\nBut a Supreme Court justice has never actually been confirmed by the vice president going down there and voting never happened before\nSo Joe Manchin is losing his his he's actually the latest polls have him dropping even farther behind and he might just say screw it I got to look out for myself and my future and hope that West Virginians voted for me if I get with Trump because then if I vote if I vote for drinking from Kevin can Trump really ripped me\nI I think so I don't think that's a that's a question right there\n\nSo I'm the latest that I've seen from ... you just you just put this out just three minutes ago uh he apparently Republican senator\nBy blood in Missouri so the outcome of the procedural vote which takes place or an hour in eleven minutes from now the outcome of the procedural vote on Kavanaugh may be reflective of the ... the confirmation vote\nAnd\nJoe Manchin it showed up once again to study the FBI report what is there to study\nIt just goes in there and you know just goes on line and checks his fantasy football and stuff like that you know and he said I'll probably be under you can't use any phones in there though I'll probably be undecided until I Walk in the door he said when asked what he's weighing right now he replied everything\nIt's really amazing how some people could be just so gung ho for Kavanaugh because they know he's a good guy and this is all the giant smear campaign\nAnd there are others that just don't want to vote for because there are big time labs and they have Trump on top of that and there's the people that know he's a good guy but they can't get around to it like knows Kevin I was a good guy\nMentioned nose is a good guy knows he's qualified elections have consequences we elected Trump the president then gets to pick the kind of ... Supreme Court justice\nThat he wants to see fit they all have their own individual ideology we're not stupid for all the four liberal or conservative you get a Republican president he's going to pick a conservative justice that's what happens when an election next time\nYou know if you're if you're a nominee wasn't as bad as Hillary and went to democratic states instead of staying home and saying I don't need to go there I'm lazy I have no work ethic that\nYou are shot at one thousand dollars now texting word bank to two hundred two hundred you'll get it fixed confirming injury plus I have a radio info thinner data and Mr Right to fly that banks to two hundred two hundred\nSix thirty here Lewis with us the news and just a second\nYear in ...

aids Brett\nKavanaugh is going to vote for you anyway more than they are going to vote for the the two to a third thing I Know third thing I think you need to know your welcome\nThird thing I think you need to know is that the unemployment rate dropped from three nine to three seven low since Nineteen sixty nine\nData says only a hundred and thirty four thousand jobs are created maybe it's because people are already working\nMay maybe\nMaybe we still have people that are working let's get 'em all out no more illegal immigration let's get an ... you see people at the U.S get 'em out there and get him a job manufacturing it as an all time high wage growth almost at three percent a year over year crazy rate things happening three things I think you need to know\nNow I'm my hypothesis I'm curious as to know what you think a couple of things will get you get your take on this does it matter to you and I I Can't imagine it wouldn't does it I'll put it this way did it did it you might be one of these people that chain that that doesn't think you should vote for Martha\nYou mark the swamp you're anti swap you'd rather have here in cinema in there I talked about this yesterday and the first hour I'll bring it up again you might say I can't we can't have another swat monster another McCain and they can't do it I don't trust or blah blah blah blah blah\nGet it I get but let me just tell you something you got to hold your nose you know how I feel about Martha you get it are the two two here since then it was a hell of a lot worse I mean she's crazy and if you are outraged by what's going on right now with what's happening with Senate Democrats that's exactly what you're going to get\nIf ...\nIf you say I don't care I'm not voting for either of them that's a vote for years to cinema\nAnd evil that's not for ... is a vote for ... and here's Dan is gonna fall right in line right by chunky boy Schumer\nAnd she's going to fight everything Trump wants to do which is everything that you want to do the wall another nominee of cabinet doesn't make it um ... she's gonna she's going to be part of the resistance she's that's what she's going to do it so if you are outraged\nI'm telling you if you were outraged by everything you've been seeing all these crazy protesters the crazy a crazy statements Democrats going after innocent guys like Brett Kavanaugh\nThere is literally zero cooperation of anything that was that was a key that he's been accused of zero nothing improves Christine Ford is actually rights or Ramirez is right nothing and if you were outraged by that I'm telling you got to hold your freaking knows and you've got to vote for Martha\nYou agree or disagree eight zero ... a barrel five six seven eight love to hear you about that now\nThe fact that Martin came out and said that she actually would vote for Brett Kavanaugh if she was in the Senate today she said and you know unless there's some crazy bomb showing the FBI report and we know there isn't except the only bumped show there is is more damaging evidence to Christine for\nBecause her friendly link Kaiser talk to the FBI again they went to see her out and she told the FBI this isn't the wall Street Journal show the FBI\nOr Christine's best friend retired FBI agent Monica maclean the one that she helped a pass a polygraph helped her get ready for a polygraph test said Monica claimed contacted her and said you need to change your story about what you said they don't you don't have an all you need you need to clarify that\nThis is bad\nSo Martha said I Will vote for\nCabin I Would vote for Kavanaugh up I was in the Senate does these what I what I just told you does that make any impact on you whatsoever\nOr you still going to vote no I'm just curious I'm just curious and when I was talking to set up for grabs people yesterday and they were fantastic they were they were great I Love going up there and talk to them um they all said they were going to hold their nose\nAnd it still more liberal hold their nose fill in the Bible\nAnd they thought it was a one nice lady uh Carol thought it was a great point that early ballots are sent out you'll get by I think October tenth yet the two two and mix Sally are going to debate October fifteenth so people can literally send in their ballots before the debate actually habits\nSo you have that now let's turn to Jeff Flake Jeff Flake\nThink is a lying\nLying lying human be maybe he was always like this maybe he was in I don't know I'm only judging by what he's doing today\nBased on everything that has been said there's literally no there's never been any cooperation proven you know that right yeah Jeff Flake came out yesterday and said that he was encouraged and that that's the word he was encouraged\nBy this new FBI reports he said\nIt finds known new corroboration and I'm thinking there was never any old corroboration you have that all the evidence points to overwhelmingly there's no reason any Republican and honestly a Democrat should vote against Kavanaugh\nBut Jeff Flake is still undecided\nHe still won't say yay or nay and I'm looking at it I'm trying to look at it from an outside perspective from Jeff Flake perspective\nAnd I think Jeff Flake is going to vote no and they were a number of reasons one\nHe hates Trump he hates Trump a lot\nWe know this right you know there's I Know there's no other reason\nHe hates you\nHe had to come out one eat crow\nBecause he said Trump will never be president and when Trump was president I'll never forget the ... election night I'll be enjoying micro now or something like that or I'll be eating micro now\nHe's mad about that he's also very mad and embarrassed that is the guy's been a congressman in Arizona for ten years in a one term senator he had to do over a year in advance say I'm not going to run for reelection\nHe doesn't like you we hate you because you he knows that you would not support him\nSo he hates Trump he hates you\nApparently Jeff lakes network is not like these other senators where it's like forty two million dollars we've looked it up I mean he's not a poor man don't get me wrong but he's not a multimillionaire according to what we saw sea ... going to need in a couple of months\nSo feel free to join me in an elevator any time we did is he going to be an older man\nA dormant he needs a job he needs to jail be now we know he's confirmed it that he is actually missed votes in the Senate\nTo meet with\nCNN and MSNBC now if you're a Jeff Flake and you realize you need a job\nDo you think CNN and MSNBC would be hard on your trail and you could really you could really Jack up your value by voting against Trump in Cavanaugh\nI mean if you give the falls in line and votes for it he's not going to be nearly as wanted by the crazies that run MSNBC and CNN right\nNow I may be wrong about all this\nSort of Jeff Flake votes against Trump and against Kavanaugh he's going to be the talk of DC for an extra few minutes of his Fifteen minutes of fame right extra few minutes\nAnd ... votes against him tomorrow and Kavanaugh doesn't get confirmed you know that he's going to be a guest on every single or at least a few or relief he'll be on Sunday Morning shows I'm just telling you right now okay\nAnd\nThat will make him very wanted by CNN and MSNBC because he's the guy that stood up to Trump\nThe guy that set up the Kavanaugh and not only did he stand up to Trump Kavanaugh he stood up to the Republicans which\nWould make him a fantastic\nContributor\nTo CNN and MSNBC right but\nIf he falls in line and says I just don't see why you could say no to Brett Kavanaugh nothing's been proven and he's got a track record of of of you know just fantastic things on the bench for twelve years\nHe's not going to be nearly as wanted maybe you won't be nearly as valuable writes nearly as valuable\nTo CNN and MSNBC so that's why I think Jeff Flake is going to vote no\nAnd I'd love to hear when you have to say about this\nAnd everything that's going on eight eight zero can Estee eight zero five six seven eight I'm not happy about that maybe I'll be surprised by that but after the McCain thumbs down this is the flake thumbs\nDown moment and I think he wants to cash in on it very spiteful man I could be proven wrong that's just what unfortunately I'm thinking Ben welcome to can Estee hello Ben\nHey how's it going All right hey so\nI I really hope you're wrong on a ... like um me to\nTell you I'm a I'm thirty are over ... were of a you know I've been in politics a little bit here and there but I've always voted and whatnot but I Will tell you after everything that that transpired and I don't think I'm the only one on the political spectrum I Am

Trump gets in there do some Republicans haven't been able to do for forty years open up Anwar get the ...\nAnd going in Alaska and it's going to create a wealth I mean just just a gigantic nest egg for the people of Alaska Trump gets it done and there's not Murkowski stands up there today and says no I don't support Brett Kavanaugh she's not going to change your vote to all of a sudden it yes I mean you do realize that writes\nThat I mean enough enough\n\nI'm\nSo we have that we have Joe Manchin Joe Manchin the Democrat who and West Virginia every county wants Brett Kavanaugh give Joe Manchin who said yes let's continue this the only Democrat to vote\nTo continue this end to end the debate tomorrow and get a confirmation votes now Joe Manchin needs this\nWell Joe Manchin when reelection I mean the people are respectively what Joe Manchin won't be the fifth vote he won't he won't be the deciding one 'cause fifty gets you'd be able to get Pence to swing on in there and make it fifty one well why wouldn't Joe mansion do that\nYou're ... wants to keep his job in West Virginia He's going to have to do that if you imagine all of a sudden they have fifty one somehow and mentioned like I'll be fifty two or I'll be fifty one doesn't that once they get fifty that's all the Republicans need cars Pence could swing on in there and be the deciding vote never happened before from\nWhat I've read but that that can happen Joe Manchin is going to have to step up really Oregon tomorrow maybe maybe mansion votes yes\nAnd flake both know that gives you fifty but in the wild card is also Susan Collins and Bethany if you missed it aunt Bethany apparently put out there that she voted yes to continue this\nHowever however she hasn't decided how she's going to vote tomorrow\nAnd she's going to announce from what I from what I understand later today\nLater today\nHow she'll vote tomorrow so we may know all this already but I guess then it if she votes no than what the hell happens then then you need you need mansion to join flake did get fifty and then Pence gets your fifty one\n\nNow it's not the end of the world\nRight\nNot the end of the world if he doesn't make its we will survive and he will be re nominated which Lindsey Graham wants to do I\nWill that have and who knows who knows what Trump's new or they'll be someone else what will the Democrats keep doing this I probably and I'm just telling you if the Democrats somehow when they're going to keep on doing it which is why as much as you probably don't really like Martha make Sally and I'm not a fan either you got a hold your nose and fill in the bubble\nYou have to do it because here's the cinema is going to continue she's gonna she's going to support this behavior\nIt's going to make it happen\nDo you agree with me or not agree with me on this whole mix alleys situation are you willing to hold your nose and fill in the bubble because if you don't see any of us do vote for either of them mixed alley or the\nTwo two then that's really a vote for the two two\nThat's it that's it\nSo that's the question what do you think about Jeff Flake eight eight zero ... euro five six Seventy they're all Republicans are getting fired up in the first time in a long time which is nice or let's play Chuck Grassley real quick\nChuck Grassley this morning on Fox and friends he's the

Chuck Grassley from this morning on Fox and friends here we go uh I think that uh it's a reflection of the the protesters and civility of American\nSociety generally a and I think\nIt's also a evidence that are that people will go to any life when they're encouraged by people on Capitol Hill like one a congresswoman saying confront\nThem in the restroom go up and another senator same ... in their face way as senators ought to be setting examples for civility not encouraging is civility you've heard about the resistance since November twenty sixteen you're seeing the resistance\nHeadquarters right here on Capitol Hill all among Democrats\nAnd it's right all among the Democrats [noise]\nWe used to call them out for and it took a long enough freaking time by the way all even Trump out there to the way even though we win like a flag by himself\nThis has been going on for way too long way too long now I Want you to hear one more thing I'm let's hear the the Orrin

now what if he votes with them is not as valuable that's just that's the only thing that I'm thinking plus he doesn't like you or me because he knows that we would never elected him which is why he said I'm I'm not going to run for reelection over a year ago or about a year ago so ah he drew in the towel it is what it is over a year ago\nSo that that's my take okay you also have to Trump so I

flake dumb enough to not\nRealize and maybe is dumb enough that\nThese networks CNN MSNBC they're using him and they will throw his bought out in a hot second when they don't need them anymore that's
