you\nKnow\nYou got I'm telling you there are lots of things going on right now with the mid term lots and lots and lots of great news right now though I Am so freaking excited President Trump's former campaign manager Steve Bannon joins me Steve how're you doing this morning\nAt Gert I'm doing great sounds like things are going great out there you got Larry ... who I Believe is a guy that's awfully on ... and all that much about voting patterns in the country it was fantastic on your show today\nYeah I've literally you him I mean it it's a it's loaded man and uh yeah he he does a better job than anybody I've ever seen especially on the on the cable news channels and and everything else so um he really looked into that stuff he's he's a bright dude\nWhat you do to your point earlier we can't get complacent what's happening ... was the last\n... this is all about President Trump up or down vote on him and in a portable and the Trump as a base election they are starting to turn out on the

they got his wife replicate what the Tea Party is two thousand and now we've stopped in full on and I\nThink if we want to play hard or we could actually stop the the ...\nWell I mean I I Know what the what history says you know yeah you know it goes back and forth usually you're in power you lose power things like that but this is rare because things are actually going really well and the number one issue that everybody always has when it comes to voting is the economy and it's on fire right now so I I mean yeah you're take I I just I Know every\nHouse selection is local and it depends on the Kennedy because there's some bad candidates out there but with the economy the way it is why the hell would people not want to do is really the Republicans\nAre the Republicans credit for the rule of thumb\nIs that an off year elections with a sitting president Trotter localized that they get it away from being a referendum on you know that's the exact opposite of what we\nWe drove the narrative to make this a referendum on Trump because it's about the whole Trump program this what the left was ... like the Trump program in its totality remember people don't show up does say they'll show up because they think\nThey want to know what the future as it turned out to be around\nIt or think people should remember that the average growth rate the American economy into World War two the the Chinese tore the most favorite nation that World Trade now than it was three point five percent\nFrom that day to day Donald Trump take over the president said the average growth rate the United states has one point ... percent in two years Trump has the growth rate three three and a half a toddler cut his focus is on five percent and this is what the Federal Reserve the tree interest rates\nWith this NAFTA is bringing back the supply chain tonight at a job\nTo the United states we're at the top of the first thing in the Trump academy this kind of a miracle turn around and I think people understand that that's where he's saying working class people and and and I think Europe is done by the amount of African American class in Spanish working class people that come out and support the Trump program\nSo you think I mean obviously again you know the polls two years ago they were way off bad no freaking idea that Trump was gonna just steam real Hillary like you did a new look at it now or ... or is this again going to be another big giant ...\nOr a store on the ... I was more ... than than the Trump to a hundred percent metaphysical surgery you're in a window with the program when we got the exit polls\nAt five o'clock in the evening on election day the exit polls head is tied in Iowa and Ohio where I felt were five or six points and losing everywhere else at five o'clock in the afternoon it looked like she was gonna win with it or hunter electoral vote\nDecree that's why the Hoosier after all high fiving carries putting on makeup laughing you know this sounds like nine o'clock what it sure is that even people that voted\nOr had to tell people they had done that so that's why these polls have always been off and I think he said well ... the generic ballot down to three if you look at the individual house races the happy one that's twenty five to thirty he house race\nIt's tightening up inside the margin of error President Trump has written a purpose of bringing Mitch McConnell and Steve Bannon at all the people have been fighting\nEverybody together and that's probably the theater the support that can make Sally the possibility of winning Arizona one\nIs showing you the Trump is leading this party unify from what the Democrats were wandering around her Hillary Clinton's also toward their husband\nOr Pocahontas was putting out her DNA test no court Cory Cory Harris and I were president Bernie Sanders giving speeches like handle it like a you know this Obama in Nevada whining about\nThat that he's not getting credit for the economy their leaders are all taking care of themselves copies just everyday he's in Texas with Ted Cruz loving up on\nOur\nCrops are sports guy he's a scratch headache after a golfer he understands that it's all about momentum and he's closing it was like sixteen we're closing hard on this thing and it's incumbent on everybody get your front at your neighbors early vote or get him to the polls effect\nWrong and that's what are they going to ask you see ban is on ... he is a President Trump's former campaign manager I'm now uh when it comes to ... you know another reason to vote besides if you want the wall you want to make some Democrats around nonstop Trump everything else\nI mean I think in in in you just kind of touched on it if Trump does when I think he's going to look at it as All right you know what this is finally\nI'm really good affirmation and I'm going to take off the gloves and I'm going to go after all these crooked people whether it's Hillary whether it's Rod Rosenstein all these people at the top of the deal Jay you name it to do you think that's going to happen if he's able to hold the house and and expanding the Senate\nI think it's a great point of it was part of it was for let's let's talk about what's going to happen strategically\nIf we hold that house here's the first one was going to happen remember these people on the far the time's up movement the resistance Tom stiers next generation it all the people around Netroots Nation that they rarely walking precincts this July and August doing with the Tea Party did\nIf they don't get a blue wave if they don't get Trump head on the pike which they've been promised\nThe Democrats are going to turn on each other member at Breitbart and other places I've been to fight as more civil war it's out of the Republican Party for nine years Sundays we win more days loop paper we've got a couple of scouts we've got ... and I we have cleaner we now Paul Ryan the Democrats have never had the civil war\nIf we work them and you said earlier that lead into this thing they already know they're not gonna take the Senate they were promised they were going to take the Senate that's off the table in fact\nWe hold Arizona a couple of others we may pick up two or three see\nIf we hold the house they will turn on each other and made dishes colonel civil war and I think you'd make it set up for Trump to have a massive landslide\nIn twenty twenty now on the other hand I think in holding the house increase in the Senate I think President Trump drops for him he says okay I've been reaffirmed at my first reelect we're going to drive this thing through twenty twenty and I think you're going to see a much more aggressive legislator program and much more aggressive investigation program\nWhen you were at the White House I'm just curious we're inside baseball and if you can't answer and you can answer but I you know I you know businesses any business there's always politics is always people trying to you know one of each other and then trying to get ahead and things like that and things are said um but was it like that on steroids time a thousand at the White House you just couldn't ruin\nTheir partner company to that last night that book is global is and I'm a national right\nInside the first your first year in the White House with her every day with a knife fight between ... and the ... I'm very proud of that I'm a I'm a national economic nationalist populist I make no bones about it and you know they were they were tough like particularly the fight them around\nIssues not just like trade but deeper debt it's economic or that China has been running on us if President Trump won the gauge and that's what's that about this whole geo strategic rethinking of the world's supply chain that President Trump is that's what might be these great deals\nPresident Trump were kind of course you were stored by these kind of progressive Democrats that were in that would include them in their straight and I think that's all on now and I think you see what's his affirmation of the other night that hey I'm a national is I put American a national security interests first put American economic interests first and particularly I put American citizens interests first\nHe's proud of that I think after two years and that is the way things are all I couldn't be happier that every day\nAnd by the White House I think that's fantastic you got to hold control of this thing now and I think he's got the the guys at credit for what they were all gone and he's on a roll\nCD okay because I you know I talked to a guy that was is the head of the national border patrol council brand and John he's\nHe's really not a big fan of Houston Nielsen says she's a ... a light and they had a long time to think of a plan to stop this caravan and she found that's why the stories came out about John Bolton John Kelly yelling at each other do you think Trump needs to get rid of some of those kind of people um I always look\nGranted judge you don't have a boat haven't quite that show ... is I think an American hero this guy's done an extraordinary job extraordinary job uh in his position in a real back but President Trump or yes I think that there will be after November So definitely be some changes\nBoth of the White House and I think there'd be some changes a cabinet and that's kind of normal and I but I think his press at Trump's now\nGetting to the lake he understands what he wants to accomplish and how it's going to accomplish it I think I see a change but I you know having Larry Kudlow and they're having John Bolton and they're having my palm pale at the state department you're starting to see the king come together and I think you're going to add to the team and I think a couple of people will be the party\nI ain't got to just come or if you don't mind I ... you're listening to ah he is a President Trump's former campaign manager or a White House strategic these on canine teams have Ninety\nUm all of a sudden this morning these new news coming out that a bombs were sent to Obama's house and the Clintons house and they were intercepted before they got there uh there's also apparently now it's coming out there was a suspicious package address to the White House CNN is just coming out has been evacuated\nYou know again I don't want to downplay this at all but I think we've been around the block\nThis just happened Thirteen Days before he isn't you know it does is just weird that it's all of a sudden a distraction trying to make people that hate those things obviously Trump supporters somehow responsible is there something weird that you're smelling hearing all the time I have\nTo add to travel with security stuff all the time but you look here's a nurse of the ... the bottom line is\nThe least ah aggressive people in the world with a Trump supporter the their the backbone of this country is hard working working class middle class and supported President Trump know who whoever did this has been done it's obviously outright and you've got a I have to wait and find out you know who did it it has been done but\nYou know a thing to change the narrative you know some people particularly people going to try to do so I think you've got to this is what it called the signal and the noise okay just look at the signal Trump signal couldn't be strong what he's doing it on the economy what are you doing on national security\nWhat he's doing on deconstructing the administrative state that is taking apart this government or by us and we're\nLike ... if you look at his lines of war the signal couldn't be strong but the noise the flash bang for a day every day\nOr whether it's Stormy Daniels are are are are used in a sense of shores they're going to try to divert all that just listen to this this listen to the signal the physical could be the stronger and just you know put that noise in the background and I think that's what I'm doing right now\nUh last one for me um and it's totally off topic but I'm a huge Seinfeld fan and I know that you were you were like a big time investor inside cost how did you get to talk about how did you get involved in saying yeah I'm going to win money on\nIt was not genius represent the company was selling it at the end of the day was that Ted Turner he didn't have the cash to pay\nMe back and said hey you got to convert it into taking over the ship but things are quite frankly we will we leave and then we're more of a cash treated there's we had to convert all into that trap doubt that Seinfeld wasn't a package of things in it at the time he gets the the ... the show had gone where people forget I think it's\nFirst year was dead last yeah was that wasn't he was going to top it perjuring first year Seinfeld\nShow I think was dead last that wait\nA minute what the thirtieth and I think in the year that we did it it had been number one but the cost and went on I think for five or six number one you know I Would like to have a stroke a British [laughter] but it's one of the ones that are tiny percent ... and most most of it was a just a good luck\nThat's how did you have any involvement at all with Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld or or just an\nInvestment banker selling did actually selling the castle rock\nApparatus and people with the time to really remember casserole booths Billy Crystal yeah that'd be really didn't make a lot money with the television division that was just starting up at the time they turned out to be the home run on it and that was just we were
