from kids the economy's crashing they want to take away that are also there was a a a bill\nOr put forth by the Republican legislature in Arizona about abortion and she calls herself an independent this gift in cinema listen to what she said about this year we go\nThere you are seeing the legislature this year to restrict women's right to choose to force her to listen to that\nPart of looking at

people said can you apologize you said no why should I Apologize\nYou didn't like you not at all fairly he and here's the cinema there on the same wavelength oh yet let's play eighty to eighty to this is what she says about\nRepublicans that by the way she wants them to cross over and vote for her because she's hoping you can't stand mixer failure so bored by her she's not trumping enough for you that you'll just you oh you don't want another McCain in there that you vote for her well this is what you're saying cinema thinks of you here we go\nAnd you know people say on the part of the reasons you know the entire time twenty or they didn't their Republican [laughter]\nHe [laughter] he part of your public [laughter] how long we should call them asking the Republicans are free riding home and

out here and there are a big debate just coming up on Monday we'll have highlights Tuesday the one and only debate that these two silent candidates that are both frauds but cinema is just a thousand times worse\nAnd by the way I'm just curious\nIf you really don't like more than you were thinking about voting for years to him because he just didn't want another McCain type you know you think

we just need jobs we need to bring jobs back here and that's what's gonna make America great doesn't matter what color you are\nWell not only that but the Democratic party has been instrumental in breaking down the family unit up like America and other\nUh people of color or I heard read an article by Thomas sill which I didn't know back uh I think before Nineteen fifty [noise]\nThe average black family they were two parents and my home they were conservative and in order to swing them to ... to vote Democrat they've started given ... you know promising free stuff free this free that\nUh they slowly eroded and broke down\nThe uh the the family unit\nTo where now it's a lot of play and go you know single than a single parent\nAnd a ... some of the black community not all but they broke down and made a the Democratic party their daddy yup or mommy and that has it and that is the thought process\nI don't know how it's gonna get sick\nBut more and more\nBlack Americans I think they're

what are you saying and he said I said that when I was brainwashed to have a victim of a victim mentality\nWell good for him ... opened his eyes\nAnd hopefully more Americans well who are stuck on stupid ignorant\nWill open their eyes and see what the Democratic Party is all about and that does not about American it is not about making American great\nIt is not about the securing our borders and bringing jobs back and the American exceptionalism the Democratic party\nAnd all of their men are the house and they all are and they all are and another thing you know the the the N. word\nYeah

this is it two days of sell offs it's a correction oh my goodness gracious to all this is this this is it Trump's going to lose image what are you crazy nuts\nThree things I think you need to know by the way I did you see this\nArnold Short ah Schwarzenegger what a disappointment another guy that Trump destroyed took over The Apprentice and belly you destroyed it with his awful ratings I thought it was hilarious\nOr he was a a rhino is a rhino could be I remember people were all excited when he ran for governor of California and then he went left with so many things climate change you name it all this stuff\nYou see the latest thing that Arnold Schwarzenegger's apologize for\nDo you remember he used the term girly man you're girly man member that really is no sorry that he ever said that because this is two thousand Eighteen and people are so sorry they're afraid of the language they use\n\nIn two thousand for Schwarzenegger called California Democrats quote girly man\nHe said the next election video people could terminate them and I remember ... and ... the ... the guys on Saturday Night live when it was funny day in a ... a pop you up they'll be a girly man who was based on our Schwarzenegger\nNow on a ... interview with mental magazine any sorry overt taunting people by calling them girly man seriously sorry get outta here man quote at the\nTime it felt like the right thing to do it was in my gut I improvised it I called them girly man because they weren't willing to take risks\nThey were afraid of everything politicians in general want to do little things so there's no risk involved\nBut now he regrets it quoted was short sighted in the long term it's better to not say that because you want to work with them if you have a little sense of history you know that the best things are accomplishment both parties worked together and start compromising like Ronald Reagan did with Tip O'Neill they argued in public and attacked each other but with a little wink\nThat's why so much got done in the Reagan Administration\nYeah\nIf he could be king for a day you know what he said he do quote access for everyone to health care get off the arms race get off polluting can't have so much plastic floating around in the oceans\nSounds like a left wing wacko doesn't mean I shouldn't have called them that you know it's so funny he's like a Jeff Flake shouldn't have gone should have gone so\nShould the Democrats not have smeared Brett Kavanaugh it'd be a guy that gives girl ... leads to drug human ...\n\nYeah never never uh never says anything about that now does he oh by the way speaking of Jeff Flake real quick\nGeoff lakes interview with C SPAN\nRemember the lock her up chants we played a couple of days ago Diane Feinstein Trump brings up Dianne Feinstein while he's in with an eerie Pennsylvania somewhere maybe the Iowa wherever he was he's so many so many he's going to be another place tonight I Can't even keep up with a guide or get the energy and so\nIt was Tuesday night he brought up Dianne Feinstein about her body language and then she she leads the note from Christine for all this other stuff the crowd started chanting lock her up lock her up lock her up\nWell Jeff flake is very upset by this it's just he told CSPAN quote the disturbing thing isn't so much what Trump says anymore if the cheers from people behind him and the chance of lock her up for example it's just unseemly\nUnseemly did you know that it's unseemly unseemly\nIt does make me feel that it's going to be a longer process to get out of this then it should be now or with Jeff Flake think that it's unseemly and his family purposely hired illegal aliens at their ranch in northern Arizona and remembered his own book he admitted when border patrol would come to try to read the ranch\nAnd their helicopters to be out there I Try to throw 'em off I get on my horse and I put on a cowboy hat I tried to I Try to distract them to let the illegals get away when he said\nTo me that's a bit unseemly\nJeff Flake still doesn't get it you know he makes these comments he is freaking clueless man\nCoolest which is why nobody likes them here in Arizona would again Eighteen percent approval rating and the media goes to him because he hates Trump as it'd be like some guy that knows what he's doing\nSo flake\nSays the unseemly of course he still doesn't understand or doesn't want to I don't know that we are sick and tired of seeing politicians get away with things\nThat if we did it we'd go to jail that's why they chant lock her up Hilary literally broke the law by having all those top secret top secret documents on her own secured server\nAnd then she erased them and they they broke cell phones they tried to hide everything they draw they deleted emails that were requested to be turned over she broke the law so many ways that's why I say ... she gets away with it if we do we go to prison\nDie leaked lied she committed crimes\nIs they lock her were sick of politicians getting away with this stuff and Jeff Flake pointed unseemly so I guess Geoff doesn't mind that politicians keep breaking the law never actually pay the price what a ... matter of fact this is you know what else he said this this is just part of it but for a number eighty if you don't mind Adriana a part of the C SPAN interview\n\nI Hope that it's him that he he wants something that happened\nWe just have to bring up the the guy that was Bob ... wife made her famous because we hate him so much and that just nice\nGets even better let's go back to Stephanie rule please Seventy eight Seventy eight after she said this was an assault in the White House Stephanie rule in her for a partner I'll leave a shouldn't do whatever they do something like that one of his name is uh somebody they they talked about uh this this White House meeting just just listen to this area\n[noise] um that was crazy I mean the things that are ... said well yeah well it's\nMy favorite yeah has talked about\nLack a male role model\nIn his life growing up that a lot of mail energy in the wrong time that that was because of the male ... foot that tap on he felt like a guy who could play catch with his his his didn't have that opportunity standing in the office and you know a lot of apple I was out there\nThey don't like the gang tell like make America great again and the river bank if there are a little black or white now historically life was better for you than it is and the current moment\nGangs and make America great county wanted a colon Kaepernick and Trump to go to the super bowl where I had to just make America great\nBend in the middle east said let's ... whatever he has a lot of thoughts you want everybody to like everybody and for that he is getting destroyed in the media doesn't care alley bill she'd have to get married don't you don't even care\nWill get back to more ... I Want you to hear one is a little off topic talking about promoting violence and stuff like that I remember when Trump destroyed Jeb Bush several times during the debates Jeb exclamation point member that\nUniverse Seventy nine ready ah Nicole Wallis who is a an establishment rhino so much so that she up after Jeb last and she was a ... advisor at that by the way nothing says credibility like being a Jeb advisor I gave him advice set a workout not so well\nSo she's a jeopardize her and she loved Romney and she loved McCain and Bush so now she's on MSNBC and she\nRevealed that she wanted a job to get violent with Trump listen to this year we go\nFor that ... that I thought he said if I send in the face I said and if you live he insulted or why not ask that aren't got next against rape is an art but what is it I said I I think that by some in the face and then gotten out of the right and then a hero\nWould've been a very low energy punch by the way very low energy\nBut it was a slow punches like us last\nAnd as these as these long arm of Jeb would have made his way to Trump ... like what are you doing what's going on what what do you do what do you enjoy the low energy\nOut my back or insult that his wife\nAgain do you not think maybe they should come to Tucson do you not think that Mexico sends rapists and drug dealers you don't think they've got to get caught by border patrol\nHe said some are good people but I don't think that Jim's wife came here legally do you\nLike All right we'll get back some ... great polling news what do you think about all of this ... what
