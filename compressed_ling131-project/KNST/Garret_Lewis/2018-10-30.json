talking about guns and uh well just listen here we go\nWe can't be talking about\nIs the way it is how you handle guns out here\nThat was ... and she said we can't talk about assault weapon bans and any of that the O'Keefe guy with the ... guy said well you know you can talk about banning weapons to California but you can't talk about a year and meaning Arizona and she said yeah because they'll shoot you\nSeveral ... and she really thinks a lot of you huh\nUh we have much much more you don't see one fifty real quick and they'll do a couple of more one fifty this is um which is here's Tim telling her group of people how she needs to get elected listen to this\nBig on my I needed to reach out to moderates and conservative Republicans\nSo that's that's what she needs need help reaching independents moderates conservatives concern of Republicans that's what we need to get your reaction to this reaction of the president talking about I don't want to say ending birthright citizenship 'cause that's not accurate restricting it I guess you should say\nRestricting ending it for illegals\nOr will react to that and we have more sound bites the play where her own staffers like her one of them is like a campaign chair I mean these are big people at her organization admitting behind the scenes that she is a hardcore leftist meaning Cubans cinema we'll get to all that don't go anywhere morning ritual Louis ... seven Ninety two sons most stimulating talk\nSome morning ritual with Jerry Lewis okay good\nFeed arch support can you believe a in a few months of the year nine years I've been wearing these almost eight years now eight years the good feed arch supports and I actually had a meeting with the new client yesterday sitting in an office with this business owner\nAnd we're talking about things and he said by the way I I have a good few dark supports he said these are fantastic he said I Can't go a day without him\nCan't go day user everything that you say\nI'm telling you if you will have sore feet if your work and after five or ten minutes where after a day ... day you feel like you feed her on fire or if you have to sit down you wake up in the morning your feet are short now your feet or so you're back hurts your knees hurt you don't need to live that way you have plenty of a plan or fish or player of fat Shiite as you don't need to live that way\nWhen people come to me\nIt just it should be a landslide\nWell let me again when I brought up this morning Arizona Republic since Seventy five percent of the voters in Arizona have already mailed in their ballots like ... like that that you know so twenty at most probably twenty or twenty five percent are going to actually show up on election day and out of the Seventy five percent that have mailed in forty four percent of Republicans thirty three percent Democrat twenty three\nNon affiliated so the Republicans have a huge lead right now\nRight huge lead and and when they ... about the poll about how Trump is doing a little bit better in a bomb in the same time period well but you got to realize Obama got at least nine percent positive coverage and Trump is getting really present negative\nCoverage so if the coverage was actually equal\nFair to both I think Trump would probably be in the high seventies by\nNow so what do you think do you think the Republicans keep out that I got that reality\nIs that they do it it's going to be a slim margin but I definitely think they're going to pick up seats in the Senate\nYes All right well we'll just unheard of it wasn't supposed to happen no none of this was supposed to happen once it's All right well hopefully he'll fix the fourteenth amendment thing\nThat that would drive a lot of people to go vote for him even more so in fact I'm pretty sure demand thank you very much um I tell you what it was a good call and some people yourself credit welcome so\nUh I think that if you ask people in this country and they don't feel bad about it\nRight they don't feel they don't feel like all you're gonna think I'm a racist if you actually ask them\nSomebody comes here that's not a citizen just to have a baby you think it's fair that baby becomes a citizen\nThey say no that doesn't seem fair what other country does that not that I Know if\nThat's you know we all know came from the fourteenth amendment was about slavery and and and I get that but it's a hundred and Seventy years later so\nEnough is enough right enough is enough I think most people in this country they owned among a lot will not say publicly but deep down they're going to say about him time oh damn time\nUh we got to get to more cinema sampled play one more cinema real quick number two this is Madison ... she is a uh she's one of the the big shots like a field coordinator for the cinema campaign and she starts laughing ... sentiments angel stand up for Arizona values here we go\nTo our share of oh Missouri democratic [noise]\nWe'll see\nShe's angry [laughter]\nWhatever\nWhatever the belief that means ah they know they know she's full of it and ... honestly shame on the rest of the media the TV stations\nOr the local newspaper not even actually putting this stuff out there but it wasn't for\nFor me telling you any Internet telling you I mean this is why there's fake news they don't get anyway we'll continue more reaction to the trumps

taxes the winnings are down to roughly a hundred and twenty five million dollars each\nNew York in Iowa State taxes bring the winnings to about one hundred and seven million dollars each and then come

the cinema getting ... getting beret tossed\n... or ... years in cinema we've been the only people here in southern Arizona the TV state the TV stations stink the newspaper stink we smelled of fraud\nVery very quickly we knew we knew everything she said in her past all the crazy stuff that she has done her ads everything about her they've crafted her they put her in a skirt the sexy glass has all this stuff to make her look normal when fact she has a radical not\nOf course nobody local media except for us has done anything about this and exposed it's [noise] and then she got beret tossed yeah\nVideo out there where she uh she was everybody that is that everybody deserves citizenship as long as you haven't just a committed a bad crime\nWhich is one of the brilliance statements of all time the guy in charge all this that did the video producing it during the great work the media doesn't do any more because they stink James O'Keefe a project baritone joins me now James Man banks are coming to the show how you doing this morning\n... great to be on with you and we've got some I I just saw sentimental reacted and that was that on your show or someone\nShow [laughter] she just reacted to this a video of these guys seem that no I haven't what happened there\nThis was um I'm trying to figure out what the program that's on some hate hate the hate the AR okay on guy he said uh where where I Am a convicted criminal cinema responding to our video showing her staffers\nMocking the you know her representing Arizona also that I'm a I don't know who these staffers are so I Can't answer your question not let's take everything they say with a grain of salt and then getting she's very defensive about what we've exposed here\n... you know that that is actually a very left the radio station up in ah Phoenix there an anti Trump stage Miller hosts are anti Trump and she actually will go on the air station because she knows what he's going to get softballs they showed a return to our guest is\nThis just happened I guess just minutes ago and we just got a copy of recording so yeah we are also another ... I\nI actually was in Arizona yesterday confronted\nThis staffer ... is her name Madison's SARS the little organizer and feel field organizer is on tape\nSaying and and she's using Barney you're close she goes sentiment represent Arizona is whatever the F that made up his she's mocking the idea that senator would represent your state as opposed to you know Washington DC national interest and um and so I could have brackets are\nAnd she actually talk to me yesterday and and the parking lot outside of the office and the\n... and in Arizona and she said that she was glib and she but she stands behind her statement\nSo we are getting some reactions from Senator and her and her team as a result of this video which is just sort of being released\nWow this is incredible by the way you're listening to James O'Keefe a project baritone voice on ... ... am seven Ninety didn't explosive explosive video undercover video exposing cinema and she was outed by her ... let me get this straight though again you talked to this this girl we have a we played the soundbites throughout the morning we played that one you talked about to Madison ...\nAnd ... and she's a field these are field coordinator is these are all kinds of people that are getting paid by her and she actually claimed that she doesn't know who these staffers are\n[laughter] yeah let me read you the exact thing has responded if you're on the quote her because hosted a TA are yeah at this morning and it's something that came out project or does it was known is cameras capture people saying things they sometimes wouldn't stay in public they did they put out is not that it's not great at it\nSo they're they're they're ... this liberal host I guess is is applauding us in front of cinema\nAnd and the Warren from which is the field organizer that says in this video is is the host saying or from a a said she they play the video on the air ... and and then I miss it I don't know who Lauren is so I Can't answer that question while the cinema is is saying she doesn't know who her field organizers are\nAnd they don't I guess she's sort of implying they don't represent her but again this is not pretend this is an undercover video showing all for staffers\nGreek chorus if you will it's it's all saying the same thing ... saying that she has to end in fact Lauren from and this video and the host grade on the radio would send them a\nHost played that clip when Lawrence says she can't really be who she is my question is why not just send them a tax was to deny that she knows who these people are\nThere you go yeah by ... she she sent me a video that you guys did a project very toss she had to become a centrist of trying to get elected a and another one like the lower and lower than it was Madison ... and they learned from said she has to hide who she is she's a liberal she's progressive um she's very progressive but you can't do that because she has to win the election do you have to get elected\nSo you're yeah hosing again these these these people how recently however I recent where these videos taken within the last week or two\nYeah it is not in the last few weeks yes I mean we've been our investigative work takes months but I Would say all this came to the last couple of weeks as the ... the campaign heats up in September and October and send them up\nYou know this whole investigation is really about politics and politicking in red states because they have to play both sides of the fence in your state of North Dakota in Missouri and Tennessee which where we've done this work\nThe politicians have to appeal to the moderates enter their progressive base\nSo it's sort of exposing what they really are and which then the machines are special special type of person because she's she's one of the more in in her past extreme\nSo she has to put on the front now we got into one of her fundraisers and at a rich donors of uh the the Andrews is this wealthy donor who we've got close to an undercover work\nAnd send them a is mocking the gun Second Amendment she goes oh they'll shoot you here in Arizona if you'd want to take away their gun Michelle David send her her her campaign manager we caught on tape saying we can't be talking about we can't be talking about assault weapons ban so\nIn these unguarded moments we captured these people mess sometimes people are not going to be honest unless you catch them\nIn these ungodly amount of people say well you shouldn't be secretly recording people we were we didn't we didn't bug the rooms we're always recording our own conversation with these people so they always knew there was kind of a stranger next to them as we talk to them and they told us who they really are and what they actually intend to do after sending that gets elected\nJames O'Keefe who you're listening to around ... am seven Ninety project beret toss is\nThe website and you know he got Houston sentiments what I mean did you look at Houston's pass and realized that she's obviously full of it has to be a radical not with the things that she has said in the past ah about the the military committing acts of terror in the middle east\nUm two the two two and female all we all know about that um to she said years ago is a state lawmaker stay at home moms are leeches off their husbands blah blah blah\nDid you know you have a good feeling that you are going to\nBasically very easily find out who she really was and how people exposure for who she was\nWell there's a gap between how you project yourself and who you are that task becomes a lot easier I mean there it's just it's just the truth I mean it's just I Can't lobby or project or interpret or advocate I just we just expose that's all we do in Roger it's us we just expose people for who they really are\nAnd I think that video speaks for itself you you you if your listeners have not seen this video with a it's a um a ten Fifteen minute video on YouTube it it's a mash up of all these conversations with their staffers and they're all saying the same thing\nThey say that first of all she says that she wants to everyone who is here illegally she wants to make a citizen yup they can't talk about this assault weapons ban and all those guns and stuff they're going to do after the election they mark Arizona and they say that that you'll shoot people if if if you talk about banning banning guns\nThey talk about how she has to pretend to beat it to be moderate even though she's really progressive\nThey ... the idea of of representing the state of Arizona and it's all on and on and my point is cinema comes out this morning on radio and says that I'm a criminal I'm a criminal McCaskill that I committed fraud yes by recording them in their own words I mean
