you don't work for them\nWhat the hell\nAre ... what it says you're in a local paper ready for this ... quote removing ice from the jail is the appropriate three thing to do it always has been I'm Glad to see that he made that move\n\nBut he expressed concern that Napier linked stone garden funding to ISIS presence in the jail saying that while they both involve immigration enforcement at a local level too don't have anything else to do with one another\nQuote this kind of quid pro quo was the type of political shenanigans the public is very tired of said ... he called Napier as move quote very brazen\nSo Napier literally tries to kiss his button do this because there's a ... and the rest of them complain about ice being in the jail\nSo Napier actually thinks if I make them happy with this they'll they'll get on my side and like a sucker he gets played like a fool even typically is\nThe lead opposite reason to me but even ... says on ... you're just trying to be political so

already somewhere in Scottsdale a spending the night\nHe's going to have a rally for Martha McSally a because amazingly enough she needs them and you need to vote for her because here since then it was a complete and total whack job but\nIt's pretty uh pretty pretty sad that Martha needs the help against such a terrible candidate is and it's so Trump's going to put on a show you will you'll hear just start probably a little after seven you'll hear right here on ... seven Ninety\nThird thing I think you need to know that caravan is getting closer of the future illegal aliens but may go says they're going to stop them as a matter of fact as a planet place\nI'll put the story on my Facebook page Mexico U.S Mexico a grand plan to handle migrant Caribbean from Central America Fox News had the exclusive on that under the deal\nIt was developed over the course of several months oh man they thought this ahead of time man that Trump they they don't know what they're doing do they Mexico requested the UN's high commissioner for refugees established shelters along its southern border with Central America\nOh man and if any of these migrants don't have the proper documentation to Mexico they get ... ship right back\nSo there's a plan in place it better work three things I think you need to know\nSo\nWe have that now you can talk about ... this is the big gigantic local story and he was a couple of things you know you're just tuning in sheriff Napier a lost out on operations stoned Garton funds\nBecause\nThere is a major Trump election drained when syndrome in the minds of three supervisors and Pima County sharing the driver\nDick Ali is an Ramon valid as they hate Trump so much that a grant that has been approved every year since two thousand six since two thousand six\nRight two thousand six was rejected\nBy the supervisors lying to the public saying that it's somehow hopes Trump enforce\nThe border or something like that border security and make\nA deputy border patrol agents they lied it's the same grant every year we know this so sheriff Napier puts out a a seven page memo\nWhere he literally gets rolled rolled\nNapier said he's compromising his position on providing office space for ice agents insincere hope that it builds a breach of trust what are the Hillary and reciprocal compromise\nYes that's exactly what ... is going to do is going to compromise their nuts their [noise] their dug in near the resistance [noise]\n\nYeah and he's hoping that by doing this supervised would vote to approve next year cycle of stone garden funding\nSo again instead of actually saying listen Pima County\nI worked for you and we need these funds these this grand has been approved every single year all of a sudden Trump gets elected and next thing you know these these supervisors hate Trump so much they're messing with your family's\nSafety is is unacceptable\nI'll be I'll be a share for just a second you said this is unacceptable to share my job is to make sure this community is as safe as possible\nAnd these three supervisors have made it extremely dangerous because where these funds came in to help us get equipment pay overtime do whatever we needed to do to stop drug runners from coming across the border and drugs and bad people and whatever else\nNow I don't have the funds to make that happen so because they Trump so much they did this ... share the driver among Valdes they all may Pima County and the rest of Arizona extremely dangerous more dangerous than what it needs to be\nAll based on their hatred for President Trump I find that unacceptable what are you what do you think\nIt's up to you at the ballot box set to watch what you didn't put pressure on him\nCall their offices and say\nYou may not like Trump but damn it I Want to make sure my family safe that's what I Want only reach my family is safe\nAnd there's people screaming from the rooftops in ... district and what they are too stupid and sharing the driver adorable and valid as\nThey should be out there because again Napier did this and said All right I'm taking the ice agents out there'll be gone he's working with the ACLU he's working with ... is he's trying to make all these people happy yet he's not making us happy and he works for us he works for me he works for you is elected not appointed\nHe doesn't know jak squad to these supervisors\n\n... says already said yeah this is nice but no dice dude no dice\n\nNapier sending a letter if compromise can move this forward I said I firmly believe stone guard and funding is of critical importance to our country I'm Sorry to our county if compromise can move that forward without collateral ... a degradation to public safety it seems reasonable and take that posture but wouldn't ... doesn't realize is that typically is\nIs it reasonable\nIt says here ... quote removing ice from the jail is the appropriate thing to do it always has been I'm Glad to see he made that move but he expressed concern that Napier links don't garden funding to ISIS presence in the jail he said that well they both involve immigration enforcement at a local level\nDue to don't have anything else to do with one another quote this kind of put quid pro quo is the type of political shenanigans\nThe public is very tired of it that's what ... said and he said that ... years move was quote very brazen Steven ... says ripping ... move\n\nAgain if Napier had the guts he would get up there today we call this show and say you know what I put it out there my bad that's it ISIS\nGoing back in an ongoing harden heavy I'm going around to everybody in the community everybody and Pima County to explain what exactly this is still in garden grant did and how ...\nIs making it much much more dangerous here\nYou just got a call now by dig leads to try building a bridge he said yeah I'm gonna blow that thing up and he did\nHe said go pounds than this has nothing to do a stone garden funding nothing\n[noise]\nWhat are you gonna do about it maybe you should have the guts to say you know what I said just back in the jail there's no dealing with these people back in the jail do it when you fight you win\nAgain Napier was never really attracted never Trump guy\nCame out against the wall got called out by me call that my Tucker Carlson\nNapier goes out on Fox News channel Fox and friends to try to stay the case were stolen garden\nAnd still gives into these crazies and what they do to pay it back to him they said screw you buddy screw you and by saying that they said screw you to tell my wife about this last

easily or there'll be people that get to die in the desert at a much more frequent rate because even these funds were used to find people that cross the border illegally that were dying in the desert\n[noise] yep\nThat's what this did you can comment if you'd like eight eight zero ... eight eight zero five six seven eight or this is beyond the lunatic fringe this is the kind of stuff listen this is the kind of stuff and I hate to say this because I like it here but it's a kind of thing that makes you say\nIt's just really the safest place where my family is this is this the safest place for my family should we go somewhere else where it's more safe\nShould we do it and again why the hell would anybody\nThat's it blank\nI don't understand why doesn't have the guts to freaking fight against the people that are making things ... you know more dangerous for us\nI I just\nI don't get it he's going along to get along\nSuck up the truck Huckleberry I kind of play both sides of this that you you got played you got played navy or\n\nThey don't care about our safety and apparently neither does Napier ... this this is what it says to me maybe is not willing to fight for what's right and fight for our safety and don't tell me well I'm trying to get your safety by getting the funds by giving given to watch\n\nThe joke or seven Nineteen if you or something to say I swear I Will get

probably need that cup of coffee right about now don't you it is the freshest coffee\nYou know of I I Can't hold someone just because the government asked me if there's no legal authority I have let them go so sheriff Napier said that's why ice agents are in my jail so I don't get sued and it was a bad guy we can make sure I says right there when we release him the ice agents there to pick 'em up\nWell now the ice age and is not going to be there to pick them up so there's a bad guy they could just go and ... says well they always check our computers in our records have access to that they know and this and that\nWhat if they're not there what if it takes them an extra half an hour and the guy is gone\nSheriff Napier\nIs now putting our community in freaking danger\nBecause he's saying I Want to get these funds so bad that I'm willing to let a bad guy go 'cause I don't want ice agents to be in the jail if they send to detain or I Can't detained the person they better get there in time otherwise this person's on the street somebody could pick them up and then he's gone right gone\n\nSo for a guy that wants to really protect the community he's not doing a very good job at it when it comes to this with this decision\n\nAnd that's why sheriff Napier Road as your share of I'm faced with the same difficult decision of how to address I used to trainers previously we contacted ice and we became aware person subject to entertain her would be released\nPractically Ninety percent of the time I used to be able to respond to the detention center and take custody of the person prior to completion of their release process the ten percent failure rate of the process was troubling to me we did not want a person who fell into that ten percent to potentially pose a public a risk to public safety\nApparently he doesn't mind that ten percent risk anymore and that sheriff Napier sheriff Napier is going to use the word compromise he's going full John McCain\nIt's got to where I Am shy\nYep\nSo he writes I understand is a very charged issue I have attempted to address this issue in a thoughtful reasonable appropriate manner\nThis is why we have ice representatives into detention center that's it again let me just this is what he said\nI've tried to find an apolitical reasonable inappropriate solution clearly attempting to balance community sent them in the charge political environment and public safety\nWith respect to detain or is is a tremendous challenge so\nI'm a member of the national sheriffs Association He writes in major county sheriff's America both organizations recommend as a best practice approach we're addressing the\nPainters is one possible plays an ice representative and your jail this allows for a direct hand off of a person with a detain or when the person was released on local charges one hundred percent ... success rate this ensures public safety doesn't involve any of the bad solutions previously discussed\nThere you go so basically he said this ensures the public is not placed in jeopardy due to the release of a person who could pose a public safety danger\nNow sheriff Napier is all about the\nChance of danger to the public\nThat's what it comes down to will continue seven thirty three ... got to get to send them as well and some uh some great great things from a Rosie O'Donnell\nWe have to get to it right we do a

[noise]\nRemoving ice agents from the Pima County jails I'm Greg Paul hanging as the news Pima County sheriff mark Napier is removing federal immigration agents from the jail as a bargaining chip saying he hopes the move will encourage supervisors to restore a federal grant\nThe move comes after a majority of the Pima County board of supervisors decided to reject a one point four million dollar border security grant awarded to the sheriff's department earlier this year\nThe county had been using these stone garden grandson's two thousand six to cover overtime mileage any equipment cost for the sheriff's office the grant encourages collaboration between local and federal law enforcement agencies\nIn a mental Napier along with local law enforcement officials urge the supervisors to approve the funds for the department Napier told the Arizona Daily Star in an email that he doesn't think removing ice from the jail will have a negative effect on public safety as I was infrequently at the jail anyway so we'll see where this story goes\nSupporters of president Donald Trump or already camping outside the Mesa facility where his rally will take place some people

don't expect ever to tour that boat that boats that we're going to turn Richard I'm is never going to change his mind um but I Do need three votes on the board and I can't stress enough that this was a several million dollars coming next year\nAnd then the federal government is funding stone guard at a much higher rate in subsequent years\nPima County needs that money they desperately need that money and ... in frequent occurrence of ice being in the jail ... me being the only share up in the state that had ice and that\nJust seemed like a compromise if if the compromise works in the county benefits because we get millions of dollars if it doesn't work I but I ... back in the jail back the way we were if I assumed she wants to go back\nI Can't either way I got I got I'm just short on time can I get your back or any ten and then we get alley Miller two more questions for you is that okay\nActually I think it'd be happy to know on on going up to Phoenix I got a meeting up there and that I'm going to be with the governors stuck to reach president this evening\nOkay well real quick or is there a way that you can just accept the funds without the approval of the board of supervisors\nI'm I'm working on a couple of a solution is a legislative solution and been working with the federal government also to see if there's a way that they can direct clause directly to sheriffs to remove the politics for what is the sheriff should be making that decision\nAbout whether or not the sponsorship public safety advocacy or not it shouldn't be a political decision yes and remember of a supervisor Christie's supported by supervisor Miller actually ... a resolution to the board that said exactly that and the board rejected it because they want to keep politics in this politics shouldn't be in this year at this about public\nSo no I Know and that's why I think he did\nNunes of dollars to to keep us safe but you're\nPlaying politics trying to make that happen instead of just fighting for what's right I mean Trump fought for everything for every time it's like people are going to think and I think that you're not doing enough to stand up for yourself you know you're not do enough to stand up for the people here and Pima County\nYou're absolutely wrong on your um ... ice that was a joint decision between us in ice but there just was not an activity to keep him there\nSo then why not keep them out and so then they aren't you guys are done why bring them back into the future\nWhile it it'd be their decision would be a mutual decision whether they want to come back or not or whether they believe there's a lot of activity that makes it sensible it was a convenience matter for our eyes and I know that they liked the convenience of being directly there rather than have to come to the jail they liked being there but\nFor the sake of trying to get this grant pushed to the finish line\nThis is a reasonable compromise that doesn't jeopardize public safety and the real jeopardy to public safety of crystal clear on this is not getting that sold aren't funny and as a system is set up right now I Need ... votes or to get stoned garden funding and absolute those three votes this county is less said\nYes and that is my primary focus is to keep this county safer to keep the federal funds coming so that I can deploy resources and obtain equipment the other was could not get\nDo you think the final thing do you think that you've done enough to make it clear to the public to really ah show how dangerous the three supervisors have made this community do you think you could do more\nI think I've spoken out I've been to a community groups have been all over the place\nThis I've been on every radio program that will help me on\nFrom NPR to Arizona Public media all over the place I don't believe they care I Believe they're listening to it very very small number of people activist that have gotten three boats are bored\nAnd their jeopardizing public safety in our county and um until we pushed that forward I Can't get them to change their minds\nWell then that's when people have made that you're given in I mean you're you're the one that's giving in they haven't given an inch and they're not going to give an inch\nBut we'll see we're going to produce a grant they're about two million dollars um if they vote three votes were back in business\nBut it'll be up to them whether they want to continue this political nonsense around the public safety grass or not\nThat's in their court I have done everything I can do to make a make this happen and if they don't like it happened and we um\nWe suffering the county and it's at the hands of the board of supervisors not they had the sheriff because I've made clear this

to head why but he doesn't know what he's doing its amateur hour oh there's others\nDo blah blah blah blah blah will get into this stuff okay ah three things I think you need to know now I'm look this whole Napier situation has fired up a lot of people\nI put stories on Facebook I even put sheriff Napier words at least\nWe all just second he wrote a whole mental as to why ice agents are needed in the jail\nNow October ... well you want to let the Tuesday when his mental came out what was that the Seventy sixty sixty a mind changed\nSupervisory only Miller wants to ...\nA good morning Karen how are you All right [laughter]\nSo uh you're telling me well first off your reaction to share of maybe years a situation where he is trying to deal with crazy but let me tell you that Trump has showed people have you fight you can when you got to stand up for yourself\nAnd I never thought you should actually talked to a group of people who deal with them Trump has with Kim Jong moon but he has by saying my button is bigger than yours and you know and then basically calling you out for being you know call just calling him out publicly and he wound up winning sure maybe you'd be willing to call out\nTo bring you have to negotiate from a position of strength yes um\nAnd if you and you know I'm pander which I Believe this is happening here to I mean it's clear from his words that he's pandering to the board majority who clearly do not they they do not want ice agents in the jail they don't want they want to open borders\nAnd this is putting the whole community at risk I'm extremely disappointed in sheriff Napier for removing ice from the jails and um I just think you know putting the community at risk to um somehow curry favor with these three members of the board who have already proven\nWhat they're going to do I mean they have jerked him around um and from the beginning you know they approved it than they voted against it then they you know they vote they initially didn't get approved then it got approved in February and then in September they come back and and not approve it again\nAnd then they have now established a committee that has oversight over the sheriff's department it includes ACLU members and a lot of these individuals who are on that committee have been in the board meetings are calling sheriff's deputies racist accusing them of targeting\nI mean I was sitting there and I finally asked the sheriff what is your response to this\nIt ... it was outrageous and it's outrageous to have to listen to this every week\nUm I don't believe any of that\nAnd um you know they've got individuals' on there who clearly have an aversion to law enforcement they don't want law enforcement and and this is a going to continue and the board of supervisors in my opinion I have been dealing with them for six years and maybe mark thinks he can\nNice his way to a solution with them\nI don't believe they can uh like you said Richard ... has already come out and he's already said this isn't good enough\nUh and that's just going to put more pressure the the flipper on that says we're among valid as\nHe's the guy who keeps going back and forth and that's going to put more pressure on him in and Isabelle Garcia and the ACLU are going to continue to threaten Ramon with recall\nAnd ah what was that what's happening oh yeah they uh they threatened Ramon valid does with recall and in the meetings and they come right out and say it and uh so we're mo\nGoes back and forth on his position on this and I don't believe he's going to be able to hold strong he's already proven he's flip flop three times\nSo he did this is the first time hearing the valley so we in these meetings yeah we're we're ... years there and you have and I'm assuming he's an easier you members and his ... yes I Am going around\nThat comes into speak a and called the deputies racist et cetera when Ramon valid does a and the first meeting you know they they came in and and it was a no and when he came back and voted yes it is they were saying they're going to we're going to do a recall\nAnd that's what they do it's intimidation and Ramon succumb to it in in September it was pretty clear why would he bring it back after seven months of approval\nOr because they're scared you know they're scaring it that they're going to do a recall on him and this is how it works and Pima County and one of the things in the last board meeting\nI'm I ask the county attorney Andy flag I said so what is the board of supervisors authority\nAnd unfortunately I didn't get the statutes but I Will get those from them and he said uh the board of supervisors had budgetary authority over the sheriff's department as we all know as long as we don't interfere with the sheriff's ability to carry out his duties\nAnd it's my opinion this is clearly interfering with the sheriff's ability to carry out his duty now as far as grant money there federal money the board of supervisors technically is uh that the entity that is authorized to accept those monies\nBut since this is in my opinion a pretty clear case of interfering with his ability to carry out his duties\nI Believe that the sheriff needs to accept these moneys and legally challenged the board\nUm he can't allow them to interfere with his ability to do his job this is just for step if he allows this they're going to continue eroding his authority and um I Will tell you this happened with the county assessed sir\nI'm the board and the ss or weren't seeing eye to eye on some of these tax appeals and I'm not saying I agree with the ... positions however\nHe pushed back they'll staples he pushed back and he threatened to sue us\nIf we interfere with his duties and right now he's pushed back so much that the board of supervisors is now doing part of his job he said you review these tax exemption waivers which is part of the ... duty you just said\nThat's I'm I'm making you do this now I'm not going to do it and the board has not sued him they've left him alone and they backed off and this is what I Believe the sheriff needs to do\nUm he's got to establish boundaries with them and it totally does that he's going to see a these members of this committee and and and Richard ... is going to continue poking and ... away at his ability to do his job\nBecause they don't want law enforcement they don't want 'em uh the borders they don't want the border security and that's why you see all these resolutions against or anything that President Trump does\nSo it you know I just think he needs to legally challenge them and that'll be the only way that he's going to get this resolved and and not lose his ability to do its job\nSo how would have worked in the valley Miller Pima County supervisor ... how would it work what do you just get up there and see that's it ... and if you guys don't like it to me\nWell he would have to um he'd have to consult with an attorney and just um you know push this and go to court he's going to have to um establishes authority because they're clearly going to continue eroding\nI mean they now have a committee with ACLU and it's about Garcia and and people or you know having oversight over on the sheriff's policies\nUm and I get it it's a good idea to get employed if people have a problem but to have them having oversight yeah\nAnd um you know if I were the sheriff I would've said no I set the policy for my department\nI'm willing to listen to people that have grievances I Want to hear input however I Am the authority that sets the policy for the department and I think pandering to these people is not going to get him anywhere and and you know and and like you said he did go out and make the case for why he needed ice in the jails what has changed\nI have to change that all of a sudden it uh they don't have a nearly as many I guess we'll aliens as they thought they did on mine did you did you write that did you look at that before you rode your your mental that yeah it's ... months ago\nI mean and and if that had happened you can imagine the national media would have been down here and all over this I Believe that majority up\nAll of them are doing their job and carrying out there and and working under unbelievable circumstances every day and they did their napping back very back\nAnd and what I what I hear in that board from it absolutely disgusting that that we have to sit there and listen to that week after week and um I like the more people in that community mark deputies coming in and saying that's not true and we're sick of being label\nOn it it drives me crazy you know why are we allowing these labels to be put on their race is that they target\nThey're accused of targeting people but yet no one comes in and prevent any of it and no one has ever come in and have filed a sheriff's rate court or a ... a three part of any\nKind of a of the memory of Christine forward that's what it is yeah you
