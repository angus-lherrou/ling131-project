Sharma road cheers Sharma said that\nGlobal investors have never been higher on American exceptionalism they're betting more\nOn our American success isn't going to be of the economy now more than ever before three things I think you need to know there is some breaking news as well or Nikki Haley has resigned\nAs the UN ambassador\nA President Trump is going to speak they say in about twenty minutes we'll see if we can carry some of that or or get highlights of it at least a showman Nikki Haley is resigning and no idea why but it's happened it is what it is um\n[noise] you know this is going to interrupt the president's probably most important thing of the day which is working lunch with Kanye West which I Love by the way\nUh maybe she's burned out\nAct CEOs really quick has this story they claim that Haley discuss her resignation with Trump last week when she visited him in the White House or her news shocked a number of for senior foreign policy officials she's on a really good job\nReally good job of course they are trying to act as if the media is especially ... dot com trying to act as if there's some animosity there because Nikki Haley wrote an op ed in September um\nChallenging the New York times anonymous op ed and she showed I don't agree with the president everything when there is disagreement is the right way and wrongly to address it I pick up the phone call him or me with him in person\nWhat's wrong with that\nIf I disagree with some something and I believe it is important enough to raise with the president I Do it and he listens\nIs never good management supposed to do\nLike my colleagues in the cabinet and on national security I very open access to the president he does not shut down his advisors and he does not demand everyone agreed with him I can talk to them most any time and I frequently do\nYou know versus when Bill Clinton was in the White House by the way and he made the FBI boss sit outside he didn't want to be briefed by him he made them sit outside you'd want to deal with them\nWas Monica debriefing them well in a different way yes she did definitely be briefing but that's\nVery good very good uh by the way\nI'm going to bring this up you remember how the media likes to say that Trump's going to have blood on his hands because of the the rallies that he has and the people that are just you know scream CNN sucks they boo people and they give Jemma cost of the finger as if that's violent and stuff like that you know you know right I mean\nThat's what they do you see the giant double standard when you have these maniacs paid and unpaid protesting maniacs primal screaming banging on doors chanting you name it or they are acting like the animals that the media hopes\nHopes that the people that Trump rallies acts but they don't act that way ever they have no right no nothing they have no reason to ever say anything negative they will of course I'm\nHowever uh they they should never ever ever\nSay anything about the way Trump\nSupporters act especially at rallies mean comparing what happens at a Trump rally to what actually takes place or outside of the Supreme Court this past week today whatever it might be it's not even night and day it's two different games not even a same ballpark things sport\nSo these these these members of the media just nothing but gigantic hypocrites gigantic hypocrites and\nIt's I you know I Hope that everybody else just see that because they'll just sit back and say if ah they started\nSharing about the NFL players or whatever they ... people are just terrible it's terrible they're terrible know enough is enough\n\nSo I just wanted to point that and nobody else really saying that I mean the the one sided ridiculous coverage of how a Arab Brett Stevens the rhino used All right for the wall Street Journal New York times he is the folk conservative right or the New York times he put\nOut that article trouble have blood on his hands there'll be a journalist dead it's like they want it to happen\nSo well they can say see we told you show yeah yeah no heck no\nAlright so based basically a nobody knows anything as to why Nikki Haley resigned but the media has to fill up time on TV and they're going to stick or they're gonna stick people on there to speculate about nothing and nobody's going to be correct so I don't want to do that\nThat's that's that's just me I'm now let's talk about some other stuff um [noise]\nWe have the mix Sally situation which I think is a big story and we can get your reaction to this again Martha mix Sally apparently having a hard time finding a basement Martha make Sally and and I hate to say this you can't vote for the two two and you can't not vote for either of them if you don't vote for Martha that's the same thing as a vote for the two two here since ...\nSo\nEnough is enough and I don't want to hear it that and I normally do I mean we can argue on the air if you want but you can't sit back and tell me that Martha you're a huge fan of Martha and she's doing a great job she's a great candidate if she literally has to get people\nFired up and bring in George Bush and Mitt Romney to do it's George Bush's brother was the odds on favorite even when Trump jumped into the game and George Bush's brother was knocked out by South Carolina\nYeah South Carolina and that's when George W Bush's brother Jeb Jeb exclamation point said I'm Out I'm done\nI'll never forget the debate when Trump said Jeb you keep up with him you keep moving further away from the Senate staging closer to the edge pretty soon you're gonna fall off it's exactly what he did these guys hate Trump do you think it's a good idea and we had a great call an hour ago\nWhere it was a great observation he said you know what I don't like that Romney and Bush are coming out to out Mick Sally you know if you're a Trump supporter piss off you're like really still who you're going to side with the are you going to be on board with the rhinos an establishment the goal of global lists where you going to be on board with the Trump stir\n\nBut he said I think that the trumps the Trump supporting people here in Arizona realize\nNeed to vote for him and Sally just because Trump needs to not have send them in there\nMaybe there are a whole bunch of never Trump or is up in the Phoenix area are they're really that many\nThat many never Trump was up there that she needs to really get Romney and Bush up there to try to tell them you need to vote for Martha and who is bringing these are the you know and the former president and the guy that never one president who's bring them in gym click\nA is is organizing this as well as a Carolyn Carolyn Jackson right from the uh um the the famous ... what is it the the auto show Jackson Barrett yes a Carolyn and Craig Jackson\nSo that's what's happening there are Tobar Nineteen Bush's will be hosting a private fundraising breakfast in Scottsdale Romney's going to speak in the east valley they're trying to get the Mormons on board that's for two thirty PM\nUm wow it's going to be in a three days falls event centering Gilbert\n[noise] you can't you can't tell me that uh\nThat ... I mean I I hate saying but she's just a bad candidate\nYou're not excited to vote for you excited to vote for Trump to give Trump another another person and their another vote that's that's all you're excited for\nSo again I Can't stress enough all those things that's on TV the so called experts they were so wrong so wrong about this with Kelly Ward who just be a weak candidate she'd be terrible she can't have that Republicans are worried should be worried they got to bring in\nThese two establishment rhinos become get people fired up who's going to get fired up about that anyway seven

Christine forty ... if you don't believe her you must you must not like any women and you were against and you don't believe any victims it's just like the same thing where if Mitt Romney comes out uh it's like you know what he's going to tell every more sorry\nUh every what you just said what the ... member of the church there you go what to believe\nAnd and that's and she's written there's got to be a whole bunch of ... listen I got my time constrained right now oh bunch of Mormons that actually like Trump\nAnd don't like Romney there's got to be yeah right I mean what it is who cares listening there are so many Jews politicians and a scratch my head and say hey how are you thinking what are you doing you know it\nIt's it's it's just it's a slap in the face slap in the face I agree ... thank you for sharing man I appreciate it rather thank you man you too Bye bye seven thirty\nNow in ... seven Ninety um apparently I guess a President Trump is going to a uh is going to speak soon
