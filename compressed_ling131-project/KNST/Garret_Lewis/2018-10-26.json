S. N. B. C. and it's\nBased on NBC News data analytics lab did analysis of party affiliation voting so far right so\nA less than two weeks out from election\nDay they tweeted out this is very important\nLess than two weeks out from election day more than eight million people across the country voted early\nIn the midterms more than a million you ready for this Republicans are outpacing Democrats nationally a change compared to two\nWeeks out from election day and twenty sixteen so an election day in twenty sixteen when Republicans held\nHouse held the Senate and won the White House\nWe are getting a better turnout in the midterms two years later\nWhat does that say does it say that\nThe blue wave what blue wave is there a blue wave why would there be a blue wave who cares about a blue wave\nThe fact that we actually have more Republicans voting at the same point\n\nNow than we did two years ago in a presidential election that is that is incredible or at least a higher percentage\nOkay October twenty fifth twenty sixteen\nTwo weeks from\nWere less than two weeks from the uh the big election right that the the twenty thousand so October twenty ... twenty sixteen forty five percent of dams early voted at that point thirty eight percent Republicans and Seventeen percent on\nOctober twenty fourth of this year forty four percent\nOf Republicans forty percent dams where the early voters forty four Republicans forty dams sixteen other so you have a six point increase in the day and the Republicans and\nA five point drop in the Democrats\nAnd its Schweikert like it's not polls\nNot polls\nWhat it is is actual facts of who's getting out there and who's voting who's registered who's going to vote that's what it comes down to and it seems based on this at least for this right here this is the actual voting numbers was returning to balance that kinda stuff\nUm what it means that there is obviously a lot more enthusiasm to vote for the Republicans and the Democrats\n[noise] crazy isn't it crazy\nI retreated that yesterday and um there should be a big story and apple was the other way around you know there'll be like the big story across the country do realize I had the bomb thing I get it whatever the vague about what whatever\nThose things are a but\n\nThis is something that you probably would not um you wouldn't see you wouldn't think you would see based on the paste past Eighteen months of listening to the mainstream media now of course they do spin this\nThey do spend this\nIt says ms NBC News story while the initial early voting numbers could be interpreted as a good sign for Republicans\nThey should be approached with caution for example not much early and absentee vote has been reported yet in some democratic strongholds such as the west coast\n\nSimilarly the twenty sixth and comparisons provide some context but comparing the current election to previous cycles can never be an apples to apples comparison [laughter]\nThey have to put that spin on it you do realize that right they have to do it yeah I Know the uh the packages who is known what the hell these things are\nStill don't know\nNBC News more NBC News you're reading\nSome of these packages were never capable of exploding\nNBC News reporter quote some of the ten suspected now twelve mail bombs address the high profile Democrats and others over the last few days were flawed and not capable of exploding isn't that break before they yesterday from Adam how's only think I did well others have yet to be fully analyzed in some cases the flaws substantial and others more subtle\nOh\nInvestigator said it wasn't clear yet whether the devices were hoaxes or simply cases of bad construction\nMhm\nYeah bad construction would fall hoax no matter what nah I don't know how to construct must have fooled\nBut at the same time why would you go to all this trouble if you weren't going to do with the correct way unless you wanted to just do what you just change\nThe narrative right yeah change the narrative just\nJust throwing it out they're changing that it seemed\nTo buy I don't I don't think so it seemed by yesterday afternoon try it\nBut yeah yeah but yeah

fifth twenty sixteen about two weeks before the ... election or two years ago right forty five percent of the early voters were Democrats\nOnly thirty eight percent of the early voters Republicans Seventeen percent others to about two weeks before the election October twenty four twenty Eighteen couple days ago\nRepublicans are forty four percent of the early votes Democrats are just forty percent and other he's sixteen so Republicans\nWent from thirty eight percent of the early vote to forty for two years later Democrats drop from forty five to forty we're out pacing the early voting and Republicans are now actually in charge Republicans never actually led\nNever there was never a time when Republicans were ever a having a more early votes and Democrats in twenty sixteen and they're already doing if they're already doing it this is incredible stuff [noise] I Love it\nEight eight zero ... a barrel five six seven eight if you'd like to talk about it I got some stuff sent to

deported two months ago and now he's on his way back because there's no wall to stop him no all by the way Trump tweeted out\nJust a little while ago Republicans were doing so well in early voting and at the polls and others bombs stuff happens and the momentum greatly slows\nNot talking politics very unfortunate what is going on Republicans go out and vote\nHuh\nYou also to to an hour ago the United states has been spending a a billions of dollars a year and legal immigration this will not continue Democrats must give us the votes to pass drawn but there are laws if not we'll be forced to play a much tougher hand\n\n... and by the way this is the situation right is the situation ah from Fox News\nPresident Trump is considering a sweeping executive order that would block migrants including asylum seekers from entering the U.S at the southern border try to stop them\nOr if they go ahead with this measure it would do regulations restricting certain migrants from seeking asylum\nRules would effectively block most if not all migrants who are taking part in the caravan Fox News learner you proposal originated out of the White House is one of several being considered no final decision has been made\n\nSo we'll find out of course it would probably be challenged um but it says you're any attempt to block\nThe Central American migrants is likely to prompt legal challenges though Trump is likely embolden following the Supreme Court ruling\nEarlier this summer that affirmed the president's right to bar entry or the injury of migrants who quote would be detrimental to the interests of the United states and that was part of the uh the terrorists ban\n\nSo how about that how about that and we're still waiting to get more information about apparently one man has been arrested in Florida or being the suspect in the mail bombings\nI Can't wait to see this oh I Can't wait eight eight zero can't as the eight zero five six seven eight are now just so you know also here's the Nielsen had some very revealing things to be said a very revealing thing I'm let's play one twenty uh she's on Martha McCalla\nYesterday on Fox and she's and this is what's crazy lawmakers I Want to make this clear lawmakers could actually change the laws you know we can deport if somebody comes up from ... there are Mexican they come across the border we can deport them in minutes hours\nCan't do it with Central Americans for some reason because that's the law why is that it should be changed nobody in Congress is trying that's what Trump says he got to change the laws that sort of this year we go\nFor ... in general to understand how that's the case\nI think back to ... thousand uh it was primarily Mexican about Ninety percent ... percent a Central American area that matters because they lost to France or Central America\nToday that will cut ... percent escape all we could if they can have the right to be here we can repatriate them with our within hours are now it's ... here's a case scenario if they're not paying twelve over three thousand gays [laughter]\nI said a lot of change that the court cases a lie it's sort of like having a hand tied behind my back I saw the same as the Congress has to have it at ... at\nThat sucks it should be changed nobody wants to change or McCain everyone on change of flake never want to change it make salad I mean what can somebody just changed that particular part make everything equaled doesn't matter where you come from we have the same laws for everyone that crosses the border illegally\nCrazy isn't it right\nWe have more to play from Houston you'll see and I have more to play a from people on CNN that are ripping Trump seeing it again he is all he is causing these pipe bombs to be delivered his
