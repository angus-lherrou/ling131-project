to think it goes well once again as you did with Obama way back in two thousand eight\nRun as you did a with Hillary I think he just you just cut through something really important I think we should describe this year the mask came off yeah\nI think it is I I I I think what's interesting\nI don't know I I definitely feel momentum the polls are showing momentum we now have if we go through all the states is a very tight race how old is up by who out in Arizona mix Sally believe it or not is now what by six this was before the release of these tapes which I Believe is definitely going to hurt\nIn the case of of course in cinema Marsha Blackburn is up by eight in Tennessee that it's such an important race Ted Cruz has rebounded in spite of all the hype the bait or working all the money that prone against Ted Cruz\nAnd it's such an important seat Claire McCaskill is down Heidi Heitkamp is down Joe Donnelly is down and I think tester is vulnerable in Manhattan I think there's a lot of

that happening and that many states you're not going to get a blue wave in the house\nI mean that they're the same voters of the same people and and the tide is not there but but there's something else or you just said that I think's really important uh and again I'm I'm thinking out loud with you so because you you trigger the reporting you're doing is triggered this in my own thinking I think our folks start shifting towards humor [laughter]\nI I really mean is I think you could take\nYou know I mean here I Am I'm I'm throwing this hard punches like yeah I'm I'm fighting as hard as I Know how to fight and then you had any just put your foot off the gas and tell a joke you\nKnow no no no I Want you to put your foot on the gas even more of a number as Reagan often proved sometimes humor

I Can't ... I think there should be over now\nBut they let us on the first thing we should say ... why would you want to be the senator from the meth capital of the world I mean if you believe the stuff he said why would you want to represent people are crazy what what's wrong with you\nThey bring to life you know I never really\nI think I think we should we should accept they really are who they are\nI accept that and I also another thing that the there is no more moderation you know the history of relationships even Tip O'Neill and Reagan I mean those days are long long gone and the era of moderation or a scoop Jackson Democrat or even Joe Lieberman got thrown out of the party\nMr Speaker the pretty much says and all that with one of the nice as human beings ever\nYou cannot be a moderate Democrat today and survive a and and a big because it's getting more and more and more isolated\nI mean I thought it was very telling that the votes on Kavanaugh you had people who might have had a better chance of getting re elected but they couldn't break with their caucus\nOnly want to do with their donors\nOnly one person and then I give him credit Joe mansion ... probably ... ... you know I'm sure he got the help me out of them by Chuck Schumer and company\nThey were desperate for him to not vote because they didn't want it to be bipartisan and that's what his vote to\nWell I mean I guess that means he's strong and he's like you're not going to ruin my career because you because of your radical left his agenda maybe it'll even think about becoming a Republican it'd be wins and that is the one seat that seems safer red state Democrats the only one now this\nPoint I think that's right I think and and it really even Asia and if you watch the even when he voted for governor the numbers narrow the race was closer today than it was a week ago because I think what's happened is people hooked up and suddenly realized what a team sport this is\nThat you got two teams in and there's a really simple question for every so called moderate and I'd say this I Would also says to mention that she was really going to vote for Schumer\nAffairs question everybody needs to be asked that question that's a Democrat\n'cause if because we've got to vote for ... why would why would West Virginians send somebody to Washington to take power away from Mitch McConnell in the neighboring state mean McConnell least understands West Virginia\n[noise] humor as contempt for West Virginia as Hillary Clinton has contempt as just recently in two weeks ago you know you add I'm Nancy Pelosi saying things that were contemptible although ... is the question will be posed to to mention is\nWhy are you even running I don't know if I go to vote for him or why run\nYou know when you look at things that have been said and I mean just in recent times I mean the the idea of smelly\nWalmart boaters or or we can't be civil or\nJoe Biden saying in September of the Trump voters of the ... society\nOr era de mobile deplorable ... or ... bitter people\nClinging to their God guns bibles in religion I mean it's pretty obvious where these people are you you haven't had a chance you have to see the bread is an office beat the undercover video project ...

I think without a doubt by the way one of the things you've got a notice this week you notice the market went down it's a up a little today but went down in the past couple of days and it was triggered by interest rates stuff but in the meantime I had some analysts telling me\nThey're afraid of the Democrats taking the house of representatives and\nThey would want to raise taxes again they would stop Trump from doing all the good things that he's done a regulation to visit with the economy and they would want to raise taxes again and that would cost jobs that were slow down the American economy and you've got an economy now that's really growing at about four percent higher than any of the expectations\nAnd what they're really afraid of is that Nancy Pelosi could become speaker again I agree with you showing that the Republicans are going to pick up Senate seats in the Senate seats looking really good because of what happened\nWith the backlash of about the whole having a hearing in how unfair it was and you can see we had to pull this this week where I'm McCaskill was losing to Hawley the Republicans for the U.S Senate\nAnd the ... on also Joe Donnelly is now down write and write and Heidi Heitkamp is finished she's down by double digits\nRight we have polls there because of the the energy sector is so important to the state that you're seeing that you're seeing these these polls um you know people want chops\nAnd what's scary is in the last three weeks where you're going to decide is if you want the economy to keep growing or do you want do you want it to slow down your policy to raise taxes take what you've got take away the jobs take away the pay raises\nAnd the vast majority of Americans don't want to go back to that I mean we had polls in September with were Nancy Pelosi has fifty five unfair will among all voters she has she has the fifty three percent unfavorable among independent women\nThat the independent women are going to decide this election and and they don't want to go back to the way things work before Donald Trump took over and started to drain the swamp and get things moving again for the country\nSo these house races you're talking about\nOverwhelmingly most of the ones in play a Republicans those Republican incumbents or the or the Republican or a candidates in the in those open seats\nThey're the ones who are going to vote to keep lowering taxes to keep the economy growing and basically to stop what you saw the last couple of days where you know the smart money on Wall street saying hold that she's if she's going to be speaker and\nThey're going to oppose the president's ah ah agenda they started selling off I mean it'd be a disaster for the country\nDoes shown 'em I honestly don't have a feel yet for the house but I think the Senate you have to have been looking very good for Republican pickups I think ah when you have thirty three races now that will that will actually tipped the balance one way or the other in the house of representatives a little too close for comfort because\nAs somebody that knows Nancy Pelosi I think that would be a worst case scenario and we'd have endless investigations and impeachment and higher taxes and\nAnd you know it that they want to get rid of ice that won't fund the border wall et cetera it's gonna be the same nonsense all over again with them\nWell I my sense is that the house is still a in democratic hands where the election today though it's getting closer or the real clear average has gone from a thirty one or thirty two seats for the Democrats to twenty six twenty seven so it's moved the same direction as the Senate races but not quite\nAs far and I would have to concede much as I Would like not to that the Senate races have moved decisively andme interaction\nKavanaugh had a lot to do with it\nYeah I Do I think they are really two realities there's the reality of the world that we live in on the east coast and west coast and the reality of the rest of the country\nThought that a lot of what happened to him\nYeah I'm kind of like an island in the middle of that east coast I'm not the rest of the east coast I don't represent the values of New York\nI have noticed yeah which is a pretty hard core left wing said even in a Governor Cuomo doesn't even want me in the state did you know that I didn't know but if I've got I got taken it no he actually said those conservative\nThat hip hop and it's not me into stem cells are streaming or write to\nMe was when it comes to me that there are actually are conservative you know certainly noticed that it's not a\nSimple number one Hans within a rifle no one can\nUh I'm right to life I'm pro Second Amendment uh and uh although I don't I'm libertarian on people's personal lives I think we ought to lead people to hell alone um so but there's no places for me in the state\nOf New York you said it himself when that happened I had a bunch of governors Florida Texas North Carolina South Carolina all calling and inviting me to move to the states I Want to take them up on Mr shown that would be governor and everything you love and vote for one's me out of town\nI speaking for myself and wanted you to run as an independent for president I think had you run an Alabama one of your old stomping grounds Doug Jones would not be a senator and I would be happy to be part of the bipartisan\nTo keep Hannity in New York or to promote Hannity\nOffice would like to run for I think my friend John and I can ah John ... well you disabuse our friend Doug the very notion that I can win any office I don't even think I could win dog catcher\nI I I think look you're still the kid from Franklin square you're still you're still have with your working class roots\nAnd Andrew Cuomo is trying to make you move out to join because New York that's our biggest export is is the people on taxpayers of New York state we send them to places like Florida and Tennessee in Texas where they have no\nNo income tax and no state income tax and they have jobs but by the way Doug fold than out on us because his client right Doug you still work for a a former mayor for New York Mike Bloomberg\nRent I heard it oh yeah yes I don't I ... I tell you you know people are speculating he might run for president but Andrew Cuomo is clearly afraid of him because he's moving so far left\nTed it's unbelievable he's gonna get whiplash\nBut but I don't even think I don't think they'll make to get through Mayor Bloomberg could get through a Democratic primary these days because they're so radical\nAnd that's my point about what's going on right now the country's realizing\nIn the next three weeks what's at stake is this is the most as Sean says the most important midterms in our lifetime because you really have a clear choice from a country that's gotten back it's got its footing back where the economy is moving while we're stronger in the world\nAre we we we are basically the heartland is feeling that people are paying attention to them that the swamp is being put back in its place that that the average person might have something to say about how their lives are going to be governed have control of their own healthcare for\nBut if Nancy Pelosi becomes the next speaker she\nWe'll be the most powerful elected Democrat in the country she'll be the national face and voice of the Democratic party and that is just frightening\n'cause it let me tell you something we're not just friday is a frightening Republicans Doug shown does not want this do you\nDo oh I Want democratic candidates at all levels in the house to say I will vote against her because that's the way to get votes in these marginal writes absolutely like she should go period and start\n[noise] well my to my way of thinking what they should say is ... no impeachment of cabin on no impeachment of Trump just to work on issues like a compromise on immigration compromise on healthcare and continue choice in education\nNow let me tell you if they if they would listen to that which they never will because they're not a moderate party that would absolutely pretty much wrap it up by the house in my opinion\nI agree Sean where I'm the same page John Dwight happier support to work with Sean when\nWe find a state or a nation for him to run in for the highest\nCould operate we can go to John Doe to yes or no he could run down when Jeff\nOr do
