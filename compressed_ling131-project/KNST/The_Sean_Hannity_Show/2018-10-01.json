T.\nThe New Yorker piece this is by Mr Ramirez and remember even the New York times couldn't go with that story they had reported that they interviewed several dozen people\nIn an attempt to corroborate her story they couldn't find one person with first hand knowledge and then they reported that Mrs Ramirez herself was contacting former your classmates asking if they were called the incident and told them pull some of them that she could not be certain Mr Kavanaugh was the one who exposed himself\nAnd that's what they're saying and remember she admitted she quickly became a ... she had gaps in her memory foggy slurring of words\nSo that's what the Democrats are citizens are credible allegation well if it was so incredible why didn't they ask judge Kavanaugh\nWhen he sat in front of them last week 'cause they they they they all had the opportunity to delve into anything they wanted to delve into and they chose not to\nThen we've got the the third incident which is the ... case where a woman claims that routinely almost on a weekend basis and she had been the ten of these parties herself personally\nThat there was Brett Kavanaugh one and a bunch of ... kids that\nWere drug ... girls and then lining up in the hall waiting their turn to rape innocent girls\nAnd a a whole series of allegations he looked at as as Byron York said the gold polls\nHave moved very very far away very very quickly and all the people that but not just going to be a week limited scope no big deal just an FBI investigate you want to clear your name right you'd want to clear your name right judge\nIt's not about clearing his name it's about giving them more time so they can come up with more allegations and it doesn't matter at the end of the day Democrats do not even want a vote on judge Kavanaugh\nAnd they want to continue the smears the slander the lies the mismanagement character assassination frankly the political blood joining of judge Kavanaugh and his family now as evidenced by now remember\nDianne Feinstein had this for six long weeks she had this back in July\nThere was a California state or California congressman that had it early July and then they went to Dianne Feinstein Dianne Feinstein on two separate occasions was meeting with judge Kavanaugh\nThen of course we had the original hearings and not at one point that Dianne Feinstein ever mentioned professor Ford\nBut while she was meeting was privately she was simultaneously recommending lawyers to professor Ford and one that was eventually chosen was Deborah cats and she is the lawyer that represents professor forward but which is fine but she has a history of\nOh challenging Paula Jones and supporting Al Franken\nSo in other words she's radical left political the attorney is and so anyway they were emails sent out we just found out late last week of a friend of this attorney for professor for this Deborah cats woman and she was in the hearing she was sitting to the right\nA professor Ford or to the left on your screen if you were watching the hearings\nAnyway it goes on to say that friends emails were sent by a friend of Deborah cats the lawyer representing professor Ford recommended by Dianne Feinstein and they were soliciting women to accuse judge Brett Kavanaugh of impropriety\nAnd this is what they were sending out last week where we just need an FBI Barry expeditious very quick very limited in scope they were they have been and continue to be on a fishing expedition\nNow the emails were obtained by the Washington Free beacon seeking corroboration from classmates of cabin all about your book and trees and gang rape and one email sent\nA late last week delivered to roughly fifty alumni of stone rich school of the Sacred Heart an all girls school near Georgetown Prep with the subject line corroboration needed\nNever cats need to find people who are familiar with what the slang terms were used by break cabin on his yearbook page meant and the devil's triangle and the F F F F F\nA wording in there if you can speak to any of these are willing to sign an affidavit please contact us\nThat's a fishing expedition and that is ... this is what the Democrats wanted the delay for\nNow if it was truly limited in scope\nAnd we know that in the case of professor poured that they were four people she mentioned we're at this party\nSome don't remember ever being even her best friend don't remember ever being at a party where Brett Kavanaugh was at the end of the you know that when the perjury I mean ... under the penalty of a felony here so they all signed these affidavits they all agreed that the that they didn't have any recollection\nAnd the the most difficult part of it is is professor Ford identified an eye witness to the event\nThat I witnessed his said under penalty of a felony that it never happened what professor Ford is claiming and this is professor Ford who put mark judge in the room at the time of the alleged incident\nSo I'm not sure what the FBI really can do in this case beyond see whether any of these people are going to admit that they committed perjury and gave false statements that ... there's nothing else really left for them to do\nPlease use your voice you will not get a second chance this letter goes on to say\nI mean well this point you're you're pretty much just soliciting\nYou know randomly anybody took ... please please come forward and then the hope is that there will be delayed again and again and again and you know on top of that than we've got you know what was supposed to be limited in scope what was supposed to be done expeditiously in a week\nNow is turning into because they can't get anything else at least not that we know of yet who knows what Dianne Feinstein knows then the only thing they've got is well did he commit perjury about the amount of alcohol that he drank\nYou know did he really black how would anybody know if he blacked out\nThat's the only he would be able to tell you if he blacked out now he admitted to drinking to liking beer liking beer a lot still liking beer drinking too much beer you know being intoxicated he admitted to all of that\nWhen he was in high school and college which not all that uncommon let's be honest about it and so they're trying to say well he didn't he do we know we had to a blackout was an I worked as a bartender for a number of years I Know a lot about alcohol I watched it up close and personal\nYou know everybody's got a number for some people the numbers to and after two they lose for some people I there were

suggesting well if you don't talk to the FBI is pretty amazing to me you know just to use his exact words from his op ed refusal to most people will speak to the refusal to do so is its own kind a statement\nOf the problem with that is if you don't remember something perfectly with the FBI and you're talking to them it's\nA crummy it's a felony\nAnd if you don't believe me asked General Flynn\nAnd if you don't believe me asked Papadopoulos who pays five years in jail you know the idea that yeah the FBI back in the middle of it you know you're screwed that's what you know when I was handed the Clinton email investigation the deputy director said to me you know you're totally screwed right\nWell maybe you shouldn't have been writing in may before you interviewed Clinton and before he interviewed any of the others Seventeen witnesses maybe maybe you shouldn't have been writing the exoneration before the investigation\nYou wasn't screwed up he did it right\nIs it there is no

is\nAnd then lying about top secret classified special access programming information in a mom and pop shop bathroom closet for the very purpose of the void in congressional oversight it's the kind of a slam dunk case\nAnd anyway he goes on to but we live in a world where the president routinely attacks the FBI because he fears it's work no\nHe attacks the upper echelon of the FBI you missed their

let's see let's let's go out and solicit people\nAnd see if we can find people that are willing to say something horrible about Brett Kavanaugh because maybe that's the way we'll be able to stop the nomination we've got to delay like we wanted now we've got to be able to get everything that we want Newt Gingrich has a great question is there even one Democrat decent enough or disgusted enough to end this cabinet travesty\nAnd he joins us now Sarah how are you welcome back to the program\nI'm doing well but I was very struck this morning by Byron ... column in which he points out that the Democrats having decided that sex may not work are now looking at whether or not Kevin all might have been an accurate in describing how much he drank so they're spreading a wider\nAnd frankly in an age when Justice Ginsburg was very political\nAnd some attacks on President Trump Democrats are trotting out\nJudicial temperament of this whole thing is it is character assassination it is I think tremendously bad for the country uh and it is it tells us who they are I mean I think the key to the election this fall is which America do you want to be do you really want to be an America\nWhere somebody could live a decent life for thirty five years have two lovely daughter is a good marriage\nAnd then get smeared on ending lady was totally uncorroborated sauces that seemed really the America we want to become\nYou know the judge was honest as could be said I like beer I drink beer I drink beer then sometimes I drink too much beer\nHe denied ever blacking out I mean the accusation that somebody could observe similarly had the blackout that night um I was a bartender when I was Seventeen and Eighteen years old and I've seen a lot of drunk people in my life\nAnd I couldn't tell you whether or not they remember the incident the next day and it wouldn't be me in the position of saying that\nWhat they're doing is they're moving the bar this is what you're saying the goalposts now are being literally moved every second every hour of every day and now that we have people working on behalf of the Dianne Feinstein\nRecommend the lord lawyer Deborah cats and sending out letters saying ah we we need more people um it sounds like they never want this to end and I don't think there is going to be a Democrat to answer your question that's going to be decent enough or disgusted enough to end it\nWell let me try to be very clear from it because I'm I'm frankly very disappointed\nIn the judiciary Republicans up just denying reality fact is this is nothing to do with traditional government this has nothing to do with the Senate this has nothing to do frankly with judge town\nThis is about a militant left wing group willing to lie assassin H meaner cheat I mean when you when you have when you have a mob that goes into a restaurant\nTo harass Sen Cruz when you have to women who break into a an elevator to harass or senator\nOver and over and over again which you have on the left his willingness to break the rules to get what they want\nAnd I think that is a very serious problem\nYou know it does raise a lot of questions because at this point I don't think we're going to go back to high school years\nYou know when people talk and I watched a lot of there's this weekend you know two commentators actually saying this is Sean Hannity could have given the speech\nAnd I'm thinking okay um how is one supposed to act when they're falsely accused of literally drugging women and boys lined up or halls all over the course of course of many weekends\nAs the boys can then take their chance that gang raping women and being a participant in that I don't know what the significant or normal reaction would be for me if you're innocent it would be righteous anger and indignation that that to me would be the normal human response if you're innocent\nRight well let me let me let me play historian from it because I spent the weekend thinking about what we're living through when\nYou know Cory Booker says you're complicit with evil if you support Kavanaugh deceiving example you're getting you know what am I Blumenthal who as the president was pointing out is terrible record of overtly publicly lying about having served in Vietnam when he didn't\nKnow suddenly he's lecturing us on the importance of honesty and integrity [noise]\nAs I thought about it I went back and found a the following quote from Abraham Lincoln which he gave at Cooper Union in New York City and Eighteen sixty\nSpeaking about the defenders of slavery who are prepared to destroy the union\nHe says quote your purpose than\nPlainly state it is that you will destroy the government unless you be allowed to construe and enforce the constitution as you please\nOn all points in dispute between you and us you will rule or ruin an all events close quote I the reason I brought that option is I really believe that's where we are\nI think on the left you have people like Maxine Waters who remember if they get a majority she chairs the committee\nShe's not some random back bench not take she's a senior member of the Democratic party leadership and she has publicly saying that people you go out and find members of the Trump Administration you harass them in the stores you harass them at the gas station you harass them at that at a restaurant what kind of countries that\nWell they're telling everybody to do it now they're out on a fishing expedition in what they promised last week which would we both suspected they just\nThey just want to stop this no matter how they end up doing it um when you are but the point is\nI think you're right but I also think that there's there's got to be a choice that has made here by the American people because if you can smear and lie and slander and bludgeon a guy like Brett Kavanaugh and go on these fishing expeditions and you're not even hiding what it is\nNobody is ever going to want to serve in any capacity in government ever oh not that we want\nPeople should remember when you get to the total attorney and history of the left if they can do to count and all they can do it to you that can do it to your daughter they can do it to your son\nI mean this is what happened to the Duke lacrosse team a total liar total fabrication\nTrent over a year as a cloud over these young men who had done nothing and so you turn around and the left is is very adept at this they believe in bowling they believe in intimidation they they don't think the truth matters what matters is power and I think\nNeed to understand this election is a choice about which America we're going to become it's much better choice in just the president this was literally about are we going to reward people who are just destructive and who are willing to cripple their own country in order to get power or are we going to repudiate them\nAnd insist on people frankly are getting us results and if you think of

I'm sure they were it was either find people because they already had been interviewed by the Senate Judiciary committee look the the the goalpost are moving faster than the speed of light here it's it's very difficult to believe that any of these people um\nIt it can take themselves seriously they said\nIt's going to be four days a week and now they're going hot an artificial that's fine you know they were saying\nThe FBI the gold standard there impartial there you know she works at that at every Democrat that now they're going up the Trump is evil puppet master controlling the FBI are actually going to be as horrible partisan organization you know it it it\nIt is and it would be laughable if it wasn't a man's lifelong reputation here on the line\n[noise] take your mind that are doing\nTwo weeks ago as far as everybody else knew Brett Kavanaugh had an impeccable reputation that is now that's gone forever you know re Donovan famously one said after being investigated for a year and a half where do I go to get my good name back mhm well in this case\nI I don't think Brett Kavanaugh ever gets ... and many many ways I mean Clarence Thomas will ever be remembered because of the last minute accusations of Anita Hill\nYeah it it it's very discouraging although I have to say I I Do get some on it you know someone who clerked for Justice Thomas and knows the why he he you know there are certain ... ... people who are going to just simply use that as their excuse is counted the name of this couch them because they disagree with them anyway [noise] um\nAnd he is someone who does ... incredible amount of respect on the bench judge Kavanaugh is a kind of person where even when he was on the DC circuit as a lower court judge the Supreme Court\nSaid it saw him as someone to really take seriously you know more than a dozen times they spoke to fourteen different times they've found now they've indicated his opinion they had a huge amount of respect for him I don't think that's going to change I think\nThey are not going to be watching this with the same knee jerk or part is in response as I Hope that that that we're seeing some some of these people a hat but but it\nUp you know the parents to do on a reputation now if you read James\n... New York times piece that he came out with the ... to me it's absolutely sunny\nAnd the things that he's saying because while the FBI's pack in the middle of it when we handled the Hillary Clinton email investigation while he was writing an exoneration himself prior to the real investigation which didn't happen until three days before he publicly exonerated her um\nBut then he goes on to trash the president at length\nAnd then he talks about FBI agents are experts which they are and interviewing people and quickly dispatching leads to their colleagues around the world to follow up with additional interviews\nAnd they will confront people with testimony and other accounts and you know yes the alleged incident occurred thirty six years ago but FBI agents no time has little to do with memory um which I found a little strange um and then you know for example everybody remembers if it rained on their wedding day\nUh I don't think that's a political in that particular sense maybe to somebody who is traumatized by could see that but for somebody that's not traumatized maybe not\nUm once they start interviewing every witness knows the consequences he says is one thing to have your lawyer submitted statement on your behalf it's very different thing to sit across from ... special agents and answer their relentless questions\nOf course the bureau won't have subpoena power only the ability to knock on doors and ask questions most people will speak to them but there is what he says refusal to do so\nIs its own kind of statement now I Want to just address that because my FBI friends my friends in the ... in the bureau special agents have all said Jimmy never ever\nTalk to the FBI unless you have a lawyer ever and I'm like why I'm somebody who loves the FBI I don't love the upper brass under Khomeini and the cave instructing page but the FBI is is the FBI people I Know what those soul to the earth people and I sort of course I'd want to help them he goes no\nAnd then they say look what happened to General Flynn General Flynn is accused of lying to the FBI and the up here I didn't think he was willing to them\nAnd it's just it's dumb to ever talk to any law enforcement without a lawyer that's what all my law enforcement people friends say because it's a crime if you lie to the FBI let's say you said something in the Senate Judiciary investigation and it doesn't exactly match up\nYou could be charged with a crime of lying to the FBI it's ridiculous\nAnd you know the the irony that says look his his company's coming MO right now is just to try to destroy Trump with everything he can and his mother another section in that play book but the irony is the exact same federal law provision that says it's a crime to to lie the FBI is the one that says it's a crime\nLie to the Senate and they're with their investigators it's not just you know a similar penalty is exactly the same statutory violation so that's just not they've been kind of pretending they're ... that I guess playing a little bit on people's images maybe from the movies\nOf what the FBI does to say that they somehow it's going to be a separate different thing what they're really doing here is there going down the same list to people the Senate Judiciary committee has already talks to\nThey're getting the same statement in some cases they might get exactly the same thing because the FBI can't ...\nCan't force them to talk to them especially if all you know as I don't remember that I wasn't there they they couldn't be dealing with taking the same\nExact statement from the same lawyers for the same the same individuals could that's ... that that is all we can no ... just because of the nature of this old investigation so the FBI isn't going to find anything new to hear that there there's my prediction\nThat morality IRA and that they don't have any other thing\nThey've already moved on I guess the ... and and that's the one that came out in the New Yorker piece and you know ... that's the one we're even the New York times that said they attempted\nTo interview over the course of a week several dozen people they couldn't find a link to one to corroborate a story and then saying the mist Ramirez\nContacted former yo classmates asking them if they were called the incident and told some of them that she could not be certain Mr cab and all was the one who exposed themselves which at that point tells me you know what do they investigating here if she's asking other ... she's telling other people she doesn't know what are they investigated\nThe more shocking thing is eating right and it's you know right before\nThis whole um ... most recent face exploded I think it was the morning on of the vote she actually her lawyer was telling people she's not even sure it with him she said what part of that he was in the room\n[laughter] I'm positive he adjusted his hands whatever that means that so but I but I Can't say for certain to get hit it and so it's even after talking to her lawyers for six days to kind of work up\nA her memory that she didn't have when she initially talked to the to the New York New York or could they also said she couldn't say for sure he was there when they initially talked to her I I I'm I'm a product or even counting the credible allegations of the you know what go for the FBI could talk to her\nUm they'll they'll get their statement and I think it's\nIf you look at the people out there than I don't make any conclusions and they don't make any recommendations they'll just going to give very handover the information that's it the the three ... and\nMaybe we'll get those three oh two we've been waiting for thrilled to forever as it relates to Bruce or and and Christopher
