Lance Armstrong is formerly strip them seven Tour de France titles the one from Nineteen Ninety nine to two thousand and five and banned for life from competitive cycling it was a dramatic fall from grace from the one time global cycling icon to inspire millions of people after surviving cancer\nThat's your look back at this week in history\nOut what I just know what I saw here is apparently what Jim Acosta is tweeted it's apparently legit\nAnd I'm Sorry I don't have time to show you here so I set it up to cook\nSomeone is gonna get hurt or worse if these mobs don't stop what they're doing now the moms in the case as I was talking about you know let's through the prism of what\nWe know today suspicious packages pipe bombs that had been sent to Obama in the Clintons apparently and and CNN and\nOthers um how many times yesterday on this program it was a story about George Soros apparently some divisive but putting his mailbox and I listen what did I say about George Soros yesterday like they have it on tape let me see what I said yesterday when it broke when the storm story broke\nApparently an explosive device was found near at George Soros says home and his mailbox the New York times reported\nIn a billionaire left this global list George Soros doesn't like Sean Hannity any funds a lot of groups that will love this show to go away\nI Want to be clear with everybody this crap has got to stop\nThis crap has got to stop this is you know we we have an election and Thirteen Days and on almost I\nYou could see this building and building and building and building Rand Paul was very outspoken somebody is going to get killed\nI was the person saying during the Kavanaugh hearings hey we we got to clear the halls this ... one of these senators is going to end up getting assaulted or worse\nYou got to clear the halls you can't let these activists you know getting in the faces fitting it Lindsey Graham holding up elevators screaming at Sanders\n... when you can't let this continue but there's it's obvious what's gonna happen to somebody\nAnd and I haven't heard any of my colleagues on the left warning that this is a bad thing I didn't hear a lot of people on the left all that upset that Sarah Sanders and her children were run out of a restaurant and then they go to another restaurant and they were followed over there for\nCrying out loud or the video of secretary Nielsen ... sitting and eating a meal\nAnd these left wing lunatics screaming at secretary Nielsen till she asked to get up and walk out of the restaurant we have the video of Pam Bondi who's going to a movie for crying out loud and what she had to go through with a left wing mob\nAnd then of course Senator Ted Cruz and his his wife\nHeidi they go to sit down at a restaurant there run out right and they get right in your grill right in your face\nYou know it's an amazing thing that they keep doing this to women or guys that are with their wives it culminated this weekend is now the fourth time that Senator McConnell has now had to deal with this he's just sitting in a restaurant with his wife Elaine Chao there just eating that's all they're doing\nHe's not working is on his off time some guy comes literally right up to the table to bang on the table\nAnd then ... rips off some of the food from the table opens the restaurant door which is adjacent to the seat where Mitch McConnell is and throws the guy's food out in the street\nAnd then start screaming at the top of his lungs\nAnd then of course Kevin McCarthy's office gets it with a Boulder busting his office window\nAnd I didn't hear anybody condemning any of this certainly during the Kavanaugh hearings nobody on the left said a word about their leftist activist they love the pressure that they were putting on Jeff Flake and and other people there they didn't say pie and Feinstein wasn't speaking out\nLindsey Graham getting spit on nobody speaking out\nThese incidents that have happened to these conservative women's I I don't see the coverage hour by hour second by second\nYou know but if Donald Trump calls the news media fake news and they do give you fake news\nThere is some truth to fake news and they just hate Trump twenty four seven you should've seen the yesterday the graphics because he said I'm not a global Islam I'm an American first nationalist well does that mean that he is or racist ... you know is he a white nationalist no he said he's a national list\nAnd his policies of the irony is all of the failure and the disproportionate failure under Obama's policies towards African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans and women\nIn the workplace they wouldn't just disproportionately impacted by the horrific policies a bronco balmy sat there for eight years did nothing to curb the violence even at his own home city\nWhere people are dying now you have a few famous people that have had these suspicious packages that had been sent and let me be very clear you know\nLeading up to this I have been saying this is not going to end well\nSomebody's gonna get hurt\nI don't want anybody hurt\nI don't want any Democrat hurt I don't want any Republican hurt I don't want any American her I don't want anyone in a caravan hurt\nIt ought not be crisis precipitated at the border because Mexico allows people to march you know three thousand miles up to the United states you want to avoid confrontations like this if you can so we had a pipe\nBomb suspicious packages sent to the Clintons home and chaplain claw similar package to Obama's home one to CNN New York headquarters\n... and apparently the one yesterday George Soros his home in Westchester New York suspicious package center Debbie Wasserman Schultz his office they're investigating one that might have gone to Maxine Waters office\nYou know with all the rhetoric from Spartacus get in their face holder tech them they go low we pick up\nHillary Clinton we can't be civil with them unless of course we win\nYou know Maxine what did she say get a crowd if you see them you get a crowd you follow them in a restaurant sing department stores in gas stations and you tell them they're not wanted anywhere anymore\nWatching it happened to all these Republican does any of this you know we don't know what the intentions are a lot of people are speculating what the intentions are um you know let me be very clear I Know I Know first hand what all of this is like\nMy thoughts and prayers go out to anybody that has to deal with this today\nI've had similar incidences of security in my life you know Linda\n... you know somebody that we both care for very very dearly a girl that worked for us for years she's been on the radio occasionally you know remember when we had the white powder scent the Fox news\nAnd she literally had to spend an entire eight nine hours in isolation\nBecause we thought at the time it was anthrax that was sent I don't get packages anymore my life uh and and far worse in terms of threats it's sad but if you're in the public eye this happens more than I Will disclose here it's not about me today\nBut I Know many other conservatives that have had the same thing happen if you go back just three weeks ago maybe people born is alarms that was it was from the minute the news\nBroke this morning the media's on Wall to wall with reports of suspicious packages and you know that were sent to the Clintons Obama Eric Holder is another one and\nYou know I think it's a huge story I Do it's a scary story\nIf you go back just three weeks ago how many ...\nLast month

Obama and holder and Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the Clintons the assumption is that this is political which by the way is\nProbably you know some fringe person out there somewhere or it could very well be and and obviously the temperatures been hot\nAs we've been hearing Democrats say they can't be civil and kick 'em and we watch mobs confronting Republicans all over the country every day and not one Democrat that I Know is spoken out and said stop attacking Sarah Sanders secretary Nielsen\nStopped confronting people like Pam Bondi\nStopped confronting Henry Kissinger stop throwing boulders through the office of Kevin McCarthy\nMaybe even watching this on a regular basis\nYou know it's a very scary thing for anybody to have to live through\nUm what's amazing again is to watch the professionalism of our law enforcement\nI mean I've known people on the bomb squad and on the NYPD their their absolute finest in the country as they did their work today and and we've had no incidents so far at all we don't know if they're alive we'll get updates from sure throughout the day\nNow the president says we cannot tolerate these cowardly act so strongly condemn all of those who choose violence first lady said as much as well\nThe president said the safety of the American people as my highest than absolute priority\nSo the full weight of our government is being deployed to conduct this investigation and bring those responsible for these despicable act the justice we will spare no resources or expanse in this effort\nAnd I just want to tell you that in these times we have to unify we have to come together and we have to send one very clear strong unmistakable message that acts or threats of political violence of any kind have no place in the u._s._a.\nAnd he

C. N. D. C. I remember getting a call from\nTom Brokaw cause producers I'm In and this is what that reminds me of however uh people have to keep in mind right now we don't know if these packages these devices are real\nUm you don't know who sent them what the purpose was um we're going to hear about a lot of false alarms and the next\nTwo days perhaps um but I Would and and I think Dan may agree with me here I Would predict given that they found these devices said and they got that without that they that\nUh I predict they're going to have somebody they're going to have a target suspect with the next two or three days\nWhat makes you think that Bernie [noise] [noise] well ... when you detonate stuff or you know you blow to pieces gets harder\nTo collect the evidence that you could send who uh who runs ... a machine right so now you have a package it's so uh the mail or the stamps were writing the device ... side they're going to break this stuff down\nWherever how long it took to find the Unabomber remember that case\nYeah but you know what Sean tons of different times of different technologies get for no mailing list of those different chairs and there are so many packages ... who's a this is a benefit to the law enforcement right now\nIn other words they have more packages and and look on the surface it would look like the ... gene okay it's going to Democrats it's going to a liberal CNN that might people might think well this might be\nRight off the top of their head that first suspect would be well might be some radical conservative but we don't know that we don't know anything right now\nYou know and and there's a lot of the way I wouldn't even call them they wouldn't be a conservative they'd be an anarchist if they were\nYeah I mean this is going to be condemned as it should be by everybody I mean no one set devices are no don't when with a straight face acceptable in polite conversation and sent the vices violence on public officials and anyone who does\nUm is a moron and Savage I think there's a period full stop there but with regard to the Unabomber thing Sean you're right it it it takes them a long time but remember what the Unabomber\nHe was a little more tactically of strategically devious he would send those bombs and it'd be an extended period of time between each one where he actually developed\nA new kind of a you know let's say ways to put those in construct those bombs to get it was very difficult with this they're basically you know ... ... nations whoever this was may have done this\nSo it's going to be really hard for them not to have left behind in any of these multiple devices\nAny clues but there's a part of me that believes Sean that\nThis person or persons um wanted to be caught I mean some of the stuff is amateurish on I'll give you a quick example I mean one of these devices since the CNN was addressed the John Brennan\nWho does that work at the end I mean it's hard to figure out you just go to the Internet and you could figure out that John Brennan and then you know it'd be the comedy is not a CNN 'cause sure this is just basic stuff I mean I think about it if you were a enough of the Savage in an animal to want to hurt someone or hurt someone in the mail processing facility\nYou think you do like basic homework like that so it's very amateurish the construction of it um from my experience and this is amateurish as well and\nYou know I agree with the a former commissioner that's I I think it'll be a matter of a few days before someone or or a group of people are caught I Hope they are but\nEverybody hopes they are um and you know usually these things come in rapid succession a commissioner and I would expect that that might be the case here although it seems to slow down so down at least for today\nWell listen you started on Monday was Soros right when you add a number of these things come in today we'll see what happens to borrow a like I said we're also going to hear a lot of false alarms in the aftermath of the truck subjects in New York City\nWhen he got ... ridge just in New York city\nThere were hundreds and hundreds of false alarms of the next two weeks\nSo we'll hear about that but um you know I I agree with that I think within a couple of days\nUm they're going to have a target or at least you know somebody they're looking at because there's just way too much here um that's been captured\nWouldn't you first be looking for some radical fringe we\nOften after these for example school shootings find that people telegraph what they're going to do ahead of time and I've got to assume here that maybe that would be the case as well that this was some type of radical extremists that that maybe doesn't like certain politicians or could it be and were Harris I mean you just don't know right\nNow given the right one your your analysis of the school shooting is absolutely correct the secret service did an exhaustive study on that Sean and that is exactly what they discovered\nThat a lot of these people engage them this targeted violence even political violence political assassination that's why the secret service ironically got into analyzing school shootings through the national threat assessment center they found very similar patterns of behavior that telegraphing which you just described directly so\nSo it wouldn't surprise me again given what I see\nBased I going to have an obviously have an adult size\nThe vices but having seen what the press is put out and went to the media they seem to be\nA very amateurish devices that they've almost

bony fraud wire hypocrite from Tennessee you got Claire McCaskill the pony lying hypocrite manipulate ... trying to manipulate the voters in Missouri and Heidi Heitkamp will be a super liberal but she's not going to tell you that until after the election\nAnyway project beret toss it CEO founder James O'Keefe strikes again how are you\nA showing great to be with you and yeah this is number three it's it's more of the same this Heidi Heitkamp director in Washington DC campaign office\nUh speaking candidly about when she gets elected she's going to go really hard left she'll be quote super liberal unquote at that point so he's describing the bait and switch that once again the red state Democrats have to do in these battleground states to get elected\nWhat's so amazing is that consistency here is that is that they are telling their staff one thing they're saying things privately that they'll never said publicly\nIn the hopes that they came basically lie to bamboozled whatever term you want to use the voters in their state in the case of brothers and even calling the people tendency ignorant in the hopes that they'll get that seat and then they'll they'll be a a basically a Chuck Schumer senator for that state\nYeah just so that your listeners if you haven't seen every video\nA video in Missouri we did where where they were talking about Obama's using Claire McCaskill views and the staffer says Obama and the ... will have the same views and everything but quote people just can't know that well in this video this video released last night on your show Sean there's this another guy Gordon is his name he's the staffer\nIn and Heidi Heitkamp Fargo North Dakota campaign office and we and we see an Obama poster in the office there's a big one of those are the Obama looks like the messiah on the wall this big poster\nBut then they took it down right before the press came so we asked why did you take your mom poster down and the staffer says well because the presses here and and we take it down when the press comes is what Heidi Heitkamp staff saying so it's more it's basically the same thing in each of these red states\nThey have to mislead they have to do the moderate voters and play the progressive base well we just have them on tape saying it we all know that Heidi is is liberal but\nShe's going to be somewhat liberal once you get selected that her staffers are emphasizing it here and they also say that she's not going to run again so because this what Jesse Overton says in the studio quote she doesn't want to run again social just do good work while she can which means that she'll do the things that she can't talk about right now\nIt's just so revealing but I I think this is really this is not an accident that you're getting very similar responses and every place you have now gone\nI mean these are three big huge massive Senate races and you have caught three major Senate candidates all admitting that they ... they're lying to the people of their state to get elected\nBut I Would argue that it ... represents the entirety of the Democratic party we now know because Maxine Waters told us that are parties told or they don't want me to say it they want me to stop saying it but I'm not going to stop saying it impeach forty five ... well that's it yeah but\nIt's ... it's particularly true in these red states there's a there's a kind of a story here that we found that were confirming suspicions that ... that's what we do it very tossed we confirms suspicions\nAnd we've always known this to be true but my point is just have integrity\nDoes it it's not really left or right thing\nI was at this first them and conference with all these big hon chosen media\nWho were ... you know very cheering and and hearing it and I just have integrity this is about just doing what you say you're going to I think it's more pronounced in the red states with these Democrats running because they have to lie to the moderate they have to work with the moderates and that and they could only make one choice once\nWhat he did not have a choice it's lying is this a purposeful misinformation propaganda campaign 'cause they have no intention of doing what they say they're going to do\nThey have a very different agenda the people working for them know that they have a very different agenda and so they're really just lying manipulating I mean it is the worst of the worst in terms of politics\nBecause there's an open contempt hatred and a feeling of superiority that Claire McCaskill has that bill Brett isn't hasn't Heidi Heitkamp as towards the people of their state Penn well they\nDo it's so hateful Sean that Claire McCaskill has asked for a special prosecutor to look into me he asked\nA marketable about these states we've already have them are getting a little bit more we still want to cover people in play is the ... in it and they're supposed to represent their states their constituencies but they say they don't they say it's all about Schumer it's all about the national wave we don't care about our own people in the states that are going to the next week\nAll right great work project bird toss dot com James
