dying to find the right person okay what give me your best shot\nAt the bottom line is if they really cared about the issue as they said they did well then Cory Booker would be under investigation because those allegations made about an assault this weekend about am never mind what he had already admitted he did on his own\nOn top of Keith Ellison he would have been investigated not one of the these Democrats have called for an investigation\nI don't know if any of its true the person that seems the most credible here is this woman Monaghan who recently dated Keith Ellison it was his girlfriend she's got tapes and and doctors' notes and\nAnd uh apparently some maybe even video of him a verbally physically emotionally abusing this woman\nOr people of Minnesota paying attention if

any indication we may be seeing a bigger\nRepublican turnout than anybody anticipated oh jeez opposed\nMight be wrong again I just don't trust these polls don't trust these people that make their predictions\nYou know I follow I I look at it I factor it into what my thinking is\nI actually think that we should act right now that every race every Republican is behind\nAnd know that if the Democrat wins for the house that that's a vote for ... staying home as I have a vote for below sea and in every important Senate race be at Florida\nOr be a Tennessee or be at Missouri or be Nevada or be at Arizona or Montana or North Dakota or New Jersey even or Indiana that they're all winnable\nNo there's no scenario would unfold one week two weeks from tonight that I could be surprised

nearly five million dollar judgment now he's been a victim and apparently from his LA office for non payment of rent\nA good week for him and he wants to run for president\nOne of their success you won't hear in your hate Trump media Wall Street journal today media continues obsessing over whatever they want to talk about but Chancellor Angela Merkel the president referred to this last night at

[noise] [noise]\nWe can't let this happen\nTo me ... is President Trump's words moments ago on the thousands of migrants heading from Central America to the U.S border with Mexico\nWe've got to do several things than I Am you know adamantly against illegal immigrant people have to stop employee illegal immigrants come up to west Chester showed is\nThat they can Nassau County stand in the street corners and in Brooklyn or the Bronx you're going to the world's if people waiting to get picked up and go to yard work in construction work and domestic work you know this is not a problem that the people who are coming into the country are solely responsible for the winter is coming if we put them to work\nMy proposal\nAnd it will include a path\nTo citizenship number of immigrants added to the labor force every year as a magnitude not seen in this country for over a century if this huge influx of mostly most co workers provide some benefits recounting me as a whole it also turns to the press further the wages of blue collar Americans and puts a strain on an already overburdened safety net immigrants\nAre the principal reason wages haven't gone up there are those immigrants' rights community who have argued passionately that we should simply provide those were illegal we would legal status or\nAt least ignore the laws on the books and put them into deportation until we have better loss but I Believe such an indiscriminate approach would be both on wives and unfair it was suggested that I was thinking about coming here legally that there will be no repercussions for such a decision and this could lead to a surge\nIn more illegal immigration\nRight amazing how they sound just like Donald Trump joining us now former speaker of the house author of the best seller Trump's America the truth about our nation's great comeback us Newt Gingrich is with us or how are you\nI'm I'm doing great and I'm and Omaha today for the Republican Party of Nebraska and I you know I'm very very optimistic about how this election is shaping up\nWell I'm Glad you there do me a favor I think uh one of the biggest mistakes I made in my life in terms of supporting somebody disappoints\nIs a guy by the name of Ben Sasse Ben Sasse had his way Hillary Clinton\nWould have been at the president the last two years she would have made the two Supreme Court appointments none of the bureau bureaucracy would have been removed we'd have open borders we would have Obamacare on steroids\nUm but he was never Trump her now is blasting made a new book trying to get me to talk about it so that he can sell copies when he hasn't passed a single piece of legislation with his own name on it alone\nThat he sponsored sorry it's personal point\nI get that that's personal but you know the fact is the never Trump or his are a fossilized group that are less and less relevant I mean it was every passing month\nThe president's support from the Republican Party goes up uh I Know this this extraordinary rally in Texas um [noise]\nI don't know of anybody\nIn American history who attracted as many people to as many different rallies as Trump has this year\nI was just an astonishing achievement and I think it does very well for the impact that he's going to have on both this year's election and on two on two thousand twenty\nLet's talk about what do we do about this caravan [noise] you know they're ... by foot they make it in what\nThree weeks three and a half weeks but one thing that I think we both agree on is that I don't want a crisis precipitated at the border because Mexico is allowing this caravan to march through their entire country\nAnd we have no choice but to guard our borders because it's our sovereign land and I wear a nation of laws and I don't ... and in the process\nSays the people on that side of the border that are not respecting our laws could they could precipitate a crisis where innocent people get hurt and I don't want that to happen\nRight is that better so so now you understand psychologically what Abraham Lincoln and went through\nBetween Eighteen fifty eight and um the spring of Eighteen sixty one and he says again and again you know we do not have to fight as soon as this this was you know you aren't going to choose\nI said I'm not going to choose on I'm going to defend the constitution and do my duty but I'm not choosing to fight\nBut if you give me no choice I Will have no choice and I think this this is I think\nOne of the great chest that President Trump is going to face because\nHe he I mean yeah I talked to about a person the other day he doesn't want anyone hurt\nYou feels this very deeply on the other hand he has sworn to protect the United states he has sworn to uphold our borders are and and I tweeted this morning says it hit me this morning if if the president is serious\nThe Mexicans only have two choices then you can deal with the caravans now in southern Mexico for when the president blocks from entering the United states\nThey can deal with them in northern Mexico I mean if you ask yourself this simple question if they literally can't get across the border\nThey're stuck in northern Mexico\nWell and I think our our position to be the next you know just decide whether I Want us to deal with them now he wants to deal with them when they turn back the border but under no circumstances\nShould we accept them and that shouldn't be powers done some brilliant legal work on the fact that the president has the authority\nTo block aliens that he deemed should be in national threatened always going to say it doesn't have to defend his decision to say I deemed to be unacceptable for national security reasons\nAnd they're blocked\nNow in all likelihood I don't think it's going to get to that point my guess is at some point because of the economic connection that Mexico needs with the United states that they're going to have to step in here somehow in turn this caravan around how they do that I don't know\nBut the reality is either by the way and I do have compassion I understand people in\nIn Central America El Salvador Guatemala Nicaragua or that they want a better life but this is not the way to do we have a process by which we have an immigration system and we're a sovereign country you don't get to you know create a crowd and rush the border\nAnd my fear is if they get to the border that we could be a potential outcome that's not going to be good for the people we had the wall Mr Speaker built this wouldn't be an option for them if we had the wall we would have that would be no risk of anybody getting hurt on either side\nRight but the number in the near future the next few weeks\nOur policy should be to hope for the best for planned for the worst\nI think the worst case is pretty simple the Mexicans end up with their own political reasons doing nothing they decide that they expect Donald Trump to Cape and so there is going to let you know as many thousand people just want to enter the United states\nWould they haven't thought through is what if he doesn't have what if he does call out to the military what if we do in fact creating affect IQ human wall and block people from entering the United states\nNow and I'm actually going to have what what could be by Dan is much she's ten or Fifteen thousand people because they keep growing well there was one report yesterday from a newspaper in Mexico that said it's already ballooned up to fourteen thousand\nRight so so part of what I'm saying is at this at that point\nWe we have a real decision to make and then there's just this is what Lincoln as saying over and over again yeah uh you know if you're going to preserve the union you're going to do whatever it takes to preserve the union\nAnd he didn't say it happily he didn't say it excited we met many of his key early speeches and there's no ... sadness to the\nUh the we're bound together by the common core of mystique memory now we have no reason to fight each other a and he's almost pleading no don't do this well I Would say the same thing here this dishes\nPerfect crossroads to make the decision\nAre we prepared to defend our sovereignty and to defend America or in the end and people blocking U.S forces to cave\nIn guilt us into allowing them to invade our country because we don't have the nerve to stop to\nAre we got to take a break or I Want you to weigh in when we get back on what the next fourteen days are going to look like what you think Nate Silver is a prediction and much more of a former speaker of the house Newt Gingrich is our guest eight hundred million for one shown as a toll free telephone number later on pastor Darrell Scott David limbo we'll check in and much more\nListen for more than three years there is a software there's been a software vulnerability\nIn the Google Plus social media network unwittingly giving third party developers potential access to use his private profile information\nAre they expected more than four hundred and Ninety six thousand users have shared private profile data with a friend and that could have been their data that is an access by these cyber criminals\nGoogle says no evidence that there's been any misuse of that data but in today's digital connected age you don't know you've got to protect yourself your good name your reputation you don't want credit cards and loans taken out and you're a name you don't want people robbing your bank um retirement accounts blind and ruining your name and reputation\nNow the way to protect yourself and your family is the all new life lock identity theft protection now with the added power of Norton Security it protects you against threats your identity and your devices that you can't see or fix on your own\nIf they didn't have a libertarian in Indiana they win that race for sure but they got a good shot beating Joe Donnelly in Indiana if people don't vote libertarian I'm On the house side it's very hard to get a feel forty retirements does it make it an easier\nOne of the shuttle bus right but I think eighty eighty percent way too high\nAnd a little surprised the silver or for the second cycle rose going ... um you know most recent survey indicates that in fact\nYou of 'em in the very closely contested districts and this was an NBC survey or that they actually are within about two points on the generic ballot\nWell if if that's in the contest districts now we're losing the Democratic districts very badly we're also not spending much money and then we're not campaigning and I'm we're not making our case a but but in the swing seats that matter a we actually are basically tied on the generic ballot\nAnd and all I can tell you is\nI I look at the issues that are going to matter ... things happening you see this a little bit with Stacey Abrams or in in Georgia the candidate for governor who explained today that she's opposed to free enterprise and health care because she she hates making a profit and you never do any good if you make a profit um\nAnd and she is just very left wing cinema the Democrat in in Arizona for US Senate\nRefuses to

I Would I ran into\nUm what's his name Blumenthal the Connecticut Senator\nAnd when I was in Washington ... during the Capitol hearing said he was a total jackass during those hearings it was coming out of where I was going in\nAnd that's what senator Sean Hannity how are you we had a very cordial conversation if he was sitting at a table I Would never I might go over and say you know send a

know I listen I train five days a week an hour and a half maybe martial arts and they know this well it's a it's it's not going to stop crazy people\nBut I got to tell you something I Will walk I Will

associated with that and but most people age don't know how to defend themselves and be they're going to react like that's just not then they're going to get past and somebody's going to get hurt\nI couldn't agree more and it is a danger for people in the public square and especially people who hold themselves out as Christians whether your pastor or you have a Christian themed blackout you really gotta be careful at it but we do anyway we need to\nBe civil and and when some people on Twitter ... and our other interactions but I don't think that means we don't fight I don't think I mean we don't uh communicate our ideas as passionately and as intensely as the ... that it just means we don't have to get his dirty as they did\nWell I look I don't know I I we just had Newt Gingrich on and pass to what he was saying is between Cavanaugh I mean all these American\nValues that have have served us so well due process presumption of innocence and then you see that there was no core operation any of these charges\nIf the Democrats really cared about the issue they'd be going after Keith Ellison right now demanding an FBI investigation and Cory Booker will be having an FBI investigation and Claire McCaskill's husband would be having an FBI investigation\nAnd Bill Clinton would be in jail for the rest of his life\nBut they're obviously playing politics with with very important issue so the hypocrisy there but between Kavanaugh the mobs\nThe caravan that's happening and the fact that we've had on paralleled economic success\nFourteen state record states record low unemployment record low unemployment for African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workplace are vets record low unemployment youth unemployment lowest ever I I'm hoping that people factor that in in fourteen days when they vote or if they vote early\nI think the man on the street will factor then I don't think the people on the street are stupid Democrat or Republican\nThen that stupid the party leaders are stupid you know but the man on the street they're able to see this process that they know that Kavanaugh was that whole cabinet issue was a sham they see the hypocrisy of the left on full display they know that this a caravan is not\nSimply a random occurrence that you know a a all these unconnected people just randomly decided to all walk thousands of miles to America to look for a better job they can see the orchestrated now some people are going to vote the party regarding this\nBut the other the say listen I'm tired of this because all of the nonsense seems to be coming from the left and the very behavior that they pretended to criticize they put it on steroids and emulate it so you know they said well we don't like the some of\nThe behavior the president during the campaign but you say they have it to another level and you're you're propagating you're out of Cleveland, Ohio\nOkay you're a an African American conservative you took a lot of heat for supporting Donald Trump out at the results are in\nAnd we're seeing all of these jobs being created for the people will get a picture over there that's the forgotten men and women of America that's what that's what twenty sixty was about for me the Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps the eight million more in poverty after Obama's eight years\nNow we've got four million jobs created eight million fewer people in poverty and on food stamps we have four hundred thousand manufacturing jobs that Obama sober never coming back\nWell the president didn't get credit when you break down boats demographically with the black community because they're never doing better they've never done better\nThank God he's going to get the votes you know a ... in the Bible nicotine was came to Jesus button night and there are a lot of ... diem is and they say listen we see what Trump is doing we embrace with Trump is doing is not what they told us that waking up and you know if they say is thirty six percent approval rating\nAt twenty or thirty percent to the fifty six six six percent believe me his message\nJust rent cream tell him his message was moving the black community I\nCome from a traditional democratic family years voted party upper black ... in my family and our sphere are now so ... to it that they're either going to not vote at all which is which is really go for it would do with the conservative movement or they're going to vote with us\nBecause they're starting to see that this was a charade here you know the media constantly but right and President Trump for no reason they've been doing it all day today CNN blacks used to go and get their news from CNN the politics um CNN MSNBC that's starting to see\nWe got to get in the trenches we've got to figure this out so we're getting a bunch of calls from people saying hey\nWhat's going on houses going how's Trump doing this how can we help on this particular side he's going to get off the black vote than any other Republican president\nI'll throw this day but if if we all believe in in God the father Jesus is okay and I think all of us here do\nIf we believe that that we all believe one thing and that predicated on that he created every man woman and child on this earth we agree with that right okay yeah so in that sense where\nBrothers and sisters we're all Americans to right and if we really believe that in every human soul God put some talent some ability\nAnd our goal is to to create an environment where that that talent that natural talent flourishes ... the word or\nEducation from the Latin isn't due to bring forth from within\nThat tells you that God put it there our job is to put enough sunlight of water on something make it grow and help people and that's what I see Trump's doing and it's and it's now hitting the forgotten men and women David that's a great story of the two years at Trump so far\n[noise] yeah yes and and we want to get that what Trump is trying to do when he says I Want to make America great again it means to restore its founding principles is Judeo Christian founding principles which is based on the idea that we're all created in God's image and that's why we have an alien Abul lights it flows from that\nBut I think the leftist authoritarian by nature their economic coercion can lead to political coercion and that's where they are and I I think the left is losing it because they don't have any ideas that worked and I don't have any proposal so they're frustrated and they resort\nTo identity politics and changing the rules and this identity politics\nDividing people on the basis of race and gender\nIs every four to four years at the same thing rich versus poor versus young black versus white a rat race a sexist massage in this Tacoma ... Lama foe but they weren't dirty air water they want to kill children and grandma throw over the cliff\nBut also they also hold eyes up to ... yeah and then one of the polar ice cap to melt\nSean they want to change the rules they want to abolish the electoral college they want to add to the Supreme Court they abuse executive authority they want to abuse the impeachment process just impeached trunk

thirty seconds final last word thoughts today what's gonna happen and fourteen days\nI I actually think that we stay off the um the so called blue what blue way that we might even retain the al\n... and we're certainly going to pick up seats in the Senate We're gonna come close we don't win the house you need to keep it and I think as the pastor Scott ... said well there's so many a minority voters out there who are going to come around the Trump expand that opportunity he's not a racist he's opening opportunities for all people including black\nAnd I'm telling you liberals can't stand this\nKanye and the other people who were defecting from their plantation can't stand it this is exciting stuff it's I think we need to go on a positive message nationalize that these last two\nWeek how how great would it be weaker transform cities like Detroit Cleveland elsewhere where every person that lives in this country\nHas a nice beautiful house in a safe neighborhood a nice car truck that they could afford to vacations take their kids to do is anyone there seven and be miserable uh but but they want to take their kids go out to eat not have to worry about a pastor I mean we all want the same things but it's it's this is universal listed humanity\nYes it is I really believe next fourteen days is going to be critical for messaging as long as I mentioned include consistent also I think that you know they're the script in the Bible says this is no weapon formed against these shell prosper I Believe some of these weapons that they formed against this nation\nI'm not going to be able to possibly even with this caravan I think is back firing I think that a lot of Americans share the same concerns about those caravans regardless of political party this year the same concerns that the Republican Party shares\nRight good to see you both curry and we've got to let you go to thank you so much for being with us pass to go to see when you were in New York but ... you being here
