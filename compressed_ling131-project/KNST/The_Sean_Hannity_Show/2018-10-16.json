Scott this undercover video they got the undercover video the week before about former governor of Tennessee Bredesen Marsha Blackburn is now up by fourteen points\nBecause on that tape it's the same line he'll he'll do the right thing when he gets there of course we don't agree with everything Trump says no not at all do what ... what we're saying we vote for cabinet of course he wouldn't vote for Kavanaugh\nI mean this is all part of a wide campaign propaganda campaign and it's all about power\nAnd it's being exposed at a very high level I mean this is really you know seeing people how they really are is should be so enlightening to the people in Tennessee in Missouri a James O'Keefe is with us She's the founder of project Vera toss\nExposing these senators I you know I watch this and I'm just like what a bunch of liars\nThat's all I think when I see those great job\nYeah Sean this is a pattern you know we really the Tennessee won the Tennessee Senate candidate bread is and you know responded by fondling and bumbling his words caught red handed these are all the staff or Sean inside their McCaskill's office they're all saying essentially the same thing when it comes to Obama\nGun control impeachment they're all saying that we have to do one thing before the election and do another thing afterwards some of that audio is a little hard to hear but\nOne of the most powerful pieces when the sky Glenn Winfrey one of McCaskill staffers explains to our journalist when we asked so what do we tell the moderates ... after we did the impeachment because we're going to have to mislead them\nAnd the guy goes will tell them get over it\nAnd that's the that's the ... it's that this is the other guy next arose field organizer tells us he says a quote people just can't know unquote than the cast on Obama had the same views now I confronted Nick on the street yesterday with a microphone I said why don't you why don't you tell the truth\nAnd of course the reason is and this is true in Missouri it's true in Tennessee is true in North Dakota\nOh some of these red state Democrats they have to lie to the voters to get elected it it's a necessary condition so all we're doing is exposed\nAnd you don't want you know what I'm saying disagree with that point they don't have the lie they have to lie if they want to win\nAnd ... it's a question of whether or not they will put aside any any sense of decency honor honesty and embrace any level of truth and they won't and that's the point and you know I see the everybody on this showing on TV\nIf you look the houses and play the senators and play if you vote for any Democrat in the house you're voting for polo see\nIt'd be a boat for Claire McCaskill or Bredesen or a high camp or cinema or Donnelly or Bill Nelson you're voting for Schumer because that's who's going to own them in control them that's what they're going to vote to be their leader\nWell you know and and Sean and some of these states like Missouri in particular the pro life Democrats and pro gun Democrats used to be a thing decades ago misery with the stalwart when it came to those things but that's a shrinking\nGroup of people and and people like Claire McCaskill half state in order to when they have to or they think they have to mislead\nAnd again this is a Greek chorus of staffers these staffers are not necessarily villainous I suppose there is on us because they're going along with it but they're just telling the truth so it's very interesting to see British and after we play those tapes on your radio last week British and talk to local media this is the kind of the Senate candidate he told all the local media stations well\nAl these these young guys were caught and kind of misled staffers who while they don't work for me when in fact they did he apologized so it's going to be\nVery uh by the way that was a lie to the first thing is that well they're they're just college kids no they weren't actually worked for him\nAnd the guy I Apologize this guy brown who is that the Democratic spokesperson for the brightest and campaign he actually apologize to the media can you believe that Sean apologized\nFor misleading people about our videos so it's very interesting to see how McCaskill's in response now this guy Josh Hawley the Senate candidate that's running against a McCaskill has responded he's tweeted out this video um he's jumping all over it so the question is really interesting thing is because\nWe're going to get him on the program and later this week I mean we're basically following the work you're doing you know one of the question is going to ask but go ahead finish your thought\nWell I was going to say that McCaskill has in the video it's she says of course I'd vote on a ban some type of gun ban and we asked her staff or what type of ban is that he said semi automatic rifles now this is an issue that nobody wants to talk about in Missouri particularly Claire McCaskill so\nWe're hoping that she gives a clear unequivocal answer about what her positions are on the gun issue and that's going to be very interesting if we can somehow get her to speak on the record publicly about this now that we've caught her red handed well\nI again I think that you're rocking the world the big state Senate candidates\nAnd exposing them for who they really are look I've been saying in explaining for a long time now what the agenda is when they want endless investigations although they'll stop the investigations that helped them the ... they'll they'll protect their deep state buddies\nThat conspired to to first stop Donald Trump remember winning and then later to destroy him um and then they will have endless investigations impeachment if they can do it\nThey want their crumbs back they're even saying that openly they're hiding their positions on open borders and eliminating ice they're not talking about really wanting to keep Obamacare under any circumstances and that's what they want to do and stop the president's agenda that's been working so these tapes\nI think expose what's going on in every congressional and Senate district except you don't have the manpower to get every single one but you've gotten a couple of big people are already\nWe've got we've gotten request to do it in every everywhere and we have to be a judicious about where we do it and when we pull people out because I could have gotten more missions if ice but there's you know it's people are already early voting and some of the states and they ... the bigger issue is like I said he last week or the few days ago\nAbout don't lie to the people I ask this guy next to roast when I saw him on the street yesterday said why do you have to why do you feel the need to why why why is our politics so broken that that becomes a condition to having to win the honest because voters aren't going to end in Tennessee this guy just lost\nA new poll out New York times poll and he's down

they paid a fortune\nIn many cases over a hundred two hundred percent more without their doctor without their protections without their plan but there's always one big pyramid scheme from the get go that's all it was from day one\nLike your doctor you keep your doctor you keep your plan oh\nNow the one thing that the Democrats are trying to do and talk about is health care which is somewhat bizarre to me because that is not exactly worked out for anybody\nWhat we have is you know the the the AC a\nWhich is the Obamacare what you've lost with the A. C. A. as people with preexisting conditions have been paying more yep higher premiums and they were paying before many lost the doctors that they loved taxing Americans who chose not to use it which by the way the individual mandate with tax the president has gotten rid of the ... rid of that\nTaxing companies who choose not to elect to pay for what your neighbor needs it was one big redistribution scheme\nNow if you deal with direct primary care direct access to doctors and we've talked about health savings accounts and we also talked about atlas AMD Dr Josh amber and Dr Lee s gross this model now has been duplicated around the country\nAnd what happens is there's no pre existing conditions prejudice at all\nIf you can afford a cell phone you can pretty much a Ford or\nA direct access to your doctor no insurance no problem you pay for what you need fifty dollars a month for an adult ten dollars a month per child they negotiate directly with the pharmaceuticals so they have Ninety to Ninety five percent reduction it'd be a high blood pressure if you have a cholesterol problem you walk out of the doctor's office with the medicine\nTrump got us out of the Paris climate agreement but the Pima County board of supervisors are going to make us by by Eli Miller joins me tomorrow morning at seven had to talk about it on ... the [noise]\n\n\nAll right as we continue back for busy phones Nina is in San Francisco a cast a vote and you know Hi how are you glad you called\nHow to make for taking my car and I'm going\nOn and he could see I'm In California and unfortunately and around it by the crazy people I'm just wondering what are we going to take ... California I don't want ... nuisance archiving I was living in San Francisco when he became a San Francisco and he gets rid of that city\nWas an ... you have a great Republican candidates out there John Cox he's a great businessman his his problem is simple math and sort of like New York city although it's happened in New York City is even happen in New Jersey Chris Christie Christie Todd Whitman\nUm and and then all the other occasions Tom Kaine is another example where Republicans were elected after Democrats make a mess\nI guarantee you that Cox could wind now that the sanctuary state of California wants to put up a sign and say free health care for everybody in the world it's assigned you're basically our governor saying\nIllegal or legal doesn't matter resident non resident doesn't matter we're going to give you free health care\nNow if the average Californian is that is taxed at Thirteen and a half percent statewide on income if you're OK with that good luck to you because it is unsustainable it will bankrupt your state there's my prediction\nBut if people want to experiment with is that you know what am I I'm not there to tell people\nCan't and I agree with you and they had on counted on where the thinking gotta get out of California can't afford to pay taxes on that [laughter]\nYeah I mean it's unbelievable look and why do you think there's a mass migration out of New York and New Jersey and Illinois to states like Florida Texas in the Carolinas wire Californians all going in Texas\nYou know what what are the Democrats on what they're hoping for that California demographic shift so that the people that ruin California and left might do the same thing to Texas\nSo unbelievable which is what the beta O'Rourke has been all about from the beginning\nAnyway you know good luck um I Would say John Cox would be a great start and that was done in the world they'll tell you that on election night three ... three weeks from tonight will take

Fox News hurricane Michael now blamed for at least twenty states dance across to south most in Bay County Florida where the storm roared ashore as a category for as the search continues for any survivors that may be buried in\nThe specific house races that mattered ten a night\nSo that people can tune in and literally see we've also put up an interactive map on Hannity outcome that people can use\nAnd you also see it Christian cinema is imploding out in Arizona project Vera toss with the tape that they release the Claire McCaskill is devastating that she's hiding what she's running on to that same happened to governor governor reticent and Tennessee\nHave Heidi Heitkamp was already down by double digits Joe Donnelly is in big trouble uh we now see Heller was very important seated in Nevada he's now a by seven in the latest poll only said I'm really worried about right now is Florida and Rick Scott just has done an amazing job for the people of Florida\nWell yeah and then the hurricane obviously that that was devastating but but the response next to hurricanes I remember that benefit there in the last year where we're Scott\nHas really shown if you remember Shawn the two thousand twelve election right here in Jersey uh that's where Hurricane Sandy hit and the President Obama had the advantage of\nActing like a commander in chief and going to the devastation while Mitt Romney of basically left helpless and they say that that hurricane may have tipped the scales back to Obama's member Romney at all the momentum in the world are going into that storm so\nYeah look a Jim Messina who was speaking of President Obama two thousand twelve he was the campaign manager\nFor a strobe I'm at that time and he said yesterday said why did Senator Warren has to do her announcement with her DNA now he goes why can't Democrats ever stay focused and I think this Elizabeth Warren revelation or lack there of will only hurt the party further because\nSee how you could ever say and many media outlets by the way Shawn said that this was definitive proof right I'll give you literally the the headlines\nAround her neck and she's Ninety six percent European I mean at that one one thousand twenty four she has perhaps maybe Native American ancestry of some type\nI mean but it is but her she literally personally change herself to minority status when the U. Penn and then at Harvard that she was billed as the first minority\nFemale professor there a Native American heritage that the Cherokee Nation has spoken out and said this is just outrageous they're out there outrage by it\nRight and that was the turning point right when they when they came out and said this is wrong this is inappropriate this is a mockery then where are you going to say is attacking was with Warren is it still conservatives or is it actually Cherokee Nation but I mean that that the headlines yesterday\nAssociated Press Warren DNA shows I have Native American heritage a CNN Elizabeth Warren releases DNA tests with strong evidence of Native American ancestry ABC News Elizabeth Warren relief reveals\nProof of Native American ancestry again what proof at this so backfired on her ... nation got involved in and all the mockery that that ensued from there this is going to follow her I Know people think that she is a front runner\nBut the fact that she lied about our heritage to advance her career I could see the signs are ready at Trump rallies in twenty twenty with one one thousand twenty fourth just written and that's it because now this defines her and this is not something you shake very easily and suddenly she's kind of morphed into Hillary Clinton where\nYou can't really trust what she says and then on top of that she has no real economic message at outside of you didn't do that so\nYeah no ensuring to see who the Democrats settle on ... and and twenty twenty because I think the left wing of the party has taken over and that's not the way you'd be President Trump\nOne of the things that I've been pointing out I don't know if you had a chance to look at the center for American Progress and there was a group formed by none other than John Podesta\nThey're running their reelection now ... very revealing the Maxine Waters says they keep telling me not to say it I keep saying I'm not a lot but I'm going to keep saying it anyway meaning impeach forty five\nSo they're hiding their agenda we learned that in this project very pause tape with Claire McCaskill in her own words also\nBut now we know that they're being told directly not to talk about their immigration and all you know a sanctuary attacks pack up punch says the four page memorandum [laughter] I'm like yeah OK and anyway the New York times were obtained a copy of it\nAnd Democrats and strategies to prepare the memos that\nThe Democrat you spend as little time as possible ever talking about immigration itself pivot\nTo more fruit will issues like health care and taxation it's very difficult to win on immigration so nobody's talking about what they really are going to do their super Democrats too when they have to pretty much lie misrepresent\nCon be quiet about what it is they want to do how they govern\nAnd and the types of agenda items they really have that's not an enviable position to be and I mean ... all the criticism Donald Trump takes he's pretty authentic he made promises and he keeps them\nThat's the thing I mean when you look at the record right everybody focuses on the rhetoric of the president too much right you look at the results and it's a completely different ballgame any president would kill to have a GDP above four percent unemployment below\nFour percent right there's something like seven point six million job openings that was that was reporter by CNBC today I think in the country that's incredible we have Ninety eight percent of the ISIS caliphate evaporated in Iraq and Syria when North Korea is no longer lobbing missile over Japan threatening Guam and the United states these\nAre all very substantial victories the trade deal he just did with Canada and Mexico I'm not sure leading here I'm Talking about the pillars of the presidency in terms of accomplishments Trump is winning right now he won with capital as well even the CNN did a\nA segment last week John Avalon where he says the president is on a winning streak and the polls are showing it he's back around forty four percent forty five percent among registered voters member\nOf al ... was the most accurate and twenty sixteen has them at fifty one\nRight fifty one percent everything is trending upwards at the wrong time for Democrats when you go into this election because to your point\nThey have no message like they had no message and twenty sixteen I don't know what Hillary Clinton's platform was outside of that guy is bad but for me so I can be the first woman president and I I Would say the same about Mitt Romney two thousand twelve I I think back I Can't remember what his platform was but I remember Joe Biden had bin Laden is\nDead and GM is alive that's easy to remember and it's a it was good enough right who was it will make America great again or keep\nAmerica great again the Trump could run on his record and Democrats just go with personal attacks like they have a if it's going to be a a long long election you know you're going to hear about how Trump some trouble like you did in two thousand sixteen but\nAgain a in till they have a message in ... Michigan Pennsylvania Wisconsin to win over those voters that see jobs coming back and companies coming back I unless they put up a centrist fiery centrist candidate that can have a lot of problems on\nThe one poll that shocks me the most the latest one out of Wisconsin had Scott Walker who I think that a phenomenal job in the state of Wisconsin and now he's always had notoriously close elections he's always had all of these groups and millions and millions of dollars pouring in from outside of Wisconsin that he's had to deal with\nNot sure if the poll is accurate but it has him down and that surprises me\nBut I think especially when you look at the Senate I I could see the Republicans again with three weeks away I don't have a crystal ball I always tell everybody play like you're behind and you're losing and you got you got to make up ground and anything can happen between now and election day in Twenty one days but\nYou know I don't see Heidi Heitkamp making a recovery I think a Christian seminar is falling apart in Arizona I see a surge of just the right time for Dean Heller in Nevada which will help him\nUm I I look at the other races Donnelly now is beginning to fall back in Indiana Marsha Blackburn is emerging in Tennessee thank goodness Claire McCaskill I Believe this tape is absolutely going to help to feed her or if the people in Missouri if this is widely disseminated 'cause it's outrageous\nAnd the only Democrat that might be safe at this point seems to be Joe mansion in the Senate\nYeah and and the Senate in order to win that back you had to go through this narrow paths if you're a Democrat through Arizona red state Texas Red state Tennessee read stand\nBy the way up I'm going to he's up by eight in the latest poll I'm actually going to be down during a town hall with him this weekend around the Houston area I'll I'll give up that announcement later in the week\nOh there you go yeah and and remember better or got more money than any cat on my guys are eight million dollars and he's tattered already has a twenty twenty presidential candidate you know\nI I think we'll probably be twenty to twenty five candidates and that's not an exaggeration because Republicans and Eighteen but yeah that would've been a very big symbolic victory of ... unseated cruise but that's going in the right direction for Cruz as well so the Senate you got to think they're probably going to pick up three or four seats\nAnd now I Would have told you two months ago and like I don't see how Democrats don't win twenty three seats to win back the house and given the history Eighteen or the last twenty mid terms I have got against the party in power by an average of something like thirty three seats a bottle of sixty three seats in two thousand ten\nSo I was thinking you know what I Can't see that not happening now I I think it's a toss up at fifty fifty that Republicans keep the house and if that happens after all this negative press that President Trump has received Republicans have received to overcome that and keep all three branches oh my goodness\nBut I Will tell you I think back then you you hit two things the fact that they have no agenda\nIs part of it the second thing is is that they're catering to a mob mentality and we saw that in the cabin on hearings and we've seen a post Kavanaugh hearings\nAnd you know when you say as Maxine Waters did about cabinet members and high ranking officials in our government you create a crowd and you you follow them into department stores in gas stations in grocery stores and you tell them\nThey're ... they're not wanted here anymore anywhere anymore I'm like that's the party because I say in it\nFor a media perspective it's funny because then you have even some anchors on CNN that are saying you know the people that chased Ted Cruz and his wife out of a Washington restaurant right they're not a mob and you can't say the word\nI'm not allowed to say the words mob rights they will continue Joe ... he is the media reporter on the hill a will come back also\n[noise]\nNot trying to find me ... dot com slash real\nOne word can change the entire meaning of a conversation with

about when\nI feel like I Know you've been in my living room so many times in mid run around with me in the car\n[laughter] well do you want to know the truth you really do know me\nYou know one thing I've always said is you really can't fake it for three our four hours a day\nI mean he me on TV you hear me on the radio I mean I Can't just we don't write lines for this program we just talk and you know unless I guess your super con artist I don't think it's you're capable people can ascertain who you really are especially that's why they call radio warms the media\nThat you're exactly right you're exactly right looked shutting the reason that caught was that was known your program yet they fight ... delivery Clinton's speech\nAnd in in that she mentioned the fact that the only way we're going to return to civility in this country used to elect Democrats and then when I heard it dawned on me that's extortion\nSelling us telling the American people\n[noise] the only way you don't have any peace impressed shut up shut up is still a Democrat\nThat's pretty you know that's one way to put it but you got to understand since the day Donald Trump won the left\nIn this country those quote resistance in this country now\nThat now emerging into a mob in some cities in this country and confronting you know the attorney general's like Pam Bondi or secretary of homeland security Nielsen or Sarah Sanders or Ted Cruz and his wife ... or\nYou know Mitch McConnell and then then of course you know putting their anarchist symbols on the GOP headquarters in New York City et cetera\nAll of this remember Maxine Waters set it if you see them get a crowd get a crowd and you confront them and you follow them into department stores in gas stations and and restaurants and you tell them you know wanted anywhere anymore\nOkay well that sounds like you want something bad to happen\nAnd the fact that the Democrats are now the strategy is to hide who they are don't be honest lie we see it in the project baritone videos or ... it is it they're not telling Maxine Waters tent said they keep telling me not to say it\nThen you read the center for American Progress don't talk about immigration because if you're ... you're not going to win with by telling people the truth about what you believe\nIt's it's sad that this is what it takes for them to win it had that Hillary Clinton had the cheat Bernie Sanders to get the nomination and that she tried to use the phony Russian da da\nDa and then had all of our deep state friends lying to the American people with unverified uncorroborated Russian bought and paid for lives\nThere's just who they are there's nothing that they're running on the tells me oh if you elect us we're going to create jobs by doing this\nWhat Trump said that we create jobs by giving us the largest tax cut and eliminating burdensome regulation and opening up bad ... building pipelines and saving the coal industry those are saving jobs\nSo you know the ... look it's I'm I'm just telling everybody three weeks from tonight you're going to turn on your TV set\nAnd you're gonna watch the coverage and you're either going to be you know maybe it maybe it'll be a mixed bag maybe the Republicans gained a couple seats in the Senate when\nMaybe they lose the house you lose the house then all you're going to see for two years is never ending non stop obsessive compulsive Trump Kate and investigations and possible impeachment that's the agenda that's it\nThere's nothing to improve the lives of the American people ... you know there's a lot at stake
