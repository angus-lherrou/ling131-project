Arizona served her\nHer country with incredible honor and distinction and Dean Heller ... Nevada and Rick Scott and Florida but these numbers today are interesting as president trumps approval rating is now matched his all time high at fifty percent\nAnd more importantly we've got a raspy suppose that says well the latest survey fifty six percent likely voters agree with judge ... statement that the Senate Judiciary committee friday last week that his confirmation hearings had become a quote national disgrace well\nThat raises questions about what impact this might have on the midterm elections in thirty three days because ... midterm election polling is getting more definitive\nThe enthusiasm gap does is closed almost two dead even hold and you see Republicans and important Senate races now and dead heats in all of the states that are red states where we're Democrats Trump is one by fairly big margins\nI'm like I'm going to go further I think when we see that moment when judge ... you know becomes just this ... and we see that first time when he is city and the Supreme Court\nI think a large part of the left is just gonna collapse and morale they have done everything they could they went all out they lied they ... they did everything you can imagine and they lost\nAnd I think that the morale effect on the left is gonna be substantial Chuck Schumer strategy failed and the fact is that he and the process you may well have crippled ... party or a generation\nA good friend of mine called and said you know there's one team out there trying to build things they're called Republicans and there's one team out there trying to destroy things they're called Democrats and he said to me I just don't think people are Americans\nAre gonna vote for the destroyer ... and I thought that was a pretty good way to capture what we've been living through\nI've often said and then we've been friends going back since Nineteen Ninety maybe even a little before that and I've often said you can predict this with certainty every two and four years that identity politics\nYou know it's rich versus poor old versus young black versus white whatever ... nature of politics they could bring up comes up every election year but they have ... son to a new low\nYou know I knew this was not going to be a difficult job for the FBI and the case that professor for there was no place there was no time there was no location there's no place for the FBI to visit\n... to to look for anything for ... that might exist\nAnd the only for people that they could really talked to the poor people ... professor ... mentioned\nThat she remembered being at this this so called party when the alleged event happened and she identified one person that was supposed to be a I Witness to the assault and the eye witness said that did not happen\nAnd the other people do not remember any such party is this and then the question is do we believe in the presumption ... innocence or we just gonna jump the gun and say guilt ... association Cory Booker said something spectacular yesterday and he goes well there's enough ... out there I mean you just gotta kinda believe it and they're not qualified based on allegations\nWell look you must be clear Cory Booker sadly somebody who I used to think that a real future ... former ah it's just sort of the cage said I mean I don't know whether it's because you want ...\nOr what but he just kind of decayed into almost making a mockery of himself me he talks with any of Spartacus moment which is a sign of such stunning historical ignorance that has a history teacher I found it painful\nUm he he makes comments like that I mean here people should know that if allegations destroy you uh then the whole process of the rule of law collapses over and totally and it's sad to watch something like that\nYou know I think could have been a positive constructive force and who's now frankly are becoming almost a caricature of himself\nIs certainly a lot at stake and then the next thirty three days and you know there's other good economic those that have come out today I mean on top of record low unemployment and fourteen states African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workforce\nA youth unemployment fifty some odd year low a we have consumer confidence all time high for a million new jobs created for a million fewer people on on food stamps or you see what the president's accomplish with NAFTA the new NAFTA the\nThe new trade agreement with Mexico and and with Canada you see that he is eliminated burdensome regulation we can now drilling and war and the forty eight states uh he is literally singlehandedly save coal mining in America and of course natural gas production will now be at an all time high\nAnd we have a Wall Street journal piece today showing more Americans getting pay raises than ever before\nAnd that's the forgotten men and women that mattered in twenty sixteen the question is will they all go out and vote to protect the progress that has been made in the last two years even maybe if they don't particularly like their individual Republican congressmen or maybe think they're weak or maybe don't even know their name is\nWell he has put your finger on the key question of this election as you know I've been involved in many many campaigns are actually going all the way back to Nineteen sixty and one of the ... one of the lessons I learned was\nI don't care about the polls show me the precincts I Want to see the first real votes I Want to see who cares enough to show up and vote because that changes everything is you know we just won a\nA sixty three percent Hispanic district in a special election for the state Senate in Texas right down along the border and this we had a candidate who got lost by twenty points four years ago came back to the special in one um\nAnd is the first Hispanic Republican state senator uh in Texas and that's because people were energized enough to turn out so I Would say to everybody in our audience who this is going to come down to isn't holding\nIt isn't conversation at the coffee shop who cares enough to get an absentee ballot who cares enough to show up at boat\nAnd if our side does show up in both I think this could be one of the most historic elections that you and I've ever covered living together for lots of elections I have a hunch this one could turn into something that we would throw us behind\nThe scenes I got to give you a lot of credit because I remember speaking with you you probably forget it the day before you became speaker of the houses in Nineteen Ninety four and I remember talking to you that day and the day of the election and\nAnd you are surrounded by a group of people in Joe Gaylord and you actually shared with me the information you had and you said it was absolutely true that for the first time in forty years Republicans would take over the house\nI think you and I were two of the few people willing to go out on a limb and said yeah Donald Trump as a real shot of winning this election and\nAnd people laughed at us at the time and I I Believe that then and and we proved out to be right we also the ... both of us predicted Obama would be an abysmal failure as president based on a very rigid ideology that he seemed to be indoctrinated into\nAnd I I agree with you I think there is an opportunity here to shock the world again\nAnd it the for the people listening to this audience they're going to tune in thirty three nights from now watch election results come in and they are either going to seek ... happy liberal newscasters announcing Nancy Pelosi as speaker and\nChuck Schumer is the Senate majority leader and Maxine Waters will be the chairman of this committee or that committee and that the impeachment of Trump will go forward taxes will go up open borders will remain an Obamacare stays all this\nOr they're going to shock the world and all these people are going to do what they did in twenty sixteen and being the shock of their life\nWell that's right and I mean I think what would I Would say to everybody who's listening to us everybody cares what's country's future make sure you vote makes sure your friends vote make sure everybody you know who favors\nA solid productive work oriented results oriented system make sure they go out and vote if that happens my I'm I'm not quite ready yet to predict what am I going to tell you that because of the intensity\nOf anger about the way the liberals smear Kavanaugh the characterization the dishonesty I Believe we have seen and I've been looking at data for three days\nI Believe that we've seen a substantial shift towards Republicans now I think that the ... were almost certainly now going to keep the Senate and probably going to increase our or the total number of senators by significant margins\nHeidi Heitkamp of North Dakota who's down eleven is no on Kavanaugh to me put a fork in that race it's over\nAgain I think Kramer and it was a great great guy and I've known for twenty four years and he's got to get out there and keep campaigning I mean one one of the lessons you know I I had very close races including a couple of recounts and I had very big raised

this is\nI'm kind of criminal behavior the way a wad of this stuff is playing out in Washington DC right now or whether it be the boxing that we've seen\n'em or whether it be just the sheer way that the FBI has been used and I think what's happening is\nIt's solidify and people that they don't want to play this game and people are starting to get on the same bandwagon I Do think it's going to have a huge outcome and the election I think that people are going to say they're tired of this nonsense it's on the west um they may not agree with everything on the right but I think it's going to cause a backlash\nYou're going to defend Europe ... liberal democratic socialist party Danielle\n... show on on could opt in any everybody excited to be here I I honestly I Want to tell you that there's going to be I think that crashed on its way out you know um they are concerned about ah the nominee out there a consensus they stick I wasn't\nDown okay but at the same hurdle we've heard all the allegations\nYou know that professor Ford's so called eye witness was contradicted her testimony and her accusation\nWe know in the case of ... Ramirez the New York times wouldn't even polar publish it because they discovered nobody that corroborate her story number one number to our own words that she was a ... D quickly had gaps in her memory\nAnd the fact that we now\nKnow that you know so many different things that we didn't know before and that Mrs Ramirez was actually out there soliciting information from her fellow your classmates the New York times reported that because she quote couldn't remember then in the case of Julie sweat Nick\nSaw her backtrack dramatically from her original story and her claim that judge Kavanaugh was a serial\nDrug or and rapists the teenage girl she'll give me the evidence and cooperation to any of these women story that's what I Want from you Danielle and don't duck and don't dodging don't hem and haw that I'm asking a tough question give me any cooperation you have\nI don't hit the cooperation because I'm not don't yeah I and I come from wind ... and ... and we talked about this last week\nWait a minute what everybody's talking hunted\nWith a full and fair and take action getting married at twenty cooperating and whatnot says if the I think no end in ... if I didn't\nSkews me why every main person that was mentioned in the case of professor Ford and the case of Mr Mir as the New York times tried to corroborated they spent an entire week interviewed dozens of people\nAnd then she herself was calling around to other yell classmate saying I don't I don't remember do you remember I'm not sure if it was him that exposed himself and then we all watch Julie sweat Nick\nAll third shift and backtrack from her original allegation which was gang raping and systematic drug gang of women so you have any cooperation for any of these incidents at all\nI'm not getting any education that I don't think that you would expect that I did\nI mean all you're following you can't find any cooperation either can you as a matter of fact we're getting just the opposite of corroboration people are saying those they don't recall those stories at all that it or that didn't happen that way at all\nSo the judge is our culture and that thing on at the last twenty four hours at looking about ah the judges trend came on a on a ... I think this is horrendous for polish side and the idea\nOf not answering my question I'm asking you if the people make serious claims allegations on a serious real topic because there are real evil horrible president predators in this world and\nThey mentioned that there are specific people have you interview them that they're going to tell you my story is true and it turns out to be the opposite don't you believe in the presumption of innocence Danielle McLaughlin yes or no\nOf course I Do show the outline getting\nSomething of course I Believe in the ... and the and the presumption of innocence I Believe that the FBI should've been allowed to do a full and fair and they take action and that is why you're going to see on the lay a huge out for a while and I understand that that's an energizing that hey\nI notice a talking point well hang on a second in accordance you interview looking in the case of professor Ford before people she identified were at the party and none of the four have any recollection of the abandoned the one I witnessed says it didn't happen\nWhat else are they supposed to do is we don't know where it happened we don't know when it happened we don't know the location and she doesn't know how she got there I got home from their what else is the FBI to do they had already given sworn statements under the penalty of a felony\nAnd all they did is reiterate those statements that the FBI what else could they possibly do Danielle in that case\nAnd being on the opposite side of it the I think at the FBI just\nDidn't know what else can they pass certainly do knowing the facts as we know that we don't know where we don't know when we don't know huh\nOK okay she thinks the fact that she doesn't run into where I where and when exactly it's not necessarily\nDon't you now that you're you're trying to what you're trying to change it look follow\nThe bouncing ball all of the people\nIf there is for people that were eyewitnesses but we don't know where we don't know when we don't know how she got she got home we don't even know the house which you mentioned four people were there they for people under penalty of fellow they all said it didn't happen the way she said one witness that didn't happen\nAnd my question is what the FBI do if they don't know the location that can't be looking parenthetically for anything quick break we'll come back more with Jonathan Gillum and Danielle McLaughlin here on the Sean Hannity show\nHey I Want to talk about your whole security protecting your family that simply ... security the best on security system on the market even said by the net PC Magazine the wire cutter is their top pick for home security and there's a good reason when they started on this program they're only five employees\nA peanut ... records and figure out what trying to exactly that my child from a safe way to try and try and\nGet should we be should we be looking into the rape allegations of Bill Clinton\nShy Juanita Robert\nOnly Dr Ford was given the\nI'm asking should ... should know law enforcement and the FBI investigate the rape allegation of Bill Clinton\nNeeded proud of our products allegations were already in the Bible scholars on by\nA guy who's made not by the FBI should we should the FBI now investigate them if this was the new standard Jonathan\nNo because that's not our authority that those are local crimes that happened now in the case of we need a Broderick though however um he that would have been a state matter because that the time of Bill Clinton where's the attorney general\nYou know and so but here's the thing that you keep saying and Daniel well have you been here's what you keep missing and so many people that are emotionally involved with this if you take the emotion out of it I Know that's difficult because people are very passionate but if you take the emotion out of it and you look at the investigative facts there are none\nAnd there is not going to be any because it doesn't matter who you question the very people that are the the the alleged victim claims were the closest to the to the electric crime don't know anything\nAnd so as you go out in a perimeter away from the people who the victim says was was there and you interview other people that may have heard somebody say something or hurt here say it becomes here say you know that from being in court that\nWhen you have a just eight minutes with no corroborating evidence that case quickly falls to the side\nAnd I certainly agree and Jonathan totally ... the the problem is that and then also the fact that the FBI is being used outside of their authority for a political matter and that scares me as a former FBI agent that scares me because that is the that's the thing that totalitarian\nI'm a governments do\nAgree I think that one thing that's important you got to they said what is the standard here this is not\nA criminal investigation uh this is an investigation into combat that may or may not have bearing on way there's somebody get a lifetime appointment and and I understand and I agree that this is the kind of extremely political and extremely emotional and I think that probably the ...\nQuestion do you have any corroborating witness for any corroborating evidence at all you can say right now\nAnd it's an on the question that as an\nReally I got an unfair question\nJonathan I don't think it's unfair to them\n... ... I I think when we say fair or unfair I think what it is is orange intimate question I'll tell you why didn't you know because\nPeople are so again angry and people are saying I Believe her I Believe him but in this case there's just no other witnesses there is no other evidence and so when you're asked if you feel this passionate about something if somebody says\nWhat other information do you have that's legitimate question because there is not and the FBI who was secrete it into this investigation has come up with non either and I can guarantee you if anybody would have earned could or it would be them\nRight and on the side there is no robbery evidence as to where the judge was on any given day with the he was there and I think I think people are emotional for for ...\nAnybody actually has a copy of is summer calendar that year but we don't have an exact day anyway so right right and you know what you're saying is that you know he has to prove his innocence or is he innocent before proven they ... they haven't been proven guilty what what do you believe him\nHe is innocent until proven guilty again\nSo he hasn't been proven guilty and you know has he he has not been proven guilty and it's gone on a long time\nNot to a legal standard that would be required in what ... not that I didn't believe that at the end if yeah and I write\nThank you both we appreciate it eight hundred ... all one Sean toll free telephone number might allow free for all we're going to get to your calls next eight hundred nine four one Sean is our number you want to be a part of the program [noise]\n\nCasino del sol empathy for entertainment venue with a lot of the authors all summer long victim's family to do some guys are going to get your ticket now just because the solar\nSystem or R. O. C. to aid too early to\nHave you ever heard of and anchors water heaters yet is exactly what it sounds like the water heater without a tank\nUsing that word I say I'm Glad you asked\nOn CNN veterans\nYou\nPut you on your radio down and misery are doing [noise]\nDriving those liberals Sean Hannity is back on the radio right now\nI'm twenty five now till the top of the hour eight hundred nine for one Sean news are toll free telephone number you want to be a part of the\nProgram All right so this vote Friday Saturday big votes big opportunity\nAnd we have Susan Collins and senator snowflake saying that they are satisfied that the comprehensive investigation to the FBI Lisa Murkowski saying the hasn't had time to read it Democrats in an uproar angry upset lashing out at the FBI\nWhat were they supposed to do except to interview the people that was supposed to corroborate the stories of this\nThat's what they did they got what they wanted and it never ever going to be enough All right back to our phones as we say Hi first Brandon is in Colorado Brandon Hi how are you glad you called and welcome to the Sean Hannity show\nHey thanks Sean I grew up in spent most of my life in Arizona where most of my family's still is and I'm I'm actually a distant relative of Jeff Flake and I do think he is a decent man and I think he has a\nA good heart but I really feel like he's getting played here by the Democrats and the left and I just really really hope that uh that you'll make the right decision tomorrow or Saturday it sounds\nSounds like after his comments today that that's more likely but uh it just you know I I Know there's a reason he's not running for reelection and it's just hard to see a see good people leave to Washington and come back a few years later and and not be able to really recognize them and I feel like that happened with McCain and I feel like it's kind of happening with Jeff as well\nI think the most shocking statement that he may was on sixty minutes when he when he actually admitted\nWhen asked if he would be voting this way he had to face the voters he had absolutely not um and I'm like oh so you're you're only stand on your principles when\nWhen you have to face the voters but that's not how you really feel it really sums up how I view a lot of politicians you know I\nI just look at a guy that can't doesn't know was old mind at times and doesn't right\nNow is the\nSame guy that wanted to be on the survivor show and you know ... you know look at him and uh you'll find this funny Sean but we were actually related or I think it's for three or four generations back a great great something grandfather he was actually the founder of snowflake Arizona which I thought you would really love\nTo know somebody told me that yesterday on my record but really no there is a snowflake Arizona senator Snowe for like\nUm I Hope it goes the right thing\nIf any Republican senator now especially Murkowski Collins flake after they they got what they wanted they got their delayed they got the FBI weighing in\nA Joe Biden said it would not going to offer recommendations and they're not going to offer opinions here\nAnd all they're going to do is give you a straight data and that's what was given and everybody seemed pleased by that his comments Susan Collins comments seemed to satisfy them no corroboration of any of these claims as we've been claiming\nAnd as we've been telling you and so the allegations have been problematic from the start it you know assuming assuming for us\nThat can here judge Kavanaugh where to get confirmed we we have got to have a deep analysis\nIn this country over where we want to go forward in terms of going forward because if we allow this to happen to good people it it's it is so it's so dark I'm having a conversation with a friend of mine who's religious\nAnd we were discussing you know look at the ten commandments why is one of the ten commandments\n... shall not bear falls witness against the neighbor because it's devastating for the rest of Brett Kavanaugh's life\nPeople know that this is what he's been accused of and yet in spite of the fact there's been no corroboration shifting stories and a media hysteria that that's why\nTo the extent that people can literally destroy other people within your window falls uncorroborated claims a shocking to me they did it to Robert Bork they did it to Clarence Thomas they've been doing it to Brett Kavanaugh they do it to Republicans conservatives every two and four years they're racist or sexist\nThey want grandma to die all these things that they've come out as a matter of of course because that's their playbook I don't know I um I I some house at some point we may need to examine libel laws at some
