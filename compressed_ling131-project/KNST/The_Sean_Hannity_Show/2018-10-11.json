it's done a phenomenal job or as it relates to you know the state\nOf Wisconsin and I hope the people of Wisconsin finally remember that but we now have Walker one poll finally up by one but it's very very close a we have a Georgia governor race that's also closer than I Would like for comfort\nOr with the Republican Kemp up by two and so we're following that raised pretty closely um in some of the other races that were watching the president's approval rating now is doing very very well he's a what fifty one percent and rats musician\nAnd so we'll watch that but I think if you look at Heidi

literally they these these districts were putting up hold the balance of power in the house of representatives I mean because of gerrymandering above big portion and percentage of seats\nI end up being safe for both Republicans and Democrats so we'll find out for voters by the way Trump more help now to these candidates in the president's got what he's up for days this week and he's going to be campaigning for everybody and these type races in an attempt to help them all out now I Am\nI honestly think that the Republicans would adapt just a little bit they don't have to take the style of Donald Trump\nBut if they go out and and passionately support making the tax cuts permanent if they passionately talk about ending the bureaucracy the way the president has been doing it if they will sign on to building and fully funding the border wall\nIf they will do the alternative healthcare solutions that we talk about all the time on this program like health savings accounts and health care cooperatives et cetera were just going to have a better country\nAnd and the more prosperous country you cannot deny the success\nOf this president and the fuel the pure force of personality I mean Donald Trump is a force of nature and I know that he breaks dishes I Know he's an icon of class I Know he's a disruptor\nBut if he's not fighting them we're not winning\nAnd when he goes up even against their own allies and says you're not paying their fair share in NATO and we're paying the bulk of money for NATO and then you're stupid enough Chancellor Merkel to go make deals to help make

served as well as a country for a long time\nAnd now with a very pathetic and sad and frankly now alarming state and I honestly think that Rand Paul is not off base when he says that this rhetoric is going to lead to somebody getting killed at some point\nWhen Democrats said get up in their face they need to realize that there are a lot of unstable people out there there are people with anger

strategy to to create the impression that there was a lot that they had\nIn fact it was them leaking to different news sources to create the impression that this was real\nAnd then of course you know uniting what they're good friend Robert Mueller and that's why it's been a witch hunt\nOr whatever Eighteen months\nThe biggest abuse of power ever that pony dusty it used to manipulate not only by

for Dave Brat maybe help out his campaign if you can and we welcome both of you to the program a gym let me start with you is it is it three or four people now that say that Rod Rosenstein Rona\nHow many have you been out\nThere there there are several and here's the bottom line when the when the chairman of the committee of jurisdiction\nAsk you to come in and testify in this case the chairman the Judiciary Committee you are obligated to do that remember Rod Rosenstein is Senate confirmed when he goes to his confirmation process he gets asked that question will you come and testify under oath an answer Congress has questioned when called is it so that is yes he is obligated to do it and for him not to come\nIs ridiculous particularly in light of what we now know where we have a ... type of rainy asleep on account\nOf someone saying that he was serious about actually recording the commander in chief of this great country so yeah he should be in front of us and if he's not going to come in like he's supposed to like you said he was going through then there definitely should be a subpoena will bring him in her deposition\nWell there's a lot that Rod Rosenstein needs to explain and it should be under oath that's the normal procedures to underwrite it sure is\nIt's her you're supposed to come in at birth order your maybe he's the guy who won the Justice Department\nAnd understand the timeline on may ninth\nKobe is fired based on the Rosenstein them all on basic hate this when he had this conversation with police the page and Andy McCabe where he said he was thinking about\nRecording the president contemporaneous with that the cave and paid held the FBI chief counsel Jim Baker that Rod Rosenstein was serious about that this solemn ... and of course may seventeenth is when Bob Mueller's named special counsel\nAlso in San ... what else happened on this and that today moment when ... director\nThe same day just kind of interesting and then of course he doesn't get the job in the next day he named special counsel so this all happens and then as you pointed out in your intro a defies ever know the third buys ever know gets signed one month later so that's sort of the timeline of what we what it's all you want to bring him in and ask questions about all those it then throughout that two month period\nAll right Dave Brat let's bring you into this eh well first of all how is your race going I you know I Know that you've been targeted now by by Nancy Pelosi and company and the thrown a ton of money in your district to get your defeated how's it going\n[noise] yeah it's going good weren't when and on the pile up the ... the health care immigration pact or my opponent is a alert you liberal and so we're putting the word out but it's like you say they're pouring billions in because\nThey know they're going after you and Derek ... big time in junior right\nRight no it's it's a it's a battle and that there there is is ah my opponent the resist\nA she really doesn't have a platform it All right now and so she's just running on the resistance than um than do vote and that's it so why I think I think the people especially after the Supreme Court dabba ... captain and Hillary yesterday and all the folks chime in on the left I think the ah the voters in Virginia or darker to write that\nLook I think we've been putting a pen specific raises a night um congressman Jordan you know I mean the California Arizona a Mayo loving Utah Colorado has a number of seats there there are\nListening to people want the full list that we've identified the top Seventy seats we put it up on the Hannity dot com good\nOh so that people can check and make sure that that if their congressmen or a woman is in a tough race that they get out to the polls what do you think's going to happen in twenty six days Congressman John\nI think we're going to win I think we got great candidates like Dave Brat who were fighting for the for the American people elected us to fight for so I think we're going to win and I think the way you frame it ups on his way you been doing it\nHow radical the left is I'd like to say it this way there there is that the left today is that they apply to ... when he respects the flag they embrace Governor Cuomo when he says America was never that great material and Maxine Waters when she says go out and harassed anyone who supports the president and we saw that double down on that whole mindset doubled down on yesterday with what Clinton in ... at about Republican\nWhat are you ... and ... they're going after terrorists Sanders I'm Pam Bondi and secretary and the ISIS\nYeah I it just it just how radical the leftist today's modern Democrat Party today's party of the lab has taken most extreme positions in history raise your taxes abolish ice never secure the border continue to socialize medicine and impeach the president and you contrast that with what the president under his leadership we've accomplished\nThe list is phenomenal did this the other day some but they could buy the taxes cut ... regulations reduced the economy going at Fort quaint two percent lowest unemployment ... years out of the Iran deal the embassies in Jerusalem we've got a new NAFTA deal the hostage come open most Korea and we got to get guys\nOn the United States Supreme court that's an amazing record and if we ended up that way and twenty six days we will win and keep the majority and continue to be able to do this thing can make\nAmerica why don't you know some of these candidates they can't string two sentences together there's no idea why they're running for office when you can't communicate\nThis is a nationalized election and we've got to understand that and go out and get that kind of message Dave Brat understands that he's out campaigning on the good thing that happened with conservative leadership and his leadership uh that's how we have to run these campaigns and if we do I think we keep the majority\nLet me ask you a question now Fox has confirmed that the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein than acting FBI directed his after the firing a coma Andrew McCabe and Robert Mueller all met on a weekend day after Mueller's investigation started up\nAnd in that meeting Rosenstein and ... and McCabe or or both detailing reasons why the other one needs to recuse themselves with her the Russia investigation as as the hell are sitting there watching all this go on and knowing that well I guess I'm In charge of the whole thing what do you make of that uh they brought\nYou know I'll just go back to the way your frame that you um ... dot com it's all like ... Iran over its like at the specific but in your intro Rosenstein said we have to follow the constitution for the people\nBecause we need oversight to follow the evidence using reason and now he woke up in front of the people right say he's not just saying no to Jim Jordan and members of oversight committee he's saying don't the American people and\nHe when he just said and your remarks that the job and the role of the constitution is to give the people oversight using evidence and reason so he he's thumbing his nose at U.S Congress and if we don't hold strong that President is not good and all that Jim go on with the ...\nYes on ... ... you're exactly right both the cave and Rosenstein ... this is interesting that both actually right Andy McCabe should have been recused from any type of oversight over the Mueller investigation because of his involvement with his wife with\nHis his conflict when his wife was running for office and he was supporting her so that should disqualify him Rosenstein is right about that but in the caves right about Rosenstein Rosenstein wrote the memo for\nWhy Kobe's should be fired one of the things Miller is looking into was there obstruction of justice into the firing of calling me you've gotta be kidding me so that guy's gonna oversee this so they both on how complex and so that that that sort of the funny thing is to argue with each other I'm like you're both right neither one of you should be involved in this special counsel any type of all there is that\nI don't want to thank you both for being with us a congressman Brad the seventh district of the commonwealth of Virginia\nOh one of the race in Virginia is Barbara Comstock seat is very very close race there um I Hope the people at Virginia get out to vote for you congressman
