anywhere on I ...\n... am seven Ninety two sons most stimulating talk\nOf course Sarah Sanders Ted Cruz and his wife are now we have mob violence in Portland in New York and we've got two Republicans punched in Minnesota\nWelcome to uh I guess the world the Maxine Waters\nGet a crowd and tell them and follow them into gas stations department stores and and and restaurants and you tell them we don't want to\nKnow where the un now where any point any time I mean is that the New America because I didn't I don't remember that um [noise]\nWell that's certainly the America will desperate left because they're losing a the more they lose the more desperate they get and it's good I think it will get worse before it gets better 'cause I ain't gonna keep losing and I think\nThat they they are so alienated from most Americans that all they have left is this kind of a new elucidate violence a which in the end I think turns people off it's it's it's it's it's also a little scary because this is Steve ... proved when he was shot um\nYou know if you're conservative and you're in public life there's a certain danger level now that is totally on American and that comes entirely from the left\nYou know the thing is that's missing and and you figure it out I mean I watch the whole process when you became speaker it didn't happen overnight it started with a series of videotapes about running to transform America and it was called renewing American civilization when did you first put those tapes out\nWe first began working on it in uh Ninety two and did the first wave of tapes in Ninety three and then the second wave after I was ...\nAnd it was all based on ideas culminating in a contract with America and I I think people forget because\nYou know we've had waves of conservatives maybe if you want to start with Gary Barry Goldwater that's one it wasn't successful but it was the beginning Reagan's victory in Nineteen eighty and then subsequently in eighty four that was another big victory and and obviously the Republicans taking over Congress for the first time in forty years with your contract\nAnd I'd argue Donald Trump is the fourth leg\nAnd that is a I ... everything he is doing in terms of governance is conservative even even threatened trade wars they're not\nThey're not materialized because that's never been as a pension his intention to for better trade deals freer fairer deals\nYou know I think look I I think he is worth a\nCycle if you will of moving back from a left wing America and we've been gaining momentum and gaining clarity\nAnd there's often tell people you know we didn't have Leonard Leo and the federalist society\nWith so many good solid conservative lawyers that we could fill up all these judicial appointments uh and that that's just a huge advantage and they're all grows out of what is now if you go back to the Goldwater of fifty four year movement\nUm but I think it's also coming to a crisis because Trump so clearly articulate each a pro American pro work ethic pro patriotism policy that he drives the left crazy\nAnd I think as a result left which has gotten more extreme they haven't modulated they haven't come back to the center they've decided that their job is to beat up and intimidate those of us who disagree with them and in the end I think that just further isolate some\nSo their agenda is pretty clear they get back the house they wanna teach men they want the crumbs back the largest tax cutting history which is obviously having a big impact on the economy we you know all the record unemployment numbers the varying demographic groups that are doing better than they've ever done\nUm they also want open borders but John Podesta said don't talk about immigration they want to eliminate ice they want to keep Obamacare\nI'm an endless investigation I Would add to that I don't hear one positive thing that's going to create one job or make this country one bit safer not nothing that they're running on just\nThat and we hate Trump that's it\nWell I think that's right in this part of me because I tried to tell us honestly what they stand for there will be treated so badly that they just they know that they can't afford to be honest but but I think I mentioned the send your TV show last night I think that we're about to be\nA magic moment in American history and I think the two words that captured in my mind our cabin all\nAnd caravan I think Kevin all the way they treated him of the viciousness the smears the character assassination childish behavior by US Senators in Senate meetings I think all that came together to really re galvanized conservatives and I think this caravan\nComing up from Guatemala should be a major focus of Republicans for the next couple of weeks because it makes clear\nThe argument about whether or not we have a right to be a sovereign country or whether in the\nFeinstein below sea San Francisco Democrat tradition we have an obligation to open up our border to anybody who can get finance\nAnd remember these three thousand people I agree with Laura Ingraham is asking the question who's paying for this these three thousand people probably cost Twenty one million dollars to move\nFrom Guatemala highly four thousand people is now grown too amid a spike among a U.S border crossings but you know Nancy Pelosi actually said we are not funding the border wall and that just as it seems to be an appendage to Donald Trump's manhood I mean\nYou know imagine anything similar said about any woman by any Republican or conservative\nI mean it's outrageous the double standard and then so flagrant but\nYou know we're we're already have paid between healthcare education criminal justice we've already paid trillions of dollars for people that didn't respect our laws and sovereign states costs the American people a fortune and by the way the people of California and now we're going to be paying for their health care for free no questions asked\nBy the way we have in Georgia a democratic nominee for governor Stacey Abrams a who are clearly favors allowing illegal immigrants to vote a says the show's on Romney distinction between a\nWell who are American citizens and people who came here illegally\nUm and that's that's sort of typical Gavin Newsom candidate for governor in California who openly says he wants to government run health care and make it available to every illegal immigrant who can get to California I mean\nThe Democratic party is becoming the party they'll the galaxy the party of breaking the wall the point you made earlier and a party which we can't win with legal American votes and so it's got to try to find some way to turn around the system and it's an amazing thing to watch though\nAre we going to get Newt Gingrich's prediction Nineteen days till election day I'll also his take on the show gave it looks like murder and who's responsible and how the president should handle this ah as it involves the Saudi and the Saudi Government and the Saudi consulate in Istanbul\nEight hundred nine four one shown as a toll free telephone number you want to be a part of the program many things we're down in Palm Beach Florida\nNews radio twelve Ninety W J uh no uh I Want to remind you look you know an off year elections it's about one thing and that's showing up\nAnd

relationship with Saudi Arabia which is the key\nTo containing Iran or what but I think we have to get to the bottom of it let me also point out to folks I'm just now working on a novel for next year called collusion in which the Russians are decide they want to push in the U.S Senate or\nIf I were writing a novel about a Saudi journalist being killed and the circumstances are just strange they're gonna they're gonna kill him in the Saudi consulate\nIn Istanbul knowing that the Turkish intelligence services monitor them all the time they're going to do it with a team of Fifteen people um it's almost like if they did do it and I'm not saying they didn't I mean clearly something terrible happened and and clearly\nInvade them on their sloppy and stupid and you know a ... it's unbelievable the
