Trump's okay man not the best guy with the economy is going great but I I don't think I'm going to vote you can't take out those poor people and make its scientific that the Democrats are going to have a turnout problem even though that's what Mike is his ... his point is\nThat the Democrat leadership and the media leadership is really kind of alone they are enraged they are blinded by their hatred\nSo much so that they think everybody like them hates Trump\nAnd that this is going to drive Democrats back to the polls more than anything has since Obama in two thousand eight\nAnd it's the old it's the old negative there is such a thing as negative turnout but it's not meant as it's been a negative turnout is your turn out\nTo oppose something that you are Michael e wary of or afraid of

we now have coming towards us\nFour thousand people strong\nThat want to get to the southern border where the United states from Central America\nI Know that the secretary of homeland security secretary Nielsen I I had an opportunity to call her office earlier today because I actually do real reporting on this show and get an update apparently as of now there's full cooperation with the Mexican government that that's not gonna happen\nBut four thousand people still four thousand people\nAnd what did Democrats what did they resist that they don't want a solution\nFor the board our problem we have with the opioids crossover human trafficking is occurring you know we they now are using these drug cartels you can't say they're stupid they're evil but they're not stupid they've been using and this is I Can't even believe this is true you know these drones that they fly with cameras above\nSo they'll fly from Mexico into the United states along our southern border they fly droves with cameras on them and what they do is they map out where the border patrol\nWhere agents aren't so then they give like the perfect entry way where it's most likely to succeed in bringing in their heroin and their fat and all and drugs that are really being targeted towards your kids your town your cities\nAt so evil these drug cartels are and how desperate they are to be successful or the president well he offered now we spent three and a half billion dollars so far that's the only amount of money that had been allocated towards the wall these pens every penny but we need twenty five billion dollars total to get the whole job done\nThat in part is what this election is about it's also about a party that has given up any sense of honor and any sense of constitutional\nOr authority let the rule of law that is based on our constitution that would mean due process\nThat would mean equal or access on there are laws equal application of our laws and we know that they gave that up any sense of due process with judge Kavanaugh it wouldn't even give him the honor of the presumption of innocence even after an FBI investigation the eighth one that he's had in his like well

see that reticent has now been exposed this week in Tennessee is somebody that is purposely lying to the people a tendency the same with Claire McCaskill we see that Christian cinema is falling apart I mean literally\n... you know she she says oh it's fine to be a fine to join you know radicals um and the Taliban actually said well by the way this is the meth capital of the world Arizona oh by the way you're crazy and she has anti war rallies while her opponent Republican Martha mix Sally\nIs that fighting for a country that's not playing well very very well right now in the state of Arizona and you see that Heidi Heitkamp totally out of touch with the people of North Dakota so it seems a lot of pickups in the making there for the Senate for the Republicans\nTight race though in Florida vote for governor in for Rick Scott is always does an amazing job for the people of Florida are anyway joining us to analyze where we are Eighteen days out is our good friends welcome back to the program John McLaughlin Doug shown pollsters both of them\nJohn Eighteen days out what do you see happening\n[noise] uh well the the houses are still in play and the Republicans are a without a doubt are fighting back to have gotten more aggressive but still it would be to do a lot more and and what's really amazing to me is the focus\nOf you know you're exposing the Democrats and what's your agenda is all the time but the focus of the Republicans really needs to be to expose Nancy Pelosi when she turns to do I think you played a clip earlier about Schumer in the Senate\nAnd he wasn't very specific about whether they're going up in the polls because the Republicans post cabinet or a have a really done a lot better at ... in a in the shade of polls that have come up on and when you talk to the uh Arizona ... now hit by a little in Tennessee Republicans leader\nNow decisively a ... so the ... the Democrat opportunities to take on the Senate look like they're going off the table and on the other hand it looks like the Republicans are ahead in Missouri they're they're they're running close races and in Montana Indiana a West Virginia I mean even in New Jersey uh it's it's turning into a competitor\nWas really looking like New Jersey might be a dog fight for Bob Menendez and the people in New Jersey of had it with him and you know now that his association with this Chilean Epstein guy\nUh that has now become an absolute verbal war between ... and his Republican opponent of opponent and now showing up at the polls are dug show where do you stand Eighteen days out\nWell hey where America's fans and John and you are right on fortunately I might add is that the Senate has moved pretty decisively\nRepublican and I don't think the New Jersey will go all the way because it is a operationally democratic state but the other states you cite so and I think are moving in what I think are the wrong direction I\nStill have a chance to pull out in Nevada and Arizona but both of those at the terrier rated above it from my perspective in the last\nWeek and I think Arizona in particular but Dean Heller was in a very tight race for reelection the Republican he was ... it was a to point raised a week ago Donald Trump goes in and now he's up by seven and I saw the crowds when I was out there was massive but the crowd outside was even bigger than the one inside\nWell look I yeah I was gonna say I I've seen the same numbers John please go ahead\nAnd I was an absolutely I mean the president is motivating his base and and the Republicans need to embrace up because\nA nationally when he won he had sixty three million voters and when the the uh uh\nUm when the midterms occur we only get Ninety million people usually out might be a little more this time but it won't be as big as the hundred and thirty nine million who showed up in a twenty six team\nSo if you can get to sixty three million Trump voters motivated that they're coming out again which the Kavanaugh hearings did and it\nAppears to have backfired particular Senator Schumer and the and the Democrats in the Senate or if you can motivate those Republicans to come out\nThose Trump voters those independents and Democrats that supported them they have a very good shot at getting Senate seats and it's probably the only shot they have of winning the house that that and going after Nancy Pelosi the idea of stopping Nancy Pelosi the most popular a\nFoil let me tell you what I'm saying I'm ready on TV if you vote I don't care what congressional district here and there were four hundred and thirty five congressional districts in this country in any of those districts\nIf you vote for any Democrat you're voting for a pillow see if you stay home it's I have a vote for ... and the same in the Senate if you're going to vote for tester and McCaskill\nAnd send them on against Dean Heller and Donnelly and you're going to vote for you know bread on the news just a phony fraud to the people of getting caught on tape being it uh and\nAnd not put more Marsha Blackburn in you know you'll get the government you deserve but you're really electing and voting for Schumer because they're gonna they're gonna tow the line with polo see in the house into the line with Schumer in the Senate that's\nYou know and what do we know that they want they want to impeach the president they want endless investigations\nThey want to raise taxes they're actually saying that they're hiding the impeachment begging Maxine Waters not to say it anymore John Podesta Center for American Progress and saying all Democrats should not talk about immigration for for this they want to open borders sanctuary cities\nSanctuary states than elimination of ice and they want to keep Obamacare that's not that didn't work for eight years dug and do we know what\nWhy why do we lose holding a bit of a leading Indiana is say a key pie you saying build the wall and he's saying oh impeachment which\nWhen he was the only reason he surviving and not down by five or six now is because you've got a libertarian in that race that is polling at nine percent you take a libertarian out at the Donnelly is history in Indiana\nWell I wouldn't be so sure on but he is running where Democrats need to be in the center and if we were fighting for his party rather than a left his party with new leadership from top to bottom I think we'd be doing a lot better I think you'd probably agree with that Sean\nHow is it possible the Democrats hold on to below sea and Schumer how was it ... it is a phenomenon to me ...\nAll one word answers on that one is money\nYou know raising enough money yeah\n... that's what it's all about\n... and and and he's absolutely right because Shawn that when we asked in September and a national holiday there were ... when we ask voters if the Democrats took over Congress do you want and she pulls you speaker didn't only twenty three percent of all voters said yes fifty six percent said now\nBut then when we asked them about the fact that you know if you know that they're chapter that these candidates are accepting millions of dollars to raise them for their campaigns from Nancy Pelosi or will they all their votes to her fifty percent agreed with that statement only twenty nine percent disagreed of all voters so think\nNancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer hold the mortgage on these candidates and let me tell you a for for ... for someone who's involved in congressional races right now trying to defend Republicans the Democrats are pouring millions of dollars to the races right now\nWhat enter patio and he's ... Republicans project very toss released to tapes and they are stunningly\nYou know revealing in terms of the willingness of campaigns to purposely organized a campaign\nTo lie to the people at Tennessee in the case of Brett us in to lie to the people of Missouri in the in the case of\nClaire McCaskill to say one thing privately another thing publicly\nIt tells me Democrats too when they have to they can expose who they are if they can't talk about impeachment which they want they can't talk about immigration and being told not to talk about that they can't talk about raising taxes even though they want that they can't talk about Obamacare even though they want that\nI mean what kind of people are they if they have zero sense of honor honesty character and integrity I Hope\nYou are exempt me from being a person\nWill not hire them to you but you know nobody's been listening to you because if they were listening to you have a whole entirely different slate of candidates and frankly the Republicans wouldn't have a shot this year\nWell thank you take that as a real well it's the fact that I mean notes on sale radical left\nOh are you I'm I'm Better right\nListen I your

horrible on social issues nicest person in the world but he's not left enough for the Democrats and they threw him out and he came back and won but I mean it says everything you need to know about the
