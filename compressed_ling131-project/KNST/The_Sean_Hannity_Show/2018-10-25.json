reason you can do this yourself from the reason you can't do the others just wires stop and think about it you have a house like let's say you're going to have thirty different sensors throughout that I'm just picking a number of every one of those things about that but why are run to what you want to do that you're not going to do\nThat you're going to hire some team to come out and run a site survey and then they're going to run the wires and you're not going to want the wire steam so they're going to have to be behind the wall or taped up the base boards or whatever that means miniature construction you're not going to do any of that\n[noise] and then when something goes wrong with wind up those wires that might trip the whole system or at least provide a fall somewhere you've got

in Indiana a will be watching and waiting the whole time they don't look to let me tell you what the worst news is in the you know we've been watching all of this happened\nYou know all of this incivility that we've been monitoring and the silences been deafening it's just been especially deafening from Democrats and the news media\nThey've been unwilling to criticize things they obviously should criticize and it's been going on two years this this is not a new phenomenon it takes on different forums it all started with Donna I Wanna I Dream an awful lot about blowing up the White House\nAnd deteriorated from there and deniro wanting a punch the president in the face and Joe Biden wanting to punch the president taking mind yard and then fight it out and Duke it out\nYou know this is the Democratic party Hillary can't be civil Eric Holder kick them\nWe watch what's happened to Pam Bondi secretary Nielsen Sarah Sanders entered kids Ted Cruz and his wife Mitch McConnell and his wife multiple times boulders now being thrown through the office window of Kevin McCarthy the house majority leader\nI mean and there's been virtual silence\nAnd we have this terrible incident that we have been watching where you know these suspected mail bombs you know thank God of the ten that have been sent a they haven't even confirmed bullies that they're real bombs I assume that they are thank God none of them went off\nBeing sent to several prominent Democrats around the country we do have one instance where Republican is being threatened we didn't have the the two instances of Minnesota with two Republican candidates were punched one\nGuy got whole ... from the ... behind that a concussion that's going to keep him out of commission for six weeks you know we're living in times where the hypocrisy reeks the media Democrats they only care about Russia collusion if Russia collusion involves Donald Trump which it does not\nBut then when they see all the evidence emerging that Hillary bought and paid for\nRussian lives by funneling money too from a law firm to weigh up research group that then hires a foreign national that makes that won't even stand by you know his ridiculous stories of hookers\nUrine ... beds in Moscow and Donald Trump years ago in under oath the says I Can't confirm any of this it's just you know well it's fifty fifty um it's raw intelligence what do I know\nAnd then that still becomes the basis to commit fraud on Pfizer court and then it still becomes the basis of you know these role upper echelon not\nRank and file big difference you know the structure the pages the ... the ... of the world et cetera you know all writing Hillary's exoneration she should have been put in jail or tried but then she gets to continue than she spends the money on the Russian dust ca\nAnd then when they can't be Trump even by disseminating those lies to you we the people well then they go the next step their insurance policy which is even though Lisa Page said there was no evidence of Trump Russia collusion and struck said that\nThere is no there there well then they start immediately strategy leaking again the same Clinton Russian dot CA and that becomes the basis of the appointment of Robert Mueller\nAnd then we go off investigating people's loans happily applications good grief it just as pathetic but they only cared about Trump Russia collusion media ignored that\nThen the media when it comes to judge Kavanaugh and the new Kavanaugh standard which is guilt by accusation all that to only is applied towards Republicans\nBecause I haven't heard Camilla Harris Spartacus or Dick Durbin or you know a Senator Feinstein or any of them ever demand an investigation and FBI investigation into Keith Ellison\nThat's fairly recent and we're real evidence real text messages a real tape real doctors' reports none of them have said we need an FBI investigation into him\nThank goodness the people of Minnesota are paying attention 'cause that matters\nYou know again it's it's it's there's just hypocrites only care about Republican Russia collusion that doesn't exist not Hillary collusion they only care about stopping cabin all but not stopping\nYou know Allison are not stopping the recent allegations based on the cabinet standard we'd be calling for FBI investigations into Corey Spartacus Booker\nOr Bill Clinton himself up we're going to go back forty years\nAnd the rape allegation with Juanita Broderick it others\nAnd then we take it a step further you know they only care they don't care about violence the threatening violence against the president or listen to this montage of everything that you know just a small one I can go on for hours of all the things the media didn't get all worked up about listen\nYou cannot be criminal with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that is why I Believe if we are fortunate enough not being liberal\nWith a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back the house and during that ... he can start again and he had any second an elevator

the incidents this week in New York\nWe don't underestimate the difference even one person can make\nTowards our collective safety and neither should the people of New York city I Want to reiterate as I did yesterday\nAs they do any time we talk about far reaching investigations of this nature of any other kind that nothing we do with law enforcement we do alone for a joint terrorists taskforce comprised of professionals and the agencies you see here today and others were investigating all of this with great precision\nThat can say with certainty that we will identifying arrest a person or people responsible for these acts make no mistake\n[noise] New York city's intelligence and counterterrorism kind of terrorism capabilities are second it on every day the air and not just this week or detectives and analysts are constantly poring over the French dream as we proactively deploy or resources around the city as needed\nAnd you're seeing that today too out of an abundance of caution will tell you that when we look at the events of yesterday and today\nI have a mensch pride incredible work the men and women are the NYPD do each and every day especially when it involves partnering with the organizations represented here today are concluded by reminding everyone that law enforcement professionals do not care about the politics behind these acts\nBut we do care about is keeping the public reserves safe that's it that's the job fighting crime and keeping people safe and through the fall and willing partnership of everyone who lives and works and and visit New York city who make the safest large city in the United states even safer Mr Mayor or\nAnything of any substance comes out the only thing they have said as the bombs had a powder meaning some type of explosive

Know how horrible it is my thoughts and prayers go out to anybody that is involved in this it's just wrong I Want these guys put in jail for as long as possible\nAnd it shouldn't they should not have to be said no conservative I Know what ever support this horrible act or this type of violence depravity\nAs a president condemned it yesterday um\nNobody knows who's responsible yet everyone's rushing to judgment like they usually do\nWhen they can politicized something you know is this has now been unfolding you you watch people assigning blame or to all political rivals especially President Trump and they go to Fox News then talk\nRadio and it goes on from there meanwhile we have heard the plate some of it in the last hour play some a bit later in the program today the most

I walked off the CNN uh they stuck\nBranded in the middle of broadcast they said that he was going to talk about the device that was ... which I thought was a good idea\nThe general public some insight as to profiling packaging whatever the case may be a and then he got on for it had been a blast of the president I just think it's bizarre I took his way over the top I think\nThey're going to you know what happened in Bernie you if you're sitting on the set of CNN explaining in detail than you left and they send cameras following him for ten minutes\nI ... what happened I was on the SAT we were already introduced to do a segment on on the devices and the investigation and then then you have to ruptured and said that was going to speak about the specific device being sent that was set to CNN and his name um but then he got on\nAnd he went on this had been a tirade against the president\nYou know I didn't have any objection to him being on I thought this was a guy that has credibility in the agency that could talk about profiling could talk about targeting could talk about packaging could talk about what to look for give the general public some real insights\nAs well but Brandon is referred to the president as a traitor and Britain is up to his eyeballs and all the corruption involved in the deep state\nAnd he went on a tirade against the president so I took the earpiece off I took the bike off and I walked off and the producers chase me down the block trying to get me to come back they were calling me but you know what an office enough already ... listen\nThis is a time you need to unify the country like Giuliani and I did in the aftermath of September eleventh this is not a time for division\nAnd CNN and granted we're at the max dividing uh the the audience that was watching the show\nThere is no conservative out their Sebastian Gorka ... nobody ever\nIt's not being conservatives that have been you know saying things I Dream an awful lot of blowing up the White House\nUm it's been Hollywood wants to punch the president in the face and showing ... heads of the president and those that talked about a killing the president et cetera um that's been the rhetoric of the left the media's been virtually silent it's ... it's Republicans and conservatives in\nYou know secretary Nielsen Pam Bondi and Sarah Sanders now Henry Kissinger Kevin McCarthy's office a Boulder is thrown through it\nUm and Ted Cruz and his wife and Mitch McConnell and his wife ... you know we've been saying that we better be really careful here I've been saying for weeks now going back to the Capitol hearing so I was saying we better clear the halls of Congress\nSomebody's going to get hurt somebody's going to get killed and no one will hold you know the rhetoric gets ratcheted up\nAnd then those people that were silent when it's a Republican\nNow or oh this is outrageous we can't have this kind of rhetoric and this is this is horrible he can't say fake news they are fake news\nThough they are and we need to keep using that phrase and I'd also like to congratulate the commission of just doing what he did yesterday that was a cabin or moment whether you stood up the truth I I just like one person on the list of who it is CNN anybody\nTell me which Republican which member advisory media all the political leadership\nMade political profit\nFrom are you going to solve is willing to shooting Steve Steve ... which Republican member of the\nThe pop the all the media profit to personally profit for his side of the rice and off the white powder was mailed to the Trump family members of the cabinet off the individuals were\nThat happened three weeks ago President Trump FBI Director re a defense secretary Mattis and and the CIA director hat all all had rice and mailed to them\nThe way I've had white powder mailed to have a\n... over the years I mean it's a horrible thing that anybody has to go through we all want to catch his ever responsible here uh but whoever it is is not somebody that would be that we would know as a quote conservative and it's just some nut job or some lunatic on what it doesn't matter what their politics are\nWhy why is it OK why is it okay for CNN to run high runs a day blaming Donald Trump for not taking responsibility for these attempted letter bombs why is that okay when was the Republican profit from congressmen actually getting shot that\nAt a baseball field very close to where I Am spending about\nBy left wing activist\nThis is this is the double standards that the average American see through and this is why we're going to vote down ticket Republican on November to six because they had enough\nOf the lives of the double standards\nYou know it's the same thing burning and I agree with Sebastian that\nYou know it showed a lot of courage what you did yesterday but I've known you so long I Know that's who you are and it comes second nature to you you don't even think about it I got to take a quick break more with NYPD Commissioner Bernie Carrick more with Dr Sebastian Gorka and more of your calls and then later on\nCongresswoman hopefully soon to be senator from Tennessee Marsha Blackburn

could make one free phone call and learn your best price for nearly a dozen highly rated price competitive companies well that's exactly what happens when you called select quote life\nFor example Georgia's forty\nHe was getting sky high quotes from other companies because he takes meds to control his blood pressure but when I shopped around I found him a ten year five hundred thousand dollar policy for under twenty five dollars a month I'm select what age and dance to be you know and believe me\nGoing up against a rifle a and a guy hidden behind a barrier\nNow that basically is is is a suicide mission to save someone else's life that's how brave watch\nOr listen to these men and women do it all the time it's just like the better weather shift a joint terrorism task force now or the FBI the New York city police this New York state police\nOr they're going to go out there a risk their lives ... personal responsible for advice as though I I Want to preface that if the devices are real\nI I don't know I I'm I'm starting to have a a real including that\nThese may not be real could buy a ... and if that's true uh were a lot better off nobody's going to get hurt but I find it really suspicious that you've at eight or nine of these things so far it usually the trigger Beck and there's a for these devices is the actual opening up the package\nWell there's been several open and none of them have data which tells me there some sort of problem so I Hope it they're not real um and I hope the the authorities find up sooner or later I think\nThe way to do this we're gonna search go because they have so much now forensic evidence here I'm assuming you know we we talked about this yesterday that it well none of this is easy but I'm I'm assuming by now they probably have their eyes on somebody\nAbsolutely absolutely by said yesterday you'll have general probably twenty four to Seventy two hours a day in and I stand by that there's that nor nor nor much of an enormous amount of evidence\nThat there have been able to capture because these things to knock that day and I think we'll see some good so All right Dr ... you'll be all last word today\nThe bottom line is we run these people to ground we released ... how we throw the book of them but it doesn't matter what side you're on\nThe the responsibility for the mobilization of violence\nAs Bobby on the left when you have the former attorney general who worked for President Obama say when they're down you check them when you have Hillary Clinton say we're going to be civil often we win the election nobody on the right says that it's the left responsible if you could ...\nI Want to thank you both a Dr Sebastian Gorka congrats by the way I knew or knew best seller why don't you try to Feeding America is a

thing to do um but with that said um now it is a to point raised two polls I've looked at\nOne with mansion up and the other with his opponent the attorney general of West Virginia Patrick Morrisey up and that means that West Virginia is now in play that means that Joe Manchin can be replaced\nA joining us now is the attorney general from the great state of West Virginia Patrick Morrisey sir congratulations there seems to be a very big comeback I'm early polls didn't look good in the beginning but I guess maybe we're getting more accurate polling as we get closer to a election day\nWell Shawn thanks so much for having me on and I think what you're seeing in West Virginia is that voters are really focusing on\nDifferences between the candidates as you can see from my ads I'm a conservative fighter will help advance the Trump jobs agenda and mansions or dishonest Washington liberal the more and more people\nDrilled down on mansions record he's starting to lose support so we feel very good and we're going to win on election day we just have to keep out working on the way we out you\nKnow I was really worried during the Obama years about our friends in West Virginia because of the the burdensome regulation driving coal miners out of business\nAnd it was one of our our best resources and we have clean coal and we have\nYou know people brave enough to go in the minds I have great admiration for anybody that does that because frankly you know you go so deep into the ground and it's dangerous work but it's but energy in the life a lot of our economy and\nOnce Donald Trump got elected which by the way would have never happened to Joe Manchin on his way 'cause he supported Hillary Clinton um you know look at what happened at the state of West Virginia all those coal mining jobs are coming back thank God\nWell thank goodness for President Trump and I have to tell you I spent a lot of the last six years suing the Obama administration uh Shaun we were the office that took the lead nationally to go against the Obama power plant one that very big victory at the U.S Supreme Court\nAnd you look at Joe mansion Joe Manchin supported Hillary Clinton even after\nShe said we're going to put a lot of coal miners in coal companies out of work so on the issue of coal on the issue of life on the second amendment there couldn't be a bigger contrast in America that between two candidates and the more people are hearing about that the better off we are and I basically have help serve as a rage\nTo President Trump's really strong policies that West Virginians really appreciate and so that's why the president's coming very strongly behind me he knows I'm going to be a staunch advocate for his agenda because it's good for West Virginia\nYou would know better than I probably should have looked at before having you on today a I meant to actually at one point what percentage of the time those Joe Manchin boat with Chuck Schumer and the Democratic

Hannity show eight hundred nine four one Sean is our number Paul is in Ohio Paul you're on the Sean Hannity show glad you called sir\nYes sir thank you for taking my call what's going on how are you\nA good good first of all want to thank you for your exposure of the left and liberal for you know who they really are\nUm uh the reason I'm calling today is concerning a repeal and replace Obamacare\nA I Know other stories or you know kind of taking the lead now but we really don't hear a whole bunch about a repeal or replace much anymore it was just wondering if you could give us an update about Republicans are doing\nIf we in two weeks we have a ... a more Republican senators which I think is very very possible and\nWest Virginia being and plays huge if we can hold onto the house you know doesn't matter what the margin of we hold on which is far more difficult I'm worried more about the house races than the Senate races\nIf we can get those two victories I guarantee you that Obamacare will be repealed and replaced and then we're going to happen by the way preexisting conditions a big lie that's being told all over the country\nOr the Republican bill dealt with pre existing conditions nobody is going to be denied coverage because they have a preexisting condition but\nYou know innovative solutions like we've been talking about I've been able to get Dr Josh ember atlas MD in front of a lot of politicians that all love the paradigm he's created in Wichita\nHe's duplicated in and close to five hundred cities now and that is fifty bucks a month unlimited concierge care for adults Ninety five percent productions in in pharmaceuticals\nOr even breast cancer medicine certain medicines he's getting for six bucks a treatment for people\nAnd you couple that with catastrophic care which is very inexpensive in case you have a heart attack a cancer or a bad car accident\nAnd you have the best concierge care you ever dreamed up twenty four hour access to a doctor or your primary care doctor you get your check ups every year you got great productions and pharmaceuticals and\nIf something really really bad happens you have the hospital care at a very reduced rate because it's it's catastrophic it's only for the worst case scenario and it's much less expensive so I think all of that health savings accounts there on the table and I'd love to see that for every American imagine\nConcierge blue ... concierge medical treatment for every American we can do that but it's not going to happen top down from the government you know or if you block grant the money to the states where you have you know fifty states have been ...\nLet me tell you what's going to rise to the top those they're going to want to turn over every nickel in those states to make it work for the people of those states or they're not going to be in power and I think that is far more economically efficient so there are a lot of good ideas I was disappointed with the Republicans last time we know John McCain had a chance to to fix this and decided against it last minute\nBut does the president's not done the individual mandate is done thankfully things to the tax bill that was passed\nUm but we've got a lot more work to do on it absolutely just like you need to fund the border wall that's also something that'll get done if we hold the house and Senate in in twelve days are but I'm focused on these house races all say it again\nEvery single house race matters some more important than others we put up the most important on my website ... dot com\nAnd the top races that are going to tip the balance of power in the house of representatives but you know if you don't get out and vote in every ... we have four hundred and thirty five house races in play here\nIf you think your guy said go vote even if your guys behind go vote\nDon't take don't leave it to chance Democrats are going to come out as soon as we have history working against us\nBut I Do believe that we can pick up the Senate seats look I think we can win Florida we're a little behind them Florida with Nelson and with the Centers for governor Marsha Blackburn is going to join us later she can and should win Tennessee Claire McCaskill should lose to Josh Hawley a Dean Heller needs to hang on in about\nA we definitely need more than ...

I'm tennis fans want to say fairness and trees and respect for others and respect for differing opinions and ... respect for the rule of law and abiding by the constitution and what we have\nA fish are resistant should face and focus Democrat Party is oh well that ends will justify whatever means sit where we're using and people are appalled at how they are conducting given south\nI saw the British ... first reaction to the tape of a his staff calling people of the people of Tennessee ignorant and by the way Tennessee happens to be one of my favorite states Nashville like right at the top three cities in the country and I\nWell that's because they all they love you in Nashville in Tennessee you\nWell I mean even bigger I live ... miles south of Nashville are just off a sixty drive\nAnd I used to go up to Nashville all the time I ... I Love music city and I love the people of Nashville and I've got to imagine they were pretty insulted a and a little bit shocked that somebody would be that duplicitous behind the scenes and then when he he said well those are just college kids volunteers and we find out no that's his full time staff\nAre I'm sure that uh he was embarrassed again\nI'm certain that they should have been embarrassed whether or not but of course he didn't they start saying\nWell if it ... it was our campaign my campaign that put somebody in there which is not this was a project their toss project but they started saying well all these other excuses but the ... they got caught they got caught saying we made this decision\nBecause we want to go to people about where he is don't worry he got it kept crap when he gets there\nSo you got to say this that and the other in order to get him there and it's\nLike as a parent I mean when your kids do something wrong my kids do something wrong which rarely happens ah kidding but\nYou know what it's not um I'm never as bad as what they did but if they try to lie to me about it then they're in big trouble not a little trouble I don't care what it is I can deal with a mistake I Can't deal with you lying to me in looking in my eyes and just outright lying to me and my lines of my kids is\nYou know I I Am not stupid stop treating me like I Am stupid I'm fries it's fresh is frustrated I Swear to God I Swear and when you know darn well they did it\nThat well that is true and in any of our relationships whether it's family members are now that we work with us or wearing church organizations with we expect them to tell us the choice to have that integrity to speak\nThe truth and when you don't then it causes are raft and that is what you're seeing with the brightest and campaigns\nAs people are saying that if she didn't like it you say and what people know about me is that they may not always agreed with me but they are always going to know where I stand\nAnd that is has been central to me as a part of my public service and people expect that and I\nKnow you a long time a congresswoman and I know you'd make a great senator and I hope the people of Tennessee understand that um what are the issues because the economy's doing very well and Tennessee\nThings are looking up we've had two years of great economic growth since Donald Trump spoke president out of the people of Tennessee feel about the president's policies and and the important vote the boats that you will be casting that if you become the next great senator from Tennessee\nPeople those supported the president Donald Trump and say look to see his policies succeeded they want to get my ... going to be a conservative and it's going to support President Trump and his policies say well look constitutional Supreme Court justices and federal judges\nThey want to keep the tax cuts the economy is so good in Tennessee it has the fastest growing median household income in the southeast\nAnd that's awesome battered for you to them fast they deserve a\nTrade yes absolutely and I tell you something else building the wall secure that southern border and it's just caravan marching through Guatemala and Mexico people are saying\nLook secure that border there's a right way and a wrong light to come to the United states we want people to come to write like respect

borders\nSovereignty issues here if they ever get we had\nThe wall up nobody would be marching they would be following the law\nAnd the proper process and necessary betting if they want to come and
