vote for Nancy Pelosi and if you have a Senate race going on in your state\nSo vote for Chuck Schumer the second potential outcome is a split decision\nSplit decision would be Republicans hang on to the Senate gain a couple seats and Nancy Pelosi them become speaker\nAnd Maxine Waters is a chairwoman Adam Schiff has a chairwoman and let's say Gerald ... chairman Elijah Cummings the chairman and it's endless investigations\nInto one of the most unbelievable\nThings that we're watching unfold here\nIs what we got this desperation factor of the Democrats I mean even when I think even when I warn you\nOf what they do every two and four years racist or sexist besides your nose Xena phobic Islam a phobic homophobic you know dirty air dirty water kill children pro granny over the cliff just when you think it can't get worse it gets worse\nAnd the echo chamber if you've ever doubted ever doubted who the media in this country is pulling for just just watch any so called cable news channel besides Fox\nFor thirty seconds because every second every minute of every day hate Trump destroy Trump help the Democrats and if it means falsely accusing the president of being responsible for\nThe synagogue shooting over the weekend and not even tell the people there viewers that while the shooter this mad man power hated Trump because of Trump being so allied and good partners with our closest ally Israel\nAnd the same people you know saying Trump cause this Trump's responsible for this you know it's it it's it's a sense of man this but it also does show a desperation that has now kicked in for the Democratic party they are desperate\nYou know one thing I I think I'm going to talk about pose a little bit in the course of the program today but I'm also on the other hand seems like I'm Talking to both sides of my face I'm really not\nI'm I'm going to tell you to just ignore the polls at this point does it matter you still have a job to do and if you want to to keep the progress that we've had you want to prevent hearing the night of one week from tonight\nAnd one day after one week from tomorrow when we talk about the results if you don't want to hear the words speaker elect Pelosi Senate majority elects Schumer then you're going to have to do something about it\nThe worst case scenario is they can win at all and the only way that's going to happen is if you stay home\nAnd the reason I'll tell you not to pay attention to the polls is because they get it wrong so often\nJust two years ago the exit polls showed that Trump lost Florida he won it last North Carolina he won it that he had lost Ohio he won Ohio that he lost Pennsylvania He won Pennsylvania that he lost Michigan in Wisconsin and he won both of them\nAnd the media nobody they weren't candy because they read these results as I was on the air at five Fifteen I had it before everybody else\nI remember my first break at at the about twenty after the hour I called then candidate Donald Trump and I said somebody's going to come in and about a minute with bad news and tell you that you lost everything don't believe it\nI said I don't believe these polls I said there's no way these polls are accurate\nAnd he goes why do you believe that and and I told them the story about two thousand and four\nWith the media again the polls came back\nAnd George Bush and Dick Cheney and lost Florida Ohio Pennsylvania and it was over\nAnd Dick Cheney called the radio program this radio program at you know on election day two thousand and four or five thirty five and reminded people they still had time to vote because he read the same information that I just read a John Kerry was going to be the next president\nYou know if you go back in you know other polls would they'd been wrong twenty fourteen you know let's go back with the election one week away it's coming down to the wire conventional wisdom is Republicans will pick up a few seats in the house or in the Senate but lose the house I Am painfully slim margin\nOne of the reasons is look if you look at real clear politics that's based on polling polling is not totally inaccurate information there's some things you can glean from polling that are\nAnecdotal maybe the way to put it helpful in other ways right now real clear politics has the Democrats are two hundred and five seats locked solid\nOr leaning Democrat it has leaning Republican lock solid Republican two hundred that's a five seat difference but because Republicans have the majority\nOf ah right now that means that they have more seats they have to defend is like thirty seats that they called toss ups that can swing one way or the other we've identified these we put them up on Hannity dot com you can check it out for yourself and the only thing that can make a difference is if you want\nThe progress of the last two years to continue\nYou get to decide how you're going to feel a week from tonight I mean when the when you watch called back the media in twenty sixteen this five Fifteen they were getting\nWell it's pretty clear Hillary I think there's going to bring on our presidents Frank Luntz who's reporting from Times Square at six Fifteen and I'm watching him it's over Trump lost it ain't happening\nTurned out not to be true it turned out the polls were wrong and I'm not criticizing Frank he was reading the polling data I had read the same data so if you don't have the sense of urgency\nI don't know what I can say or do to give it to you but the media is all in on helping the Democrats get back the house and the Senate and they're doing everything within their power to make that happen because they've handed Trump since the day walk down the escalator with millennia\nI think it's worth noting now that conventional wisdom\nDoes not exactly have a stellar track record this is where I urge you to be cautious about the polls and don't let the polls influence your motivation here\nBut there's not only were they wrong and twenty sixteen they also wrong in two thousand and four they were way off in the last midterm election remember Republicans were even saying oh because Ted Cruz's fellow buster oh we're going to get cleaned out in the Senate that didn't happen\nOne year before the twenty fourteen midterms the media insisted the GOP hopes to recapture the Senate were dead on arrival because in October Ted Cruz had filibustered Obamacare and shut the get government down for sixteen days good for him makes me like Ted Cruz more\nExperts such a short us a hundred percent certainty in twenty forty Republicans are going to pay huge price when the twenty fourteen midterms rolled around Thirteen months later the geo ... not only won back the Senate they did it with a nine feet\nSenate landslide\nNow remembers the night went on in twenty sixteen media was kinda Getty but then that getting this began to\nGive away to a little bit of a little bit of nervousness I think we got it still but ah yeah get a little tighter than we thought isn't it\nAnd then I turned into what all out melt down depression collectively\nBy the media and they couldn't believe it because you we the people shocked the world all that but an old for it's happened and fourteen and it happened in sixteen no reason it can happen in a tea\nYou should do it for no other reason because you want to keep America on the great growth growth trajectory we're on and maybe for another reason to watch these idiots in the mainstream media these sanctimonious\nA self righteous they're not news people advocates that they are the extension of the Democratic party they're going to lose it if the house remains in Republican hands and Republicans picked up a number of Senate seats they will lose it just like they did

this guy was posing as a developer or he went and he paid for Andrew at least a thousand dollars for that ticket that an illegal gift ended up itself Andrew never ordered it\nThis developer wanted a zoning change in Tallahassee and sure enough later he got that there were text messages release were that an FBI agent is a tax thing that the main lobby a buddy of Andrew saying really appreciated mayor coming through ah why\nWasn't he got arrested isn't that buying influence and corruption\nWell there is an ongoing investigation I mean that's the thing I think that um uh we don't know what's gonna happen because this has been going on for quite some time they've been gathering a lot of evidence Andrew also the same lobbyists that arrange that New York ... get paid for for night stay in a luxury Costa Rica villa for Andrew Gillum\nAndrew didn't pay a dime at that and then Andrew turned around and gave that lobby is a two million dollar contract to do a restaurant in the city of Tallahassee now we know in addition to that thousand dollar ticket\nThat the agent gave the Gallup the FBI agent also under wrote a forty three hundred dollar dinner for Andrews campaigned on twenty sixteen that was never reported what you need to be and so the question is\nAnd you can't report after the fact that just basically covering your track so CYA so it'll be interesting to\nReport it at all the only reason we know about it is because there's an ethics commission investigation of Gillum and in in a response to the subpoena uh one of the lobbyist attorneys\nThey use that for the public so forty three hundred dollars and then at least a thousand dollars for Hamilton Andrew says he's not under investigation but Sean you tell me what other reads and what an undercover agent have to do those things if he wasn't investigating mayor Andrew Gillum\nWell let me ask you to two days ago\nIt was the political reported that apparently his running mate you know claimed that quote Jews nailed him to the cross and read the text message to you know apparently it's now out there many you know people in in South Florida apparently are pretty angry at this remark\nAnd er which seems pretty anti Semitic to me as he's standing by this\nBook I think it's reprehensible Andrew Gillum pick this guy knowing that he had done that but here's the thing about Andrew Gillum\nHe is aligned himself with some of the most anti Israel and anti Semitic groups in Florida including this radical group called the dream defenders which is a leader and the boycott divest and sanctioned movement targeting Israel they actually say Israel the genocidal apartheid state and so that's one of the Andrew strongest supporters\nAndrew to this day\nOpposes having our embassy in Jerusalem he opposes recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's\nCapital and when a Israel fought back against the Moffett fats and may ah\nGillum blamed Israel he said oh they just use those attacks as a pre K to be able to do a disproportionate response of\nWhat what is that really vendors organizations that he won't disavow\nThey're one of the most radical organizations in Florida uh they they believe that the police and prisons have no place in justice\nAnd that the police needs to be funded they paid they said to us is the biggest bully in the history of the world that our military needs to be caught\nThey if they favor or replacing what they consider disaster capitalism is their words with socialist principles that are so radical it'd make Nicolas Maduro flush\nSo he signed their candidate alleged gang that he would support a this radical manifesto so that just who he is he believes and what they're doing is endorse them personally and uh it would\nLose a tape of him I guess that was discovered in June saying that he's pleased I'm proud to sneak food to dream defender activists during a thirty day sleeping protested the Florida State Capitol\nReferring to the twenty Thirteen month long anti gun protest or after the Trayvon Martin George Zimmerman case and I hope you keep at it and he supported them but you're saying that there are radical group\nWithout question I mean they they are anti law enforcement they're anti free enterprise they're anti military um they're anti Israel uh I don't know what I mean like that may be a group you would want to be aligned with if you are running for the mayor of the Gaza Strip but\nNot for governor of Florida\nWow well let's go over a little bit of his his background and the proposals that he's making but he's I think it's fairly extreme\nA number one he was endorsed by Bernie Sanders that speaks volumes to me there's a lot of outside money uh reports that he's getting money from the left wing billionaires like George Soros the George Soros really spend one point two million in this race in Florida to help him\nOh yeah I'm probably much more than that at this point now\nHe says that he supports Medicare for all I Am a champion of treaty health care and as a right not a privilege so he wants what nationalized healthcare\n... the bill he supports what abolish Medicare and Medicare Advantage for seniors enforce them on a single payer\nGovernment plan it would eliminate everybody's employer based coverage and force them on a government single plan so it really a fan the arrangements have millions and millions of Floridian that he thinks it's appropriate for government to take away health benefits that people have burned and to force them to be on this single payer plan I think that'd be a disaster\nHe wants to raise the corporate tax rate forty percent of forty percent increase ... what's that going to what's the impact that's going to have on Florida businesses and Florida workers if the businesses pack up and leave\nWe will lose jobs we will lose businesses and we're also I mean you know shock because everyone who works in high tech state they're always thinking about relocating to Florida we have a historic opportunity to really capitalize on that when I'm governor buddy Andrew has his way\nHe'll stop the flow of investment coming into Florida because people are going to invest if you have the highest tax rate in the south east and actually he would raise it to be higher than New York\nYeah and he also was the first democratic candidate Nash nationwide I read to call for the abolish meant a vice is that true\nHe supports abolishing ice and impeaching President Trump\nAnd he wants to eliminate Florida's Stand your ground law\nYes he wants to impose on while biting Floridians a duty to retreat so somebody up a criminal is attacking you you have to run and try to hide rather than fight back\nYou also support legalizing drugs in Florida like marijuana and others yes he does\nWell I mean it you're just looks like he is Bernie Sanders on steroids that down there I mean I've got to believe would this controversial background that looks like an almost a phenomenon that the media's just pushing for him and pushing for him\nAnd his record I only spent about a half hour and I was able to dig it up it wasn't that hard to find and it seems like most of the media is ignoring who he really is\nOh without question I mean the day he won the primary particularly the national media you know they've tried to elevate him and try to make him into this great candidate a they do not like the scrutinize his record or the fact that those bought him a bad relief after he lied in the debate last Sunday or the media kind of had to cover that ...\nAt the end of the day he has been given very kid glove treatment so really falls to me and other folks to go out and make the case and let people know and the good news is just weren't Floridians figure that out or they definitely don't want him as their governor and so we're going to keep making the case for the next week\nI'm worried about our friends not only the recovery uh uh thoughts and prayers go to all our friends in the panhandle\nUm uh but the panhandle to so many people whose lives have been up ended and disrupted and some people losing pretty much everything they own and they now moved out the panhandle happens to be one of the most conservative areas of Florida are you concerned that people\nFrom the panhandle of going to be able to get their hands on a ballad maps and tea or otherwise would maybe be part of early voting is Florida doing anything to assist in and help those people that have been displaced would want a vote in this election because Florida is their home\nThey're doing a lot ah everything from mobile voting sites to accommodations for absentee ballot\nYou know the bad news is that you said it was a terrific stormed the good news is I think all but about Fifteen thousand homes are going to have power by the weekend\nA which we weren't sure could happen that quickly um and I know the rest of the folks there is a combination is being made so are they are resilient people in the Panama City area um and I know a lot of them do want to vote and so they'll have the opportunity to do it\nYeah I'm a ... the devastation once again to the people there how long do you look at rebuilding not part of Florida and some people I looked like a tornado would wiped it out\nYeah look I mean it it's going to take time obviously with me coming in as governor I'm going to have to deal with it and take off were request off I Will say though um had that gone forty miles west of the population would have been much bigger\nI'm so there is damage and its extensive damage\nBut I think can damage in a relatively limited area is there's a couple area that got hit pretty good so we know what we got to do and I think we'll be able to go in and do what we are the president has committed to doing any

will even continue\nAt a greater clipping a greater pace you know so now what's happened is somehow we forgot that what eight years of Obamacare Americans slowly beginning to forget\nThat their premiums are have gone up three four hundred percent in some cases forgetting that they only have one choice of a health care provider forgetting that they lost their doctor from long ago that they really liked and wanted\nAnd they forget that people with a preexisting conditions well with Obamacare you pay more\nHigher premiums than any other plant\nRate hikes that nobody ever expected and they lie to you about people losing their doctors that was a lie you like your doctor keep your doctor people losing their plans with no choice anymore and this has now become and the final week of the election this is their talking points all across the country they're saying well we're\nWe're going to ... where we support healthcare preexisting conditions\nWhile the Republicans repeal replace plans supported preexisting conditions and they're trying to basically go with the narrow lie that Republicans want you to die\nRepublicans one dirty or water dirty air they want to kill children they want to throw granny over the cliff of course they're racist sexist massage those thicken Xena phobic Islamic phobic homophobic oh and by the way Donald Trump's responsible for the horrible shooting at the synagogue in Pittsburgh\nAnd Donald Trump's even though the guy that shot up the synagogue he's hated Donald Trump\nFor being so supportive of Israel let's not let facts\nGet in the way of a good propaganda lie in an election year well anyway Republicans now we're beginning to listen and not only are they listening to the fact that repeal has to happen but also direct primary care what I call concierge care for every American at that this is now gaining momentum\nAnd I've had conversations with numerous members of Congress in the Senate as we move forward and\nThere are a couple of plans that are percolating one would be block renting money to states so that they can become\nYou know the fifty outlets of a new innovative medicine and they'll turn over every penny because their political futures will be dependent on it\nWhich would be a good thing Gavin Newsom wants universal free care for everyone he gets X number of dollars good luck with that but in states red states with
