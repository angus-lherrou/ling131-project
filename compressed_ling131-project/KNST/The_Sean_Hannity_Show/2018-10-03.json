would be drug in young girls teenage girls and lining up in the halls and raping them and then of course she gave for names to\nNBC News and well NBC News didn't find one person to back up or story one of the names was dead and another name was somebody who said I have no idea who this person is and they still ran\nThe story and then of course backtracking on a on a variety of issues significant issues of the story that she just released a week a week prior how does that become news and yet that is what the media now does that were perfectly happy airing that interview\nAnd now she's saying well well they weren't exactly wind up in the hall um well he was in ... no I saw him near the punch bowl and he was given out red solo cups too people\nThat's not drug in girls on a nearly weekend

America\nAnd that you would you promised you would vote\nOn ten specific items in the first hundred days of what you did accomplish that task and Republicans for the most part with a few bumped pickups in the road\nHave been in power since um how to Republicans now I think the anger of the bases beyond anything I've seen in recent years rightly so over what's going on with the Kavanaugh hearings and the Democrats\nDemocrats don't have a vision for the future we had I ate horrible years of Obama we've had two very successful years of President Trump what is the pitch what what should the Congress men and women and senators be saying\nWell first of all the president has done a great job he watches various trips such as Mississippi will be in Minnesota and he's laying out the case\nThat if you want results you have a team called Republicans\nAnd if you want resistance you've got a team called Democrats and he's been laying up and and you see it in the numbers than people realize the lowest unemployment for African Americans in history lowest unemployment for Latinos\nA continuous economic growth many good things that are happening and I think the president has set the stage now to pit and spent the last five weeks\nTelling us what's coming next we got this much damage you know ... I loved the vice President Pence and like you said America's coming back he didn't say we're back yet because we're not\nWe still have a lot of work to them but we're coming back\nAnd now you have a chance for the president's leadership and I think this election ought to be about which kind of America do you want us to be you want us to keep coming back\nKeep creating jobs do you want us to control the border to save our children from MS Thirteen gangs from France and all and promote people that are you prepared to be part of a team wants\nConstitutional judges not radical I think if we got campaign could be stunningly successful and we can have as much fun on election night as we had in two thousand seven\nWhy I mean I hear optimism in you that I look I'm going to be honest I don't quite share it I'm not there with you I think it can happen I Believe it's winnable I Believe the Republicans can keep the house\nI think that Rick Scott can win the Senate in Florida I think Republicans could defeat Joe Donnelly in Indiana a a ... a Joe Manchin of West Virginia\nA Claire McCaskill in Missouri I think they can beat Heidi Heitkamp I think Martha ... a great candidate out in Arizona I think Dean Heller can hold the same no matter but I think they're all tight races and then you've got then we've got about fifty competitive house races which could tip the balance of power there\nSome course that is probably have campaigns\nBut we've got we've got thirty five days out here to go out and when and and I remember it and you remember 'cause you were there to thousands sixteen two weeks out I Do an interview with Megan Kelly and she's telling me how we're going to lose ... we're going to lose Michigan we're going to lose Wisconsin I said to her we have to alternative universes\nIn my universe I Believe the average American is so disgusted with this resistance oriented left wing radicals and\nI think the average person knows when when you hear Democrats say they're for Medicare for all their time destroying Medicare they're talking about destroying your health insurance they're talking about bankrupting the country and I think that we just have to go out and wage campaigning I must say\nPresident Trump is doing as good a job of getting out on the stump telling the truth laying it out as anybody I've ever seen\nAnd I I Believe in the American people my optimism grows out of a belief that the average hardworking decent American his disgusted by what they just saw happened to Kevin ... is is committed\nTo a work ethic due to a better future and as the Democrats get more radical I think you're going to see the Republicans continue to do a you know for example a government run health care means tax paid abortion well\nThey're very few places in America where there's a majority for your tax dollars paying for abortions and I think we have to be fair to tell the truth play into it in a direct way and if we do that we're going to have a very good election night\nI got to take a quick break from our nation's capital more with Newt Gingrich on the other side later on Joe diGenova Victoria Toensing and much more as we continue from

saw him around the punch I won't say malls or the punch container is\nI don't know why he did but I saw him by them or their friends who remember these parties to remember how I think everybody in the

anything to the punch\nUm this is so reckless irresponsible NBC how they would ever dare run this is beyond any comprehension I have now if they had confirmation if they had witnesses\nThere wasn't a changing shifting story if there wasn't dramatic backtracking they might then have some legitimate reason to air this but because\nThey want what the Democrats want which is the smearing of judge Kavanaugh to continue well they had to air it but even they airing of it made them look really really pathetic\nIt's not fair there are ... and I'll tell you the other thing there are victims people I

and well he wasn't standing in line but I saw him he was in a whole um that is so over the top\nAnd the fact the media would run that interview with so many inconsistencies in all cases no corroboration not the case of professor Ford not the case of Mr Ramirez and not the case with Julie sweat Nick know co-op corroboration\nJoe diGenova Victoria Toensing a with us the gentleman Toensing\n... will be back to the program I'm Victoria and start with you get your take on all those\nWell the new media standard is very very interesting at least for Republicans it's it's you can say John Smith rape somebody oh we can't prove that we don't have anybody else you don't have any witnesses so we're telling you you know what our problems are with our story but nevertheless\nJohn Smith rape somebody named that's that's what the media is going with Johnny I it's really important that your listeners should know about what happens here in Washington when there's a high publicity investigation because I was involved in one in the Nineteen eighties with Ronald Reagan's\nThe CIA director bill Casey and it was all over the the papers out you know how soon we all forget about these things\nBut it I was with the Senate intelligence committee and we got fetch far ranging bizarre accusations about Casey Casey met me in a park and held me up with a gun bill Casey took all my stocks and sold them kept the money for himself I\nMean they were just radically out of a wild and that happens all the time and these investigations and you know what we didn't make any of the public and even the Democrats back then did not make them public and yet we have Kamala Harris\nI'm I'm told she's a lawyer she was the attorney general is a California She's supposed to know due process [laughter] she released an anonymous chain do\nAccusation that's how the person signed it about Brett Kavanaugh of committing some lurid sex acts is there no just corn left in the U.S Senate anymore aren't going to sanction her in any way\nOh Alan Dershowitz was saying that isn't the case of Julie sweating that can particular that\nIf in fact she you know she made these statements and they're probably falls that he would want a full complete investigation into perjury allegations um you know Joe I I I don't know what the law enforcement should do I do know this\nI Know that we have now examined every single case\nIn every case there is no corroboration in every case there is multiple inconsistencies in the last case Julie sweating like there are so many inconsistencies in his mind numbing that NBC would ever aired that interview\nBut they are today anyway the eyewitnesses are the witnesses she mentioned one is dead one doesn't even know who she is and they can't get an answer from the other two and now the last minute 'cause they're desperate now they want the FBI investigating ice throwing incidence in high school\nWell I think um what has happened\nWho truly sweat Nick is that the Senate committee after the confirmation vote occurs needs to make a criminal referral\nTo the Justice Department or the U.S attorney for the district of Columbia to investigate her for obstruction of a congressional proceedings by submitting false affidavits and for perjury is written testimony very easy to investigate and it has to be done in order to send a signal\nTo everybody out there that you cannot simply make false statements to a congressional committee and the confirmation process to get yourself of liberty is very very important that miss what may\nBe investigated by a federal grand jury\nTo act as a deterrent against others from making false accusations there is no substantiate for her story\nThere is most of the education permits Ramirez story and I just want to say something that I Know uh probably throwing you don't agree with she has repeatedly lied I liked her lawyers did not tell her\nThat the committee was willing to come to California to interview her that is a lot for lawyers did tell her that no good lawyer would never community\nOh I got I got to tell you I don't think they told her if you remember in that moment when professor Ford was asked when I forgot maybe it was Lindsey Graham who or whoever it was said we offered to go to maybe Senator Grassley I think Senator Grassley and then\nShe said oh I there was genuine surprise I remembered Dianne Feinstein was working behind the scenes to get a radical left wing activist resistor as a lawyer this is Deborah attach\nNever catch by the way who said well Paula Jones only spend ten or twelve minutes with with Bill Clinton it wasn't a big deal that wouldn't constitute sexual harassment in the workplace and also defended and in the\nCase of Al Franken but I I saw genuine shocking surprise and she goes well but I didn't know that but that was very nice do you if you offered that I didn't know we should\nThey should be referred to the D.C bar then for violation of professional world\nI I may I may very well come to conclude that eventually and I'm perfectly happy to accept that I can buy that and I'll tell you something that really bothers me about her story and as an old prosecutor who tried sex crimes cases\nHere's the one thing about her story besides everything else we talked about that doesn't make any sense any victim in a situation like that goes to where people are for safety now\nWhy what's her story not include\nHer going to those people\nBecause if she had done that\nIf she ... literally if if what she says the Kurds and if she had gone to those people get what they would have remembered that in order for her to have a story that holds up without anybody knowing about it she had to leave the house\nI don't know though and look maybe you know 'cause we're talking about the we all know that there are real evil predators there are people that do murder\nAnd rape innocent people there are people that will drug and rape people I eat look at the bill Cosby case\nWe know that and and this is why I think to the Republicans credit they took these allegations in charges seriously they handled it professionally they afford it every combination which was the right thing to do but for the Democrats they just they just now I pushed this so far\nInto a ... ... ... any allegation\nNo matter how many inconsistencies no matter no evidence no matter no cooperation whatsoever\nAnd we saw that they hated the guy from the beginning I I don't I don't know what I don't know what victims remember or don't remember Joe and I don't know what how they act or react I Would assume was probably ... people react differently like you go to a funeral some people are crying some ...\nI was I was perfectly happy to accept anything that she had to say and I listen to her testimony carefully at the time and his and then I went back and I looked at it repeatedly and it may very well be that he believed everything he said\nThe problem is there's not a sin pillar of evidence to corroborate and conveniently enough everything that could have happened that would have made her story corroborate rubble is nonexistent the shorter than happen that just doesn't happen\nSean ... let me just say well you know we make our living trying to look at stories like this and taking them apart are supporting them\nThere's another problem with her story listen she said that they they're rich music on an upstairs bedroom that's kind of weird because the party was downstairs that let's take it and they turned the music up so nobody could hear her and then she likes to south in the bathroom and she can hear them talking going downstairs what\nYou think these guys and it just turn the music ups and one could hear it went over and then said let's turn it down I mean there are so many flaws in what she said\nI just don't know what look I I it's very hard I don't want to get into that whole last\nI got to take a break we'll come back more
