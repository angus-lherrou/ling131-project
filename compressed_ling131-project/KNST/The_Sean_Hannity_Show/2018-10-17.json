good to have you back I Know this has been your life and your business for so many years um my gut is pretty clear on this uh I think this man was murdered and\nThe most evil route brutal way possible and I think that the president is wise knowing that we're going to get to the truth now there's no doubt we'll go and we're going to have the truth rushing to that point is not smart in my

knowing that there are very different country but\nNow it gets complicated because fall so the Saudis the Egyptians Jordanians the Israelis the United states the Emirates they're all fighting against the Iranian had Gemini and the region and their quest for nuclear weapons and the instability that\nWould cause the entire world um I Know everybody Dr Gorka would like to say that okay we're cutting off all ties with Saudi Arabia were done where this with that um I think this will be consequences severe consequences the president said\nUm but it gets a little rougher what do you do if you're also trying to battle another enemy I mean the United states did partner with our arch enemy is the former Soviet Union to defeat or not the Islam in World War two\nYeah absolutely I mean you you don't make perfect the enemy of the good geopolitics is like politics itself domestically it as the ... all over the possible the over the perfect on on the truth is wrong we have a lot of leverage over

James O'Keefe\nKnow you are hated by people because of what you're doing it there I'm ... I mean I've talked to people on the left they you drive them nuts I mean you give them fit so fury that I thought only I could do\nIs try to see things just auditor discussed and I think one of the things that they're ceding most about that what they're most\nHating right now is the fact that both Claire McCaskill and Phil Bredesen neither Senate candidates one of them as the United States Senate or had been forced to respond to these videos all over the local media coverage you mean it's it's\nIt's critical mass in Tennessee in Missouri their their their local TV stations are calling me\nAnd the D.C journals do not want to talk about this in fact I just got to have like all the Washington Post he's tweeting at me and he's and he's saying well you know she's been public about her some of these position I said what about other things she's saying here but she hasn't been public about so they they very much hate Sean for good reason\nWell listen I when you expose fraud what this is now what's supposed is something that I've been pointing out for a while we have Maxine Waters on tape saying they keep telling me not to say it and Everytime they tell me I'm going to say it anyway impeach forty five impeach forty five\nThen we see the center for American Progress warning every single Democrat running for office told talk about immigration we know we know we won't open borders and eliminate ice but don't tell the people the truth about what you're really gonna do don't tell them what you have is a massive\nFraud propaganda light campaigning being perpetrated by a party that has lost any sense of moderation that has no agenda that they're willing to talk about that ... that is a really scary\nScenario for the country and for people that ... that's the only way they can win is polite and ... who they are\nThat's what the stories about these red state Democrats have been on your show now uh this is the fourth or third third video between Tennessee in in Missouri and one of the staffers agrees that McCaskill quote essentially has to lie to get elected and this is not just one staffer these are staffers throughout her office hiding\nHiding and masking the source of contributions one staffer says it's acting beautiful it's great when it works for us not against us to take the money ... indirect means\nIn order to I guess appeal to moderate to the front page New York times story today about how these\nPro life than pro gun Democrats are shrinking\nConstituency in Missouri the Democratic party have voted these people out but McCaskill still have to appear moderate so that she can get elected so it's it is a truism that in order to get elected in the state of Missouri or Tennessee you basically have to mislead voters to get elected as a Democrat and that's what these stories and cover\nYou know the thing is to me um I think we ... the American people had it when\nThe Democratic party a band in any sense of due process under the law equal application under our laws you know immediately I Believe her but they also said the minute cabin all was announced we are going to oppose them any way by any means necessary\nAnd then went all the the the allegations are getting more severe more severe and everyone's saying well I Believe her not even want to hear from judge Kavanaugh presumption of innocence at all and when corroborating so called corroborating stories fell apart they still didn't care\nAnd I think the American people are watching that we have a story out today where you've got these anarchist middle class of benders attacking to Minnesota GOP candidates are assaulted one is a woman\nA name as state representative Sarah Anderson punch by an anarchist trying to stop him\nFrom taking her campaign side\nI mean this this is now the Democratic party and you're exposing it and the ... and yeah you're going to be hated but\nI think ... shining a light on truth I thought this was the stuff that sixty minutes used to do\nWell undercover McCaskill statement McCaskill Claire McCaskill issued a videotape state which is unbelievable and they play loaded on your show last night and she said the number that quoted she says well it started with Josh Hawley that's her opponent would be part of fraudulently abetting someone in my campaign first of all I categorically unequivocally deny\nThat he does not work for me he does not work with me I've never spoken to any of these candidates I stay\nAway from candidates I investigate candidates but she just went on TV Sean Claire McCaskill just falsely stated that Josh was involved in is the attorney general Missouri was involved in this and then she says three times I committed fraud will will walk by what recording the people being honest that's brought\nIn their own were there and there are some\nMy words I'm not the one who said quote get over it this is a direct quote for staffers next to roast about how she's going to impeach trumpet you can tell the moderates to get over it after she gets elected that's their words and she's calling me a fraud stir for telling the truth to the American people it's the job of investigative reporting\nTo expose the truth and and I think she didn't have to respond to her response because it's filled with lies and innuendo an accusation\nI'm just glad that you were able to get all of this out and before the election um why do I suspect that there's probably going to be more tape other candidates well I have known you know what for a decade or more\nThat's right yeah I mean ... you know am I Am oh a pun intended Missouri now you know my ... next\nTo release the candidate a bit of the time we have to the United states senators and their candidates opposing them responding to our investigative work we're lying in their responses were sort of you to send me Lenski tactics against the ... the Lenski was to get the reaction and use the reaction in the reaction to the reaction\nWe have two reactions now and we're going to the next state will be releasing another video early next week in a very very a battleground state same theme Sean ... they have to lie and then once they get elected will do deal bait and switch through\nAnd do what they actually intend to do and it's it's just on videotape stopped my words not my", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "Tucson", "day": "17"}
