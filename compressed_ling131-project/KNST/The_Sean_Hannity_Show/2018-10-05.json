does not exist today\nAnd if anything we appear to be moving farther away from that it is pre K. currently worries though that the Supreme Court\nThe institution that most Americans see as the principal guardian up our shared constitutional heritage is viewed\nAs part of the problem through a political land\nMr President we've heard a lot of charges and counter charges about judge Kavanaugh\nBut as those who have known him best\nHave a test that he has been\nAn exemplary public servants\nCoach husband\nJust by the turbulent bitter fight surrounding his nomination\nMy fervent hope is that Brett Kavanaugh will work less than the divisions in the Supreme Court so that we have far fewer five four decision and so that public confidence in our\nJudiciary and our highest court is restart\nMr President I Will vote\nChicken from judge Kavanaugh betting given extra credit\nI think one of the more amazing speeches and I I Am now it's actually interesting because as a tomorrow I Begin my twenty third year on the Fox news channel\nAm I Thirty years on radio that was one of the most thoughtful speeches I think I've ever heard and I'm frankly shocked I'm\nSusan Collins over the years is frustrated the living daylights out of me were opinion so I think what stands out more than anything else\nIs the the students here come the amount of gravity that she gave to her decision and her speech and the gravity of the moment in in a an bringing literally\nA sense of sanity\nTo what has become an absolute so she said circus around the country\nAnd systematically went over every single aspect of her decision making process from George cabin on his judicial temperament the questions that he's specifically answered her passion about uh especially\nThe night disagree with their own on roe v Wade but on the issue of constitutional precedence the role of advice and consent\nAnd the respect that she is showing the constitution the process and the whole process of a role of what it means to give advice and consent\nNow with Susan Collins yes and Jeff Flake thing he is a yes on ... and all that now brings us to\nWell Lisa Murkowski simulate ... know that brings us to fifty a what forty nine fifty one forty nine yeah so\nThat brings us to forty nine\nReally all comes down to I guess at this point Joe mansion and\nLisa Murkowski and Lisa Murkowski appears to be a no and I guess mansion could be the yes\nIs our math right on this who else is outstanding at this point is everybody else I think is on record\nYeah\nNo I've got to believe I think Joe Manchin and by the way I don't think it'll be a surprise he voted yes two two and a to start the debate the thirty hours final\nVote a that'll happen mansion well here we go just broke Manchin is voting yesterday confirmed judge capital the vote so they're\nForced the Danes as that is supposed to walk his daughter down the aisle tomorrow in the middle of this vote I don't know how they're going to work that out somebody better lend them up a private plane has some kind of to get them over there\nUm what I did mired I think the most about this speech is the pressure under which Susan Collins has been\nThere is literally in Maine going on now and by the way Maine is not exactly one of the most expensive media markets but she talked in the beginning at length about the process and what this has now become a and talk about it being a a gutter political campaign\nAnd millions of dollars in people and groups of people pledging to destroy her and to feed her an upcoming elections et cetera\nAnd hum wow this is pretty amazing\nI was just an amazing speech eight hundred nine four one showing us auto for telephone number Lindsey Graham is going to join us now at the bottom of the hour or I mentioned boating yes plate voting yes and now Susan Collins voting yes which means the boats are there to confirmed judge Kavanaugh\nI Want to remind you if you have any sunspots over the summer I mean and flame patches aged ... sunspots well we've got the answer do you can't get it in any store course it comes from our great friends which I'm On the I mean they're the ones that have create a genuine sell to get rid of bags in puppet of Sunday arise now they have their gender cell sunspot director\nAnd by the way you can literally watch the sunspots disappear right before your eyes and it's guaranteed now if you purchase Jen you sell to get rid of bags and pumping there's look to your best every morning\nEntire Murkowski voting no in fact your decision on creating my person I'm ...\nI'm very very very very dear friend of mine very very dear friend of mine and I she did everything cross every T ... died she went to the same process we all did she come to a different conclusion I came to my conclusion really this morning when I went to another hour and a half\n... allegations leave Dr ... I Believe Dr Ford something\nI don't believe facts show that it was ... but I Believe something happening\nOr someone else who did it I think something happened to her I was there was no way no way all which we pay two women who watched this process unfold her doctor for a story\nI haven't I haven't found any way even though they have and the Senate\nHad people come forward I mean just so this is the lead her trauma they want\nAnd I mean my sympathy and they are her and I said hey\nYou know adequate FBI investigation\nIn dabbling in our house and for profit from you know based on what you see it for the FBI was do you enjoy it I think there's always was done I get I looked at it from me and I make\nA decision based on what you see that at a thorough investigation but if it was from I sat there there's\nA lot of people that I was concerned about how they said what they say how they did I did many other places like that and I'm just the west for hours to go with what you're up for reelection a difficult race are you concerned the basement\nRight on this one would have kept up on the Thursday to bother me about the\n[noise] All right that is\nThe uh [noise] well that's the party of Nancy Pelosi up and thirty two day she's the speaker of the house screaming in the background and all the protesting that we have seen in the party of Chuck Schumer and and now we know party that is willing to put all due process aside\nFundamental core values constitutional protections like the presumption of innocence aside\nThat will go along with guilt by accusation I think one of the more articulate moments was in the beginning of of senator Collins speech today and how she rightly pointed out there was opposition from day one\nChuck Schumer was one of them there was nobody to President Trump that was that was going to be nominated that was ever going to pass the get many Democrats from the get\nGo and I do believe that that\nJoe mansion probably a shortage reelection with this decision today but I don't really ... I don't really get the sense after reading his statement in hearing what he's saying and what he's with standing in the halls of the Senate today or that that really much impact that much at all I got the sense that he did it for all the right reasons\nWell as articulated by senator Collins and what was the most rebutting one hour speeches I think I've ever seen on the Senate floor that actually meant something\nAnd now she's systematically went through every single not only allegation but the role of advice and consent the meaning of the constitution the interpretation of the federalist papers um what it means to the whole issue of the process of\nOf a presumption of innocence and and how important it is to society\nOr even issues where I disagree with her like for example roe v Wade in precedence and and judge Kavanaugh was real record she she brought a level of of seriousness\nAnd sobriety to the entire debate I just I I I don't know her and I frankly was blown away by this today and give us some reaction to all this we have David shown civil liberties attorney criminal defense attorney gray Jarrett opposite those legal analysts author of the number one\nBestseller the Russian hoax Greg what was your reaction to that speech I don't know if he had the same reaction I did I was I was stunned I I don't know Susan Collins well but I Know a better today\nIt was nothing short of brilliant\nA week with uncommon eloquence and sound reasoning she delivered the finest speech on the floor of the U.S Senate that that I've ever witnessed in for a non lawyer\nIt was a compelling legal brief in support of Kavanaugh I thought it was important that at the outset\nCollins can damn outrageous behavior the distortions by special interest groups activists protesters and some Democratic senators making it clear\nThat their shameful character assassination backfired on them as far as her vote\nIs concerned and and I I the best part of what she said ah was ... many of Kavanaugh's opinion to demonstrate\nThey'd even Democrats and liberals should be satisfied if not pleased with Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court justice but you know she did something unique here\nShe reported the sexual misconduct allegations\nAnd said in no uncertain terms that presumption of innocence and fairness is relevant in the Senate advise and consent duty and she announced her own standard for considering accusation she said it should be more likely than not which\nLawyers you know in the civil cases is called a preponderance of the evidence\nUh and she said it wasn't there\nThere were no witnesses to corroborate Christine forward including her closest friend nobody has any recollection of it all said so under penalty of perjury so she present ...\nThat was certainly the most impressive I mean her of a real obvious heartfelt caring for professor Ford\nAlso excoriated whoever it was and she doesn't believe it was Dianne Feinstein and she defended both ... and Senator Grassley in terms of the fairness which I said from the beginning I think the seriousness of the allegation deserved\nA serious response from the Republicans and often a critic of them and I think they did handle this perfectly on their side\nAnd but whoever did leak this today grave disservice to this woman and there's no doubt about that\nDavid shown let me bring you in and get your initial thoughts on what we watch unfold you now with the announcement Jeff Flake Joe mansion and Susan Collins it would appear that tomorrow's vote expected to be around five in the afternoon eastern time on a Saturday or that the that\nJudge Kavanaugh has the votes to be confirmed to the United States Supreme court\nBut certainly looks that way I'd like to think that they're calling each\nWrote some dignity back to the process is certainly did for the moment when she was speaking she you know as a student of Senator Bill calling from Maine I was very close friend of mine with whom I disagreed on some issues but it was there he thinks that same vein you're absolutely right what she said with a critically important\nAgain it emphasized the language of article ... section two accredited she'll have the power with the advice and content\nWhat's been lost and all of this also critically important that she emphasized the presumption of innocence you have some legal scholars and commentators during the course of this debate all of a sudden this and one of the presumption of innocence doesn't really apply this isn't a trial it's not a trial based concept in American law that kind of fundamental at rock\nAmerican principle that's the way we go about our business we don't assume based on allegations and a man or woman has built up a career is guilty it was important for that um I worry still I have to say about where we go from here because we have seemed to have here by United States senators and has been beyond the pale and I never in my wildest perhaps naive\nDreams couldn't imagine with hospitable people who simply don't know anything about\nProfessor Ford or judge Kavanaugh who ... carved out of the nation you were a bad guy if you didn't wear black to Columbia Law school during the cabin or hearing that meant you might believe judge Kavanaugh this is beyond the pale these future lawyers um so I worry about where we go from here in the last one I Want to make them this is\nThe very same people who are land back during the printed in for daring to criticize cooking FBI agents who have been proven to be ... et cetera\nThose people for whom stroke was a hero or now criticizing the FBI wasn't affair or a thorough investigation they moved the ball or with their criticism whatever it is for judge Kavanaugh was that he was a sex offender now is not that they don't like is the meter because it took it personally when\nThey don't know they don't like is temperament was once opposed to respond to be a serial drug or ... and gay rapist of teenage girls I I don't know what the appropriate response except if you're innocent just outrage and anger at a level that I couldn't even begin to describe but\nUh it looks like this goes forward it looks like Kavanaugh has the votes that will support his nomination and that this will conclude tomorrow barring any unforeseen\nLast minute you know insanity but I Will tell you we won the issue we've got to deal with and I'm ...

doesn't do a lot of television she's not somebody of interviewed a lot like the most impressive thing that I took away from this is the seriousness the intellect\nThe the systematic she walked every American through her decision making process and frankly it was flawless\nIt was spectacular nothing short of spectacular now I Know a lot of people are spending a lot of money then it's probably only going to get worse for her because she clearly following her conscience on this issue and she had it ... it was\nObvious she missed nothing she had followed every single solitary detail of this\nProcess did all the work you would ever want or expect from a representative\nAnd and now I guess the left is about as unhinged they'd been I don't even think it's safe to walk the Senate halls at this point\nSenator Lindsey Graham\nOf South Carolina I Would argue it would not have happened but for him\nAnd he joins us on our news maker line um you know you told me something when I was in Washington earlier this week\nAnd I asked you I said well what are you know about Susan Collins and\nYou'd you basically describe what I learned about her today I was blown away and I don't get blown away very often I really I'm too cynical I'm from New York I've been in radio Thirty years I'm a tomorrow I start my twenty third year in the Fox news channel\nLook we went through a lot of that success earlier in the program and a lot of it bears repeating by the way I mean these are ... for a million jobs created since the election more Americans now employed\nThan ever recorded in our history unemployment the lowest since Nineteen sixty nine\nFour hundred thousand new manufacturing jobs those are the jobs Obama set a never coming back by the way things are only going to get better with the explosion in the energy sector once they can get up and online and Anwar and and continue coal mining the president's saving the coal mining industry in West Virginia singlehandedly\nAnd once we continue to extract more natural gas in the world would ever need in in three hundred years we have all of those ... resources of fourteen states record low unemployment\nA record low unemployment for Hispanic Americans African Americans Asian Americans youth unemployment fifty five year low median household income\nIts highest record ever recorded\nYou know we have the lowest unemployment rate ever recorded for Americans without even a high school diploma and veterans' unemployment has now reached its lowest rate in Twenty years\nAnd four million people off of food stamps and I can just keep on going and then promises about the types of judges he put on the court and gutting endless\nBureaucratic regulation that that literally hamstrings all businesses in America promoting buying in hiring America actively promoting and asking people to come and build their factories in manufacturing centers here and creating the economic conditions\nAnd the regulatory conditions where it's possible I mean that's why all these manufacturing jobs are coming back\nOr reducing illegal immigration course defeating ISIS\nYou know a course pulling out of that idiotic Iranian deal and little rocket man not firing a missile over Japan every other day\nI say that's pretty good but with thirty two days out of the electorate a lot can happen between now and then John McLaughlin is pollster founder McLaughlin associates shown is with us also a pollster author political analyst for Fox News\nOr thank you both for being with us or we can see I don't know if you want to call the cabin on balance or the cabinet awakening there's in every single state now Claire McCaskill is down significantly and the latest poll in Missouri\nJoe Donnelly is in trouble in Indiana Heidi Heitkamp is down and eleven in her state of North Dakota or I say that Rick Scott will be the next senator from Florida and then of course Martha ... has been surging lately uh where do you think it stands at this moment John McLaughlin\n... I I think you're seeing a a definitely a cabinet effect but it's really what it is it's three gauge whether Trump voters are showing you know you're done and I talked about two years ago how Trump had to bring new voters and to to win the election and we did\nDonald Trump ignited millions of voters who came out and voted in twenty sixteen that didn't vote and twenty twelve that took a pass on Mitt Romney and up until this time up until the hearing last Thursday or those voters were staying home or a good portion portion and weren't engaged\nAnd I think they act it's got to see that the the actual hearing in the news coverage and the character assassination the ruthless politics I think the Democrats had looked ... Chuck Schumer is a really smart strategic senator and he's the leader and he looked at the map and he said this thirty five seats up\nTwenty six or eight hours entering states that that Donald Trump won what can I Do to try to take back the majority\nAnd he probably made a calculation if we can embarrass cabinet that the Republicans pull him it was suppressed the Trump voters so that a good number of those sixty three million would stay home because you only get Ninety million come out in the mid term elections so they they made they hit the Republicans stuck from the president stuck with him\nAnd the Democrats were exposed these voters are now outraged that the Democrats would put such a late hit on and try to mirror good person who would remind them of their father their their their son their their\nTheir brother and said this was totally unfounded uncorroborated there's no evidence to it\nAnd they're trying to destroy this man and his family and the Republicans ... ... the Republicans and independents who supported Trump or coming back out and you're seeing them in these polls that Missouri poet McCaskill behind was appalled that we did for super back she's Downey points now you're seeing this I'm seeing this impulse every day it's\nIt's not a big explosion but what it is is\n... ... soldiers coming back in and get along really well\nAnd if the Trump voters were dying well what\nWas a huge enthusiasm gap just a month ago but less than a month ago two weeks ago two and a half weeks ago\nUm has now totally and completely evaporated and conservatives have been awakened and and by the way Doug shown the party that we saw protesting and the party that Russia's to judgment the party that doesn't believe in due process a party that doesn't believe in the presumption of innocence\nThe need for some corroboration and the party that defended Clinton and defense Keith Ellison a I don't think they're looking too good here to the American people right now and they they are being shown to be the radical party I've been describing for some time\nWas shot I mean I don't quite know how to fly but off your ...\nAnd you can just say I actually agree with your characterization in their handling of all of this has been pretty stupid and detrimental um to you know any sense that they have have any sense of moderation in this day and age\nWell I don't think they have any sense of moderation but what they do have is that I'm going to leave the house which right there you can lead to pick up the house and I think from what I see looking at the Senate races\nThey're all very very close within the margin of her and I really think to get a definitive answer will have to come back and in a week or ten days after capital is I think we all expect\nNarrowly confirmed to see whether the effect job than you\nAre talking about Iran is actually going to hold over time I think it really has to play out and I think there's a good chance that the protests you've seen from the Democrats from women\nLike him or not we'll continue and will ultimately a benefit particularly in suburban congressional districts less\nSo Senate races the\nDemocrats how's it going to play with the voter in the rest of the country not in New York D.C San Francisco and Los Angeles or or Illinois or Chicago how's it going to play with my writing of America I think it's very differently\nI think the the real challenge is the one John raises I think it starts right will this re engage the Trump voter I think as of today probably some evidence that that\nIs gonna inside twenty point enthusiasm gap just a ... in sixteen days\n[noise] let's let's let's wait a week Sean and we'll see where we\nDon't think this leaves a bad taste in people's mouths what they did and said this man on for support for ...\nAnd everybody who like poor experimenting Arlen than big loss\nThat you know what they did to this man and how they bludgeoned this man and his family as as bishop says they ban with no due process and for once you know how critical am of Republicans they took it with the seriousness the topic deserved they handled properly\nThey looked into every crevice in corner and we still have no corroboration now do we believe in the presumption of innocence or not you proud of the how the Democrats handle this\n... ... ... if if I can voiced support for you perhaps she'll give me a chance to do that I went up I said this is somebody who has my own a judicial legal and philosophical differences\nWith a stretch capital I Would not be voting for him but I Do think showing that you are correct that the way this process has played out depresses me as an American first and the Democrat second\nFound that are now or wait and the Democrats winning the house but was thirty plus thirty five [noise]\nWow that's a huge production for the Democrats um I don't think there's any scenario that I could discount thirty two days out of this election I think anything can happen and I hope the American people see what they were electing and Nancy Pelosi Maxine Waters and Chuck Schumer that's my of my biggest Pope John McLaughlin\nI think you're right and uh uh in terms of its its just four weeks up over four weeks ago a lot can happen but I Will tell you that the key thing is Donald Trump is putting the Republicans on his shoulders and bringing them across the finish line in that he's bringing his votes to bear\nBut it is voters are coming back out but the key thing is is to real opponents right now or Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer she needs to take them on they are going to be a nightmare if they get control either house a for next year so we've got to do is support with national survey ahead of fifty five percent unfavorable rating\nI mean fifty five percent will be a landslide for the Republicans and they could they could hold the house so right now we're headed to gain seats in the Senate but it's too early on the house and and prior to cabinet looked like we are going to lose the house but uh uh with that kind of a negative on policy\nFor her to be the leader to oppose Donald Trump every day for the next two years to his reelection you need to take on every day about them wanting to raise taxes on the economy have open borders having having a back to the elites where the swap around the country got\nSo uh if he does that over the next four weeks the Republicans could hold the house and they'll definitely pick up Senate seats\nAlright thank you both John McLaughlin and dug shown eight hundred
