Florida the first of eleven rallies in eight states before Tuesday's vote scientists Evan brown is live at the hurts arena\nJust the media blaming Trump now understand that the shooter hate Trump\nThe shooter hates Trump in large part because he's such a staunch supporter of Israel and yet that doesn't stop them\nFrom collectively losing their minds ramping up this hatred and rhetoric blaming Trump\nWere the synagogue shooting but yet the guy involved in the shooting hate the president in large part because he is so closely aligned with our closest ally Israel\nTara for in this country is white man most have been radicalized ... up to the right and we have to start doing something about\nIf you stop say mean things about me I'll stop and citing angry lunatics to kill you you know whether the\nPresident knew what he was saying the alleged gunman certainly heard something that resonated with\nTrump is doing is soaking in citing for the purposes of political power\nThe worst amongst us to take action in his name to anybody who sits there and says it there is not causality between these events any insight mensch is dishonest as they are blind\nI don't think you have to be a rocket scientist to rule the lines between these people and the rich Rick that as being ... by the presidents of the United states for the races\nFor any time I think that he's totally tolerant of racial violence in any medical followed\nIt is oh factually a lie because the guy hates Trump all the\nEvidence is there why he hated Trump hated and because of his support for our closest ally Israel how many presidents promise to move to the capital of Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem where it belongs many none had the courage to do it except this president\nYou know it's amazing when you listen to the prime minister of Israel spanking the president no president has gone as far as to say we will destroy the enemies of Israel because there are closest ally just the opposite of what they are reporting and what they're trying to do look\nIt would've been dishonest and I said at the time when Bernie Sanders supporter of went out there and shot Steve skull east on the ball field and and shot up these other innocent people you know it it would have been it would have been wrong to blame Bernie Sanders\nBernie is not responsible for what one of his crazy supporters\nTo he's just not isn't it's intellectually dishonest to suggest such a thing\nI said it at the time and I even had at the time this is not some accommodation or rational they would ever give it if it's a conservative just the opposite in this case you don't even have a Trump supporter and they're still blaming him\nI mean you know it's it is it is what it is the biggest donors to the Democratic caused this election season is the media\nIs universal almost at this point they hate Donald Trump every second every minute every hour every day it is hate destroy Trump at all costs\nYou know the whole lie about Russia collusion it's just what I've been saying they don't care about Russia collusion unless the Trump\nHillary bought and paid for ... full of Russian launch used to disseminate propaganda and influence the American people in the lead up to twenty sixteen it was it was used to get Pfizer warrants unverified uncorroborated Russian\nLies that even the own even the author of the\nOf the ... even stand by let me tell you something let's remember when the media bashed Trump a lot of them were moving the embassy to Jerusalem\nAnd the president went against it in many ways what is a new alliance forming that could be maybe at some point God willing\nA path to peace in the middle east one server all because of the threat of Iranian had Gemini in the region now caused an alliance was unsinkable maybe just a number of years back with Israel the Jordanians Egyptians the Saudis the Emirates putting aside what Saudi Arabia recently did\nI mean if there was an emerging alliance here because of Donald Trump in large part and what he's done but I Will tell you you know let's play Joe Scarborough Joe Scarborough was lost his mind I honestly I don't I don't even it's inexplicable\nThat this guy has evolved into what I think is just he's he's lost any sense of reality all of these people in the media they don't even see what\nBlind hypocrites they are how they are guilty of the very thing they accused Trump up their rhetoric that they fame moral outrage about but they are guilty of\nHe's been he's been playing the race card I he said I'm a nationalist David Duke comes out the next day

history books and look at some of the most important regimes in the twentieth century\nMight as well be certain countries talking about gypsy ... lines up historically exactly with what certain countries we're talking about when there's hunger gypsies and Jews [noise]\nYou know I mean I don't even know what to say anymore you know Don Lemon last night or the night before whenever I think it was last night listen to what he says\nSo we have to stop demonizing people and not even I think\nBiggest terror threat in the country is white man most have been radicalized for up to the right and we have to start doing something about them there is no travel ban on them\nThere was no ban on you know they have a Muslim ban there is no white guy band so what do we do about that\nI just I don't even know what to say you know and then their morning host adjusting the Trump and the synagogue shooter using the same language\nTerm messaging we'll start with the president so he seems to be going in on the two pillars of the media continuing hit the trail and attacks against and migrants\nContinuing to ratchet up the language about them just and and frankly I mean I have to say using some of the same language that the mass murder at the synagogue used in terms of the dangers and\nInvasion for these tragedies working at cross purposes narrative so it's hard for him to celebrate his narrative a villa flying migrants when again the alleged mass murderer did the same thing\nAnd I don't I don't even know where to go with this you know joyous bay hard not even on her show the view but on conspiracy TV MSNBC\nYou've also as time has gone along with them as as cars out there who not only\nThat such a cycle I I've I like the guy in a way it was like oh he's in your character he's not a Republican or Democrat he's just an anarchist decides on that [noise] and I don't mean that in an ad hominem side [laughter]\nNah not at all let me tell you what it means they are afraid they ... look there are three scenarios as I said for election night\nWe'll be examining the results one week from today on this radio program and there is an unknown factor here anyone that tells you they know what's gonna happen doesn't\nThere is there's not one outcome to be very Frank with you that would surprise me one week from today when we gather here to talk about the results but I Do know this I Do see fear at a level that is unprecedented\nThey never saw Trump coming they never understood that the election day twenty sixteen they were in a state of\nShock and it was not only shock it was

clear politics too old for locked in seemingly leaning likely Democrat on the house side and a hundred and Ninety nine locked in Republican side you have all these thirty some odd races that are now going to tip the balance of power for the house\nConventional wisdom says that Nancy Pelosi becomes the next speaker I don't look at the polls quite the same way Nancy Pelosi picking out the drapes\nA

Iowa's third district we gotta fight going on there a lot of outside money coming in as well against David Young\nAnd he joins us now apparently you know I Love these people in the Democratic side they're all saying the same thing health care health care whether we welcome to the program David Young appreciate your being with us but\nThey have people that gave us that they give us Obamacare he'd be a doctor keep your plan and save money\nWell that proved not to be true right and so they want to double down on health care Medicare for all sounds great but what does that do with the the deficit and debt and rationing health care it's risky for seniors because they should be the priority when there's Medicare and so there's a lot of scare tactics out there Sean\nAnd what I'm hearing on the ground is we have to keep the prosperity going the economy going the way it is we have two point five percent unemployment rate in Iowa shots\nAnd correcting the record with these lies and it's textbook cookie cutter messages from Nancy Pelosi across the country and\nThat is scaring seniors regarding Social Security Medicare nobody's acted to cut that and then lying about their they're not being any protections for those with preexisting conditions and we have those protections for layers of it in our Republican health care bill\nYeah a lot of ... listen lying is just a part of it the playbook of the Democrats is always the same I even think it's gotten worse in a look at this this horrible terrorist attack in the shooting took place in the Pittsburgh synagogue and\nWhat does the media but I don't they're blaming Donald Trump port and meanwhile the the guy responsible for the shooting hated Trump in large part because of his\nAnd abused it last and used it more for the advancement of human kind around the world paying the price for freedom\nIn so many different ways than the United states\nSo much at stake here eight hundred nine four one showing us auto free telephone number we'll check in with some of the other you know tipping point races throughout the day Newt Gingrich is going to join us while he's going to stay the hour and we're going to take calls and the second half hour the next hour get his take he's a little more optimistic than me I just don't know\nWhat I have a feeling there's always this question\nDonald Trump is changed all the rules in politics I don't think a lot of Trump supporters are going to be telling pollsters they're going to the polls I don't think they're going to take the call and if they find out as opposed to they're going to hang up because that's what I Would do but I've never gotten any such call\nUh All right let me remind you want a great night sleep I've been telling you about my pillow you fall asleep faster you stay asleep longer All right now they've really done themselves\nThey have my pillow for your entire body and it's like sleeping on a cloud it's my pillow for your entire body is called the

the woman who thinks it's okay to join the Taliban for Americans to join the Taliban after nine eleven and every other bizarre thing she said about the people of Arizona which he calls the meth lab of democracy and the people are crazy\nI'm so I'm just hoping it happens that way and then on the outside you got tester on the bubble even I'm Joe Manchin on a bubble in West Virginia and Bob Menendez on a bubble\nYou know it's interesting I was looking at the different levels you have members of Perry on the state where the Democrats should be safe because his personal guilt or when the\nSenate Ethics committee on a bipartisan unanimous majority find him guilty of a whole range of things I in some very very unsavory rumors that were built around all of that now so he says he's now in such bad shape\nThey'll Kevin deport millions of dollars that they'd like to put somewhere else more prone to get back in New Jersey because he can really really good candidates\nWho is a great their CEO

out to vote\nAnd the campaign convincing Democrats than there are so sick of\nMenendez and they just stay home that many actually saved three or four house seats in New Jersey that's the kind of dynamic where I frankly I Can't figure out of my own head\nWhen you go from state to state to state uh how these things are involving right now because they're very ... very much about them here and there are I think people know nobody listening should assume\nThat this was over or you can stay home and then they feel about run out and voted done which ended up not that would have by election day do not do anything else that day to vote it's that serious\nLet me let me ask you this because it lets go with real clear politics and they have to wonder written for the number of house seats that they think are safe for the Democrats and about one Ninety nine for the Republicans\nOr work with the Republicans have in the majority all of those toss ups puts them on defense than you did have forty five retirements for the Republicans that's a big number in any election year\nUm the house is what I'm most worried about and you know the thought of Nancy Pelosi being speaker elect and then speaker of the house once again is a pretty frightening thought um\nWhere do you see the house going\nWell not functionally ah I I my personal range is between the bottom of about ... ...\nWhich would mean below sea which speaker and hiring them around to twenty to thirty which would mean that Kevin McCarthy I think would end up with speaking [noise] um and I can't I've been in all honesty you know I've always been candid about these things I Can't give you a more accurate number I Can't say to you\nKnow I Can't either I really can't I mean and I think now and and look the conventional wisdom is Republicans will hold the Senate pick up seats there and let them see below sea would win the house\nUm that's not a great case scenario but that would be sort of like a split decision by the American people also say one other thing is you know some House Republicans have earned the wrath of their voters but it's really not about them it's about stopping an agenda that we know is going to be about impeachment endless investigation raising\nTaxes they want their crumbs back a sanctuary cities open borders eliminating ice and keeping Obamacare\nKenya one who does not bode\nHands effectively voted for him she should be no one should kids themselves\nIf you didn't want to have Nancy Pelosi\nAnd they're hard to have to house and people like congresswoman waters in charge of the financial services

services um she go down the list and I think to yourself\nAnybody says I'm tired of it all you don't like to know why should sort of a I'm not going to vote not voting using affect a half a vote for Nancy closer to the next week um and I think that's good\nYeah I'm I'm Still a ... there were four hundred and thirty five members of Congress all of them are up for reelection\nAnd every race is important and the idea is no this is the either stay home or you vote for the Democrat you're pretty much voting for ... the the same in the Senate races\nYou know you vote for John tester you vote for Claire McCaskill you vote for Christ in cinema you vote for Bill Nelson you both for reticent in Tennessee you're\nVoting for Schumer and I know that it's probably not the way these red state

look America's gonna make a choice there is now a movement that has\nEvolved Mr Speaker out about it argue from moderate Democrats or I think it is one party one voice leaning solidly socialist left\nVersus those that believe in our constitutional republic limited government greater freedom less government intrusion into our lives I think that is the fundamental disagreement\nWith Clinton was into vision of two totally different Americans you know there there are Americans one in which we don't teach American history to be American or will not proud of the white no sense of who he could count on a motion to leave the star Spangled Banner\nUh and uh you know we're just one more normal country though to be subordinate to the un and you're a crash\nNo wonder because we're the wealthiest country in the world are we ought to be paying huge amounts of money to other folks are because they'd like to be wealthy chew on this tiny chance that they don't have the money that like can I mean it's it's amazing to watch in serious um\nThese folks are and how much they would basically undermining America for the purpose of variety unless\nThere's a lot at stake I think the most you know if you're barely pay close attention the Democrats stand for nothing except painting Trump wanting their crumbs back open borders not anything that's going to improve the lives of the forgotten men and women in this country but it's just ... he spent a lot of time with us today we really appreciate it thank you and five or six days now till election day I'm sure\nWe'll talk before the election and afterwards and get your take on the results so thanks for being with us look forward to\nEarn eight hundred nine four one showing us our number are so when's the last time you and your family just gather around a table and play a game together I Know probably maybe never in some cases\nMay sound old fashioned but you got to listen to me the new board games that are coming up they're really amazing and you got to try it one I've been telling you about which way Druze it's a party game\nIt was the first time in eighty years since FDR ran for president did we had a democratic nominee for president when Orange County and found that Democrats think we're vulnerable and that's why they hit zero zero in on us\nWell this is really interesting because most Republicans you don't think of California races being that important but now it's become crucial in terms of\nIn a we've identified all of these races on our website Hannity dot com um that they're really focused in in which means that could be a very late night or early morning before we eventually get to know who controls can or the house\nOr come next January and it could be Nancy Pelosi this is a real threat and I think a real possibility I Would say the fact that you have two hundred and four save democratic seats a hundred and Ninety nine safe Republican seats and all these thirty some odd toss ups\nAre are Republicans on defense that means they pretty much have to run the table and that's why they're spending all those money\nI'm can money ... exactly\nYeah so tell us about you know what are the issues there and do you think the people in your district the forty fifth district of California are paying attention and are are being influenced by the money and the negative ads\n[noise] yeah it's a real clear choice in this race I mean you have\nUm a a district where people want to continue to this America forward I mean we had the lowest employment in forty nine years that you know and in orange county it's the lowest unemployment it in Nineteen years\nPeople have more money in their paycheck uh people are able to get jobs consumer confidence is that I mean we are really moving this country in the right direction that the choices clear do you want to continue living uh America forward or do you want to go back to the Obama era\nToo where are you at overregulation where you have high taxes you had government in your life and I think it's a clear choice in what we're seeing right now on the early returns\nOr is that the Republicans are just as energized as the Democrats are and in fact in my district we have over ... fourteen point advantage on the ... the return over the Democrats\nSo we aren't seeing this so called blue wave that you hear about we see that our voters they're just as an energized\nWell I think it look if you look at the Senate Republicans have decided advantage and a lot of these races where they're red states that support Trump by big margins\nBut the houses just harder to figure and I don't know if people fully completely understand that there are a lot of headwinds history runs against the party in power they have forty five retirements that's the case for example Darrell I used to see\n'em and I you know I'm assuming with gerrymandering and and the legislature out there in California they do everything they could possibly do to maximize the number of democratic seats from the state\nAnd uh so it makes a particularly hard for people like yourself that have done a good job and want to do a good job with the people in your\nState and in your district but uh you know you're fighting against the state that has a Thirteen and a half percent income tax with a democratic governor of that or democratic lieutenant governor running for governor who wants to free healthcare for anybody whether you're a California resident or not whether you're a citizen or not\nIt's a very challenging environment and to be from California and representing California either or for reasons why we need to make sure our voters get out the so that we don't lose any Republican seats we have fourteen members of Congress right now\nAre on the Democrats have thirty nine\nAnd sell it is really really important that we hold our seats we've got to turn the state around and you're absolutely right I mean the liberal policies that come out of Sacramento Jerry Brown and now possibly gather news that\nUh it is getting more and more it's four to ... to live in the state and we need to have it get to the point where that pendulum swing back and I'm going to continue to fight for my constituents that can can you to fight for Californians until we\nOne of the problems is that you will ever have swinging back is people are so fed up with the regulations and high taxation of states like California and New York Illinois and New Jersey is they are leaving and they're taking their money with them\nAnd you know my only fear is when they go to Texas or Florida or the Carolinas or maybe a lot a lot of cases Nevada or that they leave their liberal policies with them when they leave and and don't bring the failed policies that they voted for in their states\nBecause if you look at it it's become unsustainable for young people in California they can't afford to buy a first home they can't afford the high rate of taxes unless like you were in Silicon valley making crazy money\nYou're absolutely right and you know one one hope I have is that Supreme Court decision Janice versus asked me where you know if you're a member of the union you no longer have to pay your is\nThe unions can troll Sacramento and if we're allowed to have a couple of election cycles we may start to see that many go out of the hands of that at the unions that may give us a fighting chance at some point in the future and the state of California\nI got to tell you something there is a fighting chance I Wish you the best out there I Hope people are paying attention Southern California\nYou now have and this is the headline which I think it's pretty scary Michael Bloomberg spending millions or California Democrats than in tight races and one other article came out said literally spending ... million dollars just on Southern California so\nUh we wish you all the best is is Mimi Walters California's forty fifth district a and I wish you the best on election day and Dana Rohrabacher and all these other Republicans in Southern California these races all will tip the balance of power and if you vote for anybody that's a Democrat out there\nIf you swayed by these ads you're pretty much voting for below sea hold the people in those districts do understand that so anyway thanks for being with us\nThank you so much\nOr I Hope it works out for you\nKnow fun running for office who wants to run for office these days are All right let's go to our phones or we have so much going on today six days out of election day\nLet's

house races in uh Minneapolis ah in well in Minnesota for this race um that are going to tip the balance of power like Southern California it's interesting New York New Jersey\nOr places like Minnesota Wisconsin Michigan California you know state you wouldn't expect that's where a lot of these tossup races that I keep talking about our um look let me ask you when you move to North Dakota
