...\nOr apparently some people are taking that seriously Claire McCaskill's husband being accused of some type of meat to issue out there in Missouri and you notice the double standard it's everywhere\nI'm here's what is anecdotally something that I think should give you a lot of hope um and I don't make predictions I can only tell you this if you want to prediction it's simple Rick Scott is in a very very close tight race in Florida with\nBen Nelson you know but Rick Scott has done a great job for the economy down in Florida and through a great job as a senator but he's also run is you know notoriously close races down in Florida\nFlorida's important Florida I think he won his races by one percentage point each time and and each time he keeps proven the people of Florida that maybe not the best politician with the best gift of gab or schmooze or but boy when it comes to getting the job done when the people of Florida need Rick Scott he's there for you\nAnd the same with ah we've got it for whatever reason the media's fall in love with Andrew Gillum down in Florida\nAnd you know Ron dissent this about are the great debate last night and he is now fighting to to prevent Florida from getting a forty percent business tax that Gillum would support\nGillum his use some of the most harsh rhetoric against police that I've ever heard before he's fairly radical in his views is trying to hide it just like every other Democrat is hiding who they really are they can't be elected\nBy being honest with their constituents in who they are what they believe in what they really want to fight for we saw that with Brett is it and the project berets as tape and the great state of Tennessee anyway you know run the Santa sees in a fight for his life down in Florida\nWe've got Marsha Blackburn who's going to be a fantastic senator from Tennessee but\nYou know for whatever reason bred as it is out there trying to convince the people to Tennessee that he is something that he is not that he's a moderate liberal and these tapes blew that out of the water as they're calling the people of Tennessee ignorant people in his office and saying that his public position on Brett Kavanaugh\nIs just for show and we saw the same thing in the tapes in Missouri with Claire McCaskill\nYou know we've already found out she was a phony but now we really know she's a phony she goes on a an RV tour of Missouri except she's taking private jets Phillips is an RV tour\nWith with wings unbelievable\nBut some anecdotal evidence now there I think the Kavanaugh hearings I think this caravan is now becoming a massive campaign issue\nAnd just the fact that there's seven thousand people that are marching towards our southern border to create some type of confrontation oughta tell Americans what the party of sanctuary cities sanctuary states the party that wants to eliminate eyes open borders means\nWhen you look at the amount of money illegal immigration has cost the American taxpayers it is in the billions and billions and billions of dollars because if you're in this country illegally and you're arrested for something we paid the criminal justice cause\nIf you go to a hospital hospitals not going to not take care of you we pay the health care costs we pay the educational costs when your kids are in school nobody's against illegal immigration\n... nobody's against immigration everyone's against illegal immigration we're saying we have a process\nThat we have sovereignty and we have borders and they deserve to be respected\nAnd what does it say about the people that do go through the process legally improperly that's now coming to the forefront at the president's call for a wall is right sanctuary cities and states are wrong there's been so look at the crimes committed in Texas alone when I was down there for that security briefing with Rick Perry\nI mean the six hundred and forty two thousand Texans alone victims of crimes some very serious including murder\nI mean it gets downright scary now we have more instances Mitch McConnell over the weekend confronted some guy banging on his table at a restaurant taking his leftovers and throwing him a throwing those out the the door of the restaurant\nNow it's almost happening on a daily weekly basis we got a lot of new tape that we're going to play for you but I think the biggest thing that people need to know is Democrats want to stop all progress what do they want to take us back to what we know failed after eight years of Obama\nTheir signature legislation Obamacare their fundamental promises which was keep your doctor keep your plan pay less millions of Americans lost their doctors plans and are paying in some cases one hundred two hundred and three hundred percent more than they ever paid before for in theory or coverage\nWe have many states where you only have one option one the health care option that's it\nSo it has not worked out well for the American people it was from the beginning it redistribution scam where you're forcing the young and the healthy to buy plans they never want needed or desired and forcing them by threat of a fine\nTo literally subsidize the sick the elderly and and the disabled or Americans when all they really need is a catastrophic plan and one office visits a year or and they catastrophic plan would be like fifty bucks a month and that's for God Forbid you have a bad accident get cancer and heart attack\nBut the anecdotal hope that I'm Talking about is political even says looks like Chuck Schumer his dreams of becoming the Senate majority leader or evaporating before his eyes\nEven his Democratic colleagues don't think it's gonna happen anymore democratic hopes of winning the Senate have faded in the final weeks of the twenty eight to an election with a party now needing to win every one of the more than half a dozen\nCompetitive races to capture control the chamber it's a far cry from pretty much the last year and a half oh we're gonna we're gonna take control of the house in the Senate\nHeidi Heitkamp seat has slipped away looks like it's going to be a Republican pickup Martha mix Sally is going to join us later I mean every day gets worse for Christ in cinema\nI mean it's just an unmitigated disaster for her I mean you know she thinks it's okay for Americans to join up and support it skipped Mitt treason against their country and support the Taliban we've got that\nWe've got her on tape saying that her state of Arizona the people are crazy and it's the ... lab of democracy and then of course you know attacking border patrol people inviting radicals like the lawyer for the blind shake into town\nAnd meanwhile Martha ... Sally twenty eight years of service serving\nCore values that this country was built on a due process and presumption of innocence they also believe that we are a nation of laws otherwise why have the\nAnd Americans instinctively don't like the idea that people think they can march right across the border into our country we don't know who they are we don't know where they came from in some cases most cases we don't know what their intentions are\nNow the president has already said we're going to begin cutting off substantially or substantially reducing foreign aid or Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador\nAnd he says every time you see people illegally coming are attempting to come into the country blame the Democrats for not giving us the boats to change our pathetic laws and that would mean building the wall that he wanted to build that we can get done or the president just spoke out about this will play it when we come back we have a lot to get to more than ... much more straight ahead\n[noise]\nHearing comfort and film and he smiled any greatest catch for kids brings all three families with children with special medical mean hospital treatments can be scary\nEspecially French Army and he created for kids from the front room is hearing therapies and community programs reach over thirty five hundred people providing relief minimizing offering free of charge\nMore about how you can have\nAny way to do our genes confide to own three the early ... sixty five\n\nWhen you were tired of the paycheck from your job will stop but you know what most on utility bills medical bills in taxes just to name a few [noise] so what can you do you can call martini and more financial strategy Marco show you how to develop another stream of income that can last just as long as you do kind of like creating your own personal tension\nCall market two nine six four four six four or on mine more at bat dot com by contacting as you may be provided with information regarding the purchase of insurance products including annuity license in Arizona won three one six one one zero so much\nUse on Houston hours looking through the windows in your home but have you ever really looked at them like how effective are they do they offer safety and security and here's what\nAre they energy efficient well Tucson window and door looks very closely window and they've got windows that can cut your energy bills in half decorator windows for every look and windows it offers the ... the insecurities in Tucson window and door his two sons from your window at least the company and say no windows\nLip Tucson window enjoy give you a free no obligation I\nJust called to nine eight or nine eight or call now and see how beautiful secure and energy efficient windows can be live more comfortably in your own home call tonight eight V.

military to be on standby for possible deployment orders to the U.S southern border\nI mean this is in every word you know I remember I think Michelle Malcolm wrote a book years ago called invasion\nThe American people I Know the Democrats they're thinking this is their moment this is good for them I don't I don't see how any of this is good for the\nDaily Caller has a piece out saying that the majority of people in the care of on not ... that are headed to the borders are not as is being reported families including women and children\nAbout instead they're quoting multiple reports that this new way above a caravan hers is comprised quote a mostly young men who appear able bodied and could easily fend for themselves back in their home countries video footage posted by Telemundo news shows hundreds of the migrants you\nKnow by a chain link fence said the Mexico Guatemala borders some of the men scaling offends others violently shaking it causing the barrier to break apart and as the gap in the fence white and then of course a lot of the men from that moment we're able to cross into Mexico\nAnd this is now a confrontation that is coming to the southern border of the usa I'd been down to this border what twelve Thirteen so why wherever many times I have seen it it's wide open\nWhat are we gonna what's gonna happen if we have to send our troops to the border what kind of crisis is going to be precipitated because Mexico won't do their job and now according to some reports is even helping the caravan ... make their way to our southern border\nResident has also said that Guatemala Honduras El Salvador they're not doing the job stopping people from leaving their country and coming to the U.S illegally it is now but down the process of cutting off substantially reducing the massive foreign aid that we give to them\nBut the president's also right in that every time you see a caravan of people illegally coming into the country you can blame the Democrats\n... they're the ones that love these policies they're the ones that have been saying they want to eliminate ice they're the ones that say they won't open borders they're the ones that keep saying they want amnesty they're the ones that like sanctuary states sanctuary cities and sanctuary policies\nThat allow even criminal aliens to come into this country illegally\nWe have one case this was a out

Bangladeshis were detained and an immigration facility though it's not clear what happened to them after their detention the borders in Central America not as strong as the U.S which makes it possible for people from Panama and Ecuador to cross easily\nOr said Anna on Univision they cross from Costa Rica way to go through Guatemala and eventually make it in our country\nAnd yesterday they were traveling through Guatemala we noticed people from El Salvador even people from Bangladesh\nCan you imagine what they had to do to get here they infiltrated themselves in the caravan and tried to cross with the crowd that would have been benefitted them greatly\nUm so you've got the care of and continuing their march now a couple of other things that you've got to understand here is a political thing\nHaving been to the border everywhere from the Rio Grande the San Diego\nHelicopter horseback boats all terrain vehicles you foot I've been out there I've seen even gang members

when he this respect the flag they Iran don't recall when he said America was never that great and they they embrace Maxine Waters when she got harassed anybody support our president\nContracts that isn't for where they want to take the country as we've talked about before with what the president has accomplished at Twenty one month with his leadership in this country taxes regulations down economy growing it for ... percent lowest unemployment forty years course each and cabin on the court\nOut of the Iran deal embassy in Jerusalem it on and on we could go so those are the competing visions those are the ... that's the contrast I think when American step back and look they're going to pick Republicans or we're going to keep the majority in the house\nBetween no due process for Kavanaugh no presumption of innocence for Kavanaugh these are core values that have served as well as a country and then you've got this lawless caravan and I I don't hear a single Democrat saying we've got to stop\nWhat is it looks like an invasion fourteen thousand people just want to run across the border maybe more\nAnd if that happens what's gonna happen after that\nIt's like a party that is basically given up on the rule of law unconstitutional and the values that have served do so well over these many years\nExactly right or the most extreme positions\n... got closer with this comment you got\nFormer Secretary Clinton said oh yeah we'll get civil again once we have power that's not really supposed to be this great nation and like you said before it's sort of tough to avoid the immigration issue when you've got this caravan merging with thousands and thousands of people\nUm I think the president's right when he's talking about you're not going to get your foreign aid if this if this is going to continue and talking about putting hooks on the border putting troops on the board reporting National Guard in order to make sure\nThat we saw what happened last friday in Mexico at their border and then the fence was busted and people come running across now a ... it's almost like we're headed towards a major human confrontation here people that don't affect our laws in sovereignty and the president saying you must respect our laws and sovereignty\nUm no I I think Democrats go in the back of their heads hoping this happens southern all maybe something bad will happen and Trump will look bad and we can blame him as someone gets hurt\nYeah you'd you'd never know I Hope I Hope not I prayed not yeah same here\nBut I Will tell you want on Saturday I had a a person from Honduras\nWho came here legally and when that lady couldn't is that the Republican event Saturday morning in our home town in Urbana, Ohio she came up to me and she said I'm In I'm sick of this kind of stopped she could get the right way she came here legally came here because she loves this great nation wanted to start her goals and dreams in this great nation\nThat's the part that upsets me the most when you see this kind of thing happen and the and the possible politically application\nAnd and motivations behind these things that's what bothers me the most and I think it is\nCommon sense Americans say look this is not how it's supposed to work you want to come to this country and you're a legitimate asylum seeker that's one thing but when eighty percent of the people who show up at our border claiming assign um aren't legitimate or asylum seekers that's a problem that we know that's probably what this this group is is mostly about as well\nWe also have this issue of the mob that no Democrat seems willing to confront on either I mean you know we saw what we watched Ted Cruz and his wife get out of a restaurant by an angry left wing mob we watched it happened a Pam Bondi at a movie theater we watch that happen a secretary Nielsen we watch that happen to Sarah Sanders\nOr we saw Mitch McConnell go through this at the airport and then this weekend that happened a again a let me play a little of the McConnell confrontation and then you have the liberal media you know literally and then we have now Henry Kissinger was shouted down listen to some of this [laughter]\n\n\n\n\n[noise] [laughter]\n[noise]\nKnow I got a Ninety two year old man who served his country it's a\nYou know it's unbelievable you know what the ... you know ... uh what's her name Maxine Waters you you create a crowd you confront them you'd do you tell them they're not wanted anywhere anymore Mitch McConnell leave the country you know then we have you know Eric Holder kick them Hillary you can't be civil with somebody you disagree with\nNo this is this is as wrong as a gift is is not how not on a decent people are supposed to behave in and it is you know where the part that bothers me the most Sean is Dennis Kucinich is a good friend of mine and he is as far left as I Am now is actually a lovely guy\nHe's a wonderful guy he's a friend and he would never act that he will debate the idea that he will show up and have a robust debate like we're supposed to win this great nation but he ...\nNever left this isn't new to this is the way it looks and and and people who believe in addition to their ideas and their their policy that's supposed to be but what is happening now is don't games or or this country and so so wrong and just\nWaiting for this great nation off or how\nDoes the president and this would be my goal the president obviously is is going to pull back aid to some of these countries that are allowing it has this caravan to move forward\nUm nobody wants to I didn't want to get hurt at the at the border these you know I Would assume the vast majority are innocent people but you know getting where we don't know anybody I mean you could have people that nickname with the crowd that want to bring harm to our country but I Would assume most people come here because they want a better life ...\nIf they're hell bent on disobeying our laws and our sovereignty and the president then has to protect our borders how do we do it in the way that is safest for the people that are there because I don't want to see people getting hurt at the border you don't want to see people the president does want to see that\nBut they can't you can't allow them to come in either\nNo I write and this is why we've had legislation that's been introduced the Democrats won support it because I think it down they want the politics of this issue they don't want to solve the problem we need more judges on the border we need more ability to when people get there to hold them not this action release all the whole damn\nThat the Republicans hold the house I have a lot more confidence in the Senate I just can't get a a post on motivated people are and the

president\nAnd held billionaire living on Fifth Avenue identified the struggle of blue collar Americans that won the presidency and all those are the forgotten men and the forgotten women in this country and I don't think they're liking this mob mentality I don't think they like the way judge Kavanaugh was treated much\nAnd I don't think they like watching this caravan of thousands marching towards our border\nI mean they they literally are mishandling everything and so ... what's what's happening is uh the the president has almost like this light showing like you know you and I were out on Long Island in the summer or parents would hang up that insect light\nWell the president has that the Trump Twitter\nInsect light and they're all going towards the light in their vaporizing Senator

insect vaporize or so so for me I'm enjoying this the polls are tightening of and the president's base is actually going to turn out much higher percentages and people predicted and so\nOnce again he's going to defy logic here I think we are very good chance to possibly\nAh keep the house we're certainly going to gain seats in the Senate and it couldn't happen without the energy and the for tutors for a President Trump\nWell if they do it when I'll say this he's carrying a lot of these people on his back but you know what I feel like Nancy Pelosi the dangers are what we're going to have endless investigation higher taxes keep Obamacare open borders\nAnd the president is is battling back on all these fronts in Guatemala Honduras El Salvador he says there or not we're not able to do the job of\nStopping people from leaving their country and coming illegally to the U.S now we will begin cutting off substantially reducing the massive foreign aid we routinely give them an Trump tweeted out every time you see a caravan of people illegally coming are attempting to come into our country illegally\nThinking blame the Democrats were not giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws\nRemember the midterms it's so unfair to those who come in legally and he's right um well and and we don't know anything about the people that are coming here we don't know when when one thing about them and I know the media can be a sympathetic because they want but you know who might mix in with the people that maybe just want a job is a big problem for us\nBut but it's but you but here's the other thing okay the American people intuitively notion that it's just all it is is he or she is recognizing with the legendary Milton Friedman one set about\nAny country if you have a welfare state in the United states does have one you need to protect your order because free market forces dictate that people will cross over that border to participate in your welfare state and so\nEvery country has a strong border and so should the United states I don't get a you know ... on on on promoting my my uh my book that today in the last couple of days model a lotta left leaning shows ... they go they go nuts so crazy on the president's\n... response all you want to illegal immigration you have democratic and Republican presidents in democratic elected officials that have voted off the wall was I don't understand why just enforcing those laws\nI've everybody saw ... ... ... well could there anthropology\nSo why don't they well it's a lot of things are we better off economically than we were two years ago\nBy every single objective measure the answer is yes the growth of the economy consumer confidence jobs created the number of people leaving food stamps or out of poverty eight million Americans so you know by every measure and more\nBottom the bottom ten percent of the society shut the wages of five and a half percent according to the wall Street Journal over the last Eighteen months but as a direct result of the president's policies but also the fact that he cut the slack at the border\nAnd so he made it tightened up the labor supply and it's giving the lower middle class families shot you know to have real living wages\nWell that's the story that you actually tell in the book by the way Anthony Scaramucci is with us author of the brand new book it's out today we put it up on Hannity dot comments on Amazon dot com and bookstores everywhere it's called Trump the blue collar president I first heard that term from one of his sons of his either Erica Don I don't remember those Donnie\n... get hit and he called them the blue collar billionaire yeah and I said ... Don if you don't mind going to hijack the nickname and just switch out billionaire and put in President he's at the end of the day he resonates with these people for\nYeah look I I I think it is and you talk a lot about his background you you talk a little bit about your family background it's similar to my background and and it's amazing because the only thing that I really care about what motivates me it's not politics itself it's not a game to me\nBecause the policies that we have in a country as we do now greatly impact whether or not people are on food stamps or whether or not there are jobs we now in two years\nHave us a scenario that is not unfolded in this country since Nineteen sixty nine and that is we have a million more jobs than we have people on unemployment you know that I identify with that that's what you identify with you you did not have any kids that are in your mouth\nAnd you know I saw it as a dishwasher at twelve and and look where you started I you know\nSean Sean listen I mean I think that's the message and I think that's the reason why you're so clearly popular at the end of the gay America is about aspirations\nAnd America is about passing the ... the the baton to a next generation of Americans that can do better than ourselves and that's what our grandparents did for our parents and our parents did for you and I and and the cat that the right policy shift of white\nFree market based motivating market incentive policies on because what we both know is that you cannot system the ties\nOr through a political system created equal outcomes never happens black markets crop up\nAnd then there's a thin layer at the tippy top that are living better than everybody else and everyone else has devastated whether it's Cuba or Venezuela place like that\nYou know the real danger so I don't know how this is all going to play out but we we see all weekend long these mobs you know really making ... an unsafe environment for anybody to even go get a bite to eat if you're a public figure which was really sad I mean when you're doing it in front of people's wives\nIt's not only sad it's pathetic when you're going after Pam Bondi Sarah Sanders and our kids and\nSecretary Nielsen and all she's do all they're doing is trying to sit in a restaurant and have something to eat telling you know one group of Americans they're not wanted here in any way what are you doing here get out of this you know they're going after an a Ninety year old guy Henry Kissinger now who served his country with honor and distinction is that it seems

fifty percent of the kids are conservative so they're not buying into the Malone\nYeah All right stay right there by the way the books phenomenal I read it cover to cover Anthony Scaramucci is with us Trump the blue collar president\nUh you know it's interesting you look at the jobs created who's benefitting when we create manufacturing jobs in factory jobs\nAre and we bring an industry back to America and we incentivize businesses to invest here well that's the forgotten men and women the Thirteen million under Obama\nThe additional Thirteen million that were on food stamps and after eight years of his presidency and the eight million more Americans that were in poverty after eight years of his presidency well now we have for a million new jobs in eight million fewer people in poverty
