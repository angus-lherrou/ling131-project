schools at churches in this particular case this is the largest anti Semitic shooting in history of the United states\nAnd you know when the president says that you know having armed guards at school or I've been advocating for a long time now retired police retired military\nOn the perimeter in the property on every in every hall of every school\nAnd that's one way to protect our children and I always ask a simple question and it's not to me about the gun debate if you find yourself in a building with an active shooter\nWould you prefer that there are that you know that there are trained professionals in that building with firearms as a first line of defense especially knowing that most of these shootings are over ... seconds\nAnd even when you get the best response times from the greatest police departments it's usually by the time they get there it's ... it's they're just counting the casualties and and trying to protect and in an orderly fashion those who either or injured or weren't injured\nSo it's a thought um it's been used before but that's not a big story of the day the saddest thing I watched\nAll we got to watch very closely and even hearing my name brought up a number of times and you know just shaking my head because people obviously know nothing about me they do nothing about\nYou know they don't take the time to either bother to watch or listen to this program if you've been listening to this program\nYou know we have been decrying going back to Kavanaugh the angry mobs\nIn Washington confronting bidding at senators not letting them closed doors there\nWe've been talking about how dangerous the left wing mob mentality is ... and we've talked about the incidences of Sarah Sanders and her family or kids trying to get something to eat secretary Nielsen trying to get something to eat\nYou know we've talked about Pam Bondi trying to go see a movie Mitch McConnell walk into an airplane numerous times and Mitch McConnell haven't as his table slammed on food ripped off his table just last weekend Kevin McCarthy's office having a Boulder sent through it\nYou know and I've been saying it it's we've got these everybody's gotta stop\nNow we've been talking about the rhetoric we heard Hillary you can't be civil kick them Eric Holder and talking about Maxine Waters a lot you know if\nYou see these cabinet members you get a crowd or does she thinks is going to happen when the crowd is formed and you follow them into restaurants and department stores and gas stations and you tell them they're not wanted any anywhere anymore\n... how is that going to end well hold the story when I met senator what's that guy's name from Connecticut again Blumenthal when I was coming out\nThere who was in the middle of the capital hearings you know I don't I don't understand being rude to somebody just because you have a political disagreement\nWe had a very pleasant conversation\nI invited him on my show I don't know what came of it but nothing obviously but I don't know where he's thinking about it what is the point of being rude to people or getting in people's faces says Cory Booker Spartacus says why is there this anger out there\nThat we have you know all these bombs that are sent out\nThe first one went to George Soros and I said that day I said this this has got to stop\nAnd George Soros is no fan of Sean Hannity's funds groups that want me to be silenced and go away but that's not what we do in this country we protect people you're allowed to have political views and spend your money the way you you see fit in life\nAnd even if it's being spent is islands made you know what I still believe in free to\nOr the ... you know I don't want to see any politician hurt and I have consistent consistently over the years said that when President Obama and people you know threatening him and people race how do we let how does somebody get into the White House says that happened\nWe've got to protect our elected officials we have one president at a time we got it that represents the United states and that represents all of us\nAnd at the end of the day the powers in the ballot box but you know you watch something like what happened this weekend and you watch the Democratic party their lap dogs in the media wasted no time you know trying to politicize this terrible shooting over the weekend pin blame the massacre on President Trump\nLook if the president says fake news is not serving the people of this country you can chronicle it you can watch it they don't see it which is sad their views and their bias and they're abusive a platform\nBut the reality is they lie and they have an agenda and it's constantly on display at is not in any way shape or form of calls for violence\nSocial media Pittsburgh shooter guy Rodney Bowers by the way he hated President Trump which is barely getting any play they're making you assume that he was must have been a Trump supporter\nNot only attacking people of the Jewish faith but President Trump for his closeness he hid this shooter hated\nThe fact that President Trump and I think he could make an argument after so many presidents had promised to make Jerusalem the capital of Israel\nThat this president has has aligned with Israel more than any other president in modern times you know Trump surrounded by a slur for Jewish people and then he the this killer lamenting there's there's no maggot as long as there's a you know\nBad word of a quote infants ... infestation\nBut despite those facts you have people\nYou know pretty close to blaming the president and conservatives for the shooting Joe Biden widely expected to run for the presidency seemed to do so when he tweeted to the president's words matter silences complicity what does he talking about Paul Krugman New York times suggesting that Trump was to blame at least in part\nSpeaking sarcastically Krugman pleading a link to the story with the caption but no but none of the white supremacist terrorism as anything to do\nA Trump oh no it's unbelievable how they now have you know believe their own lives Alan Dershowitz had a powerful column in\nThe Daily Caller today and he's been a a passionate defender over the years a staunch defender and rightly so of Israel\nAnd Jewish civil rights anyway drew linked this morning and pointed out something the very few are willing to say and he said a day after a man killed eleven people in Pittsburgh synagogue he criticized presidents Obama and Clinton as well as Keith Ellison this is Alan Dershowitz\nAnd he went on Fox and friends this morning there can't be any tolerance for anti Semitism we have to have zero tolerance\nKen salads at home is the key here I'm dealing with them but I'm a combat him down and do something\nNo what I

and go back to the Kavanaugh hearings I didn't hear many people on the left to cry the angry mobs that were going on in the halls of Congress I I got to the point where I said probably it's better if we cleared the halls of the public\nOr you would think in the people's house that the people will be allowed to go where they are elected officials are but it was obviously becoming\nUnsafe for people senators being spit at you saw the treatment of you know we've had in recent weeks what do we have rice and sent or what was supposed to be rice and send to Susan Collins home during the Kavanaugh hearings slope coat hanger sent to her office et cetera\nWe've watched than in recent weeks racing or what they've said wars rice and being sent to the president and General Mattis and our FBI Director right and our CIA director Gina Haspel\nWe watched the last few weeks what we watch these mobs and people being run out of restaurants\nYou know Sarah Sanders in her kids and family secretary Nielsen Pam Bondi Ted Cruz Mitch McConnell airports and having his table slammed in his food thrown out the restaurant door\nI've been telling everybody that the rhetoric is too hot and too heated and people need to come down but nobody on the Democratic side ever decided to stand up and say this this has got to stop\n\nOn this program I set it when Obama was president it's got to stop we got to protect our elected officials\nThe day that they mailed this the first device was sent the George Soros his house first thing I said on the radio I said we've got ... this can happen in this country\nI Know he's not a fan of mine in any of the people that were threatened by these bombs but the rush to politicize this and turn this into well this is who conservatives are is just one big lie\nWhat you're watching unfold before you're very eyes is you know the race to politicize tragedies\nThank God those twelve or Thirteen PVC bombs didn't go off and nobody lost their life thank God\nThat was in Donald Trump's fault\nAnd then you can you know look at this terrible tragedy and they're shooting in the synagogue or this rabbit anti Semite racist and also a Trump paid or not that it should even be relevant\nIt's getting scary we had real bullets used over the weekend also to shoot up a Republican Party headquarters in Florida\nYou know and that could have killed people\nSouth Daytona police investigating after they said that someone shot out the window of the local county Republican headquarters belief set of worker arrived Monday morning saw the damage called authorities\nWe have another threat of a man has accused the guy who's been arrested but threatening to kill Florida congressman Carlos\nCurbelo that story came out this week yet he's been

getting to know a lot more about Robert Bowers and who he is he was a very ill an anti Semite he was a huge critic of Donald Trump or in a lot of ways\nUm and the president you know she'll keep for saying what that means maybe and we've talked about this after school shootings and after other church shootings\nWhere the president said well maybe we need to have retired police and military it's a sad state of affairs\nBut um as a line of defense but that doesn't take away from the horror and the vicious evil\nThat took place here you look at the victims I mean it is heartbreaking to see the faces of those slain for their faith was the cover of the New York post today and as you read about the the lives of these people it is one heartbreaking story after another\nAre sadly too we watched the media do what they always do and that's rushed to blame and pulling out all the stops to blame Donald Trump for the Pittsburgh massacre when in fact the prime minister of Israel Ron dorm or the ambassador of all said that the president's comments were welcomed and appreciated\nOn every front hum will get into all those says we continue rose cannon I'm the host of winter rolls on Rosen plugged in Pittsburgh, PA\nI'd long run to the program and David shown civil liberties attorney criminal defense attorney thank you both for being here\nUh you know how much I loved by friends in Pittsburgh rows are very very sorry or thoughts and prayers go to everybody or the fact that it's been so viciously politicized within minutes makes beat my stomach turn and those trying to cast blame against the president make this a campaign issue is just nauseating\nIt is shining you or so left in Pittsburgh as well as soon as I heard the story the news Saturday morning\nI mean my heart went out and I was almost afraid to hear the list of victims their names because\nThis community it's such a lovely place it's a very popular Pittsburgh neighborhood\nI go there to shop and to dying and and in fact my son told me just about a month ago that's one of the neighborhood is considering moving too so we we love that community it's a tight knit community they are very involved though in so many aspects and not just their community but the out if the surrounding community\nAnd as it turned out you know of course I grew up with a girl who is cutting with the two brothers\nThat perished on Saturday but there were so many people that have done so many great things in this community in the Pittsburgh area and it just it's heartbreaking it really is to see that this happened but as soon as I thought those things\nAnd immediately I got sticks thinking that this is starting to become political\nAnd it's in ...\n... there's an interesting side no to this little throw this to David I'm how democratic candidates increasingly turned against Israel\nAnd our mutual friend Alan Dershowitz you know at a pretty powerful\nColumn that he put out linking the the mass of good at the Democratic party's tolerance for anti Semitism most recently we saw Bill Clinton two seats down from Louis Farrakhan I'd never ever get in a room with a vicious racist anti Semite like Louis Farrakhan or picture that emerged with Farrakhan and\nObama that was hidden from the public for eight years while he was president that existed that they had had a relationship\nUm and if you look at some of the most pro Israeli president I think we have had since the the forty eight partition plan un partition plan is a is Donald Trump\nMore recently making Jerusalem the capital of Israel which so many other presidents have promised that never had the courage to do\nAny person who would suggest for a moment Donald Trump as anti Semitic bone in his body that have their mind look at his family et cetera but you're absolutely right and what you pointed out ... ... if you believe that words matter then it goes much further than just a President Clinton sitting in a room\nWith Mr fabric on their pictures of President Clinton President Obama Cory Booker shaking hands and smiling with Sarah ... members of Congress doing the same Linda source or another hater\nI get an honorary degree at City College an honorary doctorate\nAbomination what climate is he a way it's been a press release about some of these kinds of things and listen this is Linda ... praises\nResume oh day ah terrorists to Palestinian terrorists who killed two American college students she's been praised by Christ in dealing with a kilogram she's it praised unfortunately by Stacey Abrams is running for Congress here in Georgia now\nUm if words matter those things matter a great deal as it should be expected when you're normalized Israel bashing and the hatred of Jews it should be expecting\nAll the way that our hair she would put it I thought it was pretty powerful you said they can't be any tolerance for anti Semitism and I agree\nWe we have to have a zero tolerance policy President Obama meets with Farrakhan shame on him President Clinton sits on a platform with Farrakhan shame on him Keith Ellison joins Farrakhan was one of the greatest purveyor of anti Semitic ... he's right\nI'm just because he's black doesn't give him in the past four is anti Semitism in any liberal\nWas any positive association with Farrakhan as as part of the problem not the solution and you know just last week for outcome was making anti Semitic statements and it was only two months ago that Al Sharpton Jesse Jackson of Bill Clinton were all sitting next to each other with Farrakhan at a wreath of Franklin's funeral\nI Would not go to any funeral that he was ... I'm Sorry I just you draw the line\nAnd trying to find may here too and there's something I like your listeners to know because\nI I noticed a couple of headlines today on Sunday there was a letter that was published and written by eleven members of a group called bend the ark and they have a Pittsburgh affiliate right here and they sent a letter to the president is blaming hand they said that you yourself called the\nMurder evil that yesterday's violence is that direct combination if he were influence\nAnd they said you're in the past three years you're working your policies have\nInviting that's involved in this\nAnd the you know what was interesting is I had so many messages and phone calls from listeners today they they pretty much agree first of all of that than they are just that your listeners now\nNot representative of the Pittsburgh Jewish community they did not speak for them but many of my listeners said these people are are there and obscure left wing group I'm a very progressive chase and and they don't speak to the Jewish community here in Pittsburgh I've been told by many this morning\nYou don't have everything with David go Harry important\nVery important point by the way I Wish they were obscure Peter Beinart as a matter of that group that is real ... and hater from start to finish\nRecorded that George Soros his grandson is a member of the group that purport to speak to this ... for this wonderful Pittsburgh community I've been to the tree of life shall I was a guest of the rabbi there for about ... it's a wonderful place\nThey're not haters they're not people who want to politicize anything and the president by the way can't win for losing the guy who sent those pipe bombs around\nA claim he was a follower of President Trump this guy the shooter the killer in Pittsburgh it's President Trump is talking about global is there is no longer insult in that war world\nConservatives by in large mainstream conservatives David are the biggest supporters of Israel in this country I've been friends with prime minister Netanyahu for twenty five years friends with a ... and and Shimon Peres a in others you've\n... you've broadcast from Israel you have been a great friend of Israel patrol under set right and on foot look good articles lately and an entire stream of the Democratic party now\nThat is frankly Israel haters and not give a past this Alexandria Ocasio Cortez these new people on the scene Palestinians and the ... it's just not true they're peddling wise about Israel and that's very very dangerous if you believe words matter\nWhat words matter this was the deadliest anti Semitic attacking us history the president also saying we will seek their destruction which I agree with\nI got to take a break but we'll come back more with rose tenant and David shown on the other side I saw friends that show many have done it again right if you look in the mirror what do you see maybe a little bit of sag along your jaw line\nUm remember ... when he gets rid of bags and pumping this Sunday your eyes it's their number one best selling products you can't get it in any store and don't forget there's sunspot correctly you had a little too much sun in the summertime\nAll ... now done it again they're introducing their brand new Gen you sell jaw line treatment with dual peptide and empty old technology which is their most advanced technology ever so in other words it\nRight as we continue rose tenant and David shown you look at article after article in the Washington Post\nRose tenant you know saying that the timing the president to the Senate gone synagogue mass murder\nAnd and that's insane ...\nI'm Sorry to interrupt you shine oh it isn't saying it it is it ... it it is them desperate trying to help the Democratic allies win elections\nI Love the rabbi said rabbi Myers said that you know he's a citizen of this country and if the president wants to come here please con he would not objecting at all the president's it which I appreciate and when we start focusing on the blame game which is what we do especially the the ... media\nThat then we lose sight of what really happened to you know what really happened is as we just got an anti Semite killed ... that was his goal those were the words that were true and spoken for him and he wanted to kill Jews but we also had\nPittsburgh Police who are amazing I Love these guys I noticed them any and then they went rushing towards the gunfire while everyone else it of course is rushing away we had a document ...\nWho went to care for gunshot victim and he became a victim himself rabbi Myers made every effort to save as many lives that they could and he regretted that he couldn't save more these are the real stories and this is the truth these were not acts of the nation divided that's what the last month that the way the media wants to believe\nThat we're a nation divided but we're not\nWe're a nation or a community like this one like any other when we're faced with adversity when we come face to face with a madman we roll up our sleeves we face that evil with courage and the sacrifice\nAnd and and that is who we are as Americans and when they play the blame game on the media it just makes me sick because we missed what the true story is what the truth is and rabbi Myers I Love what you said he\nSaid the bullet holes

key races now in the Senate will watch in Florida it's a dead heat and that's both the Senate with Rick Scott and that's for governor\nAnd Ron dissent this was a couple of points behind and that's not looking good I'm also worried about panhandle of people showing up in the panhandle you had a very tight race for governor in the great state of Georgia although I think that's moving back towards camping back towards the Republican\nIn Tennessee it if you want to keep the Senate it's a must win seats in Tennessee with Marsha Blackburn against bill Brett us and we have British students team on tapes\nAnd that he was lying about cabin on that he's going to govern as a liberal\nAnd I think that really has taken people back also on tape staffers progressing calling the people Tennessee ignorant I don't think that's helpful so I think Marshall holds but people have got to get out to vote 'em we see Josh Hawley is doing very well and he's up by a couple of percentage points in Missouri against that pony Claire McCaskill\nAnd she's bragging about how she really politically it's just like Obama but she too like bread as soon as hiding who she really is Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota is down by double digits she also was exposed by project Vera ... uh we now have\nIn a Braun in Indiana he's up by a couple of points against incumbent Joe Donnelly a Democrat and only the only\nFactor there that I really see is there's a libertarian that's drawing vote so away from the Republican so if you're in Indiana don't vote libertarian or else that's like a half a vote for Donnelly\nWe've got a hold the seat Heller seat in Nevada right now he's currently up in the polls but it's always tightened Nevada and then Arizona I have no idea why poll came out this weekend

Sean we're uh we're currently are contacting twenty six million evangelical and pro life and pro family Catholic voters and Nineteen states we knocked on a million nine hundred and seven thousand two hundred twenty eight doors a through this weekend Sean not that we're counting and\nAs of this weekend five point eight million of the voters that we've contacted have already voted we expect that number to exceed ten million by election day\nWe think we're going to have the biggest turnout of Christian voters we've ever had in a midterm election\nWell I Hope so I'm I'm a little worried about the house uh I look at ras muses number the president has not had a higher approval rating than he does now which is perfect timing\nThe president literally has been going state by state and out doing everything within his power to make people aware that this was really hard mid term election history is going against the tide here\nIf we are to hold the house and hold the Senate and pick up seats in the Senate but I think we'll definitely pick up seats in the Senate I'm worried about the house real clear politics average has the Democrats and two oh five Republicans at two hundred and you know basically you've got these dirty toss up seats or or thereabouts that are in play and that's going to make all the difference\nYeah that's right and and Sean ... are it by the people right now certainly the thousands of volunteers that are out there and knock on doors and distributing voter education literature for our organization is ignored the polls ignore the press ignore the pundits do your job get the litter\nOr everybody me you know I make a living for people not ignoring mining law\nYou're except it okay but I think you're right though\nBecause the polls are so often so wrong I mean let's go back two years Donald Trump lost every state according to the exit polls five Fifteen on election day\nWell that's exactly right and I mean look when I was state party chairman and

people right except for one of them I\nBreathe founder chairman of the faith\nAnd Freedom Coalition um and I think that the ... look there are many factors I think Kavanaugh is\nPlaying a part in this I think the Democrats none of them have spoken at all about the caravan their silence has been deafening and they'll say is well Republicans talking about it means that they're they're racist and seen a photo but you know it just means we believe in the rule of law and we're not going to wait the four weeks till\nKnow seven fourteen thousand people make it here\nSo I think that's playing a part I think all the incidence of the mob on the Democratic\nParty side we have some real bullets used over the weekend shooting up a Republican headquarters in Florida we saw the terrible shooting in the Pittsburgh synagogue this weekend you have a Florida Man arrested for threatening to kill a Republican congressmen\nHave an angry leftist mob disrupting Marsha Blackburn campaign rally would Lindsey Graham um we've seen two Republicans\nPunched in Minnesota uh there's a lot of anger and a lot of violence out there on the left you see Republicans being run out of restaurants\nAre Pam Bondi run out of a movie theater secretary Nielsen oh Sarah Sanders Ted Cruz and his wife Mitch McConnell Kevin McCarthy's office it with a Boulder busting his office window so there's a lot of left wing violence out there and it's a pretty dangerous time\nThey're Americans in every way but on pay for those who enter the country illegally and those who employ them just respect the rule of law and they are

hundred number one show and if you want to be a part of the programs amazing the criticism that has been out there for what should be good coverage of the president President now sending up to five thousand troops to the border\nOr a significant display of solidarity for our sovereignty our borders the rule of law as he should we saw about a week ago when at the Guatemala and Mexican border that\nLet people got to the border knock down the fence charged over the police and walk right through Mexico and we now have estimates as high as fourteen thousand people maybe less somewhere in there in around that area that are trying\nTo make it to the southern border the United states and the president and the secretary of homeland security of made it perfectly clear the vice president made it perfectly clear\nThat that's not going to be allowed to happen and we're a nation of laws to turn around that to do with the right way to do with the legal way and in spite of that the marchers keep coming although the president of Mexico did make an offer for some of the migrants if they wanted would be given special consideration to\nWork in southern Mexico a but not many takers apparently according to what I read this weekend\nIn a lot of people have been asking well okay how did they get so organized to organize them and who's financing all of this\nUm there's been a lot of conspiracy theories that I've never believed that the only one that made any and it's not a conspiracy I'd I'd when the vice president said last week\nThat he felt that some of the leadership\nAnd Honduras was responsible for promoting the caravan and some countries from South America Venezuela particular we're we're helping to finance some of this that's the only\nBit of information that I found that was somewhat viable as a potential truth um anyway Sam Faddis is with us Sam Faddis he's a senior partner uh and former CIA operative with Thirty years of experience in conducting intelligence operations in the middle east South Asia Europe\nAnd he's worked against the most dangerous of terrorist organizations the planet has ever seen as extensive first hand experience with their methodology and tactics and a welcome to the program so glad you're with us thanks for serving your country\nThank you for having me no pleasure\nWhat so you're you wrote a column midnight I haven't read the whole column ... my read a bit is as you think that the vice president was probably right on the mark\nWithout question what on the Mark I'm in the la actually that's a great mystery here I mean the guys that organized this sort of folks somebody party called ... which is a Honduran Marxist Party\nA number of years ago supportive of of of the president's Elaine who basically tried to overthrow the constitution to make himself all presidents for life there and done with the Venezuelan\nAnd laid out in front of God and everybody all over the Internet there will and organizing a posting videos and pictures from the marks\nSo again no great great mystery this is the\nWork of guys allied with Venezuela Marxist is in effect a giant covert action campaign designed to make the American government look bad in our allies look that\nWell I may look America doesn't have much of a of a choice and and this has to be obvious to people ... and I'm listening and watching the comments and some people sort of\nAssociating this with ... with anti immigrant sentiment or Xena phobia or whatever the the charges it's not true all conservatives are saying we don't care where immigrants come from the president talked about a border wall\nWith a big door and that people should respect our laws\nAre constitutional republic\nAmerican sovereignty and come in and if you want to come in we just need to check out make sure that you don't come here with radical ideas that you have the ability to sustain yourself\nAnd don't need our help and then we can let you in and you could become a part of our family to the extent that you want to go through the process and maybe become a citizen I don't think that's too much to ask that is called the legal way\nWithout question this doesn't have anything to do with a with a necessity for me to do with race this is yeah we're a nation of immigrants were also a nation of laws and according to legal immigration procedures period which don't simply get to walk across the border I have always wondered\nBy the way those folks that are actively don't want to control the border why is it that only people who can walk here should be allowed to get him just added stuff if that's the principal well when I'm not\nI don't want anybody to get hurt because America the president means what he says\nPeople rush across our border beat at a port of entry or along the border that has not fence and that our military is on the border the military is going to be given the order to stop them now we don't want anybody hurt I don't want and I'm assuming Ninety nine point eight percent of the people coming here\nAre coming here because they come from impoverished countries and they want a better life for themselves and their family that's my guess\nBut nobody can vouch for every single person in that caravan\nAnd for the sake and safety of the American people we can't let that number of people rush across the border have no vetting of the people and sadly maybe amongst the fourteen thousand there's one or five people that come here with intentions to bring us harm\n... ugly began at the sun shine we don't want to be heard and also it it was undoubtedly true that most of these people are simply being utilized by folks hostile to the U.S up\nOn the look probably been lied to you know\nI'm told that when they get to the border will be allowed to cross on so they are being put in the in the middle of this I'm simply used as human shields on on a harder on the behalf of\n... that is a horrible raunchy because these are mostly just average people will be used\nLook I Will tell you that you know what I really feel sorry for people I've taken the time I think more than any other person and media in this country and\nI've been down to the border Thirteen times and horseback all terrain vehicle boats helicopters I've been there I've seen gang members arrested I've seen drug warehouses I've seen tunnels built um I I've been on the border spot one place in particular did have a wall and fencing and I can look across the fence\nAnd on the other side of Mexico I saw nothing but poverty I saw ... what we would almost describe homes built surrounding will look like what we would describe as a junk yard even and then on the other side of the fence or ... million dollar half million dollar homes in San Diego\nAnd apartment on that one side and all I see is poverty and and and ... I think I'd want to look across to the other side and I want to go over there is being looked dramatically different and better over here and I don't think Americans you know there were very open people\nBut we can't take in the world's population and we have to have the ability to control our borders and what we're asking is that people do it the right way\nAnd it really just keeps you know what's in our circular argument it's just what we have to do for our own safety\nWithout question of what you just describe age most of the world all of sub Saharan Africa most of South Asia most of Latin America is the argument here on the people who will control the border that we are supposed to allow three to four million people move here\nBecause that is what you were actually talking about if you're going to carry this to its ultimate logical conclusion and we obviously cannot we have to maintain control of horrible\nYeah All right we'll really really appreciate it Sam thank you eight hundred nine for one Sean is our number you want to be a part of the program and we got to take a break up right so the biggest part of off year elections mid term elections would turn out that means you showing up\nAnd this election that we have coming up well it's the most important we have seen in decades why because your savings your tax savings that's on the ballot the American economy is on the ballot America's comeback is on the ballot your jobs are on the ballot your kids' future is on the ballot your wages for one case that is also on the ballot\nAnd if you're a small business owner your tax cuts are on the ballot\nAnd here's the biggest issue on the ballot who is in charge of America's future politicians bureaucrats the socialist in DC or you you want to preserve the victories of the past two years\nOld get involved this election this November\nAnd go to big choice election dot com big choice election dot com\nThey're going to make it simple for you to do your part now you can mail make calls and emails tax\nKnock on doors help neighbors get to the polls go to big choice election dot com because the only way we lose this year is if you don't show up if you don't turn out go to big choice election dot com do your part and let's not get out worked\nIn November big choice election dot com will come back for your phone call straight ahead eight hundred nine four one Sean toll free telephone number\nOh yeah right here and get out of a media man room\nLeaning I I Am a realist and I try to look at things as I study these numbers more than you know\nIf the election were held today I think we'd lose the house by about five seats ... if the election were held with the Senate today where we would hold Tennessee we pick up Missouri we pick up Arizona we barely hold Nevada\nI think we have a if people don't vote libertarian in Indiana will win Indiana and we'll win North Dakota\nFlorida too close to call Montana too close to call West Virginia leans Democrat although the secretary of state there is now up to and the latest poll Menendez is a long shot to be beaten in New Jersey but he can be beaten\nThat's that's where my head is that today and uh well I'm trying to warn people that this is real that you know hit we have history running against us so there's only going to be one of three results\nOn the morning after the night before and it's either going to be while the Republicans picked up seats in hold the Senate Republicans while they held on to the house and that's going to be the best case scenario or it's going to be a split decision they pick up seats in the Senate but lose the house\nOr it's going to be a disaster and that's you know speaker elect Nancy Pelosi Senate majority elect Chuck Schumer\nVery Frank with you I can see any one of those three scenarios unfolding with the third one the least likely so\nYou know I'd rather go full for the gusto and win at all what are the big problems for the Republicans as they've had forty five retirement\nThat's forty five unknowns on the ballot and the Democrats you know they're getting all of this money poured into these house races because they've given up a lot on the Senate races there going all in the get the house\nAnd to really try to get in people's minds and make them understand that for the Trump agenda to continue we really do need both houses because Nancy Pelosi as speaker and Maxine Waters is a\nCommittee chairwoman and Adam shift as a committee chairmen and Gerald ... is a chairman\nIt just it's a disaster for us eight hundred dying for one Sean or toll free telephone number [noise]\n\nWarning twenty four hours may contain diverge inconvenienced\nBy a hundred percent for what you say I'm Sorry I have to argue with the listener dissent in ...

with us twenty five now till the top of the hour a there are about thirty races now we have identified actually if you look at real clear politics they have they have narrow this down to five races that they believe will be the tipping point is actually thirty races kind of like what we have but\nThey ... they have a five seat race they've got the Republicans locked in a two hundred seats they got the Democrats locked into two hundred and five seats and the remaining seats are up for grabs in other words they are toss ups in other words if we\nIn the seats and that means that Republicans will retain the house control of the house of representatives now that would be the super when that you want to go for him in the Senate is looking better but don't take anything for granted I think will have pick ups\nI think will hold Tennessee with Marsha Blackburn I think we can beat Claire McCaskill Heidi Heitkamp I think Joe Donnelly can be beaten these down in the polls I Believe that Christians cinema can be beaten as well how she was up at three in the latest poll is beyond any imagination I have\nA poll has a dead heat exactly even five forty six all Nelson versus Rick Scott who's been a phenomenal governor for the great state of Florida round the sentence was coming back interesting John James Michigan is cut his\nThe leaders stabbing now in half\nAnd it's only a six point race in Michigan where it was one twenty and so he's doing very well a lot of eyes are paying attention to the latest poll in West Virginia where mentioned is down by two\nIn New Jersey Menendez is only up by three and seen is very weak and could be the big surprise of the night\nBoth West Virginia and New Jersey to states to watch for potential surprise is not likely but potential uh one of the house races that are on our top thirty is Marty a no Stein is a gold medal is currently serves as the chairman of the board of commissioners for Lehigh County Pennsylvania you're running for\nCongress there in the Pennsylvania seventh district to fill Charlie dense empty seat and a big Trump supporter but it it's a tight race where you are you're one of the thirty that will tip the balance of power how's it going there\nAnd I'll say that Sean first off thank you for having me on the show you know out campaigning hard every single day eating every corner of this district and I got to tell you there's a lot of motivation out there right now I think people are starting to pay attention they understand what's at stake and they went to the Democrats in November six\nWell look the issue to me are simple but we have is we know what the Democrats agenda is to impeach trumpet don't say it open borders sanctuary cities sanctuary states but don't say it keep Obamacare but don't say that either just say we're for great health care for all of making some wonderful just like\nYou know keep your doctor your plan and pay less that's their agenda and they want their crumbs back\nBeyond that it's let's hide and not tell people what we really stand for because when we do we know we lose which is why all these we have now another Senate candidate will be exposing tonight\nWe've got Brett ascent in Tennessee we've got Claire McCaskill we've got Heidi Heitkamp will unveil another senator tonight all caught on tape all three campaigns saying that they purposely running as moderates but they planned to govern as liberals and their offices are laughing and the case of Tennessee got reticence that calling the people in Tennessee ignorant\nSo is your opponent out there saying what they're really going to run on what they believe in\nGod I absolutely not you know she's running as somebody she's not at the end of the day that\nDemocrats think everybody hates Trump like they do [noise] you know and to me they're completely out of touch they can see pass or angry is Sean and let's not forget don't forget election night two thousand sixteen when the media had two scenarios out there one of the best the best case of Hitler and wanting the worst case of Trump won and yet Donald Trump still wants\nNow we have a president we have the president is has a record Hillary's true colors have come out contrast that the two thousand eight where it was best case Obama and then look what happened to two thousand ten to mid term stink about that the voters corrected their mistake Obama last sixty three house seats and what's there to correct now\nWhat part of the Trump success story to the voters want to change\nGive the crumbs back increase to regulate its watched jobs go back overseas see now that's that's a difference my opponent goes and talked about that they're hiding behind a bunch of smoke and mirrors and not running for really are but I think the ... the voters are a lot smarter than that right now and we're going to some some people in November six", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "Tucson", "day":
