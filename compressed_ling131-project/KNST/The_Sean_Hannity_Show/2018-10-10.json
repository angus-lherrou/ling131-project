them accountable Sean won as truth about Congress\nRule of law is indispensable to a thriving and vibrant society [noise]\nShe'll citizens from government over reaching\nAn arbitrary action [noise]\nPursuing truth means always yielding to the fact [noise]\nEven if they run counter to our house [noise]\nTruth about credible evidence [noise]\nStrong opinions\nNow there's a lot of talk about ... ... applications\nAnd many people that I I see talking about it seem not to recognize a what a five ... five ... actually a warrant just like a search warrant in order to get five or a search warrant you need an affidavit signed by a career federal law enforcement officer who swears\nThat the information the affidavit is true and correct the best of his knowledge and beliefs\nAnd that's the way we operate and if this wrong sometimes it is if you find out is anything incorrect in there that person is going to face consequences\nAnd if you find that anything's wrong in there that person is going to face consequences you got to fix your signature to this you know it was signed up for David they get a ... a warrant signed by a career law enforcement person\nSwearing that what you are presenting to the court is true and that you know it to be true and affirmed it to be true well\nThat didn't work out what the third renewal buys an application in the case of Carter Page\nA which is the fourth buys a warrant issued\nBut the fourth one that was signed was signed by Rod Rosenstein and we all know that the bulk of information that was put in the Pfizer warrants\nWell that was based on the pony Clinton bought and paid for ... that not even Christopher Steele stands by to this day and that was never verified never corroborated and has turned out to be mostly debunked which is among the many other conflicts that Rod Rosenstein has of course\nHe's the one that recommended firing Jim Comey he's the one that signed the visor warrants he's the one that appointed Mueller\nAnd uh now he was scheduled to appear tomorrow under oath and a two sources now telling Fox News at this hour\nThat Rod Rosenstein scheduled appearance before the house Judiciary Committee is at an impasse\nOver the terms of the testimony\nAnd he doesn't want to have a transcribed interview under oath which is the standard for congressional taskforce interviews and those close to Rosenstein say well he prefers a meeting or a briefing with the house Judiciary Committee chairman and other lawmakers where there's no paper trail\nWhere there's no under oath part well the question is why would he be afraid to go under oath\nWell here to weigh in on this and much more\nUh as as impasse continues Mark Meadows he is the Freedom Caucus chairman and congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio also a Freedom Caucus member a and by the way would be in this House Judiciary committee\nAll the interview of Rod Rosenstein um we also have learned in the last three days Mark Meadows I'll start with you that we now know that Lisa Page\nAndrew McCabe the deputy FBI directors under criminal investigation Lisa Page who is out at the FBI James Baker the top attorney the FBI they all are telling the same story that Rod Rosenstein said that he wanted to surreptitiously record the president of the United states\nIn the hopes of being able to get him to say something that would allow them to invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment so we there's a lot of questions were Rod Rosenstein at this moment\nWell there are a lot of questions I think probably the bigger question is why would Rod Rosenstein\nOr not be prepared to come to Congress tomorrow to clear his name\nAnd I think the reason for that is there there are credible witness has you know your lead in ad Rod Rosenstein voice saying well you know the needs to be facts and we have the rule of law well we're willing to to consider him innocent until proven guilty\nHim not coming tomorrow indicate a that there is real credibility with these witnesses that suggested that he not only wanted to tape the president but he wanted to use those tapes a to effectively have a deal Jake two on the president of the United states\nWell he met with the president apparently earlier this week and blue on air force one does anyone know what the result of that meeting was\nWell I think the biggest thing is uh Shaun is is I let's don't read too much into a flight on air force one\nAnd I think it's the president trying to be reasonable and hear rod side of the story I think the president has been extremely measured I tell you who's not measured at this particular point\nAnd want to talk about your whole security protecting your family that simply ... security the best security system on the market even said by seeing

call these men and demand that they subpoenaed under oath Rod Rosenstein ... well I don't know why there would be any hesitation\nConsidering that he is up to his eyeballs and everything the firing of combing the appointment of Robert Mueller the signing of the third buys a warrant and three people now saying that he's talking about taping the president of the United states in the context of possibly invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment what else do we need to get a subpoena for somebody\nWill uh hopefully I I Would I Would not encourage giving out anybody's phone number and you're great at holding people accountable but here's what I Would say\nIs the fact that you're covering it you're listening nurse and the people that are truly tune in on a regular basis to listen to you they need to make sure their member of Congress feels the heat and understands how important this is but the other part of that is is Gemini or trying to work today\nUh to to stress the importance of why transparency and\nAnd the fact that the deputy attorney general much job yet a bus raises right in and say this is what I did and this is what I didn't do anything shy of that uh really uh would would be an indictment on his credibility\nYeah what about the president now talked about the classifying and releasing the un redacted by the applications especially pages ten through twelve Seventeen through thirty for the final buys a warrant the one that Rod Rosenstein side have either have you seen that particular buys her application\nI had not a show and we need to see that we need to see it and don't take an after every time roots or goes in and talks with yep yeah I remember Mr ... told us\nThat after each conversation he had with Glenn Simpson and Chris Field he would then contact person at the FBI and he would sit down with them and they would take notes we want to see all those notes of all those conversations we know they're at least twelve adult\nSo the so called real too is when you see those and remember when the president first talked about classifying what we all asking to do this three weeks ago he talked about any communications for Andy McCabe page all those documents as well\nThat would include ... numbers so we we need all that information and again if you're ... find that reading your debt talks about how our right to the justice works\nKey to that transparency give us the information that we need to see it more important the American people need to see\nWell do you want to call chairman Gowdy it's too old to two to five six zero three zero be polite please too old to two to five six oh three oh\nA chairman Goodlatte is too old to two to five fifty four thirty one too old to two to five fifty four thirty one we'll put them up on Hannity dot com and again be respectful but I think with all that's going on they should\nDemand that he testify under oath a thank you so much congressman Mark Meadows thank you congressman Jim Jordan and we appreciate your push for the truth we need to get to the bottom of the ...\nAll right we've got to take a break when we come back we got a lot more to come dam bond Gino Greg jar well more on this

Fox News Michael now a category three story but it's packing one hundred twenty five miles per hour when does it lashes the Florida Panhandle thankfully\nA welcome both of you to the program I'm ... you you watch the tactics you see the polls for the first time raspy used in showing that Republicans have more enthusiasm the Democrats and the lead up to the mid term elections I think the cabin on hearing says awoken people to just\nHow vicious the Democratic party can be\nYeah I'll listen to the old tactics of the past with the Republican Party mature intimately familiar with where\nDemocrats lobby political grenade right onto the field usually some kind of a you go through the list every night or on your Fox or you know a racist besides you this you know the the phobic ... kind of stuff these identity politics and he's a Republicans would scatter\nWell they tried a new one with Kavanaugh they try to really disgusting one this rapist line which is one of the most important things I've ever seen in politics\nAnd for the first time Sean in a long time\nWe had a president the White House who said we're not going to back down a cabinet we're not going to let you back then we're going to back you up and we won one\nAnd that when I Believe is really just and this is not a scientific sample I don't want to oversell it but based on me just driving around in my town which is a fifty fifty Republican Democrat county Martin County Florida\nRepublicans could not be more ecstatic that we finally have a warrior and a fighter in the White House who is not going to leave the battlefield when that identity politics or disgusting label or comes in from the Democratic party and I think it's really a spiced up the Republican base and I think we may have a\nWe may have a decent the election day\nWell I'm not sure I Can't read the tea leaves um I think it all comes down in these midterm elections always comes down to turn out and if people are motivated like the Rasmussen poll says\nUh than it would happen to them and looking at the numbers that Republicans are more mad about the cabinet controversy that Democrats are in a more determined to vote in the upcoming elections this is a dramatic twenty five points shifted in just the last six weeks Greg Jarrett so that would give hope to me\nAnd hopefully the American people that\nSomehow the Republicans could bucked the trend in and maintain power in the house and maybe pick up some Senate seats which I think are a distinct possibility\nWell I think you're right the only question is with twenty seven days remaining or does this trend that Republicans are motivated in energized devote\nHave legs will it last over the course of the next four weeks\nUm and you know we just don't know that but you're right the polling data does show that and I you know I think that there is a general anger among both men and women across America that this was a process\nOf the confirmation hearing that was a NASA mode of fairness and the presumption of innocence and due process and that abduction some corroborating evidence from a thirty six year old claim you\nReally can't ruin somebody's career and their lives and you know the reputation or ... that they built up in the goodwill and their families reputation\nSure I mean I Do think that there is a feeling across America that a lot of issues on fear now there are liberals and the media which is ... and uh who are show rabbit that they don't care about furnish stay just care about their own political agenda\nHowever misplaced in wrong it may be and show you're never going to change their minds there is no reasoning with on reasonable people so we'll just have to wait and see it's up to the Republican Party I think and and the candidates and indeed President Trump\nTo maintain the momentum going forward over the next twenty seven days\nLook the hell out of great article today about what their agenda is and they the Democrats have big plans none of which will help the country\nOr they want to shore up Obamacare which has been nothing short of a disaster for the American people they want more Dodd Frank financial rules to protect quotes\nDreamers and the integrity of elections in other words they want massive amnesty they want to aggressively probe any single thing they can they want this country locked down into endless investigation\nAnd likely the impeachment of Donald Trump they you know Republican celebrate the passage of the biggest tax cutting history they refer to as crumbs\nAnd they're saying it's time to take the crumbs back I guess the crumbs or the most delicious part of the meal um so all of this is in jeopardy dam bond you know I don't see a waning in people's enthusiasm now I think they have they went so far in the cabin okay some frankly in the last two years what we have witnessed split the\nAnd you chronicled lives in your new book\nYou know the the attempted sabotage of the president I think they see the fundamental unfairness and nothing they stand for is going to help the average American have a better life\nRight and showing the media and Greg just nailed it by the way that you know the media and the Democrats ... ... it's it's it's symbiotic guy I mean it it's a host\nAnd a parasite at this point they're the same thing\nThey have gym up this rage ... not all of them but many of 'em against Donald Trump to such an intense for me think about the things showing that have come out I mean new lows in politics\nDonald Trump's Supreme Court nominee called the rapists Donald Trump called the treat treat guilty of treason a crime literally punishable by death that's not hyperbolic he'd been he's been called trees is they ginned up the base so much on that here's the problem the Democrats have created for themselves in the election\nThat in order to seem like the more anti Trump candidate to get that money in those volunteers for your twenty twenty presidential campaign or to get that money in the midterms what do you have to do you have to oppose the trader you have to oppose that train rapist or whatever sick name they call the capital\nSo that that's what's leading to this cycle pathology on the left\nAnd I agree I I don't see this waning and I do see Republican voters saying listen when is enough enough you attack this this American patriot and cabinet you try to take down the Trump Administration weaponize and the government when is enough enough and I think they're going to show up I Hope I pray they do\nWell what do you think about Hillary's endorsement of ah the incitement of getting in people's face and you can't be civil suit basically calling for instability you you can't really civil with the political party\nThat wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about and then the other comments made by people like Maxine Waters and others getting their base\nHim into a grocery store is following the gas stations confront them chase them out of restaurants which we have seen going on and on a on a regular basis\nFor Republicans it is absolutely wonderful you know they oughta ... and early Christmas gift to Hillary Clinton Michael ... Maxine Waters Jerry Adler Nancy Pelosi many of those individuals are calling for\nA the investigation and teach men to Brett Kavanaugh which Americans realize you is wrong and preposterous I could have certainly explain how on a legal basis\nImpeachment is not possible for Brett Kavanaugh but the more that these toxic individuals and all of the ones I mentioned especially Hillary Clinton are toxic uh the more that only drives Republican voters to the polls\nTo make sure that these people are are not\nAh in positions of power and will not be able to run the accomplishments of Donald Trump which have been incredible you know in the course of two years he's accomplished more than\nBrock Obama did in eight years the greatest level of American economic growth and prosperity in modern American history and that is not just made up I mean the statistics demonstrate that and so if Americans want to maintain that prosperity\n'em and add you know money to their wallets into private ah from government officials who loved just squander hard earned money from American taxpayers are their choices easy\nWell I did like Kevin McCarthy introduced which is a bill to fully fund the Trump border wall a the president has already spent about what three three and a half billion dollars he needs about twenty three billion dollars more to get the job done and I think that is certainly one of the big\nIssues that Americans would be motivated to go out and vote for and the other I think\nYou know the president rightly said he could make as many as four more Supreme Court appointments\nThat is a massive issue at this point it is it's a tipping point for the courts you know if you think of the age and the health of some of the justices um ... there's no doubt there will be vacancies in the in years to come in the near future\n... and don't forget shown that the circuits and the district court the Supreme Court gets all of the attention you know it's the sexy story the highest court in the land quite obviously\nBut his Greg can tell you most of these cases that over reports to American businesses American individuals moms and dads out there are settled that the circuit court level they don't even make it to the Supreme Court and Trump already has\nWas uh twenty six appointees to the circuit courts and there's a couple of more are getting ready to have to be confirmed as well\nSo this is a really big deal now um we have of course the Ginsburg seat a you know they could come open if Trump wins reelection bid may come open I ... and I say the Sean\nI'm worried I mean I mean it I'm actually worried what will happen to the country if that seat if it gets very decides to step down I mean look what we just witnessed with cabinet can you imagine what's gonna happen if that seat comes open as a potential\nSix three conservative majority and the courts I mean it is genuinely frightens me at a at a again that's not melodramatic I worry for my kids what will happen\nOctober than what's new today on the free I heard radio\nFor decorating the house or just setting the dairy mood [laughter]\nMinds you play ... with labor in my lifetime we've\nEveryone's talking about like the fantasy football or soccer jak\nJoe Rogan experience all your favorite music all your favorite stages\nContractor lectures do I want to get back in time giving ... me I'll keep

thanks for writing Emma Ken good rich get all the week the deal will keep it cool but it's hard to sell\nTo register to vote democratic you have to see their reaction to him briefly at my age you know I'm not\nGoing to continue with Greg Jared and dare mancino both of you been following in a part of a an solvable group of us it's not a lot of buzz following all of the deep state movements\nNow the issue today we just had on Mark Meadows and Jim Jordan talking about a Rod Rosenstein is now saying he doesn't want to appear before the uh House Judiciary committee on the issues are before them\nAnd that is the latest one that Lisa Page Andrew McCabe and James Baker of all said that that Rod Rosenstein or talked about surreptitiously taping the president\nOf the United states in the hopes of getting something on tape that that might invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment\nIs the same Rod Rosenstein that is up to his eyeballs and conflict\nHaving written a letter and recommended the firing a James call me the same guy the signed the fourth and final buys a warrant that we should have on redacted and released the American people that hasn't happened yet and the same guy that appointed Robert Mueller ah why wouldn't you want to testify Greg Jared under oath\nWell he doesn't want to transcribe the interview or anything under oath or which chairman Goodlatte and others are demanding why if it's not recorded or not under oath Rosenstein can do what he always does\nThis leave and the lie with impunity without putting in self in legal jeopardy too what Rosenstein really watches oh you know Mr good lab which is to you and I sit down and have a cup of coffee we'll chat a little bit too if Rosenstein or July as as I suspect he might\nUm he doesn't ah he's not looking at a fashion misleading statement of Congress she's not looking at\nPerjury because he can always deny the conversation ... ... remembers the which which is why this is so critically important\nWell they've got a shot to subpoena him and they've got a demand to show up and they've got to put them under oath and these answers have to be given but\nUh I got to let you both so do we write great job Greg Jared congrats on the successor the rush of hoax ... new book is out right now it Spygate the attempt to sabotage that Donald Trump that soon to be a best seller thank you ... both being with us when we

I went to a state of data why that bank [noise]\nOrange\nFake news gives utilize manatees apply the crew [noise] Sean Hannity is on right now\nFortunately this is a go because hurricane of the worst guys because all of them and said with hurricane come into play so the star search Smith or anywhere between nine and fourteen feet [noise] um [noise]\nThose are just going to be the worse where the slant on just to the east or south of where the landfall somewhere right now it's projected between Panama City ... can afford it so not only are they going to bring forty feet of ocean water but in addition there'll be wave action on top of that which was the primary\nDriver of why we backed away sir [noise]\nAnd then a couple of ... that he got over a hundred and forty five miles per hour winds [noise] um [noise] you know just before two thousand and want to or not designed to to handle that I went to physically\nAnd a infant unfortunately pushed through the state so we're asking us citizens in southwest Georgia from Georgia to uh be vigilant and make sure that they understand\nWhat about comedy this area's going to see a cat one\nStorm as it moves in hand with the vegetation there while we're anticipating is a lot of down trees are impacting the power in and uh you know here again we're going to see a lot of damage devastation along the coast structurally and then as it moves and they're going to see power outages throughout the state\nThat was brought along FEMA administrator or saying that hurricane Michael is a Gulf Coast hurricane of the worst kind Michael striking the Florida Panhandle uh ... dad hit\nAnd wins now gusting up to a hundred and Seventy five miles per hour uh the damages severe it is hitting back some of them strength now as we speak or we welcome back to the program a good friend Joe ... is the official meteorologist at the Sean Hannity show with weather bell dot com\nWell everything predicted as we talked earlier in the program today has come true\nThis is a bad bad storm it's they're now in the middle of it\nAnd uh it's more devastating that we even thought it could be\nWell we had it going to as a category for my company from Sunday and\nAs a matter of fact I I you know and my dad used to always say to me the if you have to tell somebody said something you must not say it loud enough but not everybody hears things a few days away so uh it was actually is that we put it out publicly with a patriot post\nWhich is a conservative blog I Do a Monday morning telling people that it's going to be but look here's the thing with this storm folks the first thing is this is not climate change or any evidence of it okay\nSo you could see this coming you could see the whole pattern come in fact I talked to Shaun ... on the sixteenth of September I said I'll I'll be seen you get an October probably because of the Gulf\nRight now you said it right on the show I Know\nYeah right right on the show and you could see the pattern setting up for everything got together and that's why and you see that every once in a while but let me put it in perspective is is the worst storm\nEver to hit between mobile and camp out that I can find on records okay now you know whether it's ten thousand years ago something that we're so we're not sugarcoat that but\nOn the other hand it's not because of your SUV All right this is what nature is capable of doing and you could see this pattern setting up\nPretty far in advance it's also one of only a handful of storms the last twenty five years including Harvey by the way that hit at its peak Andrew did that Camille did that I was in at its peak when it came into Florida was weakening off its peak\nMost of these hurricanes have we've been blessed and not like the thirties forties and fifties\nThat hit on their peak now as far as the storm it's as if it made landfall\nAs a borderline category five I'm ... and when it's all done they may call it a category five I'm not sure they're gonna have to go in and look at the damage\nBut there's a lot more left to this storm folks because even though it's weakening hurricane force winds are going to go all the way in the central Georgia now there'll be ... to one Seventy five but they're going to be accustomed to eighty Ninety a hundred miles an hour at ... you will escaped the worst of it but I guess it's probably going to come right over Augusta very\nClose to Columbia South Carolina just north of Fayetteville by this time tomorrow when we're talking and then it will move off the mid Atlantic Coast between Cape Hatteras in Norfolk, Virginia\nVery late Thursday night on out to sea to the south of New England just be glancing blowing the I Ninety five quarter in the meantime for you folks in the Carolinas\nAll right you you're not going to have the kind of a kind of\nCold long siege brought in as six to twelve hour period\nFor much of the interior Carolinas they're going to be wind gust into forty fifty sixty miles an hour that's going to cost power outages three to six locally twelve inches of rain will aggravate flooding situations in areas that were devastated by foreign so I'm I'm Sorry to say that we've got to call it like it is well as this comes through", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "Tucson", "day": "10"}
