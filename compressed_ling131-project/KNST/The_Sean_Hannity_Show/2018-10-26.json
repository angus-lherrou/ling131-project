Fox News that from the FBI chief Christopher Wray after a suspect was arrested and charged in the string of nailed on packages sent mainly to top Democrats around the country more than a dozen packages in all several more found today we're still\nHas got those odds and those are scary odds because of policy takes over the house you know she's going to have open borders you know she's going to want to raise taxes you know she'll hunted killed jobs she'll put back in regulations and guess what they're going to try to impeach president so you've really got just over a week\nTo try to stop poetry and the Democrats from winning and the Republicans really need to have a laser focused on that and run a very very hard contrast campaign and the worst thing is right now in Ninety percent there's a story I think Ninety percent of the congressional districts that are competitive\nThe Democrats are raising the Republicans and it's not by little amounts it's by big amounts so you have a congressional race where the Democrats are spending a other Republican two million to one million in Virginia ten were Barbara construct running for reelection people were saying all your polls were wrong because you have a point it had\nAll the Democrats last friday put in for a million dollars in the last two weeks for nurses are two million between the Republican or groups in the center of town I mean Congress on contract so the Democrats are playing for keeps and the Republicans need to have that\nLooks like the Democrats have just seeded the Senate than in other words they're putting all their money into a house races just to get the one chamber absolute ... so let's say that that that what you're saying is true if the Democrats below sea become speaker and the Republicans hold on to the Senate and they pick up seats in the Senate so that would sort of be a split decision by I guess any measure right\nUp to a split decision except that\nThe Democrats will have a focused they will control the house stink of the committees that are going to change to think of I think of the intelligence committee and set of newness running it you'll have Adam Schiff gets what's gonna happen with the with the with\nAll these investigations et cetera guess what's going to happen with the Judiciary Committee ... there'll be relentless investigations of President Trump that he won't get anything done in the last two years and you know that talk about they'll go\nThey'll go check his taxes the leak all this stuff and it'll drive economy down one of the things that that you know us pollsters\nWe get calls before the elections from hedge fund guys for major Wall Street guys what are you seeing in the in the election or you want to know why the market's been going down the last month because they're seen that the Democrats could take the house and they know what that means to the economy the economy will stall out\nWhat do you think Doug shown to you in the same marry you said it's getting very tight also\nI think John's analysis is exactly right I think the Democrats I actually wouldn't might even be a little bit more cautious I see between twenty five and thirty feet I think that um\nAnd if they get twenty three seats that means they win the house\nThat that is correct time projecting\n... barely even when they were saying the Democrats could win by little as two seats\nI Am saying that I sit on your air or the other night it would be two to four I'm In the same range I think John's analysis is very very rare\nAnd I think he's right to say that the Democrats are mobilized can focus on the um on the house to the exclusion of Hispanic but the amount of money that's being spent on really the Tony raises I think Sean butter on your website cannot be underestimated and\nYou know mid term elections tend to be referenda on the president and the incumbent party and there's one with a dirty secret it's not so much from Trump that is a risk the Republicans in the house and Senate were much lower ratings than the president and it is that is the soft underbelly of the Republican Party\nAt one of the weaknesses as it relates to also to the Republican House is there's so many retirements whether they're forty by a separate retirements incumbents and name recognition for a lot of people and a lot of these races ... negligible zero it takes years\nTo build up name recognition in a district John\nAbsolutely and by the way that that top thirty most important races that you put on your website\nThose are critical seats that the Republicans really need to win and and Doug is it is I mean granted the Democrats should be listening to him but fortunately for us they don't listen to him too much for one Democrat that does listen to them is former Mayor Bloomberg in New York City\nWas a big superPAC and it's putting the resources into electing Democrats in the house now that he's gone back to being a registered Democrat and the Democrats really dug understands that they they they're very smart they really understand how to how to win races and how to take power\nAnd the Republicans need to wake up I mean those of us who are older I remembered delivering a survey that Haley Barbour helped pay for it Nineteen Ninety four in September that have we have the generic Republicans up seven and that was to the house leadership and there was a soon to be Speaker Gingrich with Bob Michel\nWas presenting the numbers to him saying you're going to be the next speaker and\nWe just need to not compromise on Clinton care well Haley Barbour\nFar ten million dollars to help when more seats and win that election the Republicans are raising record something the orange she has out raised a has out raise the uh Democrats their National Committee to to want\nThe ... that money needs to find his way into the into these top thirty races that you've outlined where the Democrats are spending has virtually two to one and all those races this week and you've got to be able to put money into those races weather's digital LEDs a\nTV ads even nationally and saying stop polo see\nWe've got to have an equal voice with the Democrats\nAnd uh uh ... they really they really are focused on trying to take over the house and it's and it's their their shot at power\nWell they're shot a power but remember you know as those that have been saying the investigations into the deep state and I don't believe that's true because we have Senate committees that are just as capable of doing that as well and similarly if the Republicans were able to build their majority in the Senate any legislation that Nancy Pelosi and company want to pass\nThat is going to be against what the Republicans want in the Senate is never going to get through it'll die there and we'll have divided government but I think you're most right and the fact that it's going to be\nBasically two more years like we've had and that is endless you know ridiculous absurd obscene investigations show trials by Adam Schiff Maxine Waters Gerald Gerald Nadler and company and\nIn other words the progress will will slow down dramatically now there is also the hope that Republicans in the lame duck session could actually get in there and pass the funding for the border wall and maybe repeal and replace Obamacare in the meantime\nLuck I think Sean that if that is John and I think folks that are suggesting that more likely than not the Democrats when the house what we are looking at with almost great certainty is ... ... critic like two years\nI make a slightly different on a book I'm afraid to look for them but I Know China's certainly knew shot I just hope we stop demonizing doing what Maxine Waters it say\nPrompts responsible for ... for a set of uh uh sending that ten or twelve arms around or vice versa planning that Democrats can we focus on our national or our borders and our future\nIf we had to go ... you've got to admit that we had the war we didn't have to worry about the the migrant caravan worry ... building the wall\nAnd having a pathway to ...\nOkay so that I Am sort of old Trump offered that deal to the Democrats they do and I would have dreamed it\nIn a heartbeat why didn't that was ... because I was pulled off the table pretty quickly when some of the Democrats said yes but goodness gracious I Would do that no heartbeat I think it makes sense a Donnelly and Indiana is saying that and I think he's right\nOr Donnelly is now down by four to broaden the libertarian candidate thankfully is falling off a little bit in Indiana anyone votes for the libertarian in Indiana you're just basically a giving a half a vote to Joe Donnelly but Joe Donnelly is in trouble I think the biggest polling surprised that we saw in the last week was Joe Manchin down by two\nPatrick Morrisey was on this program yesterday that seems like a potentially winnable race or class or the onion\nA mansion where when that will win a rail\nI felt the same thing or two but I Will tell you mentioned didn't vote for the tax cuts mentioned didn't vote for Gorsuch it appears that mentioned had an election year can conversion by voting for Kavanaugh because he knows his career would be over and more importantly the economy was saved in West Virginia coal mining industry by Donald Trump not by mentioned\nAnd I think mentioned did have an election year a conversion and that's all of the good\nElection year ... mean lets be a phony for for a couple of months they will go back to being the liberal we really are\nThat he's not really a liberal he's the most conservative Democrat\nNow I live in this environment that means he's just not a super radical you know left wing lunatics that's all that need I Will take a break we'll come back more John McLaughlin Doug shown our pollsters eight hundred nine four one showing is our number\nA we'll have the latest on what is going on in terms of this\nThe suspect that they have now in custody\nAnd more details as they become available they've uncovered recovered fourteen suspicious packages addressed two prominent people will get to that\nOf course the blame game has been on since the first thing this morning and it's absolutely sickening the way especially CNN has been handling this and much more straight ahead right so the biggest part of off year elections mid term elections that turn out that means you showing up\nAnd this election that we have coming up well it's the most important we have seen in decades why because your savings or tax savings that's on the ballot the American economy is on the ballot America's comeback is on the ballot your jobs are on the ballot your kids' future is on the ballot your wages your four O. one K. is that is also on the ballot\nAnd if you're a small business owner your tax cuts are on the ballot\nAnd here's the biggest issue on the ballot who is in charge of America's future\nPoliticians bureaucrats the socialist in DC or you you want to preserve the victories of the past two\nFour one K. and any other retirement accounts you had to catch it on your investment income tax you on your Social Security benefits and

have been sent out now we have the one person we believed to be responsible in custody does that I have an impact on the election uh Doug Jones\nI think if they serve ads could have any\nImpact it's going to help the Republicans are the county fair minded person would say that as\nWith the sound fourteen devices showing it's very hard to I Hope there's no impact it it's it's it's I think just terrific and I just hope we can pull together as a country and not try to demonize them whether it's a big ... which is an assault on our democracy and on and on our marriage\nWell Diana CNN guy today John McLaughlin John outlawed I actually go out there and say um that deniro is not like the others why Robert De Niro one of the things that I found was on October Fifteen Sean Hannity was doing a whole segment blasting De Niro\nBut things he said on Alec Baldwin show of all places and\nSaid that the Trump allies will regret it because they made a deal with the devil let's play a little bit of Robert De Niro and the things that he said and why been critical\nI mean he's so blatantly stupid he's\n... he's a dog he's a\nPig is a con artist a mutt who doesn't know what he's talking about doesn't do his homework doesn't care thinks she's gaming society doesn't pay his taxes he's an idiot Colin Powell said it best he's a national disaster he's an embarrassment to this country\nIt makes me so angry that this country has gotten to this point that this fool disposal has wound up where he has\nI'd like to punch him in the face\nI guess I'm not supposed to talk about the John\nI Know it but you know what but some people are hoping that after this election it all goes away it's not going to go away what this is about is\nDonald Trump is a historic president and the reason that he's a historic president is he's not from the establishment he beat the Republican establishment he beat the national establishment he's there he's not\nHe's not only draining the swamp but he's a threat to their very existence so what's gonna happen is the presidential race is going to start right after the election November such where the Democrats are going to put up a big field of people who are

rich got running for senator and if the people that have been displaced can't get back and vote that's going to be problematic uh for the sand distance gotten any chance they have a winning\nWell that's what I'm calling to urge my fellow pen to get out and vote which are both Governor Scott needs are but they're hoping that will be too busy for doing recovery tend to get out a\nWhile and Florida early voting is ongoing so that means you can go any time between as I understand it now and election day\nUm I Know it's hard especially for people some people have lost their everything they lost their entire home they'd been relocated and they don't have a chance to change their voter registration probably so that means that have to go back to where they live in or they can get an absentee ballot I don't think it's too late for that\nTo eleven days but you'd have to check in with your local elections office\nYes that's correct I saw it on the news the other day about that's about it still ... but\nI I mean Lee encourage everybody to get out and vote yeah just called your local elections office have them send you an absentee\nBallot if you're not there if you can get back

to use name calling\nThing that they they basically ... every time you disagree with one of them you you end up are racist or not fear and this is what are the way at least I Believe the two people who are\nA bit off maybe they're fighting psychologically the rangers or something but when they hear the left wing calling us Nazis and calling us racist and ... and and having people like Diane

it on there how about Republican incumbent Jeff Denham a former state senator air force veteran he's in a pretty tight race with Josh Harder um that's more in the Central Valley area how does that race\nGoing on with my we're all in tight races like like Denham has been again such a fantastic congressman for his own people he's watched out for them\nI ... I have a couple of disagreements with him but the fact is I Know he is energetic and will step forward and he will argue the case for his people any time so his and although he's being outspent but I'm sure I look I'm being outspent by six or seven to one\nAnd let me uh Bloomberg kicking in another four million dollars and the last week of the campaign all of us are facing that\nBut when the public knows who we are like like a with Duncan Hunter they know how drunk and hotter as they know that um they they they know us personally and they know where I work trying to return to protect them we speak for them and the other people are just calling names and joined the liberal left on\nAll right well for those in Southern California all the seats that we're talking about ISIS old seat Duncan Hunter seat obviously the case of Dana Rohrabacher I mean these have been strong solid conservative voices now in your case\nOr what for a couple of decades now in Congress and you're one of

with the events they\nYou know these devices that never detonated you know I call them I guess suspicious device is because we don't really know if they actually bombs but it got\nMe thinking about very sure that that's been confirmed because when they said they had powder I'm assuming there was some type of gun powder\nSome type of explosive powder and then had shrapnel in it like a lot of charter glass and you know we've got to get to know a little bit more about this guy short of the van that had a CNN sucks picture on it in a picture Donald Trump it doesn't mean a thing and\nYou know by the way I remember when I when Bernie Sanders when one of his supporters shot up that baseball field I said at the time boy if this I'm not blaming Bernie nobody should blame Bernie Sanders he's not responsible for what one does and I said but boy if it was some supporter of Trump or any Republican oh they'd blame everybody\nWell what I mean I'm not going to do with the left does here\nBernie Sanders is not responsible for what one of his stupid supporters have to say but this most Bernie Sanders supporters are not violent and not out there trying to kill Republicans and Bernie said he was sick and by the entire\nYou know anti GOP massacre here All right and I believe him\nWhen I was a different tact than you hear from the media today right\nRight and you know what what concerns me and thank you for correcting me about the update on the um the bomb threat what I'm concerned about is\nAs he mentioned the van with all the stickers okay perhaps it is somebody from the far right but I'm noticing what I'm hearing is the the sticky jury as far as how they were placed how they with no\nYou know issue with the Levant itself but the other thing I thought about was William Clyde Arlen who\nThreaten people with rice and a couple of weeks ago and he was arrested and I'm starting to question could there be an action and the ... knows that individuals could there be more than one person involved in this whole\nScenario that's been going on for as you well know months because the Trump family was threatened as well\nAs I've gone through a lot of this it's not fun and I don't talk about it a lot of ... uh I shared about one percent of the things that I've dealt with throughout my career frankly I don't think anybody wants to hear it and it's sadly is a part of being in the public eye and having strong political views it's on it really is unfortunate\nBut that's why I was I think\nWhat we should be able to be able to do so you know without fear of any type of retribution and\nApparently that's not how it's going to work but you know look it's let's wait and see I Am getting mixed messages all over the place\nOn this man this guy this background we have to find out if there were accomplices here we were just beginning to put it together or people can assume what they want but as we have always done is we're not going to rush to judgment at all in this program and we're going to wait and see and when we know the truth will pass it on to you\nOr we can yeah well we ... we don't know\nYeah the truth matters and China I Want to say one other thing to do with respect to the invasion what concerns me about that and it's not really getting recorded much it's how many people are sick and we have children dying from early on like illnesses now so what talking and bring\nAnd that's another issue I you know I'm concerned about\n[noise] yeah well look we got we always got to stay on top of all these diseases and stay ahead of it and thank God we have some brilliant scientists and doctors that work endlessly out long hours every day to to save us All right we've got to take a break hey listen I Will tell you that my pillow changed my life\nIt just works

because he was never Trump or and\nYou know now he writes a book any devotes twenty pages of is failing book against me and you know lo and behold nobody wants to buy as book as I predicted and I just think it's amazing because when he was running he was begging us to put them on the air as often as we could and we even put an audio out of him praising me\nAt the almost daily so I guess\nYou know he says now I'm Bad for America but I was pretty good for Ben Sasse in America at the time that he wanted to use these airwaves every day to get his message out\nYeah and I'll tell you at least in my district which encompasses about a three quarters of the west end of the state of Nebraska I'm that's Adrian ... district um been sad is not real popular right at the moment I'll just put it that way\nYeah well look I I personally feel like on a level it doesn't happen to me ... very often he said everything that I thought would would make a great senator and lead the great people the ... and

word go ahead what what else on your mind well\nI'm with the package bombs devices\nI think this is kind of um something that a song and the media and some on the left have kind of been wanting to
