of all agree inland folks the last two years Greenland has had near record snowfall and the reason why the north Atlantic is changing it's getting colder again we're going back to the cold\nPeriods of the Atlantic multi decadal oscillation like we were in the eighties and nineties early nineties and that's a natural cyclical process for the past two years if you look at the charts you can see Greenland has had well above normal snow fall\nAnd near record snowfall so Greenland she apparently she's on aware of this because two or three years ago of course Greenland wasn't that way so right about Antarctica\nSo so Antarctica is up near normal they will record breaking record breaking high about five six years ago then they came down below in their back your normal now let me let me say this\nThe president answer the question perfectly here's why up until now\nClimate change first of all everyone believes the climate changes so that her washed is based on a false premise that he doesn't believe the climate change\nThe climate is always change naturally I feel now people are saying that now it's man that's doing it how it is not questioning it make any sense in other words if you were just apply only accept something after ten million years every single time it was natural now\nOr you know whether they're going to bring anybody else better than anyone else I mean when you look back at the earth temperature as a ... and cooler than warmer in the warmer than cooler\nIt has so questioning it questioning authority is what he's doing and that's his background that's why now let me let me get Leslie for if if she lets thing if you are listening will give you for example intensified more rapidly than Michael right off the top of my head\nNineteen thirty five hurricane went

and that's way up in the north Atlantic they're countless examples\nOf rapid feedback development it was a textbook case for it and it's amazing watching this go on in front of my eyes of people say how did this happen how to ... it's right out of my classes at Penn State Nineteen Seventy and then I think Seventy is our number\nOr we have representative John Ratcliffe at talking about fusion\nUPS founder Glenn Simpson well he's now saying indicated he's going to plead the fifth he's not saying a word anymore\nOr he was on Fox News Sunday telling Maria ... Romo that Glenn Simpson is in real legal jeopardy in all of this he also confirmed that the FBI has evidence that directly refused the premise of a ... a Trump Russia probe in other words that there's been and remains exculpatory evidence\nThere was a great piece by Jonathan Turley ... three reasons mother may not charge Trump with obstruction apparently not asking any questions about it but\nSticking exclusively to whether or not there was any type of collusion which we all know the answer to a you have one top Republican lawmaker now saying the FBI failed to provide a\nFederal surveillance court with important evidence well we do that now for a long time and we know that\nFor Pfizer court judges or handed information that was supposed to be verified and corroborated ended up being Hillary Clinton's bought and paid for Russian lies\nThat was put together by fusion GPS interestingly funneled money through Perkins Coolio law from the hiring of Christ is Christopher Steele of foreign national he doesn't even stand by the information and the ...\nAnd it was the bulk of information to get for Pfizer warrants against the Trump campaign associate and the lead up to the twenty sixteen race\nAll this comes down to some simple basic fundamental things and they never told the Pfizer judges that it was Hillary Clinton that paid for this information and it's unbelievable that this could be happening in this country but it looks like we're finally beginning to get to the bottom of it at least I Hope so Jason Chaffetz is with us\nFormer congressman now Fox News contributor author of the New York times best seller the deep state we had Victoria Toensing and Joe diGenova of of the gentleman ... with us ah thank you both for being here let's start with Jason shape it's because this is your wheel house and it seems to me that it doesn't matter what Congress request\nThey seek to do their job of oversight they're never going to get the information from the department of justice and they're not going to get the people they need to talk in front of them under oath\nWell the hard part about when you issues the peanut when I was the chairman of the oversight commission or committee I can issue a subpoena but the only way to go in for that it's through the department of justice and so the weight of the paper really isn't worth much because the deejay won't enforce its own subpoena the subpoena issued by Congress\nThat the name that people need to also familiarize themselves with is mark Elias market why it was ...\nHe was canceled for the DNC he was careful for Hillary Clinton he was counsel for a ... a productive group he was involved there\nThis this guy sits in the middle of a lot of these transactions in the movement of money and I think more and more you'll start to see his name along with you know or and Simpson and all these others\nWell I think the fact that ... Simpson is now saying Victoria that\nGoing to plead the fifth and it can get away with that and make them come in and plead the fifth you know the idea that they can just threatened to plead the fifth and not have to actually go through with it I think it's important\nThey should make him show up and in front of the TV cameras plead the fifth and it's ridiculous to accept a letter from the lawyers and I hope they send you are talking to your former friends and telling them to get them\nOr get in to the Congress to take this that and I don't care if they're not going to um\n... because I think there are other ways to to figure out how to do it\nYou've got us the peanut use the peanut first and then you negotiate later you don't say oh mine he didn't show up talking trying to work it out now you have to think of that scene and he said Pina and then you say you can't make it Wednesday then you make it there is that I Can't believe there's no ... well\nI mean I'm trying to understand I mean the president said that there would be de classification and all the materials the Jim Jordan was just talking about would be an redacted and we'd have a chance to see the visor warrants the gang of eight information that three oh two between\nAh Bruce or and Christopher Steele and how they wanted a funnel that information straight into Robert Mueller's office uh Joe diGenova but you know the idea of why do I think even with you and Victoria's my attorneys\nThat I wouldn't get away with just saying I'm going to plead the fifth leave me alone now or or not handing over subpoenaed materials to Congress\nWell I don't think there's any question that Congress has dropped the ball on course to get some opinions but let me just say this 'cause this is really important all the names that you heard Michael Mr liar Simpson\nOr all those people they are who to everything that was done in the United states what's fascinating is what happened in the United kingdom between the Congress and core issue a subpoena score we now know that the FBI or\nAm I sick and that you know a few\nTo conduct electronic surveillance of American citizens on foreign soil without legal authority to do so and that information was fat conversations a George ... what were your perspective and in the course of the second the compensation\nThey found out that Papadopoulos was not interested in Hillary email or anything else and they never ... information to the by the court\nYou know it seems congressman shape it's that every piece of the puzzle now is falling in place I think we now understand\nWhat the insurance policy was Lisa Page testify that in the the nine months of the investigation leading up to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller that they had no evidence of Trump Russia collusion at all um and by the way even\nHer lover Peter Struck said the same thing he said well I'd be all end up there was something there there is no there are there\nAnd then all of a sudden we find the media elites strategy that they discussed this with Andrew McCabe comes in James Baker comes in and other people come in and what we see is again it goes back to the Clinton bought and paid dossier that dossier information is leaked out to the media creating the impression that in fact there was\nRussia Trump collusion but they did it themselves they took the again it's it's all they were doing the leaking so that they can appoint the special counsel so then the which one could be ... begin I is there any part of the puzzle that isn't clear to you because it's getting very clear to me\nDo it is becoming a crystal clear\nAnd that's why Jim Jordan is exactly right the people that were in that meeting and river the timing of this evening this meeting happens directly after\nA district Colombia's relieved of his duties but just before I'm Mr Mueller is put into place and you have to understand who's in that meeting what was discussed it sounds like bakers being most candid about what was going on there but\nEach of the people in that meeting should be brought in for its own their own deposition\nUh transcribed under oath or before Congress you don't have these five minute little you know after you have questions when you do this and I've been in these they go for an hour for the Republican than the Democrats get time than another hour for Republicans and you can really get in depth information if they would do it that way\nVictoria I think that's true and that's right and that's just an that's fair but\nThe obstruction continue I Will take a break we'll come back more with Jason Chaffetz and Joe diGenova also Victoria Toensing with us I Want to remind you our friends at my pillow they have done it again not only did they make the best greatest pillow ever

I wasn't there I only watched what when\nThe fights that started the videos that that everybody's been putting on line and um\nI got to be honest I think Rand Paul and we saw what happened in the Brett Kavanaugh hearings during the hearings which is fine that was free speech I didn't have any problem with that at all I think we've gotten to the point where we're going to have to kick out citizens so that the men and women are now ... get to walk the halls\nWithout what's now becoming I think it's dangerous confrontations own and I have\nBeen protests on the left and in the right in Congress including disrupting earrings and find a way all within the last ... or ... and to\nDo it but I don't have a problem with the with the speaking part but I Do have a problem if they're not letting these people walk there screaming at them they're in their face and if something's gonna happen Sally here's the praise my fear is just rhetoric is now crossed the line if you're talking about physical violence confronting members of the government\nYou know you know one thing I and I pulled by play it for you right now\nI always said about Obama the number one leaves kids alone that both he and Michelle seem like good parents they really did and I ... and I also said we've got to protect our presidents and I said it when Obama was president so many times I can play a loop of it if you like to hear it\nWay I don't need to but what I Would want me to play it again look\nOf all you're ignoring the wishes of nonviolent protest the phone calls to petition the whatever those are the marching orders and second of all you have your seem to be ignoring the examples that Donald Trump really when people stood up for him saying well I got to hurt and if you can send you in court don't worry about it\nAnd you talk marching orders for violent\nOkay I remember one nothing is another one another that sort of like well what I was saying oh no no no no I mean if you want me the question\nI didn't take that and it's the same intensity and messages I'm hearing regularly but this is an everyday thing that is now happening with the Democratic party\nBy the way I have the evidence of me saying about Obama\nOnly play with ... ... you're talking about protecting the president of the United states of America and it's just there's no room for error\nYou've got to protect the president that that represents the free world so they've got a very difficult job they've got to almost be perfect and anytime any incident happens ah lately is becoming pretty high profile I\nMissed the speakers you're gonna have strong feelings about this we've now learned that this guy that broke into the White House not only did he get in the door\nBut he knocked down the secret
