add more senators from West Virginia from Indiana from North Dakota from Missouri from Florida\nA from Arizona Nevada and but until then you know I don't know what happens I have no faith\nThat anybody really gives a rip that this man's life has been bludgeoned this family has been bludgeoned then there's there's no corroborating evidence for any of it\nBut I think we have to wait to see what happens in the FBI's report if the investigation finds\nPlausible evidence against Kavanaugh this will not only helped to restore his reputation and solidify the integrity of the United States Supreme court at large\nBut it will also give a valid reason to senators like Murkowski and Collins a and Jeff Flake and somebody like Joe mansion and and perhaps a couple of others are who are Democrats to vote in favor of cabinet but I find it amazing to me\nA vet were holding Kavanaugh\nTo an unfair a standard of his behavior\nIn high school and college as a lead shift I doubt very many Democrats in the United States Senate could could meet\nThat standard in some of these allegations Julie sweat Nick are preposterous on their faces you point out she's now backtracking NBC issued a statement\nSaying that we can't confirm any of what she's saying and in fact she's deviated now from her sworn affidavit or in her most recent interview with NBC News so you know that a claim\nWhat do you think of the view which again this statement only come out a week prior and multiple mold I mean she backtrack dramatically on very key points\nAnd when you think of the seriousness of drug in girls and gang raping them and how she well he was near the punch bowl and while he wasn't lined up buddy I saw him in the hall and nobody else\nI mean she was saying this was done as a matter of course on weekends at the time we believe that no girl that was raped no boys that saw the drug gang of girls ever told the teacher a parent a law enforcement officer\nNobody told them\nI find that go ahead Greg answer that you're still no no go ahead David\nWell I I I find that again absurd on its face as you said this is I Do uh the the sweat Nick ... while the other sweating allegations that just doesn't hold true and I think following up on what you said\nAnd he doesn't comport with human nature just wouldn't have happened that way but it was truly right there would have been held up eight after one and it for sure after multiple times this doesn't hold true but in response to something you said earlier\nOr what we do taking this in the mid term\nIf the FBI I'm something really damning which I truly that uh nothing will change the fact that the Democrats have acted in bad thing\nEither way and the people know that what they've done is way except that I and pernicious\nAnd I think the public is is outraged and I think they're going to punish the Democrat and in the mid term what I Do think though is we'd be much better off with a victory\nAnd and the Democrats having acted the way they have then I lost and them having acted the way they have because what Trump stands for is fighting and ultimately win\nAnd we we always blame our losses in the Senate on these ... these are moderates in these questions and they traders I don't wanna say trader literally track with these people who don't have any guts are actually liberal than Republican clothing\nTo choose from

Mick\nParty culture where almost ...\nThe weekend that women girls young girls were being drugged with ... and and ... forced to be an ... and young boys would then lined up outside the room waiting to gang rape\nWomen and girls and that this happened thirty six years ago\nAnd nobody ever ever ever told a parent told a teacher told law enforcement and she gives the names just like in the case of professor Ford of individuals that would quote\nCorroborate this story and it's not corroborated just the opposite well this guy is dead and on top of that then we've got oh this one doesn't even know who you are\nHow does this how do you where it is the new standard in any capacity here to put this on the air Byron York\nIs a joining us he's been running a lotta columns about this not the least of which is how high the bar has risen in the goalposts we've come a long way from oh it's going to be very limited in terms of the FBI investigation it's only going to be maximum a week and they'll get the job done and will move forward with a vote\nNow you see that a Camille Harris she's now coming out with another allegation just today\nMyron\nHey Sean listen on this on this NBC thing I think everybody's got to be in two minds a war on on the basis of the lack of evidence and\nUh there's no way the story should ever had been reported publicly just shouldn't have bad but it was given in part a a due to the news networks um thing about Michael I haven't had any her lawyer\nSo once it was all out there the fact that NBC has reported this is probably a good corrective or at least where you can see what I think what it was a parent to a lot of people are there just was nothing to this story\nUm and when she offered a witnesses to corroborate the stories you just played a one hit the writer who she was\nAnother was deceased and to others didn't answer the phone so I'm the story is already out there and has already done the damage it is a good thing to knock it out\nAll right so let's go through all three cases that the the Democrats now want to expand the investigation they they never wanted a limited investigation they wanted to know fledged investigation is now being the seventh\nFrom every indication at all I'm reading though that the FBI is moving expeditiously and it seems like they're very close to probably completing their work but if we start with professor Ford professor Ford claimed\nThat these four people were at the party nobody remembers any such party that she describes and the one person that was supposedly was an eye witness to the alleged abuse in her case\nUm was mark judge and he said absolutely it didn't happen and then if you look at the ... if you look at the ... case this was in the New Yorker well the New York times couldn't print the

have a boat on Capitol and uh I assume it's going to happen at some point this week we have any any timetable idea\nBut I don't know yet but uh I think that's correct and so here with the agreement or with our colleagues and Chris Coons was never part of the agreement he's a Democrat from Delaware L like risk but he was never part of this agreement what compromise has been reached for Chris Coons he is voting no he's\nAsking for the investigation to continue around whether or not he's been honest about his drinking habits so Chris Coons is a non factor here Lisa Murkowski Susan Collins Jeff Flake expressed a desire for the FBI\nTo talk to the witnesses around the Ford allegation and ... and the fall and incredibly any credible lead within\nI think the FBI's about finished everybody can look that report for themselves and see if it's changed anything I Hope we don't move the goalpost Geoff oh did you sing committee when the understanding that he wanted to see what the FBI found about these accusations and hopefully get this done this week\nAll right let's talk about this agreement because it was supposed to be limited in scope and now it is expanded out further we now see the\n... ah your your colleague on the Senate Judiciary committee the great senator from the state of Hawaii he wants men by the way to sit down and shut up yeah which was a pretty outrageous statement but anyway a senator her own out now is saying she wants in an F. FBI investigation into the quote I throwing report\nYeah yeah that's where we're our so my dad owns a bar\nAnd so a throw in ice is like a good day in a bar so uh the bottom line is this whole bunch of BS and she's not part of the agreement she voted and she's the one that said the goal was to delay\nOr the hearing long enough to get into the mid term soon and I have a Democrat replace\nA Justice Kennedy in twenty twenty she said that not one media outlets fed ask her what did you mean but they're agreement I just outlined it was a the three witnesses that Dr Ford named mess for ... isn't there any a credible leads within that world of FBI will follow them and that's it and we're going to vote this week\nOkay let's talk a little bit about your on the program last night on on Hannity and I thought you dropped\nA huge bomb shell and I was asking you look I have no idea how Jeff Flake gonna end up voting in this I have no idea what Lisa Murkowski is going to do I have no idea what Susan Collins is going to do or they are your colleagues maybe you up some more insight than I have but\nTo me they're the ones that met privately with Joe Manchin and they decided on this course now that it's an FBI investigation but we're supposed to be limited in scope is now expanded out into other allegations but if you fall one vote short you came up with a pretty\nInteresting and thoughtful idea that I kind of like\n[noise] well I think we've got the votes and then some but here's the question does the Republican Party abandon Brett Kavanaugh delete legitimize the\nWay he was treated if the Senate is it forty nine what I Would like to see happen is to appeal the verdict of the Senate and the November election and take it to some of the states and see if the people in those states agree with their senator about Brett Kavanaugh the swap\nWould abandon Kavanaugh the traditional way of doing business is if they fail one vote short just pull the plug\nHe's never quit I don't want to quit on him so I think Trump might be different I think Trump with say listen this man's been abused I'm not given up on hand less having an election to see if the vote in the Senate really represented the Trump states were Democrats a rain\nWell I mean this is the thing I mean we have people like Joe Donnelly he's a no he said already Claire McCaskill's know already as a matter of fact that most Democrats would know no matter who Donald\nTrump s ride they've already against ...\nYeah All right so now what's going to happen to Bill Nelson of Florida and Joe Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp and Joe Donnelly and well a smart question\nMartha ... a great candidate for the Republicans in Arizona most served their country with honor and distinction I Hope she wins um we certainly could use a win out in Nevada or do you think this impacts the race and do you actually think you're going to get the votes and why do you think you'd get the votes\nWell number one I think we're going to get the votes because Jeff voted in committee yes I don't believe the FBI is going to find anything a relevant to this limited investigation that would show that\nThat are ... for its claims are more credible and that there's anything new about Brett Kavanaugh in terms of the investigation I Would hope they would stay consistent with this vote I think the other two Collins and Murkowski or friends they're warning the FBI to check the committee's homework I get that\nThat will be done here shortly but you're asking the hypothetical\nI Can't imagine how we would explain to the Republican Party that we gave up on Brett Kavanaugh because for one vote short when a lot of the states that led to that vote being short Trump won I Do not believe North Dakota once a highly had camp to vote no\nI agree with you\nI Am so this is why you have an election appeal the verdict that the Senate if we have to to the people of of the country in November\nLet me ask you if you've spoken to the red state Trump state Democrats that are up for reelection if you talk to any of\nThem doing it right now uh [laughter] so you mean you're you're communicating hand I don't I'm not sure if they're all Hannity listeners and viewers beyond doubt\nI doubt if they're listening [laughter] I think we're fine but here's the dilemma that you that this process has put us in this is about the future of the judiciary the states couldn't be higher is about the reputation of one of the finest man I Know\nIt's about who would come forward after this debacle is about sending a tone and the standard that will destroy the ... and eat the Senate alive so I Know President Trump pretty well\nI think we've got the votes and then some but I think he's a different kind of politician that he wouldn't let the system get off the hook that if we had to as a last resort where one vote short let's say hypothetically we would take this issue to the ballot box and about thirty something days thirty five we\nCan find and find that extra vote that way we would have a good nominee or have a light salvaged have a process uh saved and the people finally get to speak up here I think we're fine but you asked me a question and I thought about this yesterday\nAnd said if Brett Kavanaugh is on the ballot in some of the states I think it changes the election you see in North Dakota there's a poll out today the number one issue in North Dakota is I'm Brett Kavanaugh's nomination as far ahead of anything else sixty to twenty eight the people in North Dakota North Dakota support Brett Kavanaugh\nWell it's fascinating to me that the Democratic leadership is showing no support or comprehension or understanding\nOf what their colleagues from states that are not New York and California have to go through in terms of reelection but the reality is\nThat I Would even argue that if they do vote for Kavanaugh it's only an election year conversion and there were only doing it because if they don't the people in their state will throw him out but they'll probably go right back to to be in a party line vote would Schumer at the end of the\nDay [laughter] well you know I'm I'm not a psychologist or political scientist\nI don't care is like you know I'm a bad business I don't care how you find Jesus as long as you do you know if you can figure out that Brett Kavanaugh as highly qualified and these accusations have crumbled are good for you and now here's the point\nThis has become the most despicable thing I've seen in Washington and that's saying a lot\nIt changed the face of the judiciary forever if we condone it so it's just not a complicated issue for me if we follow vote short a less take this to the ballot box and see what happens\nLet me ask you about this whole process now we've gone through and and I do think the Republicans and you know I'm pretty honest broker I'm pretty critical of Republicans when they're wrong I Do think that they they have handled this with the seriousness the charge deserves I think ...\n[noise] yes no I think they handled it properly because these are serious allegations but she identified in and look I won't go through the ... the entire\nWe don't need to we don't need to reach try this case I made I don't mind you've made up your mind there five accusations that have are are are not verified or just made up not true outrageous so it's not about cabinet\nThem is that this is
