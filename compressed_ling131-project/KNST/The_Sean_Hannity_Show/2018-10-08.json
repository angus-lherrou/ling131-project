I mean in other words I talk about every election Republicans racist or sexist massage in his homophobic Xena phobic Islamophobia they weren't dirty air water and they wanna kill granny on roller over a cliff and they want to kill children well now with you know hold hangers being sent then\nAnd there it's it's just the same tactics as does\nThose tactics I think are backfiring on the Democrats and all of the activists and protesters and and these special interest groups the polling data Sean is very revealing there was some apathy among Republicans as is often the case in a midterm election\nAnd suddenly that changed and transformed GOP voters into energized and motivated voters to get out on\nElection day next month because they see what is going to happen if they lose the house and the Senate because Nancy Pelosi and Jerry Adler who would then become\nA chairman of the Judiciary Committee if Democrats win the house are vowing to a ... exact we're van ... a retribution investigation to remove calving off those from the Supreme Court by virtue of\nArticles of impeachment and and there's nothing that will motivate of Republican voters more than that kind of a threat to undermine the Democratic process of confirmation and to try to stabilize the Supreme Court for partisan reasons\nOh it's going to be interesting to watch do you think politically John you watch a lot of campaigns is they're going to be as big as the American people going to be motivated in twenty nine days and they're going to remember this\nWell I Can't read the tea leaves but what we just saw with the confirmation battle actually was a an example of our separation of powers inaction were each branch exercise it's appropriate role\nAnd now in our democracy the people are going to decide and you know there are going to be irresponsible lawyers who are going to come\nGo on T. V. shows with more people who are claiming I should have been interviewed I could have told this town and I just hope that people can separate the wheat from the ...\nAs a prosecutor looking at these three cases how would you handle them thirty six years later in each case no corroboration in each case\nUh well uh with I don't know anything beyond what's in the public record but without corroboration you might entertain a meeting for an hour or two and say thank you for coming by a there's nothing to talk about\nUm okay so when when professor board for example she can't remember location\nYou cant remember an exact date or a place not he's struggling to know the year in the case of ... Ramirez she's calling other fellow students from back in the day she's asking them if they remember because she's not sure she remembers\nA in the case of Julie sweating neck who made the you know changed her story well Brett Kavanaugh gave out red solo cups and he was near the punch bowl and I saw him in a hall maybe not lined up in a hall\nUm which is very different from the these sworn affidavit that they had originally laid out the week before I mean you ... if you look at that but in the prosecutor's office what are they going to say\nWell are they going to say a these are all frivolous accusations but uh as far as we know regarding doctor for that one nine or ten witnesses interviewed and people are going to say well there were so many more who didn't weren't interview it's not the number of interviews\nIt's the what they have to say and if it's all cumulative you don't if you don't count the witnesses\nAnd but I think some of those other people as I say now I'm going to want to have their twenty four hours in the sun or you know in the in the same and they're gonna wanna go to the national Enquirer or something like that but there are no criminal there no criminal cases are no civil cases are good men was confirmed he's now a justice and we need to move on\nLet's talk about the news that we are pretty confident as coming out this week um let me just say this very up to sleep I can that if a top ranking FBI official word a confirmed that there was an orchestrated effort among the upper echelon\nWithin the the O. J. and the FBI to go\nAfter Donald Trump or retribution for the firing of James told me what would that mean reg ...\nIt would mean that this was all a hoax the Russian hoax and it wasn't Trump Russia collusion\nAnd that would mean Greg Garrett was right from the get go but yeah I\n... and and yes and the latest information only corroborate the thesis of the book there there wasn't Trump Russia collusion but there was Hillary Clinton Russia collusion she had on her payroll British spy\nA who is using Russian sources and now we've learned through the interview behind closed doors of James Baker the top uh FBI lawyer\nThey documents were being passed him from Hillary Clinton lawyer and the tea and she's a lawyer\nA shoe you know this is a stomach sharing information uh and in fact we've also learned that you know this was part of the vice a warrant to spy on the Trump campaign none of it\nWas corroborated a federal regulations are very clear you may not submit the Fisk\nInformation and evidence that is on corroborated and yet that is precisely what they did and so I agree with you when these documents are classified and the inspector general has it has had enough time to look at them and decide I think they will be explosive\nIs there any way that Rod Rosenstein who signed the fourth buys a warrant we know the bases the bulk of the information in the ... the application John was the unverified\nAre uncorroborated dot CA the political document that Hillary paid for I mean how is it possible that they passed for those and I mean that wasn't he has to be held accountable for that\nWell let's wait and see when the documents of declassified but the answer to your question does of course uh we talk about the president does not above the law and he's not but certainly knew there was the deputy attorney general\nBut ah I see one thing a little bit differently and maybe we're going to segue into this and that is everything you're talking about should be thoroughly investigated\nBut I think it's separate from what the more people are doing and I think that the Mueller investigation can conclude by showing independently that the president was just not involved in any wrongdoing and it doesn't have to be one or they did not necessarily linked\nWould they would he have an obligation to this is what frustrates me I think that the the mandate was so broad that we end up going into people's\nYou know main bank loan applications from years gone by to me is just ridiculous the considering where it was supposed to start and where it was supposed to go or would it not lead to an important issue especially of Russian lives were paid for and disseminated to the American people\nTo purposely lie to them before an election and worse than that used to use them five buys the applications to spy on an opposition party candidate and then use later to destroy a presidential\nUh a president who was duly elected\nWell a hundred percent and if those things that verified the people involved should be held responsible criminally but I'm saying that the bowler investigation in itself\nCan conclude by showing the president didn't do anything wrong one of the dangers of a special counselor or a special prosecutor is they have only one case so they're on a mission but what I've always believed is\nIf a special counsel does a thorough investigation and concludes that in this case the president did not do anything wrong he that special counsel has not failed\nGreat for families teams in individual she was from over one hundred projects on the day

I found out about the you know the hacking of my emails and wiretapping of my uh\nAnd this of first happened in August so you found out pretty early\nYeah and actually I ... I first started getting phone calls I didn't know about the intelligence operation I just\nGot a call ... ... that they had this buys a warrant against you in the media knew about it or you believe they knew about it\nWell the first news report ah I think came out with his a lady Louise mensch in October of twenty sixteen ... within just a couple of days of when the uh first Pfizer weren't with I think first\nRan with the story in March of Seventy yes and that's what we said wait a minute there is a buys a warrant on the Trump campaign or were you aware of our reporting at the time\n... it's funny Sean writes a interesting story I haven't talked about it in the media before but in March twenty Seventeen that's what's been leaked in the Washington Post that I was having all these meetings with the FBI\nI remember you know in these long series of ten hours plus meetings one of the meetings I'm walking out I mentioned\nThat well I had a long interview it in detail with Catherine heritage and it's going to be airing tonight on the on the evening shows on Fox and what they say they were quite a you know they they gave me a bit of luck let's just put it that way but they again because it's all about you know media perception\nWhat are they asking you at the time what do they want to know their spying on you and then they're bringing you win simultaneously\nYou've never been charged with anything there's no indication you're ever going to be charged with anything at all you don't fear that that in any way you're going to be charged right\n... well I Know I've never done anything wrong right and again the primary focus of those conversations was about the ... right right the same false allegations that the DNC paid for going back to a ...\nA lot about that that they ask you specifics about that dossier\nAbsolutely yeah basically everything I've done and kind of all sort of revolving around that also you know as you were alluding to I've been a source for the intel community previously and you know I helped or the year prior\nThere is a an indictment of ... or ... you know someone pleaded guilty in the southern district of New York and I was a witness on that case so you know we were talking a bit about that too\nAll right let's talk a little bit about what now now that your life had been up and then um you I I Know you're fighting to get your good name back\nI Know media organizations have pulled lies about you\nOr I Would say that the there was absolutely reckless disregard for the truth that a lot of these cases um what are your plans what are you gonna do what are you going to do to the government that ends up you know using on verified information to literally take away all of your civil liberties has got to be some recourse for you\nWell I'd definitely working on a few strategies Sean to me the biggest concern is just the damage that this has done to our country and the roads blocked that it's created for the Trump Administration in the first couple of years in office so\nMy the biggest thing that goes back to the first thing you were talking about in your segment a with chairman Goodlatte just getting the truth out there and so I'm doing everything possible to help facilitate that you\nShould write a book what it's like to be spied on by your government you know something to that if I'm Serious that would be you know a at a movie certainly that could be put on the screen as as well but I mean what does it feel like because I guess maybe there are some people because they took out the Warren on you\nDo you have you you know what they did they ask you about everything that you were saying and doing it this time\nBasically yeah and I'm going back many years again at and we had talked about many hours\nTotal do you think you've spoken to intel community FBI Muller all these people how many hours do you think you spend total\nOver the last two years out of the last two decades two years last two years well I mean in terms of actually in person meetings you know forty eight hours or something like that but you know when you add in the hundreds and hundreds of hours I had to do in terms of document production etcetera right now that's a\nWhole different level when you went before a mall or what was that like you know I don't I don't like to talk about that ... just because in general they have been a less leaky\nTerms of getting the you know mentioning that fact but it was reported in December of twenty Seventeen December last year that I had a recently been in front of the grand jury and I won't I
