destroy Trump they want impeachment open borders\nIce eliminated keep their crumbs and Obamacare short of that what else do they stand for\nSo if you got to start it's important to remember that you know it's an uphill battle in mid term elections the party that controls the presidency as only gain seats in the house of representatives three times in the last one hundred years\nYou have also on top of that you've got about forty retirements to deal with which means that the names on the ballot\nOr new and different hopefully better in some cases\nBut are you better off today than you or two years ago as a matter of America better off today than it was two years ago\nIs America stronger than it was two years ago is the economy better off than it was two years ago is the president keeping his word is promises to you the American people\nWe know that on the issue of the tax cuts well at least kept his promise on the issue of ending burdensome regulation these kept his promise on building the wall he hasn't fully been able to do it because it hasn't been fully funded Kevin McCarthy introduce the bolt built today to fully fund the wall\nBut he has spent three point three and a half trillion dollars to\nFund the wall in our record unemployment and fourteen states we now have the lowest unemployment rate in over fifty years last time it was this low was Nineteen sixty nine when the New York Mets shocked the world that won the world series that's how far back that goes\nHispanic American unemployment record lows African American unemployment record low women in the work force record low record low for\nAsian Americans also record low for a veterans who have come back from war they're getting employed as well to\nPresidents kept his promises on ... dealing with rogue regimes like Iran and North Korea\nThe sanctions in Iran are now paying off we see the Iranian economy about tank every day we see the whole issue with little rocket man we don't have a rocket being fired almost every other day that seems to be remaining on track the president hasn't given up anything in regards to that\nPresident has opened up an war we now have one of the largest oil reserves that was on available because of environmental extremism it's a vast wilderness and we just let it sit there\nAnd we haven't been able to tap into those resources or building the Dakota pipelines or the Keystone Pipeline that's all in the works now too\nIt's not a small deal is it that the president kept his promise and put to original is on the U.S Supreme Court they've now been confirmed he gave us the names of people that he would select from any selected from that list\nPromises made promises kept too short years and we see the benefits of the country\nAnd in twenty eight days for

Pelosi's picking out the drapes Maxine Waters is thinking impeachment Jerrold Nadler once endless investigation nobody's thinking about what they're going to do for you we the people\nWhat are they going to do they're going to now finally come out against Obamacare no they love Obamacare they gotta now say you know what these tax cuts are working and it's creating jobs they're not going to do that either\nYou know we've learned a lot in the last couple of days and we're really going to dig down deep do a Hannity investigation and the next hour\nIn a while we've been so busy in the last three weeks covering the blood thinning of judge Kavanaugh leading up to his confirmation\nThere's been a lot of news that we have not been covering one of them is John Solomon Sarah quarter you know Byron York everybody Catherine heritage of all been breaking stories but\nYou know we have all the evidence now that things were far worse regarding the effort to literally on do\nAn election of the president first we know that just to remind you can bring you back words a little bit remember Hillary Clinton the single greatest obstruction of justice case slam dunk case in our history\nWe know that Hillary Clinton obstructed justice when she deleted subpoenaed emails and then use bleach pet and then busted up devices with cameras were had arranged to it that's obstruction\nBut of course she had friends in the deep state they took the case away from the field agents and brought it in a house with the upper echelon of the FBI and that would be called me and struck in company\nAnd told me and struck in particular they wrote the exoneration Hillary in May of twenty sixteen long before they ever interviewed Hillary or the main people involved in the whole thing\nAnd then all of a sudden they interview her Peter Struck one of the interviewers\nA man that thinks that Hillary should win a hundred million to zero and a exonerate Hillary three days later and then they launched the Russia investigation\nAn exoneration before an investigation that means the fix was it if the field agents if they were allowed to do their job it never would have ended up that way because they would have followed the rule of law they would have they would have kept their pledge of equal application of our laws\nWell now the new evidence and remember then all everything goes back to the dossier that Hillary bought and paid for but\nWe now know that last week while we were covering the cabinet an issue that the FBI general counsel James Baker remember he reported directly to James cone may\nWell he told congressional investigators last week that an attorney\nRemember the company Perkins Kuwait that's the company that Hillary's campaign and she was controlling the DNC money according to Don and Brazil will they will funneling money into Perkins Kuwait which is a law firms so it would show up on campaign finance report says illegal cost\nIt turns out they would hire fusion GPS in our research group that went out and hire the former ... six agent\nOr the name of Christopher Steele Christopher Steele uses Russian sources he himself doesn't even stand by any of his sources he doesn't believe his own dot CA when push came to shove and an inter August tore and Great Britain but anyway this revelation is\nBaker telling the number two the the lead counsel for the FBI has now gone twenty five pop representatives of the FBI and the de OJ or either resigned or fired or\nOr stepped aside and anyway stunning revelation that he told congressional investigation gators that an attorney for ... law firm gave him the materials again this is what Hillary paid for about Russian election meddling during the twenty sixteen presidential campaign\nThat's done in terms of what\nIt reveals since uh directly contradicts Justice Department and FBI official sworn testimony\nSo in other words they lied under oath\nAnd Baker was telling Congress last week the ... lawyer Michael Sussman directly handed documents to him about Russia's attempts at meddling in the twenties sixteen election\nIn other words he was a cut out he was a go between for Hillary Clinton and the FBI knew it the question is why did the FBI knowing this then lie about\nThat in fact you know its application then for the Pfizer warrant which we now know the bulk of information for that was the Clinton bought and paid for dot CA that even the guy to put it together doesn't stand by but anyway\nThe fights application was based on Hillary's bought and paid for dot CA but it was all to get warrants to spy on a Trump campaign associate\nAnd by the way it seems now that it was done at the direction of Donald Trump's opponent Hillary Clinton\nKids under Eighteen free with paid adult tickets on line at

be destined Fort\nWalton Beach uh and surrounding communities and uh is hurricane warning storm surge warnings have all been issued along the Gulf Coast as I understand that we have some evacuations now taking place and it looks like it's a really big threat to the panhandle thoughts and prayers go to our friends down in\nThe panhandle area we check in with both job of started the official weatherman of the Sean Hannity show and of course he's with weather bell dot com and spin I'm being told that the worst storm to hit the Florida Panhandle and like decades how bad is\nWhy I think it's going to be the or maybe the worst on record in Panama City\nOr that area particularly last major hurricane to hit coming in at this angle was a hurricane ... back in Nineteen Ninety five hurricane cage\nIt there in November believe it or not um Nineteen eighty five that was a major hurricane in the Gulf but a week into a category too when it went through there so this is probably going to be the benchmark storm for that Panama City area\nNow the fortunate thing is if we want to cover the a sort of the silver lining here Pensacola and mobile are going to get north wins\nAnd mobile I don't think this is a big deal immobile Pensacola go forty ... sixty maybe three or four inches of rain\nBut once you start moving east southeast would down the coast and especially in the Panama City area\nThis is going to be as bad as you see in that particular area the weather pattern you remember Florence was off its peak when it hit the north Carolina coast this one because of the weather pattern is intensifying as it comes to the coast\nAnd I don't expect anything to stop it from being a place that strong category where he perhaps even a a borderline category for upon landfall very well telegraph in this pattern you remember Shawn last time I was on with you I said I'll I'll probably\nWere hit by Florence is going to be another three to six locally ten inches of rain coming Thursday night into friday morning friday the storm will be between Kate Patterson Norfolk go right out to sea to the south of New England no problem in the north east from it but it is going to be a big problem even in the Carolinas or because of the fact that there's more rain coming\nSo you're going to you're basically saying this is going to come up through the Florida Panhandle it's going to sort of veer right hit the Carolinas hard and then go out to sea\nYeah won't hit the ... you'll see forty to sixty mile an hour winds maybe ... hurricane force along the outer banks and forty or sixty

J. face consequences\nRegarding fights that well he signed the final buys a warrant himself and then when he was talking about the rule of law speaking up for truth and Jim Jordan blasting Rod Rosenstein conduct now the president met yesterday on air force one apparently had a meeting not a lot of details about what went on in the meeting\nWith Rod Rosenstein there was talk about well he might be fired after it had been discovered that he was talking about well you want me to wear a wire\nAround the president and his answer was you know at least to the spin was well I was just saying that you wouldn't want me to wear a wire around the president and it was all in the tone and the cadence of what he said we have three articles in front of me right now one by Katherine heritage at Fox one by Sarah quarter won by John Solomon\nSolomon's article goes on former FBI lawyer plot to record removed Trump was not a joke and John Solomon let me read from the article don't tell former FBI general council member James Baker\nHe was one of those that resigned that those infamous discussions\nAbout secretly recording president Donald Trump and using the tapes to remove him for office where a joke he apparently doesn't believe it and he yelled quite the vantage point as he was on the inside of the FBI bureaus leadership and may have twenty Seventeen when the discussions occurred and Baker told Congress last week\nThat his boss than acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe remember ... and Lisa Page both took notes of the meeting and McCabe was saying yeah Rod Rosenstein had in fact said this\nAny way now James Baker is saying and Andrew McCabe is saying that in fact they were dead serious about about the idea\nOf Sarah surreptitiously recording the forty fifth president\nUsing the evidence to make the case\nThat Trump should be removed from office according to every source now in all three articles and Baker told lawmakers that he wasn't\nIn the meeting that McCabe had with the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein and which the subject came up but he had first hand conversations with McCain and the FBI lawyer that was assigned to a ... page about the issue\nSo Baker talk to both of the un quote as far as Baker was concerned this was the real plan being discussed that the source directly familiar with thinking\nIt'll investigation it was no laughing matter to the FBI or member then you can go back to what was the insurance policy to remove Trump is five months now into his presidency is this just before the appointment of the special counsel\nAs soon as Justin ... at that time frame around the media elite strategy that was occurring anyway so it goes on word of bakers testimony now is surface just days before Rosenstein said to be interviewed and private by the\nHouse Judiciary committee lawmakers that's supposed to happen Thursday of this week and the New York times first reported allegations that Rosenstein the number two at the department of justice has tried to downplay his role in all of this in his office suggested that\nHe thought the discussion was a joke that Rosenstein never gave in order to carry out any such plot and he doesn't believe the Trump should be removed from office\nBut making those statements through a spokesperson is a bit different than having Rosenstein himself face Congress answer the questions under the penalty of a felony if lawmakers think he's lying and bakers account lawmakers this month clearly complicates that already complicated picture\nAs it relates to Rod Rosenstein before Congress assuming he shows up for Thursday's interview but even more so Baker story ... extraordinary conversation and we go on from there and now we've got to really take our time with this issue today and\nWe're going to now begin to put the pieces of the puzzle together because what this is where laying out here are the top people the the upper echelon remember twenty five people have either been demoted fired or have left the FBI the OJ and their\nUpper ranks here and James Baker is one of them and Andrew McCabe at least a page of both corroborating what apparently now James Baker is set about Rod Rosenstein anyway John Solomon ease but investigative reporter is what the hell rag Jarrett Fox News legal analyst\nAnd of course the seller of the number one book the Russia hoax\nThank you all for being with us I'm John let's just I Want to also put this in context where people because it gets complicated we got a first start with the timeline the timeline is may have twenty Seventeen or that's when Robert Mueller is getting appointed by Rod Rosenstein\nJust before that we had people like ... Lisa Page in and Peter Struck talking about uh media elite strategy\nThat had to do with the dusty a while it now appears that that was all being league for the purposes and again ... all was was the ... a recycled and different news outlets\nFor the purpose of initiating the special counsel so would get appointed that we're discovering that they're even talking about surreptitiously taping the president of the United states so that they can remove him from office this sounds like a cool to me\nOr if there's one other event that occurs and that may find friends that really I think you're a shockwave for this conversation and that was the termination of James\nComey's the FBI Director of it allowed all this Russia investigation to go on and we know now ... just after market in may and they still have or wherever you're from a proving any form of collusion with Russia so they've been nine months out of James Kobe's let this go on for nine months\nHe's let two agents who have an anti Trump a virus read that investigation he gets fired and what's the natural reaction of all those who've been supporting James Comey that's being roses is a a Medicaid and a stroke page it's hey maybe we can remove this guy rather can't prove that he did something wrong with Russia\nMaybe we can prove confident and will will record him\nAnd uh and maybe try to take 'em out through the recording and the twenty Fifth Amendment this is not what the FBI was brought into the wrong track record talk about history book\nLays out a real possibility that this was a soft grew right look at this we have the FBI not investigating a crime here that in fact they can't find a crime by a pay as\nWell at least ... pages testimony just to be clear she said they they had found nothing and nine months leading up to the point\nThat's right so they switch gears right maybe we can remove him through other means and and this conversation is so extraordinary ...\nSays that job at the FBI or twenty Fifth Amendment never envision the FBI being involved in it she got the FBI and the deputy attorney general\nOr allegedly our conversation he says it's a joke they say they're dead serious about it and they believe he was dead serious about it and no matter which way you're coming down it's just another example of how far down the road with the FBI was beyond its core mission which is to investigate crimes stop counter intelligence\nAnd and again this has nothing to do with rank and file agents that all this this is John group of rogue power hungry upper echelon management types and if anything they took the the cases away from the field officers purposely so that they can involved themselves in these nefarious activities that's why\nIt really does explain a great Jerry why every FBI guy I Know is so angry about this because they know was ripped out of their hands\nAnd this and all of them say that if this was them they know they get fired\nThat's right and in fact I interviewed former top officials at the FBI who are angry at people like James Comey Andrew McCabe James Baker Lisa Page\nPeters struck for ruining the reputation the good name of the FBI I wrote a column recently that said Rosenstein actions\nIn an attempt to ... the sitting president United States\nIs the equivalent of an attempted coup not a bloody violent coups what's known and John refer to it a moment ago as a soft coup ah using in misusing their power in the law to remove a sitting president and so here we now have not just James Baker\nWho was told this was serious but the people in the conversation with Rosenstein who are Andrew McCabe and Lisa Page you said he was\nDead serious recruit people to invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment and secretly record the president\nTo gather evidence in support of it uh Rosenstein whenever he gets caught engaging in wrongdoing claims oh I was misunderstood he threatened the intelligence committee staff members in January first denied it\nThen they admitted it but said oh\nI was misunderstood he threatened Devon newness\nAnd said oh I was misunderstood and now\nIn his attempted coup of the president of the evidence indicates he is saying oh I was misunderstood

that is now under criminal investigation all corroborating that Rod Rosenstein\nHimself was discussing wearing a wire to ... secretly recorded conversations with President Trump and the hope she'd say something that they could use and then both the twenty Fifth Amendment and remove him from power Andrew McCabe telling that in and confirming that along with Lisa Page\nAnd go into the office of the general counsel James Baker he's corroborating all of this and uh they're saying the Baker said it Baker and heard about it and the other two actually took notes about it at the time the other story that we're following is\nWe've pretty stunning revelation since it directly contradicts what the Justice Department\nAnd the FBI officials have set in sworn testimony but\nJames Baker also telling Congress last week member of the law firms Perkins Kuwait\nThat's where Hillary's campaign that's where the DNC funneled money so it would look like a legal expense when in fact there was anything but and then they hired fusion GPS and research firm that went out and got hired by the name of Christopher Steele and he used as Russian sources to put together\nA series of papers they become known as the ... the same ... that was never corroborated a verified but used as a buys a warrant application the bulk of information to get a buys a warrant to spy on a Trump campaign associates\nAnd it gets worse than that it was used even though this information was not corroborated it was disseminated on all levels of government to propagandize on line to the American people in the lead up to a campaign and then it was used when our understanding to bludgeon\nThen president Donald Trump and to try and get him removed from office and creating a phony Russia Trump narrative that never ever had

Now you have one of the top lawyers for the Democrats and the Clinton campaign was feeding information directly to the top lawyer at the FBI\nAll right so it appears the FBI and the Justice Department

saying here that is wrong\nGreg Garrett you've got a hundred percent correct there was never any Trump Russia collusion the FBI and the DEA OJ knew it there was Hillary Clinton Russian collusion two

Forbid I get cancer or the God Forbid I get in a bad accident right\nRight and you you don't have a car insurance for gasoline you don't have home owners insurance for long term care insurance just for the big things and we've tried to ensure everything top down and that's led to the last you know really a good ten years of\nInsurance premiums that have doubled or tripled more we need to do is ensure less which is how every other insurance product works the key to that is means doctors have to make more of the services they provide affordable\nAnd they can if they cut out the middleman and streamline than a simple\nAnd how big is your practice how many patients do you have in your facility and at the same day in Wichita\nIn Wichita we have five doctors in over thirty two hundred patients\nUnbelievable and your age you give concierge care at all I could pick up a phone and I'm getting a doctor at three in the morning that it's going to answer my call\nYou do you have and I could go down and see somebody at three AM in the morning\nIf you need stitches or emergency you know a lot of the three am phone calls or chest pain which we might send to the ER but a lot of times the kid who's sick and a mom who's worried and\nUm you of if you can avoid the ER you can avoid a thousand or two thousand dollar bill that's how you get health care health insurance is a card in your wallet healthcare is access to your doctor yeah\nAll right and then how many other practices around the country have you been able to to provide your model that they have duplicated how you you've been out and about and a champion of this for a long time\nYet we've helped over five hundred and fifty doctors convert to this model in the last few years but there's about a thousand total there in forty eight states every state except north and South Dakota right now but we have one about to launch in North Dakota [noise]\nUm and then it's even gotten a little bit international so um this is a a sound tried and true model\nNow and what do you do Dr gross in terms of your president of duck a doctor patient care foundation you know now that we have alternatives that are working real life experiences seems to me that we ought to be able to duplicate it a lot more than we are\nAbsolutely a so doctor patient care foundation was a physician run health policy because doctors never seemed to be at the paper whenever we're having a conversation about health care so we put traditions are back in ... with the will to have conversations\nPersonally I I also have a primary care practice much like that with some ... here in southwest Florida ... ... any health are pushing me was\nWire using insurance to pay for health are for basic primary care services all it does is create a ... tour where ... ... ... ... points with Dr Josh and we're seeing patients come from all over the state of ... and even from outside of the country\nWas ... medical tourism are and what we're finding is that you know not not the same thing about health insurance we're using it for all and you know when somebody is ...\nTwice the amount of money for a service because they just are helping shots wondering ensuring is using insurance drives up the cost of the product so ... says two hundred and twenty dollars\nWhile using her commercial insurance you know we go through all the hoops to give it authorized\nYour co pays five hundred dollars or so we we see this time of the gang the more people are are coming out of pocket to pay for health health or\nI'll let them go up to ... more insurance seems to be becoming an optical I'm an ... solution so I'm pleased to see the worst shifting the conversation from our coverage for everyone wants to talk about reducing the cost of health care\nThat real close enough I was about ... upon us some help committee on the ...\nWould it be a better idea that me and I'm watching for example they have this race out in California everybody's shock gather news and who is now offering free healthcare but everybody\nWhether your pay our taxpayer whether you're in the ... the state legally or illegally everybody's got to get free health care well I basically put a sign that says come to California but you get sick\nUm because people are going to go there now what's interesting to me is that a Republican is within striking distance and that gubernatorial race out in California because instinctively people no we can't afford to pay\nFor every illegal immigrant in the country but the reality is is that if I Lived in Wichita, Kansas I Would be a part of atlas empty and I would be your patient\nDr ... because I I think it's the best deal I liked the idea of being able to call my\nDoctor whenever I'm sick or if I have a kid that sick every parent wants the ability to do that and your parts are service provides it for fifty bucks a month now how much is the average in Wichita, Kansas catastrophic plan of it for the big things heart attack a accident or cancer how much we one of those plans cost\nAbout five hundred dollars to family five hundred dollars for a year or a month\nA month so and the current rates closer to you know a thousand twelve hundred a across the nation people are paying more for health insurance each month and they're paying for their mortgage\nIf the Trump tax cuts only put a hundred dollars per household per month in and they're being credited with the economic boom of your four point two percent GDP\nIf we fix health insurance we could put five hundred dollars back in the pocket of every household or the real ... and the the politician there has in California is to send him an originality\nDestroying more money at the problem has never fixed it the what we're doing is Dr Lee and ourselves and and a thousand other physicians is is innovating and saying how do we get much cheaper how do we make it so patients don't have co pays how do we provide stitches for no cost because they're so affordable\nI'm actually looking at ways it fundamentally fixing the system that's what we need not just promises of more spending\nAnd if I could add add to that just a a ... you know as far as the cost of care is the biggest one of the people ask us as well how can I just get major medical you know we we can afford what what services the ... primary care practice providing but we just need something catastrophic\nWell Obama Care made that illegal or something ... just brought offshore explode with access these major medical plan called ... short term medical plans and some would argue that these are actually true insurance they don't cover anything except the major medical expenses Seventy five dollars a month a\nLot but what it is this can be implemented easily\nCity by city town by town we can duplicate the model it already does take care of individuals with preexisting conditions if somebody wants to sign up for outlets MD and they have a preexisting condition or Dr ... denied them service\nThat everybody's welcome everybody's price the same just based on age um we know we're going to work harder for some patients but well so now we're going to not have to work as hard for other patients and we don't want to be judged by their illness\nHow did you get to who directly negotiate these prices with these pharmaceutical companies\nBoy I Wish I could say was because we're so darn good at it um the the truth is it's so much more simple than that\nAt a doctor's in forty four states are allowed to work directly with pharmaceutical wholesalers so just like you can go to Costco and get something for much cheaper because you pay a membership we do the same thing and we're able to\nGet the you know the actual cost of medicine might be a ten dollars for a thousand pills and because we don't have\nA staff of seven people er physician fighting insurance we can lower the cost and pass the savings on directly to the patient ... this is a win for everybody we we don't take care of of Republicans or Democrats we take care of people\nSo how does somebody had a group of doctors in New York say implement those cars are going to look at this and say fifty bucks a month I Can't make ten cents off of that\nBut they're going to have to move to New York because they don't make it easy but they could work with a pharmacist in New York state's one of the a few states that make it very difficult but then a pharmacist could say um if you do a five dollar a month membership with them then you get the medicine that cost that would be an amazing model it it would cut down there\nRight let's take New York out of the equation for California out of the ... let's say any other state Louisiana Florida hum I don't know Missouri yeah how do they do it\nIt's as simple as signing up effect shopping on Amazon there's there's almost nothing to it um\nYou know we have one supplier that makes it very easy overnight shipping and that's just it if I Want to buy a bottle of a hundred pills of blood pressure medicine I can if I Want to buy a thousand pills I can and it's about the same price um but it's fundamentally cheaper than what\nAbout Lindsey Graham is
