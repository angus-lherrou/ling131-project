{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KNST", "content": "Wow this is in ... you had already been teaching about this work\nYes yeah so um I was familiar with it but most out of body experience suggests to be clear or or spontaneous and people have there are certain prayed alludes to them vibrations a sleep paralysis by the way\nIs a prelude if it's if you react properly is a wonderful prelude to an out of body experience if you stay calm and react uh I I always I often say and people think it's strange but I Love sleep paralysis\nWell that's an indication that I'm ready to leave my body\nWell it keeps you have that then you know walking off your balcony or yeah I think it's important people\nDon't know how to use it um to initiate a profound experience\nOr as cars science has been part of that\nSo many people have common phenomena and they don't know what's happening millions and millions of people have they wake up in the middle of the night and they are non mall over or their vibrating or they're assuring strange sounds you know these all can be\nA prelude to an out of body experience if you're if you learn how to respond to these what I call them in or signals\nOf there's a shift that's occurring within you that's preparing you for this shift of consciousness that we call an out of body experience\nNow it's important to become aware of this\nThat we do this naturally anyway I mean do you now sees when you are when people aren't going to be travels the experiences you mapped the brain or do you make any type of um recording of their travel\nWe have at the Monroe Institute we have in isolation both that has been used to map brainwaves during many different altered states\nThere was a copper lines or isolation chamber huh uh at the Monroe Institute that's used for um research\nA matter of fact there was one in each a we have two centers and uh\nThere's there's quite a bit of research being done on different types of ... states have consciousness let's put it that way for instance we have a class called discovery or twenty people are all hooked up to a mind mirror and every person they go through a series of technique\nIt's a and they're they're but they're mad their brain waves are mapped during every exercise and in fact I speak it one night at on the class and I talk about how to initiate obese but they\nThey cover a lot of territory they also how to go deeper and meditation very quickly how to remote view more effectively for instance there's a lot of different let's just say I'm skills that are talked for interested in different kinds of approaches\nLet's talk about some of the findings Cindy's what is a mind mirror twenty people hooked up to the minds near\nThe online mirrors just a device that um will it's that's the trade name of the device\nI'm In uh in our class we will have\nA four people can be monitored by each Martin mirror and it's a it's a brain wave which it literally will monitor 'em your multiple different venues or the brain while you're going through an entire forty five minute program\nSo you can track it and then we can print out it resolved and again that you can tell what is what are you most responding to\nThat that\nThat's one of the beauties of the Monroe Institute is that there is research done in these areas but for me the main my main goal is to teach people\nHow to have the experience themselves and not only have it but control it and get the most of it my main goal is to teach people how to have a profound\nA spiritual experience ideally throughout a body exploration it's not just about walking and walking through a wall and\nTalking to someone and it's a lot more profound than that you have the we have the ability to have the literally connect with our higher self with are multi dimensional self right and have the kind of experiences that\nThat a Buddhist speaks of and the ancient Hindus and missed except talked about throughout the ages\nThat we're no we're there we have the ability ourselves because we are all of us are multi dimensional being it's just a matter of of beginning to open up to our own potential\nI found some great information on

on in your life a problem or an illness\nYou can connect to your own answers can you connect with people that their loved ones that um can you help them with the answer\nWell you can definitely contact loved ones uh it depends on whether each individual was open to whatever information you want to share but we have the ability to contact our loved ones face to face\nYeah amazing experience

against is William bowl and and he's talking about Bernard Bonnie travel\nAnd he's been doing twenty five years of research and they really made a ... pounds and who have gone through the ... ... e training and then really the genius and\nHe's come up with a common let me put it in nominal associated with the the remember thinking as he picks clean and then this for audience\nYes I'm just to clarify I've been at the Monroe Institute for the last eight years so um but I've been studying this and practicing for forty or just\nTo go on my website astro info dot org I included um over a period of ten years I did a\nA number of surveys and I've received sixteen thousand responses from people that had out of body experiences and this is from forty two different countries by the way and it's it was amazing how similar\nKinds of experiences that people were having were so similar it didn't matter what the culture was for instance I'm a floating or um vibrations high energy sensations\nEighty five percent of people experience buzzing humming are roaring sounds as a as a prelude normally\nTo the experience because normally when you're in your experience things become very generally speaking are quiet but there's a lot of phenomena associated with the onset uh Seventy two percent at some point experienced some kind of partial or fall asleep paralysis\nI'm being lifted are touched that was quite common thirty three percent hearing voices are footsteps thirty seven percent this is one that's very common probably to almost anyone\nAnd that is seen through closed islets if you're seen through your closed ... at night and you can begin to see you are already in the process of shifting your consciousness to your non physical body\nBecause you have and it doesn't mean you've actually did your body but it'd be injured in the process\nBut most people don't know this because they haven't been trained\nIn the in the prelude and the phenomena associated these are common things at a for instance probably the most common it's just a jerk awake you feel like you're just a you're taking a nap and suddenly you just jerk back into your body\nRight is I find that many people feel that that's an indication you're you're at a phase with your body as your fell asleep\nSo that that I see the ... on because then half each I'm retired I Will switch and I think his muscles and ... are you saying that he said\nNo I'm I'm saying it's not that I'm saying it's a prelude to one potentially ... this is what I have found and what many other um experiences I've seen and explored\nEvery one when they sleep we all humans are moving out of phase from our body sets with sleep is\nMhm we take for granted no one you know there is no we we know about REM periods and we know about this from a scientific standpoint but what happens for that one third of our life\nWe're actually moving out of phase with her body and when you leave your body you can observe other people it's like a double image people literally are floated I'm not saying they're floating on the ceiling they're just like two inches out of the phase with her body\nAt night as a slate and you can observe this actually during an out of body experience isn't ... image you're looking at\nIt's amazing the same applies to animals by the way animals also do the exact same thing\nOh yeah when you want you to animals sleep they aren't switching and having all sorts of experiences\nWhere they're moving their legs and the dream candidate they may be running in their non physical body I mean my point is that out of body experiences or as natural as breathing\nAnd think about this for a moment and and that is just that everyone is non physical we're non physical ... temporarily for a very brief period of time eighty years or Ninety years\nWe didn't have any biological ... machine and then we're ... we're all moving beyond the body\nSo it isn't it I find it just\nIt's one of the ways to discover what's really going on what this multi dimensional game of chess wordplay and most people only aware that they think there's two levels of the game life and death\nActually it's a it's a vast multi dimensional game but very few people are aware of it\nAnd you begin to awake into this one you have an out of body or near death experience\nWell if you wanted to ask a question like how did the pyramid game here\nWould you go into an OB and ask that question and have you ever tried this and I'm curious how did you mean ... ...\n... that's a good question it's all in the perception of the experience are okay\nAnd you can have multiple experiences for instance I had I Begin to have spontaneous experiences when I started this goes back in the seventies\nAnd I was still learning what was going and I'm Still learning by the way you know one's a master we're constantly learning and I started to have experiences of myself as a German tank commander in these experience I Would find myself literally riding a German tank\nI mean and it was so real it was just like the physical world and I didn't even know what was going on I didn't believe in a past lives that wasn't on my radar\nBut then I had these repeated experiences and that's the way a lot of people end up getting verification and I had multiple multiple experiences where I found myself as a German soldier in World War two\nAnd I also found out that my let's just say one of my sons was with me at the time\nAnd um my point is that when often will get information given to us or we open to these experiences and we get a download and it's more than just the download of information it's presented to us in exponential were there were present\nAnd when you have this happen a dozen times it begins to get you get your own verification\nOr what's going on ... and I think\nThis is very important because no one's telling you for instance I didn't believe in past lives into I started to have my own\nThat's I mean I'm just using this is one example\nRight that does make sense it's it's just not needing to be validated or parents might not be any anyone other than you are\nRight and it's very important that sets self verification is essential I find because that's the only way will ever break free from the indoctrination of belief systems that dominate our society and culture\nAt very important yes\nBecause all of us have been from birth we've all been indoctrinated along certain religious and let's just say educational lines and [noise] you know I always ask somebody\nThat's an avid believer and anything left backed up special your religion you know what would you believe what faith would you believe that you would have been born in India ah\nEh we're all been programmed and this gives us an opportunity to break free from that program into truly see what's real and look beyond the programming that we all share a cause and that's an important aspect of this\nBig and it's an individual journey nobody can tell you what you are and where you're going nobody can you have to experience it and then you suddenly oh my God now I got it\nAnd it's it's a transformational powerful experience and it's very self empowering\nMm need in you know back to the report that you had you talked about the common maybe put it in ... and also\nThe average age of just first out of body experience for ... years old and he put recruit recount they change it and it's often heated experience it happens over and over again but he declined during early teenage years why do you think that is so they sent you forget that\nI I think the children are just more open to naturally experience their multi dimensional self and once you hit ... based on all my research once you hit puberty everything just starts to shut down I think it as an interest just affects us something to do with it\nYou are free of all of that indoctrination and that's and that is incredibly powerful\nYes and I think more of us need to understand that and get out of the the ... that we tend to get in with his Eric all news that we\nAre it's ridiculous and you realize it's you know there's so much of a court and stuff that we need to know about ourselves the greatest problem with humanity is a lack of knowledge of self ... that's the core issue\nInvolved in all the ills that face humanity it's lack of knowledge himself if every one seven billion of it suddenly awoke one day and knew what we were\nAnd where we come from and where we're going there'd be no conflict there'd be no wars are being ... none of that would occur mhm because we would know better\nIf we really truly knew we were all connected but there are just some beans on this planet we don't want to be connected with that theory doesn't work can we really truly all be connected to only the ones that would be connected to [laughter]\nWe go beyond the ego\nYeah we we are we going to take another quick break and when we come back we're going to

V. I. T. [noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\nWell ... ... am Ryan Lee cigar\nAnd my guest William Bowman is joining me his website again is ... ... dot org now uh we have great college ... college sure and let's go to Jamie in Washington state first time caller here in Khost Jeannie when does your question\nHuh how's it going to reach what is your question my friends\nI'm curious as there's any a relative in between the out of body experiences and a memory loss\nQuestioned question you mean not remembering the experience or memory in Austin general\n... a coalition a little bit of both the uh either long term memory and of the uh out of body experience itself\nBut right there at the end it was like a a breath of fresh air came on me and\nI wasn't worried about anything any more\n... sounds peaceful peaceful and is is what it\nWas exactly peaceful\nHave you been able to recreate than experience or not and heart attack but feeling that experience a peace\nNow I Wish I could ... it would actually be a great\nWell maybe that's maybe you can blame could he\nYeah absolutely and one of the things that people do report\nWhen they have and out of body experience um\nIs that they have this immense feeling of a love and peace it fly that just flows through them mhm uh I've talked about this many times um it's like you're entering into a some people report it like their entry into a sea of of love\nAnd I'm an acceptance and it's and it's like it's difficult to even ... there was no words to even describe some of these things\nBecause they're beyond our um our verbiage but yes I mean that's one of the reasons that people do have a explore these experiences so they can ah let's just say connect with those higher aspects of themselves\n... now and thank you very much so I appreciate it I mean has there ever been reporting of that and not a good experience similar to be is that you can't it's not right\nYou know like there has been an end to ease and nightmares in ...\nIn your fear based if you've been brought up with this concept that there's a devil or Satan around every corner waiting for you to pounce on you you're going to have light you made likely have negative experience your own fear will create it\nWhen we leave our bodies were entering into a very thought responsive dimensional space and that's what people forget it and I I I say this all the time you know we're not observers\nOf non physical reality we're participants\nEach thought is a creative projection and we are influencing the energies around us we do it in the physical but slowed down here but when you leave your body through near death experiences\nSame applies to um if you're doing ... San Pedro or the empty or it doesn't matter how you and do the experience if you're a fear based and you take your fears are mindset is going with us into our experiences\nThat's why it's so important to begin to each to take a close look at yourself and your beliefs and to see how and try to perjure yourself as much as possible of these fear based a belief systems that have no reality to them\nBut if you believe in some kind of negative vanity if if there is not like there's negative entered its you are going to create it\nWhen your mind is going to mold of reality around you if you believe in love and light you're going to manifest love and light if you believe in darkness and a negative beings and whatever then you're going to manifest that is well\nWell you are creative powerful beings and when you leave your body no matter how it's done you're entering into a incredibly thought response of environment and you have to take responsibility for your experience some people don't like to hear this but it's it's the truth\nWell I had we had one once where I went it was a dream I guess I remember but he could very well in and out of body experience where I\nWas shocked by somebody that he'd written up it was like a future scene and they were on a motorcycle and they got us in the recycling helmet look directly at me didn't recognize this person don't know anyone that I'm\nBrian ... owns a motorcycle\nAnd it was and he woke me up because it was as if\nThat person was really looking at me and I don't know who lives and it wasn't a protection of anything and it was the name was no there isn't a premonition of anything that happened it just isn't it was as if I had gone into a future dimension\nLooks pretty bleak the honest and then this person looked at me saying why are you who how did you cross into this dimension and then I woke up because\nWe can't each other yeah I don't know if that's an adult well out of body travel most likely mhm\nOr could have been but it wasn't a projection of my psyche at all\nNo object there is consensus what I call consensus realities and there is no consensus reality there's that's that's why it's important to learn about the consensus realities are created by a collective group of individuals that all agree on a reality\nAnd they create that's why I called consensus\nThere's many types of reality that exist and in our multi dimensional universe and that's why it's important for us to start to learn new what is essentially the rules of nonsensical reality and how they function because it's not the same as it is here\nWe're used to linear time writing the gravity we're used to air yeah when you leave your body you don't have a biological body you're not breathing air you know you don't have gravity\nAll the things we're used to have to you have to learn how to function in a new kind of energy\nThat's and that's of course one of the things I teach and I'm\nIn my work shops but it's also in my book but it's important for everybody to start learning the nature of our continuing existence\nYes that will be prepared for this transition of consciousness\nI understand I understand they well thank you so much Williams has been great if you go to his website which is ... info dot org you'll find out about all of his books and his courses in classes and there's lots of free information there as

welcome to the blue moon hunted history chores we've been probably scaring the public's since two thousand two Stephanie waters is my guest welcome Stephanie\nLisa I'm Glad to be here and I love that proceeding commercial about paying because\nGold tonight is to have everyone Peter Pan [laughter] I'm going to scare the pie at it that it's lovely record\nI was thinking about that commercial say can you really say pee on an original is is that there's a sharing anyway I'll go to the show [laughter] funny\nYeah thank you very much and um thank you very much for being for letting me be on tonight and I've been a long time listener so this is a dream come true\nCause so will you send me your book and we do are you constantly in Colorado during our guys shows and I thought it would be so fascinating 'cause there are so many different pieces of history little pockets of history and it's very unassuming you can\nFind things like that in Colorado and everywhere but where did you what was your first experience with her normal\nWell I've been seeing go since I was me an e high to a grasshopper is what I always say [noise]\nUm and about and my parents never believe me so it was quite frightening\nAnd so this really has become part of my mission in life is to try to spread some better understanding and after I got cancer I'm about ten years ago it was my wake up call and I looked at my bucket list and believe it or not\nMy goal was to try and unite the paranormal can even immunity and also there's some outreach to help children better understand\nAnd and so I actually started the paranormal convention and I partnered with my friend or a spin\nAnd she said professional psychic and she runs a nonprofit called the kindred spirit out of Longmont, Colorado mhm and so the\nTwo of us uh with the brainstorming and then getting a lot of support from the other people in the community changed the name to spirits of the Rockies paranormal convention and we we call it a little faith because every year\nWe tried to bomb threat in a different\nCommunity and by doing that we outreach to the historian because we call ourselves hunted historians because what we do is actual real history\nSo even if you don't believe in ghosts or things that go on and the night supposedly this stuff really happened\nAnd I got particularly interested in this after I found out about a journalist\nIt's named Charles for it and I'm sure all your listeners know about him that he was pretty popular about a hundred years ago and what he did was he went into old newspaper archives and old mysteries and he revisited them\nTo see if it was possible that these things really happened and so that's\nWhat I decided to do and interesting enough this is actually my fifth book and I want to shout out to shift for publishing LCD they actually publish my last book goes legends and lord of the Rockies\nAnd it is available through shut the ship for publishing\nOkay well let's just back up for a second here so you let's talk about your Journey Through sure going to diverge cancer and so you know you reconnected your life which goes what were you doing before then\nWell before is that [noise]\nI like I said I've always been in to the paranormal because I've been seeing it you know since I was little child\nSo what do you mean seeing it you you know I see it and I actually feel it\nI just really like humans to examples that\nWell I can I Know this is going to sound really funny but I can actually sense things I'm I'm an impasse I think a lot of your listeners probably are familiar with that kind of a term\nBut I'm very ... I'm just highly sensitive now if somebody came up to me and said hey is the Broncos going to win the football team I Can't\nProtect that into the future but what I can do is I see pictures for example today I was at the flea market with a friend and they lost their backpack and I saw the picture in my head of where it was that I just close my eyes and I saw where it was that and we went back in there it was so\nI'm able to do things like that um\nBut I let's see I think okay so I was a professional story tell her from the time I was about twenty all through college I used to do singing telegrams all of this kind of thing and so I've worked in the entertainment business for quite a while and about Twenty years ago is when I bought a bed and breakfast in managing Springs Colorado and he was taunted\nAnd so I said well I might as well start doing haunted history tourists and I open my big huge mansion to the public and I had haunted wine and cheese parties\nDid you know before you bought it it was haunted\nYeah I knew was haunted but I was kind of like this you know my kids were oh starting in junior high at the time and I was like oh this will be fun and kids get this we are oh you're going to love this story this is way true I mean it sounds like it's made up but I'm telling you that all that I'm telling you tonight is a hundred percent true\nWe were living in Southern California is a time and my husband was working for cancer research company and he got uh laid off when the company changed hands\nSo my entire family a move to Colorado and bought\nAn old haunted mansions sight unseen I Swear\nThat because they wanted to buy a hundred mentioned well are they wanted to buy a mansion\nWell what happened is I actually come out I'm actually from Colorado and I'd come out on vacation and I was staying in the bed and breakfast and I got to know the owners pretty well and I told them my story about how my husband was in this cancer research company and he was the CFO and everything\nAnd at the same time the owner's life who actually wasn't living there she was that in California because she I mean ... Texas 'cause she had cancer and she was dying so she was really interested in the research and I tried to give her as much information as I could you know her husband\nAnd mind you and she died and so during this time it was really interesting because I actually got an email\nUm and it was back in Nineteen Ninety nine you know so I I think it was like I feel bad a questionnaire and the room and that's how he got my email address\nAnd he said to me you know I I Know your husband was involved in this and everything but we actually have this\nA bed and breakfast up for sale and uh if you that you know I Know you said your husband just got laid off of work I don't know if you were thinking about coming back to Colorado but we could talk about\nFinancing the home for you and that was interesting because my husband didn't have a job I mean everything just smell into place like we were meant to have this house and by the way I actually knew of the house because I grew up here and he was always really fond of this big beautiful old\nA craftsman style mansion done in the arts and crafts file I just loved it\nAnd um when we bought it it was really rundown\n[laughter] ... extremely\nRun down and so one of the first order of business was to actually fix up the house now this was a problem because the owners said to us that they would finance us no problem we didn't even have to put any money down\nBut I was not allowed to sell anything in the house until the house was paid for and we signed a balloon I'm a balloon like loans and said that we would pass the house in five years after five years we can do whatever we wanted with the furniture or the house\n... what have you well\nAfter us and you know no no hard feelings to the former owners or anything but I really did not like the way this house was decorated and an artist you know and it's\nVery severe that I'm In a soothing you can see where this was going roe [laughter]\nSo I actually called the owner's son and he was managing the bed and breakfast at the time and I said hey do you think they would mind if I you know just sold a few things and he goes you know what steps do what you want he goes\nMy mother is old and she is going to die soon you know this is before she died and he goes don't worry about it you know I'm just do what you want there never coming back to Colorado again because you know it's too high of an altitude song about that just do what you want\nAnd I said All right thank you very much so I put an ad in the paper and I had the biggest estate so I don't think anybody's ever seen anything\nLike that while I hired\nTwenty people um to help me out and we all had T shirts that said on all that just state so Nineteen Ninety nine and it was ethic\nMy goodness you know things fall out literally\nEverything in the house lock stock and barrel you can see where this is going right [laughter] I Can't wait\nTill the ghost of Shirley actually sue was not happy with me I'm not long after that my nephew was living with me and he was only six years old at the time and he actually had his own bedroom at the on a ledge estate and he started talking about a ghost

tell us a little bit more about\nYou what we were talking about men or two springs and how it has this incredible magnetic anomaly there we're ... miles in Colorado and why specifically Colorado did it just called you\nUm\nI think another reason why I'm that people were drawn to manage it springs or spiritual reasons is because originally this was a sanctuary\nTo five warring Native American tribes and when they came here they had to pack between them that they would not\nFight when they were here this was their holy sanctuary so they would wipe out their war paint and put down their weapons and and there was peace here forever until the Victorians came along and the legend is that we started building you know the hotels and\nSilver seven I went up there to the theater and that those just gone it worked\nShe'll be manager confirmed that\nThey know that all of this worked up beautifully [laughter]\nThan eating now had she seen the operation of this not\nSince the book has come out it was amazing during the time before the book\nYes oh yes she knew it was on it but she hit like I said her job was at stake oh by the way it was interesting I forgot that is an important part of the story why out of the blue you know on August\nEighth two thousand six team because the theater had just been sold to the city at one point it was actually slated for the wrecking ball oh that's good was reaching out that's really trying to find someone to help her tell her story\nI'm sure this isn't the first time that's happened to you\nI'm a ... well the first time I got a call from

day believe it or not you know everyone thinks that it's midnight or you know they're ... we do have the votes that come out of the night you know but um or at three thirty in the morning but I find the best time\nTo actually look for growth if he wants to see them with your eye is at dusk in between when the sun is just setting it's in between day and night ... that is the best time\nIs a transition time why it's\nThe if the lighting if you think about this there are so many colors that we can't see and when the lighting is just right see I'm also an artist and oil painter it lends itself\nTo the shadows does that make sense\nYes it does it make strapped when you see the shadow people and the light changes very fast rate and it\nOnly I call it the God like it only lasts about ten minutes and then the Rockies we have it it's beautiful because of the way that it bounces off the rocks and the lead into the mountains like I live in a canyon and it really lends itself to being able to see the shadows that just the right direction\nNow is the place that you living in now hunted or did you met with non on ... and the gas or the goes follow you\nWrite that they do on line two words it's very funny the up and doing them now for Seventeen years I started when I was in kindergarten [laughter]\nJust kidding [laughter]\nBut um that being said I've been doing it for so long that I just naturally thought that the this is going to crack you up but I thought that the street lights and managers who were on a timer because whenever I Would walk in her name's ... lights they would go out when I Would be talking about certain goes you know the certain locations\nAnd then one day my friend says why would they go out when you're standing underneath them if they were on some kind of a trip or to save on electricity or whatever they would on when you walk underneath them and I said [laughter]\nYeah that's true [laughter] so they really do communicate with us on the tour I Will talk to them in the street lights will flash this this town is very haunted by\nA well it's true for a lot of areas I mean even bolder window I Walk around there and then went there once a month doing

we're talking about Colorado legends in lower and when we were talking a little bit before the break about pikes peak now there's many places in the world that have lots of legends and lower but this particular one pikes peak has\nA lot it's considered one of the\nMore spiritual places in the world as well as um because of its kind of rich waters and mineral rich area in that particular region of the u._s. can you tell us a little bit about your experience as many ... you know about the beach\n[noise] well um pikes peak I think it was called T. T. V. A. T. that are have a I think that's what the native youth used to call it but they literally believe that the mountain was the belly button of the universe\nI just love that I loved belly buttons anyway but especially the belly button of the universe that's pretty important\nWhy why you would call that connect it to the mother okay yeah it's connected to the\nMother and think about the native is the way that they must of looking at it as being closest to heaven as they can get a father sky Mother Earth ... and so the significance and even even if you look at the mountain\nIt definitely stand out from the rest of the whole front range it stands out like a sore thumb\nThat and the natives knew that it that of the significance and we also know that cripple creek is right there on the side of pikes peak and cripple creek as I understand it um during the pikes peak gold fresh\nUh produced more goals than any place in the whole world I Hope I have that right than here I Do [laughter]\nWell it makes sense because there's a lot of other minerals there as well yeah\nAnd if you ... I Love the show ancient aliens and they talk about that that\nHave a lot of UFO sightings over pikes peak\nAnd I'm a lot of those stories of posts and of course in this region but on ancient aliens they talk about how perhaps the I'm ancient aliens were attracted to this region because of the rich mineral deposits underneath\nThe mountains here in the Rockies and I find that that is a very good explanation because when I was doing my research especially about UFOs I found that most of the sightings happened over the all metal mining camp\nEspecially cripple creek you know there's a story that happened this would have been Twenty years before the Wright brothers to fly over ... over Kitty Hawk hearing cripple creek Colorado they were over five hundred people that saw us so\nWhen they were coming out of church on Sunday about noon it was clear daylight\nAnd it was a flight of about seven or eight of them of ships\nAnd they were hovering just about oh a hundred hundred yards at the time it was so close that they could see the windows I mean that that is amazing and they were hollering they weren't flying so the explanation of weather balloons was totally\nBefore there was like yeah it just it just I I find that fascinating because today if somebody says oh I saw a UFO you can always brushed it off as being an airplane but before\nWe had or a governor ... experiment gone exactly exactly or even weather balloons wouldn't have behave the way that the ... mhm theoretically\nWhite plastic sack played up and down sideways hovering you know like a helicopter mhm\nA fascinating and they didn't know what to look they there was no explanation now so what I did was I followed it I followed the sightings throughout the Rockies at the very same time it was fascinating to me this was like an Eighteen fifty nine you would not that it's a lot of\nPeople well yeah but a lot of people thought this I mean just outrageously crazy and he followed his story in\nKansas and then came over to Colorado yeah it was amazing and the story was consistent\nVery much so the way that that that's a very good question right there because that's\nThere was no way that the farmers in Kansas you know back then before we had the world Wide Web could possibly know when farmers in Colorado where thing that I mean this was amazing back then you know um what we you know that we've had the telegraph\nOf them do you think pikes peak because of its mineral rich content and waters that are that contain a lot of minerals there it's a conduit for a a UFO or extraterrestrial activity yeah\nAbsolutely um I have had the great pleasure of meeting some wonderful people over the years as the director of the paranormal convention\nAnd one of my friends is named Dan Mathias and he lives in the mountain falls Colorado and um which is right underneath pikes peak and um he saw a big foot at come to the back door opened his door actually um [noise]\nHe um the big foot actually rubbed at the high neon his screen door and he actually had some big hair\n[laughter] and um then has really committed\nHis entire life to the belief in Bigfoot and he believes that his property is on part of a portal and he does\nWe will do [noise] and [noise] ...\n[noise] oh [noise]\nWe would go [noise] um [noise] Christ\nYou see somebody down you know the chicken up and you have them get up\nAlso like yeah I'm In a spot right now\n... has been homeless for two years yeah I'm doing some but let them come\nPerson I don't know what I have\nI'm Leon rhyme joined me and send the kids in the fight to get our kids off and that's how you can help benefits of\nHealing comfort and so many smiled integrated touch for kids brings in all three families of children with special medical needs hospital treatments can be scary\nFor a child being integrated ... showed that the different ways they're healing therapies in community programs reach over thirty five hundred people annually providing relief and minimizing suffering free of charge\nMore about how you can help and integrate them touch dot O.

E. where did you go\nWhat did you experience how did you know that this was effective for you\nWell the my first one I've ever had hundreds and hundreds of experience\nSays over the decades but the first one I had um I was actually in a dorm room a going to college and I was doing what I call the target technique where you select three objects and you focus on them and as you fall asleep at night and the next after\nA series of days went by a one day I was sleeping on my side and I when I become aware I've realize I was vibrating differently\nIt's it's strange to really describe this but you feel a vibration of floating sensation and when I reached out my arm I realized my arm entered the wall\nAnd when I did you think we reached beyond that oh no I was not ...\nI didn't realize it was tell you the truth at the time but when I reached out what is at now I realize it at that moment I realized was my non physical arm\nIt went through the wall and then I saw them stand in the next thing I knew I was standing by the foot of the bed and it was a one hundred percent real and I began to move around the room and examine my surroundings\nThat was my first experience it was relatively brief\nBut it was quite a life changing\nDid you encounter any body being guide anyone there\nAre actually that I did and I write about this and my first book adventures beyond the body that I observed someone that was observing may\nUm but they didn't I didn't communicate with them but somebody was observing may which was ... at the moment was a little bit shocking I was a newbie I had no idea about that what I had first stepped into here\nAnd a ... over the decades and years of course I became more and more comfortable as I began to have more and more experiences\nIt's addicting isn't it\nYeah well it's it's it's exciting because you can finally obtained the answers for yourself ... ... that said I think\nIs the most important thing you don't have to depend upon um external sources and uh the indoctrinated society and culture that surround us you can you can find out the answers for yourself\nYou don't give me an example 'cause how do we know the answers are true\nWhen you experienced some in other words once you leave your body you know you you're more than your body you know that your brain is not the source of consciousness mhm as we've been trained to believe\nYou realize that you continue to exist and also you begin to realize that the universe is multi dimensional\nWhen I began to experience was or not only one non physical dimension but many of them and you realize that the physical world is just the in a sense the EPA term is a sin at the ... of the universe\nIs just one of them yes\nAnd but you can experience that first hand and that's what's important it's it's it's not conjecture or belief system\nMhm I always think you know is incredible and our our world is ... you know this incredible below that we're in\nA given topic couldn't it stops here I mean with all the intelligence that we have here and with all the tens information's in the human being why would the universe just create one type of human being it doesn't make any [laughter]\nAbsolutely not and once you have to mention that\nOnce you have these experiences you realize that the universe is multi dimensional mhm and that and that there is there's\nTrillions of all their life forms\nYeah and not all human and has to be it wouldn't just be one [laughter] you don't want him anything\nNo of course not and it's the universe is far more diverse and magnificent than than we can do that I can express\nMhm yeah it is an absolute in till now when you\nYou have these experiences and you know they're real because usually they feel real you know he was clean because usually not a language to really clearly defined what an idiot mention is universal understanding\nWell once you leave your body and you begin to you begin to communicate and meet other being's generally they're humanoid they're generally what we would consider to be people that have died a I write about communicating and meeting my mother and my uncle who who had passed\nAnd all communication is very elegant it's by solved and there's no need in other words language is no longer a barrier\nWe we communicate directly by thought ... and it's amazing it's so clear and concise compared to the physical languages that we use here that are symbols\nAnd it's uh it's amazing but that's one of the great benefits of this is that you have an opportunity\nExperience and explore\nYourself and discover the answers for yourself there was no\nUm when I teach my classes are there is no um belief systems attached to it each individual is given the skills given the tools needed let's say to go out and become an explorer themselves so they can\nDiscover what they feel is the truth for themselves which is very important\nNow you're listening you teach\nThem they really

... or spontaneous and people have there are certain prayed alludes to them vibrations\nA fleet paralysis by the way is a prelude if it's if you react properly is a wonderful prelude to an out of body experience if you stay calm\nAnd react uh I I always I often say and people think it's strange but I Love sleep paralysis\nWell that's an indication that I'm ready to leave my body\nWell it keeps you safe than you know walking off your balcony or yeah I think it's important people\nDon't know how to use it um to initiate a profound experience\nOr as cars science has been part of that\nSo many people have common phenomena and they don't know what's happening millions and millions of people have they wake up in the middle of the night and the norm all over or their vibrating or they're assuring strange sounds you know these all can be\nA prelude to an out of body experience if you're if you learn how to respond to these what I call them in our signals\nOf there's a shift that's occurring within you that's preparing you for this shift of consciousness that we call an out of body experience\nNow it's important to become aware of this\nThat we do this naturally anyway I mean do you map fees when you are when people are going to these travels the experiences you mapped the brain or do you make any type of um recording of their travel\nWe have at the Monroe Institute we have in isolation booth that has been used\nTo map brainwaves\nDuring many different altered states there was a copper lines or isolation chamber huh\nUh at the Monroe Institute that's used for um research\nA matter of fact there's one in each a we have two centers and uh\nThere was a there was quite a bit of research being done on different types of ... states have consciousness let's put it that way for instance we have a class called discovery were twenty people are all hooked up to a mind mirror and every person they go through a series of techniques\nAre and they're they're but they're mad their brain waves are mapped during every exercise\nAnd in fact I speak it one night it on this class and I talk about how to initiate obese\nBut they they cover a lot of territory they also how to go deeper and meditation very quickly how to remote view more effectively for instance there's a lot of different let's just say I'm skills that are taught for interested in different kinds of approaches\nLet's talk about some of the findings Cindy's what is a mind mirror twenty people hooked up to the minds near\nOh they're aligned mirrors just a device that um will it's that's the trade name of the device\nI'm In ... in our class we will have\nA four people can be monitored by each mind mirror and it's a it's a brain wave which it literally will monitor 'em your multiple different venues or the brain while you're going through an entire forty five minute program\nSo you can track it and then we can print out it resolved and again that you can tell what is what are you most responding to\nBut that's that's that's one of the beauties of the Monroe Institute is that there is research done in these areas but for me the main my main goal is to teach people\nHow they have the experience themselves and not only have it put control it and get the most of it my main goal is to teach people how to have a profound\nA spiritual experience ideally throughout a body exploration it's not just about walking and walking through a wall and\nA talking to someone and it's a lot more profound than that you have the we have the ability to have the literally connect with our higher self\nWith are multi dimensional self right\nAnd have the kind of experiences that that a Buddhist speaks of and the ancient Hindus and missed except talked about throughout the ages\nThat we're no we're there we have that ability ourselves because we are all of us are multi dimensional being it's just a matter of of beginning to open up to our own potential\nI found some great information on your website and let's say by the way it's ... ... ... dot org and there are ... resources on their uh\n[noise] I I I've found as civically ways that you can take yourself into and it

Bonnie travel and he's been doing twenty five years of research and they really are sixteen thousand participants who have gone through the ... e training and then really the genius\nAnd he's come up with a common let me put it to nominate on associated with the the ease Cleveland was wondering if you can explain this for audience\nYes I'm just to clarify I've been at the Monroe Institute for the last eight years so um but I've been studying\nThis and practicing for forty or just to go on my Web site astro info dot org I included um over a period of ten years I did a\nA number of surveys and I've received sixteen thousand responses from people that had out of body experiences and this is from forty two different countries by the way\nAnd it's it was amazing how similar kinds of experiences that people were having were so similar it didn't matter what the culture was for instance I'm\nA floating or um vibrations high energy sensations\nEighty five percent of people experience buzzing humming are roaring sounds\nAs a as a prelude normally to the experience because normally when you're in your experience things become very generally speaking are quiet but there's a lot of phenomena associated with the onset\nOf Seventy two percent at some point experienced some kind of partial or fall asleep paralysis\nI'm\nBeing lifted are touched that was quite common thirty three percent ... hearing voices are footsteps thirty seven percent this is one that's very common probably to almost anyone\nAnd that is seen through closed islets if you're seen through your closed ... at night and you can begin to see you are already in the process of shifting your consciousness to your non physical\nBody because you have and it\nDoesn't mean you've actually did your body but it'd be injured in the process\nBut most people don't know this because they haven't been trained in the in the prelude and the phenomena associated these are common things at a for instance probably the most common it's just a jerk awake you feel like you're just a you're taking a nap and suddenly you just jerk back into your body\nRight is I find that many people feel that that's an indication you're you're at a phase with your body is your fell asleep\nSo that that I see the ... on it because then happen if I'm a retired I Will switch and I think it's his muscles in or are you saying that an out of body said\nNo I'm saying it's not that I'm saying it's a prelude to one potentially ... this is what I have found and what many other um experiences have seen and explored\nEveryone when they sleep we all humans are moving at a face from our body sets with sleep is mhm we take it for granted no one you know there's no we we know about REM periods and\nWe know about this from a scientific standpoint but what happens for that one third of our life\nWe're actually moving out of phase with her body and when you leave your body you can observe other people\nIt's like a double image people literally are floated I'm not saying they're floating up the feeling they're just like two inches out of the phase with her body at night as a slate and you can observe this actually during an out of body experience\nSo what does it look like the image you're looking at it's amazing the same applies to animals by the way animals also do the exact same thing\nOh yeah when you watch the animals sleep they aren't switching and having all sorts of experiences\nWhere they're moving their legs and the dream the can or they may be running in their non physical body I mean my point is that out of body experiences or as natural was breathing\nAnd think about this for a moment and and that is just that everyone is non physical we're a non physical ... temporarily for a very brief period of time eighty years or Ninety years\nWe didn't have any biological ... machine ... and then we're ... we're all moving beyond the body\nSo it isn't it I find it just\nIt's one of the ways to discover what's really going on what this multi dimensional game of chess for play ... and most people only aware that they think there's two levels of the game life and death\nActually it's a it's a vast multi dimensional game but very few people are aware of it\nAnd you begin to awake into this one you have an out of body or near death experience\nWell if you wanted to ask the question like how did the pyramid game here would you go into an OB and ask that question and have you ever tried this and I'm curious how would you know the difference between an imagination\n... that's a good question it's all in the perception of the experience are okay and you can have multiple experiences\nFor instance I had I Begin to have spontaneous experiences when I started this goes back into the seventies\nAnd I was still learning what was going and I'm Still learning by the way you know one master we're constantly learning and I started to have experiences of myself as a German tank commander in these experience would find myself literally riding a German tank\nI mean and it was so real it was just like the physical world and I didn't even know what was going on I didn't believe in a pass wives that wasn't on my radar\nBut then I had these repeated experiences and that's the way a lot of people end up getting verification and I had multiple multiple experiences where I found myself as a German soldier in World War two and I also found out that my\nLet's just say one of my sons was with me at the time\nAnd um my point is that when often will get information given to us or we open to these experiences and we get a download and it's more than just the download of information it's presented to us in ... were there were present\nAnd when you have this happen a dozen times it begins to get you get your own verification\nOr what's going on ... and I think\nThis is very important because no one's\nTelling you for instance I didn't believe in past lives into I started to have my own\nThat's I mean I'm just using this is one example\nRight that does make sense it's it's just not needing to be validated or parents might not be any anyone other than you are\nRight and it's very important that sets self verification is\nEssential I fine because that's the only way will ever break free from the indoctrination of belief systems that dominate our society and culture\nAt very important\nYes because all of us have been from birth we've all been indoctrinated along certain religious and let's just say educational lines and [noise] you know I always ask somebody\nThat's an avid believer and anything left of special your religion you know what would you believe what faith would you believe that you would have been born in India\nAh eh we're had been programmed and this gives us an opportunity to break free from that program into truly see what's real and look beyond the programming that we all share a cause and that's an important aspect of this\nAnd it's an individual journey nobody can tell you what you are and where you're going nobody can you have to experience it and then you suddenly oh my God now I got it and it's it's a transformational powerful experience and it's very self empowering\n... it is now back to the report that you had you talked about the common maybe put it in ... now\nThe average age of the first ... ... ... years old people recruit recount painting and it's often heated experienced it happens over and over again but he declined during early teenage years why do you think that is really just forget that\nI I think the children are just more open to naturally experience their multi dimensional self and once you hit ... based on all my research once you hit puberty everything just starts to\nAnd what's so important is for us to have our own transformation or experiences I think that's critical to our evolution individual and collective way otherwise when you have your own profound experience\nYou you you can no longer be manipulated by these external forces around you because you know better you just look at it like it it's just the drama it's the game that's being played all around us and you look at it like that\nAnd you know it and that makes a difference you don't get sucked in for instance the political drama that that you don't get sucked into that stuff did you realize it's a temporary drama and and you understand there was a bigger game it's foot here you\nKnow the big game is to know your true self to have your own profound experience\nSo that you know the answers for yourself and you're no longer upon of anyone else any belief system government religion you are free of all of that indoctrination and that's that is incredibly powerful\nYes and I think more of us need to understand that and get out of the the ... that we tend to get in with his his error call news that\nWe do it or did your research and you realize it's\nYou know there's so much important stuff that we need to know about ourselves the greatest problem with humanity is a lack of knowledge of self ...\nThat's the core issue involved in all the ills that face humanity it's lack of knowledge of self

where does your question my friend\nI'm curious if there's any a relative in between the out of body experiences and a memory loss\nOr questioned question you\nMean not remembering\nThe experience or memory in Austin general\n... of coalition a little bit of\nBoth uh either long term memory and of the uh out of body experience itself\nBut not\nBut right there at the end it was like a a breath of fresh air came on me and\nI wasn't worried about anything any more\n... pounds he's so he's and he's is what it was exactly peaceful\nHave you been able to recreate than experience on now in heart attacks that feeling that experience and peace\nNo I Wish I could hit and would actually be great\nWell maybe that's maybe you can blame the heat\nYeah absolutely and one of the things that people do report when they have and out of body experience um\nIs that they have this immense feeling of a love and peace and fly that just flew through them mhm uh I've talked about this many times um it's like you're entering into a some people report it\nLike their entry into a sea of of love\nAnd I'm an acceptance and it's and it's like it's difficult to even the there is no words to even describe some of these things\nBecause they're beyond our um our verbiage but yes I mean that's one of the reasons that people do a explore these experiences so they can ah let's just say connect with these higher aspects of themselves\n... now and thank you very much ... ... ... I mean has there ever been reporting of that\nAnd not a good experience I mean nobody is that you can't not right\nYou know like there has been an end to ease and nightmares\nYour fear based if you've been brought up with this concept that there's a devil or Satan around every corner waiting for you to pounce on you\nYou're going to have light you made likely have negative experience your own fear will create it when we leave our bodies were entering into a very thought responsive dimensional space and that's what people forget and I I I say this all the time you know we're not observers\nOf non physical reality we're participants each thought is a creative projection and we are influencing the energies around us we do it in the physical it's slowed down there\nBut when you leave your body through near death experiences\nSame applies to um if you're doing ... San Pedro or the empty or it doesn't matter how you and do the experience if you're a fear based and you take your fears are mindset is going with us into our experiences\nThat's why it's so important to begin to each to take a close look at yourself and your beliefs and to see how and tried to perjure yourself as much as possible of these fear based a belief systems that have no reality to them\nBut if you believe in some kind of negative energy if if there is not like there's negative entered its you are going to create it when your mind is going to mold of reality around you\nIf you believe in love and light you're going to manifest love and light if you believe in darkness in a negative beings and whatever\nThen you're going to manifest that is well well you are creative powerful beings and when you leave your body no matter how it's done you're entering into a incredibly thought response of environment\nAnd you have to take responsibility for your experience some people don't like to hear this but it's it's a truce\nWell I had weird one once where I went it was a specific dream I guess I remember but it could very well in and out of body experience where I\nWas shocked by somebody that he had written up it was like a future scene and they were on a motorcycle and they got off the motorcycle and took off your helmet look directly at me didn't recognize this person don't know anyone that um\nRides or owns a motorcycle\nAnd it was as it woke me up because it was as if\nThat person was really looking at me and I don't know who was and it wasn't a projection of anything and it was benign was no there wasn't a a premonition of anything that happened it just was in it was as if I had gone into a future dimension\nWhich looks pretty bleak to be honest and then this person looked at me saying why are you who how did you cross into this dimension and then I woke up because\nI was scared to each other you know I'd I don't know of that ad out at well out of body travel most likely mhm\nOr could have been but it wasn't a projection of my psyche at all\nNo there was a ... there was consensus what are called consensus realities and there's no consensus reality there's that's that's why it's important to learn about it and sensors realities are created by a collective group of individuals that all agree on a reality\nAnd they create a toy called consensus\nThere was many types of reality that exist and you know multi dimensional universe and the choice important for us to look at them learn new orders or century the rules of non physical reality and how they function because it's not the same as it is here\nWe're used to live in a car ride the gravity or your sister they're you know when you're in your body you don't have a biological body you're not breathing air you don't you don't have gravity\nAll the things we're used to just do you have to learn how to function in a new kind of energy\nThat's and that's of course one of ... or ...

I'm just highly sensitive now if somebody came up to me and said hey is the Broncos going to win the football team I Can't\nProtect that into the future but what I can do is I see pictures for example today I was at the flea market with a friend and they lost their backpack and I saw the picture in my head of where it was at I just close my eyes and I saw where it was at and we went back in there it was\nSo I'm able to do things like that um\nBut I let's see I think okay so I was a professional story tell her from the time I was about twenty all through college I used to do singing telegrams all of this kind of thing and so I've worked in the entertainment business for quite a while and about Twenty years ago is when I bought a bed and breakfast and managed to Springs Colorado and he was taunted\nAnd so I said well I might as well start doing haunted history tourists and I open my\nBig huge mansion to the public and I had haunted wine and\nCheese parties did you know before you bought it it was haunted\nYeah I knew was haunted but I was kind of like this you know my kids were oh starting in junior high at the time\nAnd I was like oh this will be fun kids get this we are oh\nYou're going to love this story this is way true I mean it sounds like it's made up but I'm telling you that all that I'm telling you tonight is a hundred percent true we were living in Southern California at the time and my husband was working for cancer research company and he got laid off when the company changed hands\nSo my entire family a move to Colorado and bought an old haunted mansions sight unseen I Swear\nThat because they wanted to buy a hundred mentioned well where they wanted to buy a mansion\nWell what happened is I actually come out I'm actually from Colorado and I'd come out on vacation and I was staying in the bed and breakfast and I got to know the owners pretty well and I told them my story about how my husband was in this cancer research company and he was the CFO and everything\nAnd at the same time the owner's life who actually wasn't living there she was that in California because she I mean ... Texas 'cause she had cancer and she was dying so she was really interested in the research and I tried to give her as much information as I could you know her husband\nAnd mind you and your she died and so during this time it was really interesting because I actually got an email\nUm and it was back in Nineteen Ninety nine you know so I think it was like I feel bad a questionnaire and the room and that's how he got my email address\nAnd he said to me you know I I Know your husband was involved in this and everything but we actually have this\nA bed and breakfast for cell and ah if you you know I Know you said your husband just got laid off of work I don't know if you were thinking about coming back to Colorado but we could talk about\nFinancing the home for you and that was interesting because my husband didn't have a job I mean everything just fell into place like we were meant to have this house and by the way I actually knew of the house because I grew up here and he was always really fond of this big beautiful old\nA craftsman style mansion done and the arts and crafts file I just loved it\nAnd um when we bought it\nWas really rundown [laughter]\n... extremely run down and so one of the first order of business was to actually fix up the house now this was a problem because the owners said to us\nThat they would finance us no problem we didn't even have to put any money down\nBut I was not allowed to sell anything in the house until the house was paid for and we signed a balloon I'm a balloon like loans and said that we would pass the house in five years after five years we can do whatever we wanted with the furniture or the house\nWhat what have you well after us and you know no no hard feelings to the former owners or anything but I really did not like the way this house was decorated and I'm an artist you know and it's\nVery severe that I'm In a soothing you can see where this was going roe [laughter]\nSo I actually called the owner's son and he was managing the bed and breakfast at the time and I said hey do you think they would mind if I you know just sold a few things and it goes you know what steps do what you want he goes\nMy mother is old and she is going to die soon you know this was before she died and he goes don't worry about it you know I'm just do what you want there never coming back to Colorado again because you know it's too
