{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KNST", "content": "So there's a couple of sites that talk about my work and talked about these cases and a couple of people have chimed in and said well you know Dave talks about people in this books that have been found and there's no mystery there\nThey obviously haven't read the books and they don't understand the rationale behind why these stories are important\nSo you've got a two year old child that's in the middle of the wilderness with their friends or their family and they disappear and that child found say three thousand feet higher in elevation and six miles away in a day and a half\nA well I don't know many parents to think that there are two year old could make that track\nBut that's not it I mean when I started to accumulate the data on it in off the grid the book before this one I had a list that accumulated\nThat probably there's fifty a cases in their starts off with the case let's say a four year old missing in Australia found five days later forty five miles away across the desert\nOf four years old I'm there's other cases where two year old in Florida sound twenty miles away through the swamps a another two year olds in Australia found Fifteen miles away in three days two years old\nA three year old ... Fifteen miles away twenty four hours\nNot possible in my book but I mean there's a long long list of these and why did I start to accumulate that data\nBecause in search and rescue manuals that says that a two year old should be found Ninety five percent of the time in a radius of two miles or less from the point last seen these numbers absolutely blow that to smithereens\nIt's something search and rescue people don't want to talk about don't want to address that want to even think about and I can understand why because there's no way you could plan a search thirty\nMiles away for a two year old it just you don't have enough people to do it and you have to work for that Ninety five percent tile but the problem is in all these books they don't talk about the other five percent anywhere I'm probably the first person that's ever talked about it but as you state\nHow are these kids making this extraordinary distance\nAnd extraordinary heights\nWhen I go to a conference I always ask people how many people in the room or parents you know Ninety percent of people raised their hands and I said if I said okay you you're just going to set your child down in the dirt on a trail walk away we'll watch the child with such child's gonna do for the next hour\nThey said well maybe it'll crawl under Bush and go to sleep maybe the plan that dirt for a while maybe they'll run down the trail for a little bit get upset cry and then go to sleep\nAnd I said how many how many parents and you think your kid would run up hill nobody raises their hand I mean it does happen but it's pretty rare\nBut I have all these examples where these heights had been achieved by these little kids\nWere they cross a couple of mountain ranges or you know it's incredibly difficult terrain sometimes without any shoes on\nWell yeah I mean we talked about a two year old boy that they\nGuest he traveled nine to twelve miles in nine hours over two mountain ranges and he was found face down in snow the next morning unbelievably alive and we found that guy years later and interviewed him and he has no recollection of what happened in his his mom said we couldn't believe we found them and we couldn't believe he was alive\nHave a case in the new book ah in Southern California the Lucerne valley below Hanks this was back in Ninety\nFifty six is the child is five years old at the age of disappearance and you do the math on a bill I guess if he had walked nonstop for twenty four hours he didn't have to go what six miles per hour\nA bunch of kids are going to walk for twenty four hours with no food or water um it it seems just impossible\nUnless somebody pick them up for some something or someone picked him up and locked up their\n... and the reason these cases have significant is that your report on a child who's a duck to downtown\nAnd they're found in West Los Vegas three hours later six miles away you know sure somebody put them in the car and drove from there but when you're talking in the middle of the wilderness that's not happening and\nWhen you talk about this happening when the people in the party in anybody never talked to anybody and when they check the trail walked nobody else was there nobody ever saw anything nobody saw any cars\nNobody else there so how did that trial make the difference in that time doesn't make\nA in the new book uh it's law L.

Park Service that's their property and they patrol it and their national park police are there\nWell there's an ... a location called Oregon or gee a an organ pipe cactus national monument and it's an Arizona\nFar southern part of the state right near the border with Mexico well on February third Nineteen Seventy one a woman thirty two years old named Carol Turner who was a student at the University of New Mexico\nDrove there and was going to take a few days vacation and break from school and kind of walk around and she was inquisitive smart athletic brilliant some people called er\nWell I stumbled onto this case and saw it and some archive somewhere\nAnd I immediately wrote to the Pima County sheriff yeah some pretty documents on that case I got the documents in my hand then I called the national Park Service at organ pipe and ask them for their reports and they stay added a we don't have any\nI said have you heard of the case no well this person's still missing\nSo she was a thirty two year old graduate student she had been a PE teacher with a master's degree in physical education decided she wanted to go back and get to more masters degrees\nAnd she ... she was just really admired by all of the faculty that she worked around and and studied under and all the articles in all the reports said that they stay that she was really smart\nWell she was about to graduate with a degree in sociology and biology and she was working and then you as university lab tech to earn some extra money\nShe loved the outdoors type regularly\nOn January thirty first Seventy one she left her residence in southeast Albuquerque she was driving her white sixty eight Plymouth station wagon and she went about an eight hour drive to the monument and she slept in her car that first night\nFebruary first it was established that she attended an evening ranger presentation at the end of that presentation she went up to the ranger engage them in conversation he remembered it and said hey she asked really good questions and was smart\nFebruary second she went to the park visitors center spoke to a ranger they're stating she had just returned from a hike to bowl pasture\nAnd asked about a guy the trip to a place called dripping springs\nSubsequent investigation found she spoke to a ... a ranger an individual named Larry Henderson you said he she he remembers or ask good questions was interested in the environment wander nowhere to go to see more things\nOn February third she moved your car out of the campground nobody knew exactly why and on February forth at nine Fifteen and I am a ranger was patrolling\nAnd found carols car parked in s this canyon picnic site with a note taped inside the windshield and it said if I'm not backed by four thirty pm on February through these contact the ranger\nSmart smart thing to do\nExactly no I Wish everybody would do that\nBut then as I went through this I started to think she was going to a place and she was heading to a place that she went to earlier and I always wondered in the back of my mind it's something happened that first trip and she was going back to the second time and just in case she was leaving this no I wasn't sure\nSo he purchased patrol vehicle and he hiked the two miles up from bull pasture he saw nothing and decided to check the trail register and it was signed by Carol the first day she went on February second notify park headquarters advises them that he has a missing hiker and this starts the search process\nFebruary fourth and fifth national park service that sent in to Forman teams up that trail the search whether it was described and reports this cold and blustery they determined Carol was last seen eating an orange on the trail and they did find some spare orange peel scattered around\nThe Pima County sheriff was asked to join the search when the national Park Service started to get low on resources\nThey also called in the border patrol and the tribal police US Customs month an air force base they brought in civilian helicopters was massive the search for three hundred ground searchers were on at any one time the\nPark superintendent again he met Ryan contacted turtles parents in North Carolina the\nParents they did the Carol would never ever go off trail she was in ... outstanding athletic condition and she was supposed to be back in Albuquerque on February fifth February twenty second that Ryan told the Associated Press it's almost becoming a search for the answer to a mystery\nMarch seventh one last push to locate curl rangers claimed to smell an odor of the human decaying flesh up the trail march thirteenth national park service protein into the area of the odor and found nothing\nAnd\nAgain they have no documentation on the incident anywhere now I did get this NPs report that was in the Pima County documents and it was written by the chief ranger Roswell boils and it was three type written pages that outlines of search for Carole\nAnd Ninety percent of it real boring real mundane a review of what it says one additional clue was turned up on Monday February fifteenth too limited locations about four hundred

we save some time to talk about the era cases so I Want to jump into one of the most baffling cases involving water it's a guy named Henry McCabe and this is really pretty creepy\nThat is a creepy case and ah [noise] the new Brighton Minnesota the community just north of Minneapolis not very far with the suburb September seven two thousand Fifteen to twenty eight am it happened [noise] McCabe was thirty two years old\nSo uh he was an immigrant from Liberia married to a woman named cream their two kids lived in a city called Mountain View again just north of Minneapolis north side this is a cost her area of missing people that I've written about in the past\nYou had a great job he was an auditor for the state of Minnesota for the department of revenue\nOn September sixty thousand Fifteen his wife with kids or went to California and it was a\nPlanned vacation well on that Sunday night Henry went out with a long time friend who was a very diligent guy always on time very respectable and he and his friend went to the club early they laugh\nEarly on that Monday morning and ... states that he dropped him off at a location and friendly\nAt the super gas station at a Seventy third avenue at two twenty three am Henry phone appears corrupt pocket dial this wife while she was asleep in California\nAnd left the link the voicemail strange sound screaming paying growls et cetera\nAnd a guy from uh Finland did some amazing work sent me this booklet of things that he did and in there he said Dave did you know that there's six major disappearances in Bermuda Triangle that matched dates of disappearances and your books\n[laughter] I never even knew that and then went back through it and he was right and that got me to start paying attention to these triangles now in the Nevada try and go down there by you it goes from Reno Las Vegas to Fresno that's the triangle\nAnd when I first got on to that I thought well this seems kinda hocus pocus I don't know if I should pay attention but then I put it on a map I said holy crap you know it's in the middle that try and go\nTo Sam in national park yes\nI go that's quite a coincidence so Yosemite kings canyon and sequoia national parks are there and I've got tons of disappearances in kings canyon and sequoia as well\n[noise] and when I watched a documentary about the Nevada Triangle there's several thousand planes that crashed and disappeared in this year is in that area\nAnd a lot of it can be explained by various meteorologist as strange air currents that things which seems reasonable\nBut when you bring into account that there was also many many people that have disappeared in that area under unexplained circumstances seems kind of a strange coincidence\nWell let's get into some uh do you have any specifics from the ... were you when you get into where should we just go you jumped into the cases of ear disappearances in general\nAnd it was just go to air disappearances\nYou have a case in the book from Moffett Field Sunnyvale, California from Nineteen forty two what's the deal on that one\nSo that's a I grew up not far from off the field in Sunnyvale I grew up ... you know and I had plane flying into Moffett Field going right over my house every day of the week\nAnd it had notoriety in the early forties for being a place where all the blimps that patrolled the coast of California that's where they were stationed at their and Treasure Island in the middle of the day\nWell in August sixteen Nineteen forty two a blimp was getting are sent out a treasure island where they held the world's fair was man by the Senate ... Cody\nSeven years old and an infant Charles McAdams thirty eight years old [noise]\nAnd uh they've left Treasure Island no big deal general patrol all the details on this came from the navy file under a freedom of Information Act I filed ... report on this\nWell as they depart they start to head out over the Golden Gate and they start to go out over the Pacific towards the furloughed islands and Cody with control of an L. E. airship and this was originally taken by our military\nAnd it was owned by grid here and they took it\nBecause there was a a needed for patrol\n[noise] we'll both men lived near Moffett Field in Mountain View but they drove up to a treasure island for the day to leave on their ship [noise]\nUh that night water vapor was in the air and it made the ship too heavy to carry a normal for person that would be in the bucket they only left with to first hundred and ten minute to the white was normal in fact there was no communication and\nThen at seven fifty am the crew radio that they were investigating a suspicious oil slick and there were five miles to the fair on islands\nEight oh five numerous attempts by radio to reach the crew but there was no luck\nAnd the navy scrambled to over to you kingfisher aircraft out of Alameda naval air station to go track down the boy\nWhat a plane's encountered cloudy weather with a feeling of five hundred feet they decided it was too dangerous to fly below the crowd so they will bubble [noise] uh ten forty five AM Moffett Field received a call from Fort funds to near the Golden Gate stating that they are to LA ship with two pilots and all we're fine\nWell the navy made a huge sigh of relief and they felt that all was okay now this was a really really weird call but it was in the file and they couldn't explain why it was their\nMinute eleven Fifteen for fun and cause Moffett Field against they didn't get that in LA had crashed\nIn the hills of Daly city Daly city is just south of San Francisco on the coast or the navy response to Daly city and they find the airship on the ground with one bomb missing the guard was near perfect condition\nMotors on the ship or off even though one throw was half open and the other was all the way open\nAnd the crew which was required were white preserves over the water both of the life preserver that they were supposed to be wearing were gone there was a confidential maybe briefcase in each a airship and that was still intact the cabin door was open plenty of fuel within the tanks\nThe radio with in perfect condition no distress call for fun and called back and say they said they made a serious mistake know LA was present at the Fort they couldn't explain why they made that original call [noise]\nThe central coast of California had a major searched started almost immediately that may be found to fishing boats and navy built in a postcard ship it's all the blimp dip and drop to wears on the oil slick\nThe blimp then gained altitude and disappeared into the crowd\nIs it all pure fairly normal but it did go into the crowd and disappeared the crash happened at four thirty to build your street Daly city three miles east of the Pacific ocean the crew did not use parachutes and shoots that were in the crock were still there [noise]\nThere was a couple of theories that I'm Sorry to interrupt you there's a couple of theories that developed a and that the theories are just about as weird as the disappearances or we're going to go to a break come back we're in the jump into the other details about this case and then I get your take on what might have happened to these two missing crew people\nInto the break with the journey wheel in the sky\nFind them more about tonight's just log on to go to ... am dot com\n\nLikes to play you go again bouncing around saying wait I didn't mean teaching by that and I just wanted to see what I mean it's all about you I agree with electric human sharing like fucking around feeling the alley sorry\nMaybe people generally prefer the shooting in converting son of a female voice apology\nAccepted into ... so what station did you want to hear against\nJane as she I Am seven Ninety there's nothing artificial intelligence\n\nIt's one thing to reach\nWe\nA rock and roll lovers or send us why don't you wish me ... this week in lock him real history\nBack in Nineteen Seventy Elvis Presley classic jailhouse rocks was released it became his ninth us number one single he stayed on the billboard charts for Nineteen weeks film clips from the movie where he sang the song is considered by many historians to be the first ... committee\nThis week in Nineteen sixty four just to freeze their first national television appearance performing where did I Love ...

prime minister called a cabinet meeting laid on Sunday and shortly after the U.S and Canada confirmed a new trade agreement was in place the United states Mexico Canada agreement us MCA replaces the Nineteen Ninety four NAFTA packed\n\n\n\n\nBefore the break we are talking about this US Navy blimp it's patrolling off the coast to California and uh the blimp comes back crashes on land the crew is gone they pick up the story from there\nSo the navy did their investigation and they said that uh there was no fire on board when it hit the beach originally when it hit land it drop one of its bombs accidentally that made the blimp wider was able to take off again and crashing that Daly city neighborhood\nThere was a massive search off the coast that went on for days and they never found anything they reviewed radio bog there was no call for help\nThey could never explained why the blimp went straight up into the crowds after dropping the players and they thought that it would have stayed lower to watch are like that they were watching on the water there were lots of water craft in that area\nThey never found the crew or the emergency survival equipment that they were wearing\nAnd this is an area outside the Golden Gate that I've written about many times before because just north of San Francisco [noise] yup point raised national park which has had several strange disappearances I've documented\nAnd just south of the Golden Gate to a location called half moon bay in that area of the coast I've written about other disappearances that are very very strange no other part of the northern California coast north of\nThat coin raise area and nothing immediately south uh half moon bay so it's this we're one area that has the strings attached to it\nAnd like you said that they came up with some explanation for to me that we are laughable\n\nWell uh like uh maybe they got into an argument and uh and both fell off or maybe one of them accidentally fell over and the other guy tried to save him and was pulled into the water or\nI mean could that could does not have happened ...\n... what do you think George [laughter]\nWell I'm just asking you did to respond to those stories that doesn't seem like a there was any kind of a disturbance sign of disturbance in the in what was left of the craft or and if they were wearing their life jackets you'd think that they would still be had been floating around out there when the when the search was underway\nOr even if they come out of their life jacket they would have recovered the jak\nRight because that that area of the water that was searched out there with search so thoroughly and eventually those jackets are gonna wash up the shore and they would have recovered them on the beach so oh these explanations absolutely made no sense at all\nYou have another case from Scotland a that was held Nineteen Seventy five\nBefore I get into that if I Want to address something that you said just after the break and that was an explanation that fits the facts and I immediately thought of in Walker ranch you know\nGive is going to bring this up at some point um you know as I read this book today um I notice that you you've ventured a little bit farther than you have in previous works or in the land in the air disappearances there's the Fred let Frederick ... case which is a famous UFO case\nThere's also a reference to a needs a National Institute for discovery science which was the organization that was studying skin Walker ranch in and several of the cattle mutilation that had happened in the winter basin\nAnd the circumstances where it looked like these cows had been dropped from the sky some of them disappeared altogether but some of them or their their legs were broken as if they'd been dropped from the sky several of your cases I thought the same thing in multiple missing for a woman bucks it looks like people are snatched down to the off the ground\nAnd then some of them are dropped back into these are odd locations little kids that are suddenly miles and miles away I it it seems like I Know you don't want to commit to\nAny particular explanation because you don't have enough evidence to a to point to one in particular but some of this stuff\nCertainly ventures into the area of the paranormal and um I wanted to share this with the audience that day I don't know David how how closely you follow the UFO a topic I Know you sometimes you get into those subjects but\nIt's been an amazing nine or ten months a where all these documents are coming out about government studies of UFOs the Pentagon's ongoing interest and one of the stories that I was able to break earlier this year was about skin walk Iran's that a program that have been created by the Pentagon\nOr to look at UFOs also went much further that it it studied what we would call paranormal events unexplained mysteries at places like skin Walker ranch and elsewhere\nAnd I'm at Jeremy core bell is made a film about it and I included in that film and is a reference to our book which had been read in Washington it turns out earlier this year I was invited to go back by Senator Harry Reid to meet with some people whose names I cannot cannot make public\nBut they are they gave me sort of a download on the UFO mystery and what some of the research had uncovered and um and ... as well as additional information and some of that has been made public but the one of these guys pulled me aside\nHe had a at an ongoing interest in skin Walker ranch and other mysteries related to it and he asked uh ask me some questions about the ranch and then he said\nYou know we think that that guy de ... that are that his mystery with these missing people might be related to the phenomena at the ranch\nAnd I ask a couple of questions that didn't seem to have a real solid answer or not one that they would share with me\nBut the idea that the phenomenon that's been seen there which is sometimes playful and sometimes dangerous might be related to yours startled me and I don't know how you react to that but maybe it makes you uncomfortable or being associated with anything as weird as that but you're stuff's pretty weird too\n\nSo how would you rank this person's credibility and integrity on a topic like this\nUm I'd say this person that I'm Talking about knows more about it than anyone and I don't mean just in the military I mean anyone\nUh he's this person has seen a lot of stuff that the the public has never seen so you know he\nHe has a very broad spectrum and a very broad knowledge base about what we would call paranormal including UFOs and alleged abductions and things of that sort so I don't know exactly how your a phenomena fit in with the larger picture but the idea that somebody has been looking at it is a I think that's pretty interesting\nLetter wake up call I think so um [noise]\nSo you know way back when we first started to talk about the ranch I really put an emphasis on that area to see if there was anything related to it just the parents that I could take my teeth into they can relate it to the activity there\nAnd you know there's really nothing around that ranch that I could say is related to missing people that I study but ethics seated before sometimes I think\nI I relate it to law enforcement and if you have a say a series of bank robberies the bank robbers are ever going to do a bank robbery in their neighborhood because they don't want to draw attention to it\nAnd I've always stated that I think that this is related to the profile points I I gave you one of those is water and when you look at Mississippi and Louisiana say it just filled with water I have no cases from there it's bizarre\nAnd isn't George isn't there a lake fairly near that ranch\nYeah it's ... it's a reservoir it's called bottle hollow um it's a manmade lake but the ones right in the middle of the ... reservation that you saw a control that property and they allow camping and fishing and swimming and things of that sort when that lake is a a\n... has a long history of really weird stuff creatures have been seen there and objects coming in and out of the water and there but a lot of drowning said that they the ... tribe believes that uh there's something in the water that pulls you down a lot of people at Brown there and uh\nSo ... you're right I get asked all the time if there's anybody in the vicinity the ranch you meet your criteria who's banished like that and I have to say no\nOther than animals livestock things and that sort but no people have a banished then I Know of of course we haven't really dug into the historical archives or to the extent that you have but I think that some of that work is being done right now\nAnyway it's uh it it was a it struck me as a significant that that the person who told me that in D.C had brought up your\nBooks and and your subject matter I Want to try to get one more of these air disappearances in before the bottom of the

going to send you an email by the way I'll say I spoke to you\nOn the Appalachian Trail from Rochester to Philadelphia you there's ways to drive in many places in the Appalachian Trail you can pull off the road and just walk and take a nice walk on the trail and one time I did that in the afternoon\nAnd there was a a man or woman and a boy and a couple of other people walk in one direction\nAnd and we started talking and walking within five minutes another family came from around out simply to me out of nowhere\nAnd there were picnic tables right near there and one woman who I was very suspicious of that just appeared said Hi to the other one and she had a girl\nAnd the shuttle can our kids play and the the the people that I had been walking with the mother said you are and we shut down at a picnic table and the strange woman said to the other lady that I had to walk with what's your name\nThat they tell their name and the woman says that's our name too\nAnd then about three minutes later the lady looks and the boys go on and she started calling them and I got up and I walk around in a swear to God I Am not making this up\nThere was a close creature over the boy the boy had passed out or I don't know if the creature bumped them but this is the part I Want you know it had\nKind of futuristic very tight fitting clothes it jumped this creature looked humanoid\nBut not totally human it jumped at least twenty feet from the ground without running jumped up to the the middle of a tree where the you know the branches start coming out\nAnd then I just turned around and I

these weird events that I've had in my life\nSometimes don't sink in until after the fact and you know I started thinking about it well wait a minute how did they even get that ATV onto the road that show [laughter] alone\nHow weird their appearance was I mean I was struck by how odd it was at the time but um\nYou know I just kind of reason to the way that well there are people but I tell you up in those woods there's been some strange strange events uh I I called in a while back I talk to you when you talk to the big foot researcher that the records their their sounds it was in those\nWoods where I heard this a ungodly sound that couldn't be any other animal and I don't think of the best opera singer POV raunchy could have imitated the sound and I'd encourage you to find\nKnow what coast to coast it would be audiotape they used to play a visual legit big foot recording ten or more years ago George or used to play it\nI think are used to play it hasn't been played for years but I heard that up in the shame would it's a unique recording never heard of it before\nI'm starting to buying more and more to the fact that you speak put my feet dimensional\nMy extraterrestrial connection the humanoid that I saw in the woods or more I think about it there's\nNinety nine point nine percent sure those were not humans\nAnd hindsight I'm just glad they didn't take me whatever they were doing up in that area\nWell we're glad to cause a ... you wouldn't have been able to call in presumably thank you Jason for sharing that story that's a that's a pretty straight you need to start carrying some recording equipment with you wherever you go thanks very much tried to get one more caller in close to home here Brian in Las Vegas hey Brian what's on your mind\nOh yeah\nA couple of comments on the on the Michigan for one one on one on previous callers and over quickly maybe a historian real quick um I had kind of a big but experience and it wasn't until he played this year sounds like coast to coast they realize that that's what I heard I\nWas up um the Willamette to for national forest is a lot of ill so between um mount bachelor and a three sisters in Oregon\nAnd um it was up there a late night watch the stars and hanging out and they'll\nLikely music stuff sometimes I just kinda hang out more which were quiet and there's nobody around for hours up there and we went down to look and stars through binoculars\nAnd I heard that same sound that he's talking about as best as I Know what he's talking about [noise] um and it at a weird psychic effect I don't know anybody else has had this experience but um it was kinda like hey what are you doing up here and I've\nGot a second guessing but oil it's really far away and the you know maybe I'm just imagining that and\nSo I kept hanging out with the stars in about ten minutes and they closed oh I'd say at least three to five miles in maybe ten minutes and it did the same sound again only the the impression or psyche can personally at all it was like hey I'm coming at you\nAnd may I jump to my car so bad and got out of there um and\nYou know I never really piece together what was you know I'm like I said I Will do a lot of reading once in a lot of close coast and when the theorists down it was like oh my God that's what it is a you know musicians like listen to overtones and frequency and stuff a lot\nAnd I'm

missing for one one guy coming back Wednesday ... going to be back on the air\nAnd I always tell them not soon enough we get more requests for Dave than any other guest that I've experienced since I've been with the program for ten years and that's a that's because he always brings the goods\nI Am jazz that he always allows me to get the first interview when he unveils a new book and like the other books this new one does not disappoint\nA Davis you probably know spent Twenty years in law enforcement then worked in the tech industry for a bit but found as true calling as an investigator of unusual disappearances and his work in that area has become a phenomenon known all over the world multiple books a documentary film\nAnd maybe some other surprises become Dave great to have you back\nIn Georgia I'm always humbled that anyone even wants to listen to listen to me though or appreciate the invite\nWhen you say you know I noticed something as I was reading the new book today that you make some personal observations than I have not uh I haven't seen it you go this far in the other books I insights\nInto your own emotional reactions to some of these cases and it seems clear like the subject really gets to you and you've got I think eleven hundred and thirty five cases that you profiled over the years thousands more they'd be looked into\nSome of them really seem to get into your head though I I think in part because of similarities or some of the missing to your own life right\nYou know I think that's true um I've been very fortunate to me family of people who have been lost and when you meet these people it really brings brings home the emotion and [noise] there's\nA lot of parallels to my life with a lot of these families and I've written about people that remind me of myself a lot of time and ah [noise]\nI've put that in the book just recently ... probably because it's it's more of an evolution of my writing and\nHopefully people see that you know hey if people are really really good people the right to drag has fighting these are the upper echelon and\nIt's the conundrum to me why I don't find people that are down and out in life that are disappearing but it it seems to me that it's always the high rollers the people that are high\nPerformers that are disappearing\nYou know one place in the new book you've mentioned how as a rule you did not reach out to the families of the missing now sometimes you meet him in ... due to various circumstances but in general you don't call somebody up out of the blue and say hey can I talk to you about your dad loved one or you're missing loved one because it seems like an invisible line that you don't want to cross over but I Wonder\nHas the success of your books help in the sense that these families now reach out to you that they're unsatisfied say with the\nSearch effort or something and they're they're turning to you for some help her answers\nIt has happened and uh I don't want to inject myself into a search or into the turmoil that evolving with somebody disappearing now somebody reaches out one from help absolutely I'm going to be there I'll do everything I can [noise]\nAnd there's been cases just recently where that's happened and I've been glad to help and ah\nI've kinda guided them and it it seems that a lot of these families\nAnd covered the same sort of issues time and time again and frustrating as heck sit back and hear the frustration and their voice a\nCommon one is is it seems as though when jurisdictions stop searching they get to a point seven to ten days and they say hey there's nothing else we can do there's no place else to search\nA we're running out of resources we've got to stop well many times families and friends rally at that point and they get a group together and they keep searching for what I tell these people is you've got to get a copy of those reports that the jurisdiction wrote search and rescue report\nLaw enforcement report the who they interviewed who they talked to were they searched the effectiveness of the search\nOr the areas that they completely eliminated and the and the areas that they thought that they still should search more because without that you're really searching wind and there's been in for just lately where people have said no they said they won't give us anything\nI I find that baffling\nI mean that's how they've treated you\nWell I was getting then ask you the same question about different agencies I Know how the national Park Service feels about you and that they are we should anybody who has not heard your earlier interviews or is not familiar with the books you might be listening tonight\nI'm maybe we started there where you can explain the history of your interaction with the national Park Service the forest service government entities in general because they've shut you out I mean I guess I I'm interested to learn that they're doing the same thing to the families of the missing but it's really\nKind of clear over the big picture that they don't want to help solve these mysteries\nYou know it it's a sad note on humanity if that's the case but there is a lot of obstruction\nSo when I started out I was told by a couple of Park Service rangers that they had found this appearances in their parks where they had worked that bothered them didn't make sense when they tried to find information that couldn't\nAnd they thought somebody with an investigative background ought to be looking into it\nAnd that's sort of how it all started and I filed a series of freedom of Information

that uh you've got some imitators out there are people who have written books similar to yours as well as people who've gone further than that pretending to be you can you address that very moment before we jump into the cases\nThis is one of the most frustrating parts of the you know in the public spotlight I go to conferences all the time people come up to me and they say so you said this or how did you come up with that I'm thinking I never said that and there's a series of YouTube sites\nThat have the name David polite is missing for one one missing a national parks there all frauds they're not me there are people that have used my name to get innocent and listeners to get on and every time you click through they get paid by their Google Ads\nThe only site that has me is that can ... missing project you to say all the rest are not me in fact about eighty percent of them and when you click and and you listen if you don't know it's somebody else talking about some other topic and it's not even me at all so\nI tried to tell us that people don't trust you to really don't even listen to them a lesson that can happen to sing project site that's the only real site that you're going to get honest information from All right\nTalk for a moment about search and rescue parameters because that that information becomes key to you picking the cases that huge zero in on I mean there are metrics there are there's\nData um for search and rescue 'em yeah how how they proceed and and I are huge database I Would think that gives clues about which cases stand out as being unusual\nSo that the data that you're trying to get to is really in the reports that they generate\nAnd the national Park Service for one won't volunteer up any of these reports now find name a specific date and a specific time and that person has been rural to be a missing and presumed deceased\nThey're released the report most time a lot of times they want there is a case from eighty six\nAnd are filmed impossible distances way sometimes they're alive amazingly enough but I'm often found impossible distances away and there is no way no way they could walk there on their own or talk about that the nomination\nSo there's a couple of sites that talk about my work and talked about these cases and the couple of people have chimed in and said well you know Dave talks about people in this books that have been found and there's no mystery there they obviously haven't read the books and they don't understand the rationale behind why these stories are important\nSo you've got a two year old child that's in the middle of the wilderness with their friends or their family and they disappear and that child found say three thousand feet higher in elevation and six miles away in a day and a half\nA well I don't know many parents to think that there are two year old could make that track\nBut that's not it I mean when I started to accumulate the data on it in off the grid the book before this one I had a list that accumulated\nThat probably there's fifty a cases in their starts off with a case let's say a four year old missing in Australia found\nFive days later forty five miles away across the desert\nOn four years old I'm there's other cases where two year old in Florida found twenty miles away through the swamps a another two year olds in Australia found Fifteen miles away in three days two years old\nA three year old found Fifteen miles away twenty four hours\nNot possible in my book but I mean there's a long long list of these and why did I start to accumulate that data\nBecause in search and rescue manuals that says that a two year old should be found Ninety five percent of the time in a radius of two miles or less from the point last seen these numbers absolutely blow that to smithereens\nIt's something search and rescue people don't want to talk about don't want to address that want to even think about and I can understand why because there's no way you could plan a search\nThirty miles away for a two year old just you don't have enough people to do it and you have to work for that Ninety five percent tile but the problem is in all these books they don't talk about the other five percent anywhere I'm probably the first person that's ever ...\nAbout it but as you state how are the kids making this extraordinary distance\nAnd extraordinary hike when I go to a conference I always ask people how many people in the room or parents you know Ninety percent of people raised their hand and I said if I said OK you that your child down in the dirt on a trail walk away or watch the child with the child going to do for the next hour\nThey said well maybe it'll crawl under Bush and go to sleep maybe the plan that jerk for a while maybe they'll run down the trail for a little bit get upset cry and then go to sleep\nAnd I could how many how many parents and your think your kid would run up hill nobody races around I mean it does happen but it's pretty rare\nBut I have all these examples where the heights of been achieved by these little kids\nWere they crossed a couple of mountain ranges or you know it's incredibly difficult terrain sometimes without any shoes on\nA you know we've got a movement we talked about a two year old boy that they\nTraveled nine to twelve miles in nine hours over two mountain ranges and he was found face down and know the next morning unbelievably why we found that got years later and interviewed him and he has no recollection of what happened and it has months that we couldn't believe we found him and we couldn't believe it or why\nYou have a case in the new book ah in Southern California the Lucerne belly bill Hanks this was from back in Nineteen fifty six is the child is five years old at the age of disappearance\nAnd you do the math on a bill I guess if he had walked nonstop for twenty four hours to have to go watch six miles per hour\nBut a kid's not going to walk for twenty four hours with no food or water um it it seems just impossible\nUnless somebody picked him up or some something or someone picked him up and left him there\nWell and and the reason these cases have significant is that we'll see you report on a child who's abducted in downtown\nAnd they're found in West Los Vegas three hours later six miles away you know sure probable somebody put them in the car and drove down there but when you're talking in the middle of the wilderness that's not happening and\nWhen you talk about this happening when the people in the party in anybody never talk to anybody and when they check the trail walks nobody else was there nobody saw anything nobody saw any cars\nNobody else was there so how did that trial make that distance in that time doesn't make\nA in the new book or it's law L. A. W. land air and water and a land cases you've talked about before but you've got some new ones including one\nThat happened in organ pipe cactus national monument Arizona ready to take a break now when we come back this one is really creepy and even some of the investigators who are working the case admitted it was really creepy\nI Will tell you why in just a moment talking with David ... is going to take a break the person's project break down into the break [noise]\nThe coast website is no streamlined for mobile devices Greek news if you're a coast insider for simply want to enjoy our website on your phone visit coast to coast am dot com on your iPhone or Android rose or [noise]\n[noise]\n\nBe wrong [noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n\nWe\nHey they're rock and roll lovers of Sandy ...

part of the national Park Service that's their property and they patrol it and their national park police are there\nWell there's an ... a location called Oregon or gee a an organ pipe cactus national monument and it's an Arizona\nFar southern part of the state right near the border with Mexico on February third Nineteen Seventy one a woman thirty two years old named Carol Turner who was a student at the University of New Mexico\nDrove there and was going to take a few days vacation and break from school and kind of walk around and she was inquisitive smart athletic brilliant some people called er\nWell I stumbled onto this case and saw it and some archive somewhere\nAnd I immediately wrote to the Pima County sheriff yeah some pretty documents on that case I got the documents in my hand then I called the national Park Service at organ pipe and ask them for their reports and they stay at it or we don't have any\nI said have you heard of the case no well this person's still missing\nSo she was a thirty two year old graduate student she had been a PE teacher with a master's degree in physical education decided she wanted to go back and get to more masters degrees\nAnd she ... she was just really admired by all of the faculty that she worked around and and studied under and all the articles in all the reports said that they stay that she was really smart\nWell she was about to graduate with a degree in sociology and biology and she was working and then you as university lab tech to earn some extra money\nShe loved the outdoors type regularly\nOn January thirty first Seventy one she left her residence in southeast Albuquerque she was driving her white sixty eight Plymouth station wagon and she went about an eight hour drive to the monument and she slept in her car that first night\nFebruary first it was established that she attended an evening ranger presentation at the end of that presentation she went up to the ranger engage them in conversation he remembered it and said hey she asked really good questions and was smart\nFebruary second she went to the park visitors center spoke to a ranger they're stating she had just returned from a hike to bowl pasture\nAnd asked about a guy the trip to a place called dripping springs\nSubsequent investigation found she spoke to a ... a ranger an individual named Larry Henderson you said he she he remembers or ask good questions was interested in the environment wander nowhere to go to see more things\nOn February third she moved your car out of the campground nobody knew exactly why and on February forth at nine Fifteen and I am a ranger was patrolling\nAnd found carols car parked in s this canyon picnic site with a note taped inside the windshield and it said if I'm not backed by four thirty pm on February through\nThese contact the ranger smart smart thing to do\nYou know I Wish everybody would do that\nBut then as I went through this I started to think she was going to a place and she was heading to a place that she went to earlier and I always wondered in the back of my mind that something happened that first trip and she was going back to the second time and just in case she was

Want to jump into one of the most babbling cases involving water it's a guy named Henry McKay but this is really pretty creepy\nThat is a creepy case and ah [noise] the new Brighton Minnesota the community just north of Minneapolis not very far with the suburb September seven two thousand Fifteen to twenty eight am it happened [noise] McCabe with thirty two years old\nSo uh he was an immigrant from Liberia married to a woman named cream their two kids lived in a city called Mountain View again just north of Minneapolis north side this is a cost her area of missing people that I've written about in the past\nYou had a great job he was an auditor for the state of Minnesota for the department of revenue\nOn September sixty thousand Fifteen his wife with kids or went to California\nAnd it was a planned vacation well on that Sunday night Henry went out with a long time friend who was a very diligent guy always on time very respectable\nAnd he and his friend went to the club early they laugh\nEarly on that Monday morning and ... states that he dropped him off at a location and critically at the super gas station or a Seventy third avenue at two twenty three am\nHenry phone appears Trump pocket dial this wife while she was asleep and California\nAnd put together some very interesting factual side notes\nAnd a guy from uh Finland did some amazing work sent me this booklet of things that he did and in there he said Dave did you know that there's six major disappearances in Bermuda Triangle that matched dates of disappearances in your books\n[laughter] I never even knew that and then went back through it and he was right and that got me to start paying attention to these triangles now in the Nevada try and go down there by you it goes from Reno Las Vegas to Fresno that's the triangle\nAnd when I first got on to that I thought well this seems kinda hocus pocus I don't know if I should pay attention but then I put it on a map I said holy crap you know it's in the middle that try and go\nTo Sam in national park yes\nI go that's quite a coincidence so Yosemite kings canyon and sequoia national parks are there and I've got tons of disappearances and king canyon and sequoia as well\n[noise] and when I watched a documentary about the Nevada Triangle there's several thousand planes that have crashed and disappeared in this year is in that area\nAnd a lot of it can be explained by various meteorologist as strange air currents things which seems reasonable\nBut when you bring into account that there is also many many people that have disappeared in that area under unexplained circumstances seems kind of a strange coincidence\nWell let's get into some uh do you have any specifics from the ... were you when you get into or should we just go you jump into the cases of ear disappearances in general\nIt was just go to air disappearances\nYou have a case in the books from among the field Sunnyvale, California from Nineteen forty two what's the deal on that one\nSo that's a I grew up not far from Moffett Field uh in Sunnyvale I grew up ... you know and I had plane flying into Moffett Field going right over my house every day of the week and it had notoriety in the early forties for\nBeing a place where all the blimps that patrolled the coast of California that's where they were stationed at their and Treasure Island\nIn the middle of the day [noise] [noise] well in August sixteenth Nineteen forty two a blimp was getting a fence out of Treasure Island where they held the world's fair was man by ... earners Cody twenty seven years old and an infant Charles McAdams thirty eight years old [noise]\nAnd uh they've left Treasure Island no big deal general patrol all the details on this came from the navy file under a freedom of Information Act I filed fascinating report on this well\nAs they depart they start to head out over the Golden Gate and they start to go out over the Pacific towards the furloughed islands [noise] and uh Cody with control of an L. E. airship and this was originally taken by our military\nAnd it was owned by good year and they took it because there was a a needed for patrol\n[noise] what both men lived near Moffett Field in Mountain View but they drove up to Treasure Island for the day to leave on their ship [noise]\nUh that night water vapor was in the air and it made the ship too heavy to carry a normal for a person that would be in the bucket they only left with to\nFirst hundred and ten minute to the white was normal in fact there was no communication and then at seven fifty am the crew radio that they were investigating suspicious oil slick and there were five miles to the fair on islands\nAt eight oh five numerous attempts by radio to reach the crew but there was no luck\nAnd the navy scrambled to you over to you kingfisher aircraft out of Alameda naval air station to go track down the boy\nWhat a plane's encountered cloudy weather with a feeling of five hundred feet they decided it was too dangerous to fly below the crowd so they will bubble [noise] ten forty five AM Moffett Field received a call from Fort funds to near the Golden Gate stating that they are to LA ship with two pilots and all we're fine\nWell the navy made a huge sigh of relief and they felt that all was okay now this was a really really weird call but it was in a file and they couldn't explain why it was their\nMinute eleven Fifteen for fun and cause Moffett Field against they didn't get that in LA had crashed in the hills of Daly city Daly city is just south of San Francisco on the coast\nOr the navy response to Daly city and they find the airship on the ground with one bomb missing the\nGuard was near perfect condition both motors on a ship or off even though one frog was half open and the other was all the way open and the crew which was required were white preserves over the water both of the life preserver that they were supposed to be wearing were gone there\nWas a confidential maybe briefcase and each a airship and that was still intact the cabin door was open plenty of fuel within the tanks the radio with in perfect condition no distress call\nFor fun and called back and say they said they made a serious mistake know LA was present at the Fort they couldn't explain why they made that original call [noise]\nThe central coast of California had a major search and started almost immediately that may be found to fishing boats and navy built in a postcard ship that's all the blimp yep and drop cure wears on the oil slick\nThe blimp then gained altitude and disappeared into the crowds they said all pure fairly normal but it did go into the crowd and disappeared the crash happened at four thirty to build your street Daly city three miles east of the Pacific ocean\nThe crew did not use parachutes and shoots that we're in a craft were still there [noise]\nI mean there's a couple of theories that I'm Sorry to interrupt you there was a couple of theories that developed a and that the theories are just about as weird as the disappearances or we're going to go to a break come back we're going to jump into the other details about this case and then I get your take on what might have happened to these two missing crew people\nEnded a break with the journey wheel in the sky\nFind them ... and I just logged on to go to ... am done\n\nNow a year in rock

spreads Kevin I'm Still waiting to be confirmed or rejected by the Senate hurts\nOne eight hundred four hundred seven one four or five\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\nBefore the break we're talking about this US Navy blimp it's patrolling off the coast of California and uh the blimp comes back crashes on land the crew is gone they pick up the story from there\nFor the navy did their investigation and they said that uh there was no fire onboard when it hit the beach originally when it hit land it drop one of its bombs accidentally that\nMade the blimp wider was able to take off again and crashing that Daly city neighborhood\nThere was a massive search off the coast that went on for days and they never found anything they reviewed radio bog there was no call for help\nThey could never explained why the blimp went straight up into the crowds after dropping the players and they thought that it would have stayed lower to watch a lick that they were watching on the water there were lots of water craft in that area\nThey never found the crew or the emergency survival equipment that they were wearing\nAnd there's an area outside the Golden Gate that I've written about many times before because just north of San Francisco [noise] yup point raised national park which has had several strange disappearances I've documented\nAnd just south of the Golden Gate to a location called offering day in that area of the coast I've written about other just the parents of that are very very strange no other part of the northern California coast north of\nThat coin raise area\nAnd nothing immediately south half moon bay so it's this one area that have just strangeness attached to it\nAnd like you said that they came up with some explanation for to me there were laughable\n\nWell like ah maybe they got into an argument and uh and both fell off or maybe one of them accidentally fell over and the other guy tried to save him and was pulled into the water or\nI mean could that could does not have happened ...\n... what do you think George [laughter]\nWell I'm just asking you did to respond to those stories it doesn't seem like a there was any kind of a disturbance sign of disturbance in the in what was left in the craft store and if they were wearing their life jackets you'd think that they would still be had been floating around out there when the when the search was underway\nOr even if they come out of their life jacket they would have recovered the jak right\nBecause the the area of the water that was searched out there with search so thoroughly and eventually those jackets are gonna wash up the shore and they would have recovered them on the beach so all these explanations absolutely made no sense at all\nYou have another case from Scotland a that was held Nineteen Seventy five\nBefore I get in that case I Want to address something that you said just after the break and that was an explanation that fits the facts and I immediately thought of skin Walker ranch\nYou know give is going to bring this up at some point um you know as I read this book today um\nNotice that you you've ventured a little bit farther than you have in previous works or in the land in the air disappearances there's there Fred let Frederick Marilyn ditch case which is a famous UFO case\nThere's also a reference to a needs a National Institute for discovery science which was the organization that was studying skin Walker ranch in and several of the cattle mutilation that had happened and he went to base in\nAt the circumstances where it looked like these cows had been dropped from the sky some of them disappeared altogether but some of them or their their legs were broken as if they'd been dropped from the sky several of your cases I thought the same thing in multiple missing for a woman books it looks like people are snatched down to the off the ground\nAnd then some of them are dropped back into these are odd locations little kids that are suddenly miles and miles away I it it seems like I Know you don't want to commit to\nAny particular explanation because you don't have enough evidence to a to point to one in particular but some of this stuff\nCertainly ventures into the area of the paranormal and um I wanted to share this with the audience that I don't know David how how closely you follow the UFO a topic I Know you sometimes you get into those subjects but\nIt's been an amazing nine or ten months a where all these documents are coming out about government studies of UFOs the Pentagon's ongoing interest and one of the stories that I was able to break earlier this year was about skin Walker ranch that a program that have been created by\nThe Pentagon or to look at UFOs also went much further that it it studied what we would call paranormal events unexplained mysteries at places like skin Walker ranch and elsewhere\nAnd I'm at Jeremy core bell is made a film about it and I included in that film and is a reference to our book\nHad been read in Washington it turns out earlier this year I was invited to go back by Senator Harry Reid to meet with some people whose names I cannot cannot make public\nBut they uh they gave me sort of a download on the UFO mystery and what some of the research had uncovered and um and ... as well as additional information and some of that has been made public but the one of these guys pulled me aside\nHe had a at an ongoing interest in skin Walker ranch and other mysteries related to it and he asked a asked me some questions about the ranch and then he said\nYou know we think that that guy de ... that are that his mystery with these missing people might be related to the phenomena at the ranch\nAnd I asked a couple of questions that didn't seem to have a real solid answer or not one that they would share with me\nBut the idea that the phenomenon that's been seen there which is sometimes playful and sometimes dangerous might be related to yours startled me and I don't know how you react to that but maybe it makes you uncomfortable or being associated with anything as weird as that but you're stuff's pretty weird too\nSo how would you rank this person's credibility and integrity on a topic like this\nUm I'd say this person that I'm Talking about knows more about it than anyone and I don't mean just in the military I mean\nAnyone uh he's this person has seen a lot of stuff that the the public has never seen so you know he he has a\nVery broad spectrum and a very broad knowledge base about what we would call paranormal including UFOs and alleged abductions and things of that sort so I don't know exactly how your a phenomena fit in with a larger picture but the idea that somebody has been looking at it is a I think that's pretty interesting\nThat's a wake up call I think so um\n[noise] so you know way back when we first started to talk about the ranch I really put an emphasis on that area to see if there was anything related to it just the parents that I could think my teeth into they can relate it to the activity there\nAnd you know there's really nothing around that ranch that I could say is related to missing people that I study but ethics seated before sometimes I think\nI I relate it to law enforcement and if you have a say a series of bank robberies\nBank robbers are ever going to do it\nBank robbery in their neighborhood because they don't want to draw attention to it and I've always stated that I think that this is related to the profile points I I gave you one of those is water and when you look at Mississippi and Louisiana say it just filled with water\nI have no cases from there\nIt's bizarre\nAnd isn't George isn't there a lake fairly near that ranch\nYeah it's ... it's a reservoir it's called bottle hollow um it's manmade lake but the ones right in the middle of the ... reservation that you saw a control that property and they allow camping and fishing and swimming and things of that sort but\nAt the lake is a a ... has a long history of really weird stuff creatures have been seen there and objects coming in and out of the water in the ... that that they the ... tribe believes that uh there's something in the water that pulls you down a lot of people at Brown there and uh\nSo ... you're right I get asked all the time if there's anybody in the vicinity the ranch you meet your criteria who's banished like that and I have to say no\nOther than animals livestock things and that sort of but no people have a banished then I Know of of course we haven't really dug into the historical archives or to the extent that you have but I think that some of that work is being done right now\nAnyway it's uh it it was a it struck me as a significant that that the person who told me that in D.C had brought up your books and and your subject matter\nI Want to try to get one more of these air disappearances in before the bottom of the break because I I think I'm going to open up the phone lines you know people are going to want to
