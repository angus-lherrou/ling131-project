{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KNST", "content": "And so it seems to me that there has been a space force all ready for a long time and that space force serve the dual purpose I mean it can make\nA the defense of earth against other earthlings\nI'm much stronger but at the same time you're defending perhaps all earthlings from some kind of outside potential for invasion\nAnd I think that even if you are listening to this show tonight and you believe that there are aliens or ... or however you want to describe them\nThat are coming here and you think they must be good because if they weren't good they would have destroyed is already if you're in charge of the military\nIf your job is to be suspicious\nIf your job is to protect the people of your country then why would you take a chance and say okay well maybe these beings are benevolent but still why don't we do with ever we can to have whatever we can muster together in place just in case\nYou need to send ourselves because they have a change of heart or they've been deceiving us better to be\nSafe than sorry right\nWhy sure you know and and we it might be Utah I'll I mean you would think that it would be that if the if there are beings out there that are coming here that are are so advanced that they um they they ... you know would otherwise destroy is\nAh if you know if if that was their plan but on you know here's this is getting dark this is this is very dark but I honestly this is a a logical point of view what if George\n... if they were going to come back here these beings that ancient alien a theorists talk about talk about this kind of thing many times on the History Channel [noise] um if they they come back and they want to and slave us again\nBecause a lot of people believe especially if you look at like Zacharias ... work and all that that they came here and modified our our genetics in our DNA to enslave us and treat us as minors for gold or whatever if their goal is to come back here and in slave us it might be a better fate for\nUs to commit to global suicide in other words and again I told you this is going to be dark what if a lot of these governments actually have some kind of plan in place where they say rather than have these beings come back\nAnd put you know colors on us and and work us like animals we hit these buttons and we just annihilate ourselves spooky but what if that's the case\nSo do stay button basically\nAnd and that the idea is that we're not necessarily as concerned about each other as we are about the force from outside and you're going back to Ronald Reagan\nI'm I'm sure you recall that kind of eerie comment that he made a one of his speeches I Believe it might have been before the un you know if what if there was an alien threat [laughter]\nYou know what did he really mean by that you know he was he was just being facetious to try to talk to people about banning together or does he really knows something at the time\nBut when you look back at all of these people who have made deathbed confessions who are related to Roswell and um you know the whole suspicion that surrounds researchers to this day who goes snooping a little too much and digging a little too deep I mean there is something\nTo this idea that we may be up against potentially a some visitors here if you want to call them visitors they call them are just as easily invaders but there may be some some ah beings\nThat we have got to do our best to defend against\nAnd they're using space time manipulating technology\nIn order to completely I'm Out maneuver anything that we can do and so once we see it possible examples like I'm perhaps presenting ...\nMaybe now we humans are experimenting with some stuff\nSadly enough weaponry which also may have a space time manipulating effect\nUh this could be a particularly worrisome for those beings if they say okay we made a little trade off we gave them a few little nuggets of wisdom but boy the the the earthlings are run with it and so we need to put them back in their place\nJosh tell us about your event coming up in October\nThis month yeah fake it which this Saturday it's October the thirteenth

... with you again I'm going to give you a little Halloween trivia here Halloween is an annual holiday ... celebrated each year on October thirty first it originated with the ancient Celtic festival of Saddam Hussein when people would light bonfires and work costumes to ward off ghosts\nAnd the evening before was known as all Hallows eve and then later Halloween there's an interesting Josh\n[noise] yeah it absolutely is I mean that it goes back thousands of years\nAnd um I I think Fallon was the original pronunciation and they would talk about this being a period of time with them or if\nThey were really you know reaping the reward them harvest but preparing for the call the month of winter and so they believe that as the world was sort of transitioning\nInto the cold dead time that there was a period where the the bill was so thin in fact the Europeans often talk about what they call in places the boundary with soaked in between where we are and where the spirits are that we can encounter each other\nAt least one or two nights and ... and interact with each other and the good part was well some of your loved ones might come through but then there were also all of these creepy evil being sticking through and so you'd you'd wear a mask so do you blend in with even ones and they'd be like oh you're one of us\nYou know and and they they wouldn't harm you but from a more um I I think updated point of view George this also happens to be the time of year when a here in our part of the world\nThe earth is shifting away from the sun and so uh that means not only does it get you know colder and darker as we tilt into that mysterious back a black void of space\nBut furthermore uh we are not being as a strongly bombarded\nBy the the radiation coming from the sun\nAnd therefore subtle things\nThat might otherwise have been sort of brown doubt and the noise of the sons radiation could pop a little more so for example let's say a eyes shine a flashlight at towards you outside on a bright sunny day\nWhile you're not going to notice that as much as you would if I did it on a dark night right and so what happens in\nGeneral but it's still there but it's still there it's still there but it's just not as prominent and noticeable so this is\nThe time of year when we shift away from the sun and a lot of these subtle energies electromagnetic electro static and otherwise that are associated with these spirits another paranormal entities are suddenly more distinctive\nAnd a play more of a significant role in in our awareness and of course we're we're also enhancing this because we're we're paying more attention and we're looking out for it more\nLet's take some calls here with Josh as we continue chatting I Want to ask you about Robert The hunted all in a moment let's go to Charles first time caller in Asheville North Carolina hey Charles\nGo ahead you're with us no\nHe's not let's get John and Virginia Beach Virginia try hey John go ahead\nGeorge gosh um I wouldn't tell a story that after they back in the nineties\nYou know I I never believed in ... spirits UFOs eighties and things of that ... however that Nineteen leaders middle nineties I had an uncle had passed away and they were having a little show this point in the church\nAnd I was in that close to him but I just said you know any way I Am I went I was late getting as so I had to sit in the back of the church was packed and services going on and all of a sudden I felt some somebody standing behind me behind one of the pushing the check\nAnd I looked up and it was my uncle\nHad just passed a lay low and and he\nTold me he said John that your car and I wish I was shocked I didn't know what to do and then he again said jammed don't ... your car when I was so scared I had to get out of there so I got up late and what he was gone but still you know I knew something\nAnd so I got her at a friend of mine in the next morning I called my cousin which was the son and it has to wait and asking the TV and then when you're not clear to me and I get him right back home he said not at all so he and his belt and got my car\nToo many cage for them that anyway he got in my car when they pull that that ... ...\nAnd they were hit by a truck and they they weren't killed but they were extremely you know injured hurt I mean they had ... votes in mind that too but I never told me like this I was really a lot to say anything that is what I did tell\nTwo of my close friends and I'm Out of the way they're not that I was sure they have the ... I\nGuess you know up until now I hadn't told\nMe in the in the morning was just not to be in that car as opposed to you driving the car\nYou know well I didn't want to do that and he told me down and\nWhat you didn't think it would carry on to them no no no that was\nThe idea that they would be ... in my car but they were ... they weren't killed but that was a ... and ... like a ... you get all the same thing is for them to have seen\nJosh why does spirits come across like that in warn you\nYeah well you know John ... thank you for that that's a great call and it I Believe represents one of the most interesting aspects of the spiritual realm [noise]\nYou know scientist who are the smartest folks among us right now who where are you know the astrophysicist a cosmologist a quantum physicist they're telling us\nThat we have the mathematical models we have the experimental data to prove that all time is happening at once at least on this particular time line that the past the president and the future are all happening at once the problem is that we humans are\nSpirits in the material world it's like the song by the police\nAnd so when you are spirit trapped here in this material body you're only able to process what's happening on the timeline little by little a minute by minute hour by hour a day by day week by week and so on\nBut once you are no longer in this body it seems like you're able to have an awareness of things that extend far beyond what we physical or physically incarnate as humans call the presidents and so it would make perfect sense that if you have a loved one\nEspecially one who has recently passed into the spiritual realm\nThat person may be astounded by the fact that he or she can now see\nThe future to a degree that you cannot or it might almost be like comparing the perspective of an app to the ... to the perspective of an eagle ah they're both physical beings but they just have a different point of view and and when the eagles way up high he can see the storms\nThat are coming that the aunt can't see but the answer's more sensitive to what's happening on on a lower level\nSo anyway all that said your relatives or friends or loved ones who passed over my definitely be able to see beyond the scope of the temporary situation\nAnd see somewhat into the future and that would certainly be great motivation for them to come and give you a warning and in this case John and it seems like that's the most likely thing that happened to you\nAny updates with Robert de haunted dull Josh\n[noise] you know Robert at this point lives like a king and and and this is very funny because\nYou still ...\nYeah yeah I mean I I haven't seen him in a while now but Robert I think really became famous or some would say infamous as Robert\nBecause that a lot of people were sort of a chiding him and uh I don't want to use the word abusing him but basically there\nThey were taking about and cathartic Lee releasing their pent up frustrations on him\nAnd it was when the shock wave of curses and bad luck started hitting all those people that suddenly word began to spread like okay this goal here and you know\nRobert was fighting back\nYeah and it's because of that that um he I Believe now is so famous because the word has now spread for so long that if you go to see how\nYou have to be respectful people now take it seriously and I don't think that there are nearly as many people who are going to see him now who are having bad experiences or even\nThe paranormal experiences because he seems to be at peace and I I think it's in part\nEncourage the anarchy in the face of from Congress the officers be confirmed them all to the Supreme Court is\nPaying their tea am seven Ninety two sides most\nMocks News I'm Paul Stevens' borders on guard for tropical storm Michael likely becoming a hurricane by mid week Florida governor Rick Scott\nFamilies should take this opportunity to get three days of food and water and make sure all medications already check on your neighbors\nAnd listen to local officials Michael ... big wins that sixty miles an hour about Ninety five miles east southeast are positive male Mexico confirms Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh heading into his first week on the high court with many Democrats still angry after a bitter confirmation process\nGoing to be on the Supreme Court with his whole big after after her role and that they showed a wise I found out or they are a very ...

I perfectly\nAnd he's looking at me and I start mouth and they continue mop like okay this kind of eerie any pushing pretty hard and so I was wondering\nIt seems like since I've been working there for about a month like you think it's maybe around October is that we're in the spirit to really show theirselves or and he wasn't\nSupposed to be there was\nI I don't think so I talked to the in a in a couple of the nurses and they told me\nThat they everyone who goes in there by their cell or maybe two or three people that they feel like someone to watching them and I was just wondering might huh Josh or what do you guys think to like it seems to me is October 'cause it's not a full moon cause of the full moon I could tell you what it gets really crazy around the hospital for whatever reason\nHuh do you know the little boy died there\nYou know I asked them and they sent from what we understand no loans have died there but they said we don't know a full history\nOf ... what do you think Josh\n[noise] well ... thank you for that call and yes I think that this time of year has more prominent paranormal activity for at least three reasons\nReason number one goes back to what I was saying earlier in the show about the earth tilting away from the sun and subtle energy fields being magnified or at least being more perceptive ... so that's that's number one number two is that here again in our part of the world and the northern hemisphere\nMost places have a colder drier environment and I know that's certainly the case in Utah\nSo that means there is a larger build up of electro static charges so when you lay down at night and you pull your sheets up you might see those little blue sparks flying around the similar to when you're drag your socks on the carpet and touched the door knob\nAnd there is a definite relationship between enhanced electro static charge and the ability for paranormal phenomenon to materialize and interact\nOr in my laboratory over the years I've been able to reproduce many of the things\nThat people talk about when they encounter the paranormal using electromagnetic charges such as creating Loomis life forms making objects move without any visible source or creating the sensation of a cold spot or a cold when when they call it an eye on when\nI'm making your hair stand on end these are all things that you can do artificially with electro static charge and yet\nWhen you go to these places where people are often experiencing extreme paranormal phenomena you\nFind that there are these very strong electro static anomalies in the area so there's some connection there\nRegarding how that the non physical realm of the spiritual might be able to temporarily interact with the physical realm\nAnd that reminds me of how something like a magnet has this invisible field around that that creates a physical effect but then the third and final point of course is that\nThis time of year we're talking about it more I mean you go to the store you see all of these things that remind you of the paranormal spooky the afterlife you see it all on\nYou see the movies coming out and so you combined those three things together and certainly it means that again at least here in the United states\nThis is the time of year when we have the higher likelihood of experiencing something go sleep spooky creepy paranormal or at very least metaphysical\nAnd Josh don't you get energized during this time of the year for some reason\n[noise] well I Do and I think you know part of that goes back to the fact that you know I was born this month and so you know that's always been a time a celebration my mom and dad have always been fantastic people have always been a really cool arranging nice things for me and growing up in western North Carolina\nUh especially of Asheville when when the leaves are splashed with color and everybody that becoming very festive um it's a great reflection of that original celebrate tore mood\nFrom the old world in fact so many people of Scots Irish descent came into the mountains of western North Carolina because they found them familiar\nThat are on every single genealogist I've ever talked to says there are more people of for example Scottish dissent in North Carolina then there are in Scotland\nAnd uh we should remember that the very first attempt at an English Settlement with in North Carolina on the coast at a place called Roanoke Island\nAnd they all vanish so we now know that today is one of history of the greatest mystery the ah last calling me and so I was born in the area that had um an enormous amount of influence\nFrom the early you know Scots Irish who originated these ideas about celebrating fell on Halloween and so that combined with my birthday makes me very excited and I'm sure contributed to the fact that ah I Love this time of year\nThirty seconds or give us your uh been again one more time\nOr I go to Joshua pie Warren dot com has no period

haunted rock and roll that was a classic mad welcome back to the program\nThank you very much for having me on\nVery background hot as a journalist get involved in the unusual in the paranormal\nWell the simple answer was I was born that\nWay on Halloween or yeah yeah oh happy birthday coming up\nYeah thank you very much so that really kind of started my interest in it I don't ever remember a time where I wasn't interested in ghost stories horror movies and uh like so I just learned uh I I never really wrote about it until I started to work as a reporter\nAnd uh every Halloween I Would try to write a a a feature story a Halloween feature story and so I started to write a story about um local ghosts legends around the area where I was born\nAnd ah the reaction to that story was so overwhelming that I thought well there's really something here and so since then I've I've combined my interest in history and folklore and go stories and just kind of combined them altogether\nDid your birthday cut into Halloween or didn't Halloween cut into your birthday when you\nKnow it it sort of a made my birthday ex financial I refer to it as the season of Matt now [laughter] I Love it\nDid last year I Love this quarter October November December it's it is the best\nAbsolutely in how did you get your interest in World War two\nWell I after I wrote you know I wrote three books about a music in the supernatural and at a certain point I wanted to uh find another project to to play with my publisher and initially I thought I I I'm you know to be completely transparent I consider myself more of a civil war geek\nUm but I started to look around at writing a civil war book but what I found is that there's just so many so much good stuff out there already\nA and that people have compiled a numerous books so I didn't think I could really add anything to that area of ah of ghost stories in the supernatural\nSo I just started I turn towards a World War two uh and started to uh research whether there were any ghost stories and and sure enough there were there were plenty of good stories that I could compile in a way that I I like to do it I like to do I like to couple ghost stories with\nYou know tales of secret in cities and and forty entails so a haunted World War two it turned into be just a really a deep area for me to explore and that's that's kind of what I like to do\nAny harm to the world war two were these ghost stories and the vents from World war one that overlapped in World War two or with these things happening during the second war\nSo most of the stories that I I compile our stories from World war two not between the wars\nAnd and they occur they continue to occur believe it or not\nWhat creates the difference between these kinds of ghost stories I Would call the military on things as opposed to regular\n[noise] that that's a that's a great question because um [noise] you know\nMost of the stories that I wrote about before a university ... stories haunted rock and roll ghost stories of country music there was there sort of a light hearted aspect of the stories compared to what I found myself into when I started to research the world war two go slower\nUm and I think when you're dealing with war and warriors and victims of of\nAtrocities and World War two probably set a new standard and violence and atrocities so there is a deep seriousness about the material and I really want to honor the sacrifices especially from the soldiers and sailors Marines\nUh you know when you're dealing with this these acts of Vail valor on on Normandy and\nYou know uh all of those stories you want to make sure that your your ah honoring or what they they brought or the other thing that I found a little different when I started to research hunted World War two was that um\n[noise] you know you want to make sure that you get the history right a history serves as a backdrop for a lot of these stories\nAnd I think go stories are are one way that people help preserve the past\nBut sometimes they're not perfect into history so what I found myself doing is a lot of times is is uh finding these ghost stories and then trying to confirm to make sure that history was correct a you know I've been I've never looked for whether a\nA ... or was available to German troops in ... during the Normandy invasion but\nYou know I found myself looking looking at those types of details so I think those are two reasons why the these stories are a lot different from the stories that I worked on before\nWhat isn't Matthew about the battlefield that seems to enhance the stories\nIn and they could be anywhere they could be I had um a friend who just went to the little the corn oh we're customs last stand ones and you know he's convinced that's haunted to Gettysburg we know is going to write and sure there are other battlefields that are but what is it about war\nThat creates these auntie does it because sadly enough these Soldiers Die so suddenly and they just still hang around what what's going on there\nYeah there there are a lot of theories about why battlefield seemed to attract these ... more so than than other places um [noise]\nAnd and they're essentially two camps on this so you have on one hand you have the paranormal theorists and they said that this ... in in one case a they say that this violence and trauma of war ah causes these um\nAlmost in the event almost in beds itself in time and space it gets repeated over and over so that kind of explains what they would consider residual ... now on the other hand there there are some of the arrests that also say that you know\nThe shock of war happens so quick that maybe people have a hard time transitioning maybe their spirits have a hard time transitioning from one plane to the next that's that's the other theory now there's a whole skeptical side of this too and what\nThe skeptics would suggest is that because these areas are profoundly moving emotionally when you talk about the sacrifice when you talk about\nThe death and the tragedy that it raises your consciousness that maybe you mistake normal ah activity normal phenomena for paranormal phenomena so those seem to be the main theories behind why these battlefields are so haunted\nUse their own specific battlefield that you would say is the most ...\nI think the consensus wise I Would say ah Normandy is extremely haunted um there's\nJust doesn't stories are especially in it might be because there are a lot of tourists are that are visiting that area and so a lot of this tourists there documenting what happens but the bunkers the fortifications uh seem to be haunted one of the stories that I found a particularly interesting\nWas that a\nA father and daughter visited the battlefield\nAnd that's part of France for people who don't know where it is\nYeah Normandy, France uh and uh the the\nFather and the daughter visited the Normandy peaches and we're exploring some of the fortifications and went into a bunker and when the daughter and and father said that when they came out of the bunkers ... they didn't really talk too much about it but then later\nThe daughter said that when she was in there she solve these figures are these people actually in the bunker somewhere laying down somewhere looking out the window and then she started to describe their uniforms and the father who was a World War two buff\nImmediately ... a recognized these uniforms is German uniforms\nAnd later he decided he wouldn't press the issue on a writer right away but then later he talks to her and he brought out a book of weaponry and and uniforms in and asked her to look through it and identify what she saw\nAnd he claims that she had no access to any World War two history books she truck he tried to keep that away from her because she was so young but then she began to describe the guns that were there the uniforms that were there and they all matched or what could have been\nIn that bunker at that time so you do have stories like that from a pretty credible sources that they've had these experiences in Normandy and that certainly wasn't the only one that happened in those bunkers\nThe other place that uh I talked to a German goes tonner and his name's Tom put do and he told me that uh he investigated the art dance battlefield which is in in Germany or near Germany\nForty nine the motion is agreed to\nEncourage anarchy in the face of them were seen as an officer reconfirmed them all to the Supreme Court is\nPaying their tea am

I didn't want to leave our our sailors out\nNo nine years maybe for me so let's not leave aside well\nYeah I'm going to make sure I have those in there so the interesting thing about uh after World War two was you had these battleships\nYou had ... ah aircraft carriers and they were engaged in so many activities so much a honor that ah those sailors served in that it was a shame to just got all them or to reduce them to scrap but luckily for us a lot of um\nPeople got into preserving those um ships those aircraft carriers and his battleships as living museums and they brought him back to different ports and and also when they brought him back to these ports\nThey brought a lot of a ghost stories with them and and some of the ones that I collected the USS Yorktown which is now in Charleston Harbor\nUm there's a lot of activity or a witness their shadow figure is probably one of the ones they call them shadow ed and Ed's stands for enemy designated ...\nWas a World War two term for when you come in contact with the enemy\nOr there's some pretty dramatic stories of ghost hunters chasing the shadow creature around the the carrier USS Hornet I think is probably one of the most documented\nA ship based a haunted sites are there there\nIs a story about a man dressed in white naval uniform who uh wanders around the deck some of the battle ships the USS North Carolina I worked with a\nUh a few a paranormal investigator from Port city paranormal and they basically told me they they have a career documenting the ... on there\nUm and of course we mentioned USS Arizona oh those are and there there are a lot more I was finding them even as a I was starting to publish this book so yeah there are a lot of World War two ships are on it and I'm just glad that they preserved um and have him back here ghosts and all\nJust an amazing series of events that have been happening that seemed\nTo all of a similarity in that has to do with tragedy\n... for some reason tragedy makes these go ... or whatever we want to call them hang around don't you think\nYeah I mean absolutely that seems to be the one common element\nOf uh you know all the not just the ghosts of World War two but uh when you talk about haunted rock and roll which I investigated and even some of the ghost stories of of country these tragedies just seem to linger it's like either the spirit doesn't want to let go uh somehow this is a a\nInteraction between consciousness of reality or maybe they were just so primed um to to when we hear these tragedies to maybe hope that that uh the spirits go on or the spiritual anger there's probably a lot of different reasons for that those are just some of the ones that I've come across\nOur special guest of course is Matthew ... we're going to take calls next hour with him stories and questions of course and the let's get into when we come back also after the break Matthew a little bit of euro haunted rock and roll stories those are those are fantastic too\nI Love them that's one of my favorites\nAnd they just keep coming more and more and more they just never stopped like you know people like Michael Jackson who passed on now when prince and folks like that have they come back you up to a ... as a ghost\nWell there are definitely go stories about Michael Jackson uh there were a few video anomalies\nWhen a when I Believe his brother I Believe it

'cause he was was also interested in the cold did you come across anything that the dealt with that\nYou know I did and I came away with a little bit of a different\nPerspective about Hitler in the cold\nAh you know initially I thought that Hitler was a a cult practitioner throughout his life but what I found through my research and this is pretty controversial and I'm sure there will people have\nHave different ideas and I'd be glad to entertain those thoughts too but it sounds like Hitler's early\nA philosophy was influenced by\nA cult groups like the whole society in the ... society very prevalent in a pre World War two Germany in that area\nBut what I think happened was that Hitler was of all things are not in a coal theorists but more of an incredible sociopathic nurse assistant I don't think he could think\nThat there was any type of power a worthy of him I think he thought he was the ultimate power and that the state was the ultimate power and so what you see later is that a Hitler begins to purge a lot of it is a cult groups he starts to go after fortune tellers\nAnd astrologers so I came away with a little bit of a different opinion on the cold in in Nazi Germany uh likewise I was sort of fascinated that the cult played a much bigger role in my opinion a among uh\nThe side of the allied side so there were\nThe wiccan in England who uh try to get together to uh spiritually or go after the Nazi regime they held um meetings and the ... got together with the express purpose of trying to to stop 'em\nGermany from invading England and likewise uh and I really picked us up from a frequent guest on coast to coast Mitch or with\nUh the allied a new thought ...\nA movement those a lot of the practitioners for that group were very involved and to try and use\nSpiritual techniques a cult techniques to stop Hitler from uh from succeeding so those were a different ways that a ... you know when I tried to write a book I'm I'm really I Know a lot of people write books because they know a lot I like to learn a lot\nSo I go into a some of these stories with really preconceived notions\nAnd then as I delve into it I find twists and turns that that I tried to bring out uh in in the book\nNow in your stories on haunted rock and roll told me the theme about those\n[noise] well the theme about haunted rock and roll is\nThat I'm really when I started writing hunter rock and roll and again another I listen to our Gary Patterson on your show many times ah and ah\nYou know I started to investigate and what I thought initially was that rock and roll had this special cult power and maybe people that were into the Cold War attracted to it\nBut after writing the country book and then revisiting rock and roll for more on a rock and roll what a ... a ... I came away with is the thought that\nMusic is really just to consciousness raising tool it's used in just about every religious service are out there it's also a key part of a lot of um historical movements like the civil rights movement there's something special about music that I Believe raises the consciousness\nOf both the listener and and the musician\nThat I think makes either people more open to things like the supernatural the cult or maybe a you know actually can kind of promote these these types of powers in these types of of of visions so that's really the theme that kind of runs through all of those book in my opinion\nWell that's pretty dramatic stuff and like we were talking earlier the current rock stars that his needed a haven't shown up yet but they will I think eventually don't you\n... yeah I sometimes this is a matter of what I find is that it's a matter of\nThese stories in these tales in the supernatural usually start out than to than musician to musician a person the witnesses it\nTalks to another friend and then for me it usually bubbles up on line and blog posts and then uh newspapers will investigate I'll look into it goes counters will be attracted to the site\nSo it takes a while I'm I'm Still waiting for some good ghost stories about David Bowie for example\nJames Dean of course died young in a car accident and was in his car chopped up into little pieces and they sold the parts and apparently they were haunted\n[noise] yeah that's a ... the name of his car yeah he um he had a car it was a poor spider uh wasn't involved in Iraq and then\nA pieces of it because it wasn't really a race car um pieces of it were salvaged and I know there's one story about um a a one race car driver used a piece in his car and a car fell on them and I think crushed him to death\nBelieve it or not there's a parallel to that in the haunted World War two book there was a\nI think it was a beat twenty four the crash landed in the desert of North Africa pieces of it were recovered are that are now in the national I think air force a museum a and\nPieces of that plane were report it to be cursed in that uh I think some of the pieces went went into a\nA a a plane that later crashed I think a couple of planes crashed based on and so so there is a connection\nAll right let's take some calls here for you Matthew let's pick it up by going to Frank in Hollywood, Maryland to get us started any Frank\nYou're back with you when you made any subject India I I I I think you know they somehow think at the a and a and not the Nazi Germany but what about\nA remote places where the Jewish people were murdered by by not a I once saw a film where they were just shot three hundred shot down over it and they knew that they were shot down\nA credible a bell was found\nAnd I'm Wondering if any any hunting and in a remote places where you're not you're not take my answer off\nAir okay ...\nThanks for that that's a that's a great question and I believe I Know exactly which\nWhich footage you're talking about and believe it or not one of the stories that I came across a is I think from that area because I I Believe that might have been taken in Poland Czechoslovakia\nAnd there are stories about some of the victims of the Jewish victims of those atrocities\nUm that still hunters areas again I I I found out of a difference for those those people that I Would leave them out of the book and and wouldn't try to\nTry to um you know they looked at like I was making any money from that so I I left that out but yeah definitely those stories crop up\nAnd I guarantee you if you were in those areas you would find a lot of go slower a lot of folklore and a lot of good stories about those places\nNot stop we go to Charles ...

a bit suspicious but no honestly what I was doing as I said I have this new piece of technology I'm going to take it to a certain place I don't think I said we're of course that plays turned out to be here is if the one [noise] Las Vegas outside of Las Vegas Nevada\nAnd um I I I sort of gave everybody a heads up and then when I found something that surprised me\nUm it went viral I mean I I made international news with this discovery it was a Newsweek inside edition and ABC NBC CBS Fox News media in Russia China basically I discovered some type of a space time anomaly\nLas Vegas and area fifty one at this nondescript site on the side of the road out in the desert and it turns out that that is one of the most extreme UFO hot spots in the state were incredible footage has been shot of UFOs we're close encounters have occurred\nI'm much stronger but at the same time you're defending perhaps all earthlings from some kind of outside potential for invasion\nAnd I think that even if you are listening to this show tonight and you believe that there are aliens or ... or however you want to describe them\nThat are coming here and you think they must be good because if they weren't good they would have destroyed is already if you're in charge of the military\nIf your job is to be suspicious if your job is to protect the people of your country\nThen why would you take a chance and say okay well maybe these beings are benevolent but still why don't we do with ever we can to have whatever we can muster together in place just in case\nYou don't you need to send ourselves because they have a change of heart or they've been deceiving them to be safe than sorry right\nWhy sure you know and and we it might be Utah I'll I mean you would think that it would be that if the if there are beings out there that are coming here that are are so advanced that they um they they ... you know would otherwise destroy is\nAh if you know if if that was their plan but on you know here's this is getting dark this is this is very dark but I honestly this is a a logical point of view what if George\n... if they were going to come back here these beings that ancient alien a theorists talk about talk about this kind of thing many times on the History Channel [noise] um if they they come back and they want to enslave us again\nBecause a lot of people believe especially if you look at like Zacharias ... work and all that that they came here\nAnd modified our our genetics in our DNA to enslave us and treat us as minors for gold or whatever\nIf their goal is to come back here and in slavery was it might be a better fate for us to commit global suicide in other words and again I told you this is going to be dark what if a lot of these governments actually have some kind of plan in place where they say rather than have these beings come back\nAnd put you know colors on us and and work like animals we hit these buttons and we just annihilate ourselves\nSpooky but what if that's the case so do stay button basically\nAnd an end to the idea is that we're not necessarily as concerned about each other as we are about the force from outside and going back to Ronald Reagan\nI'm I'm sure you recall that kind of eerie comment that he made a one of his speeches I Believe it might have been before the un you know what if there was an alien threat [laughter]\nWhat did he really mean by that you know he was he was just being facetious to try to talk to people banding together or does he really knew something at the time\nWhen you look back at all of these people who have made deathbed confessions who are related to Roswell and um you know the whole suspicion that surrounds researchers to this day who goes snooping a little too much and digging a little too deep I mean there is something\nTo this idea\nThat we may be up against potentially a some visitors here if you want to call them visitors they call them are just as easily invaders but there may be some some ah beings\nThat we have got to do our best to defend against\nAnd they're using space time manipulating technology in order to completely I'm Out maneuver anything that we can do and so once we see\nIs it possible examples like I'm perhaps preventing that maybe now we humans are experimenting with some stuff\nSadly enough weaponry which also may have a space time manipulating affect\nAh this could be a particularly worrisome for those beings if they say okay we made a little trade off we gave them if you little nuggets of wisdom but boy the the the earthlings are run with it and so we need to

I guess you know up until now I hadn't told\nMe in the in the morning was just not to be in that car as opposed to you driving the\nCar yeah well I didn't want to do that and he told me down and\nWhat you didn't think it would carry on to them no no no that was the\nIdea that the end you get my car but they were ... they weren't killed but that was a she only time I ever encountered anything like a safe ... you get all the same thing it's for them they're seen\nJosh why does spirits come across like that in more than you\nYeah well you know John ... thank you for that that's a great call and it I Believe represents one of the most interesting aspects of the spiritual realm [noise]\nYou know scientist who are the smartest folks among us right now who are uh you know the astrophysicist a cosmologist a quantum physicist they're telling us\nThat we have the mathematical models we have the experimental data to prove that all time is happening at once at least on this particular time line that the past the president and the future are all happening at once the problem is that we humans are\nSpirits in the material world it's like the song by the police\nAnd so when you are spirit trapped here in this material body you're only able to process what's happening on the timeline little by little a minute by minute hour by hour a day by day week by week and so on\nBut once you are no longer in this body it seems like you're able to have an awareness of things that extend far beyond what we physical or physically incarnate as humans call the presidents and\nSo it would make perfect sense that if you have a loved one\nEspecially one who has recently passed into the spiritual realm\nThat person may be astounded by the fact that he or she can now see\nThe future to a degree that you cannot or it might almost be like comparing the perspective of an app to the ... to the perspective of an eagle ah they're both physical beings but they just have a different point of view and then when the eagles way up high he can see the storms\nThat are coming that the aunt can't see but the answer's more sensitive to what's happening on on a lower level\nSo anyway all that said your relatives or friends or loved ones who Passover might definitely be able to see beyond the scope of the temporary situation\nAnd see somewhat into the future and that would certainly be great motivation for them to come and give you a warning and in this a case John and it seems like that's the most likely thing that happened to you\nAny updates with Robert de haunted dull Josh\n[noise] you know Robert at this point lives like a king and and and this is very funny because he still does ...\nYeah yeah I mean I I haven't seen him in a while now but Robert I think really became famous or some would say infamous as Robert\nBecause that a lot of people were sort of a chiding him and uh I don't want to use the word abusing him but basically there\nThey were taking him out and ... releasing their pent up frustrations on him\nAnd it was when the shock wave of curses and bad luck started hitting all those people that suddenly word began to spread like okay this is all here and you know\nRobert was fighting back\nYeah and it's because of that that\nUm he I Believe now is so famous because the word has now spread for so long that if you go to see how\nYou have to be respectful people now take it seriously and I don't think that there are nearly as many people who are going to see him now who are having bad experiences or even paranormal experiences because he seems to be at peace and I think it's in part\nBlanc mixture you break out all our great tailgate party playlists whether you're at home or the stadium and knew I our Radio Free ... collection that come out\nRadio annually and Lou a ceremonial swearing in tonight for Supreme Court justice Brett\nKavanaugh officially justice capital has already been seated by chief justice Roberts but tonight in Seventy on President troubled much more public swearing in ceremony and the East Room of the White House ...\nDemocrats help voters frustrated by the bitter confirmation battle will turn up at the polls during the mid term election\nAnd majority leader Mitch McConnell says the momentum in the midterm says shifted to Republicans\nThe oil rich of the protesters at the Capitol actually energize the Republican base\nThe NTSB investigating a deadly limit crash in ...

I perfectly and\nHe's looking at me and I start mouth and they continue mop like okay this kind of eerie any ... would be pretty hard and so I was wondering\nIt seems like since I've been working there for about a month like he think it's maybe around October is that we're in the spirit to really show theirselves\nAnd he wasn't supposed to be there was ...\nI I don't think so I talked to see in a in a couple of the nurses and they told me\nThat they everyone who goes in there by their cell or maybe two or three people they feel like someone watching them and I was just wondering like huh Josh or what do you guys think 'cause like it seems to me is October 'cause it's not a full moon because of the full moon I can tell you what it gets really crazy around the hospital for whatever reason\nHow do you know a little boy died there\nYou know I asked them and they sent from what we understand no one's died there but they said we don't know a full history\nOf the ways in hospital where do you think Josh\nWe'll call thank you for that call and yes I think that this time of year has more prominent paranormal activity for at least three reasons\nReason number one goes back to what I was saying earlier in the show about the earth tilting away from the sun and subtle energy fields being magnified or at least being more perceptive ... so that's that's number one number two is that here again in our part of the world in the northern hemisphere\nMost places have a colder drier environment and I know that's certainly the case in Utah\nSo that means there is a larger build up of electro static charges so when you lay down at night and you pull your sheets up you might see those little blue sparks flying around the similar to when you're drag your socks on the carpet and touched the door knob\nAnd there is a definite relationship between enhanced electro static charge\nAnd the ability for paranormal phenomenon to materialize and interact\nOr in my laboratory over the years I've been able to reproduce many of the things\nThat people talk about when they encounter the paranormal using electromagnetic charges such as creating luminous life forms making objects move without any visible source or creating the sensation of a cold spot or a cold wind where they call an eye on when\nI'm making your hair stand on end these are all things that you can do artificially with electro static charge and yet\nWhen you go to these places where people are often experiencing extreme paranormal phenomena you find that there are these very strong electro static anomalies in the area so there's some connection there\nRegarding how that the non physical realm of the spiritual might be able to temporarily interact with the physical realm\nAnd that reminds me of how something like a magnet has this invisible filled around at that creates a physical effects but then the third and final point of course is that\nThis time of year we're talking about it more I mean you go to the store you see all of these things that remind you of the paranormal spooky the afterlife\nYou see it all on TV you see the movies coming out and so you combine those three things together and certainly it means that again at least here\nIn the United states this is the time of year when we have the higher likelihood of experiencing something go sleep spooky creepy paranormal or at very least metaphysical\nAnd Josh don't you get energized during this time of the year for some reason\n[noise] well I Do and I think you know part of it goes back to the fact that you know I was born this month and so you know that's always been a time a celebration my mom and dad have always been fantastic people have always been really cool arranging nice things for me and growing up in western North Carolina\nUh especially of Asheville when when the leaves are splashed with color and everybody that becoming very best to um it's a great reflection of that original celebrate tore mood\nFrom the old world in fact so many people of Scots Irish descent came into the mountains of western North Carolina because they found them familiar\nThat ah I every single genealogist I've ever talked to says there are more people of for example Scottish dissent in North Carolina then there are in Scotland\nAnd uh we should remember that the very first attempt at an English Settlement with in North Carolina on the coast\nAt a place called Roanoke Island and they all vanished so we now know that today is one of history of the greatest mystery the ah last calling me and so I was born in the area that had um an enormous amount of influence\nFrom the early you know Scots Irish who originated these ideas about celebrating Fallon and Halloween and so that combined with my birthday makes me very excited and I'm sure contributed to the fact that ah I Love this time of year\nThirty seconds or give us your ability to get more and more time\nOr I go to Joshua pie Warren dot com has no

at\nFringe science and the paranormal for the online magazine he uses his experience in journalism\nAnd his interest in both go slower and the paranormal to collect and tell stories all about the supernatural he was with us a couple of months ago with Richard talking about some haunted rock and roll that was a classic mad welcome back to the program\nThank you very much for having me on\nVery background hot as a journalist get involved in the unusual in the paranormal\nWell the simple answer was I was born that way\nOn Halloween or yeah yeah oh happy birthday coming up\nYeah thank you very much so that really kind of started my interest in it I don't ever remember a time where I wasn't interested in ghost stories horror movies and the like so I just learned uh I I never really wrote about it until I started to work as a reporter\nAnd uh every Halloween I Would try to write a a a feature\nStory a Halloween feature story and so I started to write a story about um local ghosts legends around the area where I was born\nAnd ah the reaction to that story was so overwhelming that I thought well there's really something here and so since then I've I've combined my interest in history and folklore and go stories and just kind of combined them altogether\nDid your birthday cut into Halloween or didn't Halloween cut into your birthday when you\nKnow it it sort of a made my birthday ex financial I refer to it as the season of Matt now\n[laughter] I Love it and getting off the ... corner October November December it's it is the best absolutely in how did you get your interest in World War two\nWell after I wrote you know I wrote three books about a music in the supernatural and at a certain point I wanted to uh find another project to place with my publisher and initially I thought I I I'm you know to be completely transparent I consider myself more of a civil war geek\nUm but I started to look around at writing a civil war book but what I found is that there's just so many so much good stuff out there already\nAre and that people have compiled a numerous books so I didn't think I could really add anything to that area of ah of ghost stories in the supernatural so I just started I turn towards a World War two uh and started to uh research whether there were any ghost stories and\nAnd sure enough there were there were plenty of good stories that I could compile in a way that I I like to do it I like to do I like to couple ghost stories with\nYou know tales of secret in cities and and forty entails so a haunted World War two it turned into be just a really a deep area for me to explore and that's that's kind of what I like to do\nAny harm to the world war two were these goals stories and events from World war one that overlapped in World War two or with these things happening during the second war\nSo most of the stories that I I compile our stories from World war two not between the wars\nAnd and they occur they continue to occur believe it or not\nWhat creates the difference between these kinds of ghost stories I Would call the military on teens as opposed to regular\n[noise] that that's a that's a great question because um [noise] you know\nMost of the stories that I wrote about before a university ... stories haunted rock and roll go stories of country music\nThere was there sort of a light hearted aspect of the stories compared to what I found myself into when I started to research the world war two go slower um and I think when you're dealing with war and warriors and victims of of\nAtrocities and World War two probably set a new standard and violence and atrocities so there is a deep seriousness about the material and I really want to honor the sacrifices especially from the soldiers and sailors Marines\nUh you know when you're dealing with this these acts of Vail valor on on Normandy and\nYou know uh all of those stories you want to make sure that your your ah honoring or what they they brought or the other thing that I found a little different when I started to research hunted World War two was that\nUm\n[noise] you know you want to make sure that you get the history right I'm history serves as a backdrop for a lot of these stories\nAnd I think ghost stories are are one way that people help preserve the past\nBut sometimes they're not perfect into history so what I found myself doing is a lot of times is is uh finding these ghost stories and then trying to confirm to make sure that history was correct a you know I've been I've never looked for whether a\nA ... or was available to German troops in ... during the Normandy invasion but you know I found myself looking looking at those types of details so I think those are two reasons why the these stories are a lot different from the stories that I worked on before\nWhat isn't Matthew about the battlefield that seems to enhance the stories\nIn and they could be anywhere they could be I had um a friend who just went to the little big corn or were customs last stand ones and you know he's convinced that's haunted to Gettysburg we know is that right I'm sure there are other battlefield that are but what is it about war\nThat creates these auntie does it because sadly enough these Soldiers Die so suddenly and they just still hang around what what's going on there\nYeah there there are a lot of theories about why battlefield seemed to attract these ... more so than than other places um and and they're\nEssentially is two camps on this so you have on one hand you have the paranormal theorists and they say that this uh in in one case a they say that this violence and trauma of war ah causes these\nUm almost in the event\nAlmost in beds itself in time and space it gets repeated over and over so that kind of explains what they would consider residual ... now on the other hand there there are some a theorist that also say that you know\nThe shock of war happens so quick that maybe people have a hard time transitioning maybe their spirits have a hard time transitioning from one plane to the next that's that's the other theory now there's a whole skeptical side of this too and what\nThe skeptics would suggest is that because these areas are profoundly moving emotionally when you talk about the sacrifice when you talk about\nThe death and the tragedy that it raises your consciousness that maybe you mistake normal ah activity normal phenomena for paranormal phenomena so those seem to be the main theories behind why these battlefields are so haunted\nIs there a specific battlefield that you would say is the most ...\nI think the consensus wise I Would say ah Normandy is extremely haunted um there's just doesn't stories\nAre especially in it might be because there are a lot of tourists are that are visiting that area and so a lot of this towards their documenting what happens but the bunkers the fortifications uh seem to be haunted one of the stories that I found a particularly interesting was that a\nA father and daughter visited the battlefield\nAnd that's part of France for people who don't know where it is\nRight yeah Normandy, France uh and\nUh the the father and the daughter visited\nThe Normandy peaches and we're exploring some of the fortifications and went into a bunker and when the daughter and and father said that when they came out of the bunker they they didn't really talk too much about it but then later\nThe daughter said that when she was in there she solve these figures are these people actually in the bunker somewhere laying down somewhere looking out the window and then she started to describe their uniforms and the father who was a World War two buff\nImmediately or recognize these uniforms is German uniforms\nAnd later he decided he wouldn't press the issue on a writer right away but then later he talks to her and he brought out a book of weaponry and and uniforms in and asked her to look through it and identify what she saw\nAnd he claims that she had no access to any World War two history books she truck he tried to keep that away from her because she was so young but then she began to describe\nThe guns that were there the uniforms that were there and they all matched or what could have been in that\nAt that time so you do have stories like that from a pretty credible sources that they've had these experiences in Normandy and that certainly wasn't the only one that happened in those bunkers\nThe other place that uh I talked to a German goes tonner and uh his name's Tom put do and he told me that uh he investigated the art dance battlefield which is in in Germany or near Germany\nThank you for your voice\nIs going to be a\nSeven Ninety years are going to be leading talk\nThey were heading to a
