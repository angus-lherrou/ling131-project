I mean it's kind of moment of that whole situation I don't think so I think the iconic moment is the one step for man that's another one yeah yeah I mean there's a couple yeah but um but we now uh now I have not seen the movie um but there's a couple of articles that are out talking about the flag and first of all the flags all over the movie\nI mean they they think insight you know Fifteen twenty examples of the flag all over the place in some of it is like the just the patch or yeah which would you kind of understand would be really obvious if they would not even only just that for example\nUh apparently they don't show them planting the flag into the moon however in the scene you can see the flag planted in the moon in the background was already been planted there and they show it somebody they're avoiding the flag they just don't have that moment not good enough what if those forty year old women or they're not like I said how to\nAgain there was there already is someone else comes and\nThey get there a couple of bottles or short innate you might not understand that but I mean are we not just the\nVictim here of of\nOf the budget the outrage it does not seem to be a thing no it most of it's not most of it now\nThis okay today there's a tweet from Donald Trump oh did he say something crazy of course they did is a tweet from Donald Trump today we're also talking about a war in Elizabeth Warren's Cherokee heritage\nWhy why he does this matter I mean you know again we have to Saudi Arabia thing going on that it's much more important I mean not to mention that we're going to hit a trillion dollars in debt again for this year\nAnother trillion dollars in debt there's no sign of that letting up despite the fact that we're in a good economy were were were popping out a trillion plus on the books when unemployment rate is almost at full employment\nWe're almost at the peak of our employment situation we are at a point where we are the stock market despite a couple of bad days this week a has been raging for a very long time\nA housing prices are up everything you know everything is ... pointing in the right direction and we're still throwing a trillion dollars on the fire\n[noise] I'm just put this up this new banner from CNN\nThe disappearance of journalists puts spotlight on Trump's business ties and that he is because candidate Trump talked about uh doing business with the Saudi Arabian yes he's talked about that for a very long my gosh are you kidding me now\nThat the only reason why they care about the Saudi Arabia and say forget about you forget about gas prices forget about the economy forget about the tech sector forget about all of that\nThis is just another way for them to talk about Donald Trump don't play that game just don't play that game\nI Wish I cared about anything in the world as much as CNN cares about what Donald Trump tweets\nI mean there are absolutely chemically obsessed with this man they are it's it's incredible they are chemically addicted\nThey cannot break the bell\nAnd unfortunately the one who loses in that is them\nSo how do you manage to separate Saudi Arabia from the United states you kidnapped and killed a Washington Post writer they blame it on the Saturday and you will encourage Americans to react with outrageous those crime against read or the breath of quote turkey ever pull off the subject like this you at\n... or want to have a history of deception two thousand sixteen ... to get a parliamentary majority would approve a new constitution making him a dictator for life but he fell short of the majority so what did he do he pretended that the Kurds had attacked and attacked Kurdish villages viciously that'll ever taught all the Kurds out of the parliament\nAnd to increase the proportion of his followers and the legislative body that was not enough to give him the power that he craves in July two thousand and sixteen\nThere were the who wants to see him he took advantage of the emergency powers to toss over a hundred thousand people who didn't support him out of their jobs at the jail tens of thousands of them but who actually perpetrated back cool\nI suspect it was or to want to himself\nHow could eared ones darker forces have created the impression of a murder that would separate the Saudis and the Americans\nFocus on a Saturday writer for the Washington Post\nThat's an interesting theory Howard Bloom will have to keep watching this one thank you\nSo have you ever taken ... listen to this story over technologies recently received proposals from Wall street banks\nValuing the ride hailing company as much as a hundred and twenty billion dollars in an initial public offering that could take place earlier next year and that's an amazing story\nArchaeologist and Italy have uncovered and inscription that they say may show that the history books have been wrong for centuries\nAbout palm pay historians of long believed that mount Vesuvius erupted on August Seventy nine eighty destroying the nearby Roman city of bomb pay but now when in scripture and has been uncovered dated mid October almost two months later ...\nWell this year more than half of all the United states have confirmed or possibly ... possible cases of acute polio like illness that can cause paralysis and mostly affects children\nAll those thirty states said that they had cases that were confirmed suspected or being investigated including Fifteen states that said they are confirmed cases in two thousand Eighteen and total forty seven confirmed cases in forty nine more were suspected are being investigated\nFor a total of Ninety six it's bizarre story Dr Gary right now are with us scary what's going on here\nWell George this is a real mystery tonight uh this plastered paralysis is been around for three or four years in the United states and it hits the voluntary nerves in your spinal cord not up in your brain\nYour legs your arms your face your fingers or swallowing and even your breathing can be paralyzed\nAnd the average age is about seven and a half years and they've noticed that comes after an acute respiratory infection in the late after in the late fall\nAnd it doesn't look good any good traces the spinal fluid and some of the children show a virus called eighth of a new one but not all of them have that most of them have clean spinal fluids and they don't know what's going on right now they said our chances are one and a million of getting it\nHowever India has had fifty thousand cases over the last couple of years what cuts are right down to one\nIn ten thousand\nSo what we want to make sure that it's not coming in and it's not going to come here but the\nProblem and here's what we do and it seems like it is easier\nYeah we don't know the cause why is there an increase why is it reported in countries all over the world who's at risk what are the long term effects what's the prevention and most important what's the treatment to this infection\nWell that's good it's scary though Gary why does it affect just children apparently around it\nMay it may be a because of the the respiratory virus that was out last year called de sixty eight really hit children are very hard and put a lot of the hospital and they noticed an association between severe respiratory infections in children and uh the acute flattered paralysis\nSo it's usually a you have to watch out for is that about a week or so after a coup respiratory infection\nOr the children started getting weakness in her arms and legs and you should get him to the doctor quickly to have them checked out for this\nAll right thank you Gary today in Canada has become only the second country in the world to approve for recreational purposes

the other reason is that rod really had no creative control over that series unfortunately you what was his role\nWell he he created the series um he he wrote the pilot film which was called night gallery was three stories and it was a it was kind of a ... movie of the week kind of\nThing and even hitched it he's the one who probably pitched it to the network ...\nAfter that was such a success he pitched it and they kind of mutually pitched each other and and he did so he he wrote a lot for the series and he hosted it obviously but he had no say in cast and directing and editing and all that kind of thing and and you see\nThat kind of his absence come up all the time in episode where you say a rod would have done this or you know and he didn't have that freedom to do that\nHow come you never wrote a book\nWell he never wrote a novel he did write your collections of short stories\n... sure but I'm getting the closest\nThe ever came to writing anything that was novel length was actually\nThe stories that made up the night gallery movie or they originally were developed as they were long short stories I'm In a book called the season to be wary\nI'm ... but he never had the time you know that's the simple answer he ... he was so busy with tells me he he wanted to write a novel he really did but he just never could get away for long enough period of time to dedicate to writing a novel\nIs there's going to be a ... to the twilight zone\nYes it's it's already in production and it's just supposed to be coming out early next year I'm Jordan Peele who the director and writer of get out\nOr is in charge of it he's going to be hosting it and producing it and from what little I've seen so far in terms of trailers and things I'm I'm cautiously optimistic I think they may actually get it right to some extent this time\nWe're the what's the venue for where they're gonna ear and\nIt's going to be on CBS all access so it's not going to be on regular TV it's going to be a pay you know like um [noise] you know Netflix or Amazon Prime that kind of thing so CBS all access and the interesting thing about that is\nThey launched the CBS all all access network with Star Trek with a new Star Trek series and now they're adding onto that with the twilight zone so it's like they you know they're going way back to get these shows to to launch this new network so it tells you how you know how classic these shows are they can be re Andrew reintroduced to a whole new audience in this way\nNicolas wasn't around surely one of the co writers a planet of the apes\nHe sure was in a lot of people still still don't are surprised when you say that but yes he was he didn't really get credit for it to well he did get literally get credit for it on the screen it's ... it's the the credit is written by Michael Wilson and rod Serling a so he did get coal credit but ever since\nThe movie came out there's always been this kind of you know what did he really right you know what what do you really can contribute to the final film and it's been a lot of misinformation and and speculation about what he did right so that's another thing that I think I clarify in the book\nSome of his is shows whether it was that gallery your twilight zone and in the era of supernatural to it what was his belief about that\nHe was he was a skeptic but he was very interested in it he\nWas a heat you know Carol Serling was once asked that question and and I think the answer she gave us the best answer the gift she said that he wanted to believe he had that he really wanted to believe that you know the alien had been here you know a thousand years ago\nAnd he was very open to these theories of you know the crop circles and you know they only visitations in UFO sightings and all that kind of stuff but he was also a very practical guy and he was he didn't have any experience of his own you'd never saw a spaceship or\nAnything like that so he was always skeptical but but he really had an interest in it and you know in the early seventies\nA rod narrated some very popular ah documentaries about this kind of thing you know in search engine astronauts in search of ancient mysteries which led to the series in search of and during that time particularly he really got interested in this thing but I don't think he ever\nYou know went over to the side of being a true believer or anything like that\nNow the twilight zone there were thirty minute episodes but I guess mine is commercial time they were about what twenty two twenty three minutes\nTwenty four most of them yeah back then now nowadays or thirty minutes she'll be twenty two but back then it was twenty four yeah a little less commercials that's still a lot of writing isn't it\nOh yeah yeah um yeah and and the amazing thing is how fully developed rod Serling could write a story in a character and twenty four minutes you know he he often a complaint about that to some extent said how hard it is to write a fully developed story and twenty four minutes and then he went out and did it over and over again you know so he\nUm he was able to succeed in a in a in a venue that you know it's very hard to succeed in\nIt's very difficult to pinpoint your very favorite twilight zone episode because they were all different and they were all great\nIt's yeah it's um you know it is and and the show was so yeah as you said if so they're so different it was very hard to pigeon hole the twilight zone it covered the gamut from you know it's hard science fiction and fantasy to western comedies to you know it went across the board so um you know I you know I\nHave a couple of favorites you know just a you know to\nThrow a couple of my favorite at this point probably as it's walking\nDistance wrote songs for season a episode about his kind of archetype will you know businessman who stressed out and wants to go back to his home town and you know really this youth and go back to a easier less stressful life was that the Willoughby\nOr it's just like really as kind of a stop it will be a kind of a companion piece to its well distance yeah so they\nBoth very similar and they're both among among the favorites and that was that was a big theme is or was this idea of going back to his innocent youth and Binghamton New York\nI I I Love like I mentioned I sing the body electric uh to serve man that was a classic\nA man is absolutely a classic and and it's again one of those shows that people still note to this day they know that ending its a cookbook you know they that stuff\n[laughter] ever [laughter] and then just so many good the uh what was the name of the one where the guy was obsessed with the ah he hated gambling and then all of a sudden he was obsessed with a slot machine that kept calling his name\nYeah that was called the fever and starve to ever\nFlown who actually started rod Serling his very first breakthrough hit called patterns on crafts theater or he start in that and you start in the fever and yeah exactly he was he was against gambling and he got ... kind of dragged Las Vegas and he became a you know addicted to this one particular slot machine that he thinks is taunting him\nAnd it drove him crazy after a while then ... exactly right yeah\nAll right Nick stay with us we're going to come back and take phone calls next our folks so if you want to chat about rod Serling talk about your favorite episode or just talk with Nicholas per ISI about some of the older type television programs check in with us next on coast to coast they I'm\nNever missed a detail

competition\nUh you know there'll be there'll be but it's kind of like talking about now major league baseball before the before Jackie Robinson you know and you know they didn't have the competition from the from the black player from the Latin player from all these places and they were certainly people who played in the major leagues in Nineteen forty one\nWho may not have made it in Nineteen fifty one because there was so much more more competition\nWhat would I Would say about all the different channels available now in his day there was just three major networks now my God you've got hundreds of channels\nYeah well he would he would love the freedom that it that it\nGives to ah to writers and creators that's you know in his day you know if those three networks didn't want to hear it that was it I mean you know and in some cases if he was you know had on the contract to CBS CBS didn't want to hear it that was it nowadays you know you can go to so many different outlets to get your creation\nOr seen and heard uh so yeah he would be thrilled with that aspect of it for sure\nI mean Netflix and Amazon truly rival the networks now don't they\nOh absolutely I some of the best television being made right now is on on those platforms\nIt's amazing let's take some calls let's go west of the Rockies cursed in Boise idaho or to get us started Hi Kurt\nHey George I'm Glad he got Nick I Can't wait to read the book you mentioned earlier when you were talking about the impact of the fact that the entire series is in black and white and of course Nick mentioned that you know the film or look\nBut I've always been amazed at what I was able to do with regarding the size of this sets which to me was as far as the visual impact was which is a testament to the you know the cinematographer or the lighting directors which I just\nI was just blown away with what they were able to accomplish was ordering from Nick if he knew how many cameras they used during the actual shoots\nOkay Nick you know\nI Do not know the answer that question by will absolutely agree with that it that's one of the striking things about the series is is\nThat you know of course the production level in terms of budget you know it was a fairly of generously budgeted show at the for the for the time but of course in terms of special effects they weren't going to be able to give you the brilliance you know spaceships a shooting across the sky and that kind of thing so they ... had\nTo work with a you know more a relatively modest a set\nAnd the so and he did he got the most out of out of those particular sets and and every now and then to actually because budget was always a concern um he would write a particular show that only took place in one the one room because it was going to be cheaper to make\nYou know young actors one room and that's it and he would do one of those after they had a couple of expensive shows like eye of the beholder or you know and I married twenty thousand feet or something and then he would do one of these shows that we got kind of got the budget back under control\nHe jumped started many careers to did you not\nYeah I think so I mean it's certainly there are a lot of you know stars and soon to be Robert Redford yeah yeah has learned Redford\nActually got his first job not on the twilight zone but in another show that rod Serling had written cold in the presence of mind enemies on playoff Ninety it was the very first\nAppearance by Robert Robert Redford on television a and that was a great great show when he was very good in that too\nYeah in the twilight zone episode he was a cop in the lady thought he was a death coming to get her yeah I'm not going to see what the ending is but that was a great show\nYeah was it was very that was written by George Clinton Johnson actually and that's a terrific show\nWhat was the name of the show and Nicholas were ... more head was a woman in her house in a small flying saucer landed inside her house or something like that and she beat it with a broom\n[laughter] it's called the invaders\nAnd and that was written by Richard Matheson or the late great Richard Matheson uh he wrote several episodes of the show and that's one of the most well remembered episodes of the series it's ... it's largely dialogue free there's almost no dialogue in it until the very end when the when the you know spill person you know a sense a few things\nWe found out who they were in the other one I like to was the lady who was having plastic surgery a because everybody thought she was ugly in a she wanted to look like everyone else and uh we found out what everyone else look like and that's\nThat's the eye of the beholder and that is um you know if there's a quintessential twilight zone episode I think that's that's it that's that's the one uh and again one of the most well remembered episode\nAnd the one that really gave me the message of people was the shelter above that fallout shelter\nYeah the shelter is a great a great episode or certainly wrote that one and uh yeah it's about the idea that there's going to you know there's a there's a bomb threat a nuclear threat and what this what does this community do when there's only one bomb shelter and they all want to get into and they can't get into it and\nThey turn on each other and it was yeah that was a terrifically a vote on episode\nRenee in San Francisco is with us Hi Renee go ahead\nI I you know um there's an episode that's a very rare episode that it was finally or at least ... years later that was called miniature\nMiniature I don't remember that Nicholas ...\nRobert ... absolutely right another great and you know great actor who one of his early early performances Robert Duvall a that was one of the hour long episode was the fourth season of the twilight zone they were all in our long as opposed to half\nHour I'll rarely yeah okay\nYeah and then you sure it was one of the hour long episode and it ... it was involved in a in a lawsuit at the time that\nUh the series went into syndication so it was not initially syndicated so it was not seen for decades or at least Twenty years\nUh and so that was long long settled and um there was a special on pulled the twilight zone silver anniversary special and they showed that particular episode along with a couple of others that had been similarly left out of the syndication package\nWhat was the tragedy when they were doing the twilight zone movie a helicopter crashed or something like that\nOh he has horrible horrible incident I'm a yeah helicopter crashed after an explosion you know special effects explosion and killed the moral starring in that particular story and two young children who are on the set\nA it was yeah yeah cast they pull over the entire movie of course\nHorrible horrible situation on Long Island New York is with us they just go ahead I\nMake a couple of questions or one would be the first one would be that seems like it was very escapist were then maybe someone stay back in the sexes I'm just speculating if you had to write for a job and it came home and watch the twilight zone\nThat would be almost like an escape from your daily reality\nAnd I guess people might have wanted that and I'm Wondering if there are any other shows really light that my second question would be about\nIs down\nAnd for information right now\nSeven Ninety\n[noise]\nAnd then to the ... fleet they got your pants off at\nMaybe break dancing or skateboarding\nFor video games whenever you get at the skills to make

twilight zone by year I'm Out I'm In this came after we but I Believe a one step beyond which started in fifty eight I think\nNext up we're going to end in Tulsa, Oklahoma Edward taken away\nTo Georgia and neck you know I wrote a story man he was ... he had the ability to be able to understand human nature because if you listen to a lot of his episodes and I've got every one of them and I ... about every two months\nYou know every one of his shows has a point to it but he's trying to point to you know and I think it's because of the experiences at a combat soldier during World War two which I you know it was all about the the Nazi movement and all of that you know\nAnd the everything you've been through one of my favorite episodes it's hard to say which is my favorite but I think it has to be the one that's to be twenty five Mitchell twin engine bomber\nComing over from Italy crashes in the desert that the cat that airplane didn't go on that mission for whatever reason which was Robert coming Bob comings I'm Sorry ... and up bop companies just happened to be walking by a scene is newspaper of his airplane they had found laying in the desert\nAnd he went back in time where you went back to the desert in his mind\nAnd relive the experience even though he didn't fly that nation you know and or any I ended up in a hospital room\nAnd having psychiatric care trying to find out you know what caused him to add a nervous breakdown and it was because the shock of seeing an airplane on the newspaper just recently you know and when it when the show ended close to the ending of it\nThe nurse bodies clothing out there and she said well there's sand in his shoes\nAnd so somehow or another he really transport himself back in time to be twenty five ... crashed you know struggle with those shows that ... day and\nHe had a time machine you know one of 'em this guy or you know way back in time three different times and he thought he would try to prevent that took place one of them was just thinking of the Titanic\nThe guy went back tried to tried to change that while he failed at one time you went back and tried to stop the uh Japanese from being annihilated in Hiroshima trying to warn them that didn't do any good he got thrown in jail for his efforts on that\nSo I went back and he ended up in Nazi Germany but already thought he could alter that event\nCourse but a man I don't know we it it'd be hard to say which me my favorite episode the the the Christmas Story\nThe guy that played art Carney played the ah Santa Claus in a department store and the call Cowell was his name he wanted to be the biggest gift giver of all times the guy was all a shrine\nWhen he got a break from the department store you went and got drunk came back he was setting up on the chairs little boy jumped up in his lap\nSanta Claus just it was to grow up man I mean he fell out of the chair on the floor you know where she got fired and everything he went outside and he was all down down he went and a back alley and picked up a bag and it turned into gifts mysteriously bag just all of a sudden became full of gifts instead of a you know empty cans\nMan he went around giving gifts to everybody and it just and that story you know and the guy that Rand a department store\nThey found car well given these gifts out at this a place like a John ... mission type place you know at least when it comes and goes where did you get all these gifts if you've got a receipt for all these is Bob Bob ... and he goes no I just\nI found the bag and the gift rent it and I'm just giving them out picking at the PlayStation and the department store owner came in there so yeah there it is there is the merchandise oh well you're the Bob are by you know and ah the guy's name was Mr done department store owner right and uh\nAnd they need to step out of the bag at the police station there wasn't nothing but empty can it right there so they had to let him go of course the store owner sitting here scratch your head the policemen scratch it it can figure out where all those gift recover from it they were coming out that bag\nSo just before they released a coal oil Santa Claus he raced in the bag and grab a bottle of wine Nineteen thirty three and handed it to Mr gundy\nHuh you know said merry Christmas\nAnd both of them got pretty pretty toasted on the wine and they walked outside and they seemed Santa Claus flying overhead and a slave with reindeer\nAnd arrows society and that right there just catches my heart Everytime\nI live in you as you mentioned something about cans and remember kick the can Nicholas\nOh sure sure yeah kick the can and that was actually re made in the twilight zone feature film as well about a a old old folks home where a ... one of the old one of the people there and wants to get the get the residents to play kick the can to feel young again and of course they do become young again my point kick the can and\nAnd the one person who was against it the whole time he didn't play and he didn't get to become young and he regrets it obviously and and that that was written by George Clinton Johnson actually that's a terrific episode\nWe're running out of time your neck but uh I I've got to tell you this is a topic that is so dear to my heart it brings back memories when I was a kid watching television my folks were there in the living room with those those are great times weren't they\nScrape memories yeah yeah it was a different time and you know for all of us and uh yeah it's great to ... TV can bring you back that way and you know so it's yeah it's great to think about\nLife was different too sure it sure was yeah yeah absolutely it was a kid I didn't have a cure in the world we\nKnow and that's where the and you know that that's something interrupt showing was was yearning for in a lot of us well isn't that supposed to be able to go back to being a kid and have nothing to being carefree and being innocent and and the less stress and everything else and that came out and in so many stories\nBy the way you believe it was wrong about one thing you're not a bad bad man\n[laughter] that's what I could take it from from bill movies you can call me that I'm Sorry but\nThat's a classic ... one more time you bought your website if you would for people\nSure will be a rod Serling memorial foundation or can be found just that rod Serling dot com WWW dot ... dot com and uh I have a Facebook page that's dedicated to the book so it's not my personal pages it's for the book it's Facebook dot com and then it's forward slash rod\nSerling dimensions open were rod Serling dimensions ah the working title for the book was dimensions of imagination so it was that but uh the book is called ... showing his life working imagination\nSuper neck thanks again up next we're talking about haunted collectibles and collectibles to next\n... the new version of that goes to ... am at no bribe bone in no Android we're not going to\nLose ... on demand anywhere anytime good at ... dot com and downloaded to the\nGetting ready to be in the new view streaming edition this month has no shortage of Netflix Original to take over your TV you out this week is part of\nMaking a murderer these three of marble daredevil main runway new comedy special get expert advice on allergies sleep diet in more with the help in the new documentary series asked the doctor and illusions daring brown is back on Netflix with a new special golf sacrifice\nSome lick getting out of the Amazon Prime this week include the cost of building horror movies that'll or young Jake Gyllenhaal and the weird cool Donnie ... place builds on a good way to hell why not the new horror comedies slice comes out\nThis week and on the complete opposite side of the spectrum kids Daniel tiger movie lands on prime\nSubscribers premieres on with the Alec Baldwin show season five from Europe Blackfish the debut of the counters the kids are All right and more this week on Hulu and that's new streaming edition and I heart radio\nYou into Jordan was celebrated in October twenty third [noise]\nHe didn't talk to you\nNeed to mention\n... and take the plunge to be drug free for more information on how you can celebrate mid week the dot com\nHas gone from the region will studio your local area reason well darn calm is gay and I see him and I are radio station [noise]\nSecretary of state arrives in Turkey ... and Fox News secretary Mike Pompeo's mission to learn what happened to a journalist ... taking him to turkey after a day of meetings in Saudi Arabia\n\nMan won't come back to coast to coast great show for you coming up here waned Maddox with us and noted expert in the areas of American furniture folk art paintings glass pottery and collectibles but there's more to the story and by the way he has a broad experience in American and European antiques\nHe's the founding president of the ... brewery antique Dealers Association past president of the ... brewery lions clubs for more than Twenty years\nWayne has maintained a busy antique appraisal business serving trust attorneys insurance agencies homeowners indeed up appraisals services Wayne welcome to the program looking forward to this\nThank you it's going to be a blast\nI got to tell you my my lead uncle ought to Boston ... years ago recommended to John F.

away a lot of people do I just failed that everything else\n[laughter] not really\nBut you know I I was a middle aged guy I was in a restaurant business I was the stock market forecaster I used to that was one of these guys who told Merrill Lynch which way the market was going I worked at a think tank yeah parents got sick got called back to Connecticut\nAnd ended up in the antique business after a restaurant jobs didn't work out things usually working life\n... ... that's true but people of color collectibles aren't going to tell you when I Wish I still have my baseball cards from the Nineteen fifties I don't know where they are I've asked my mother who is eighty nine years old mom checked the ... where are they she says George you we gave them away\nWhat I had in the fifties every baseball card and clear that play during that period what would they be worth today a fortune\nWell Nineteen fifty two mantle card oppose it was in great good shape your real good shape right what would you ... well suppose you were at a tag sale\nAll right you're running around out there in a city angels and you come across an old old house I hundred years old the coup all out there and as a farmer than I just sold the house I I'm just getting rid of that stuff so right away you got a feeling that this stuff might be a legit\nNot it tag sale where some facts are you guys can outsmart right\nRight you look around and it's all real stuff that's been handed down for years yes see a fifty two man told they're an excellent condition ask them a few questions you find out it's right a guy says listen I've been told that's where the porch and I want ten thousand bucks for it by the by it\nI don't know I don't know until I call a guy like you\nWell that's worth a town somewhere in the neighborhood of ah you know two hundred thousand dollars no yeah oh\nI had ALS Caroline's and mental saying Willie Mays I had him all to\nMyself I used to put those cards and my bicycle spokes\n[laughter] I had to duplicate so we did it with the duplicates remember\nYeah with the duplicates in generally your head like I had the theme Pete Rose rookie card to Islam\nI ran into Pete Rose a couple of years ago in Los Angeles and the ... what would those cars have been worse if you'd given them to him to sign even more\nNow I I actually don't think that would help the value of very much and probably it would hurt the value you don't want to do that with a you know you're better off having 'em sign a napkin\nYeah exactly now old football cards and stuff so they worth money too\nThat's what you should be buying right now really\nI always think if you do a little things a little different than the average guy you'll make a little extra money right here where everybody's on the baseball card that nobody's buying football cards which means you should\nBe eyeing football\n... interesting to\nWrite basketball cards\nI once saw a guy who had a complete [noise] he had Michael Jordan rookie cards that before they cut the cards it's called a big plate he had a whole plate of sixteen Michael Jordan rookie guards on\nOh I don't know what the heck that the work that day she's managed basketball\nCard but nobody collects football cards and you can buy and real cheap and that's sort of thing you should be buying it get yourself like addict but his rookie cup Dick Butkus card right some sort of thing if you can buy that for a couple of bucks you buy it\nI think I threw away a wholeness Wagner card was worse than they\n[laughter] they have a an artist Wagner card\nDid you really do not like a million dollars isn't it\n[laughter] yeah it thought two million if it has a a a a\nA Piedmont back gosh\nYeah that's that's the most famous uh collectible and history\nWhen what makes these collectibles so expensive and so he's on after\nI always say you know the way to make money in and take the jets instead of sitting around and saying well this is rare this is exceedingly rare there's only one of the world and it's obviously a four hundred years old the\nWicked dusty it is right that's not the kind of what makes things give things value is what I call marketability\nAsk yourself who's going to buy it you know everybody loves baseball\nGot its an American the love baseball one of the reasons Mickey Mantle baseball cards are worth so much as it sounds like Mickey Mouse\nYeah you're right by the name the named beautiful [noise] I'm In a ... right there so a lot of people live in New York oh they love that\nYou know there's so much common

how many twilight zone episodes were there a hundred and fifty six\nHundred and ... and I know that three of them for example it's a good life in praise of long distance call with that guy Billy ... who was a kid that scared everybody into the cornfields\nFilm or feel to them that you filmed episodes do and so if you take that up a notch and make a color than to get done you're completely in another universe and you're not for me you're not in the twilight zone anymore\nWell that's why I think ... gallery that came out in color after the twilight zone didn't quite have that twilight zone magic to it\nThat's one of the reasons I think yeah yeah the other reason is that rod really had no creative control over that series unfortunately yeah what was his role\nWell he he created that series um he he wrote the pilot film which was called night gallery it was three stories and it was a it was kind of a ... movie of the week kind of\nThing and even ... he's the one who probably pitched it to the network will I bring all the\n... after that was such a success he pitched it and they kind of mutually pitched each other and and he did so he he wrote a lot for the series and he hosted obviously but he had no say in cast and directing and editing and all that kind of thing and and you see that kind of his absence\nCome up all the time in episode where you say oh you know rod would have done this or you know and he didn't have that freedom to do that\nHow come you never wrote a book\nWell he never wrote a novel he did right and you know a collection of short stories\n... sure but I mean the closest\nThe ever came to writing anything that was novel length was actually the stories that made up the night gallery movie uh they originally were developed as they were long short stories I'm In a book called the season to be wary um some but she never\nHad the time you know that's the simple answer he ... he was so busy with tells me he he wanted to write a novel he really did but he just never could get away for long enough period of time to dedicate to writing a novel\nThat there's going to be a ... to the twilight zone\nYes it's it's already in production and it's just supposed to be coming out or ... or early next year I'm Jordan Peele who the director and writer of get out\nA is in charge of it he's going to be hosting it and producing it and from what little I've seen so far in terms of trailers and things I'm I'm cautiously optimistic I think they may actually get it right to some extent this time\nWe're the what's the venue for it where they're gonna ear and\nIt's going to be on CBS all access so it's not going to be on regular TV it's going to be a pay\nYou know like um [noise] you know Netflix or Amazon Prime that kind of thing so CBS all access and the interesting thing about that is\nThey launched the CBS all all access network with Star Trek with a new Star Trek series and now they're adding onto that with the twilight zone so it's like they you know the going way back to get these shows to to launch this new network so it tells you how you know how classic these shows are that can be ... re introduced to a whole new audience in this way\nNicolas wasn't rod surely one of the co writers of planet of the apes\nHe sure was in a lot of people still still don't are surprised when you say that but yes he was\nHe didn't really get credit for it did he well he did get literally get credit for it on the screen it's ... it's the the credit is written\nBy Michael Wilson and rod Serling a surgical credit but ever since the movie came out there's always been this kind of you know what did he really right you know what what did you really can contribute to the final film and it's been a lot of misinformation and and speculation about what he did right so that's another thing that I think I clarify in the book\nSome of his is shows whether it was not gallery your twilight zone and in the era of supernatural to it what was his belief about that\nHe was he was a skeptic but he was very interested in it he was a heat you know Carol Serling was once asked that question and and I think the answer she gave us the best answer the gift\nShe said that he wanted to believe he had that he really wanted to believe that\nYou know the alien had been here you know a thousand years ago and he was very open to these theories of you know the crop circles and you know they only visitations in UFO sightings and all that kind of stuff but he was also very practical guy and he was he didn't have any experience of his own he never saw a spaceship or\nAnything like that so he was always skeptical but but he really had an interest in it and you know in the early seventies a rod narrated\nSome very popular ah documentaries about this kind of thing you know in search of ancient astronauts in search of ancient mysteries which led to the series in search of and during that time particularly he really got interested in this thing but I don't think he ever\nYou know went over to the side of being a true believer or anything like that\nNow the twilight zone there were thirty minute episodes but I guess minus commercial time there were about what twenty two twenty three minutes\nTwenty four most of them yeah back then now nowadays or thirty minutes she'll be twenty two but back then it was twenty four yeah a little less commercials\nThat's still a lot of writing isn't it\nOh yeah yeah um yeah and and the amazing thing is how fully developed rod Serling could write a story in a character and twenty four minutes you know he he often a complaint about that to some extent said how hard it is to write a fully developed story in twenty four minutes and then he went out and did it over and over again you know so he\nUm he was able to succeed in a in a in a venue that you know it's very hard to succeed in\nIt's very difficult to pinpoint your very favorite twilight zone episode because they were all different and they were all great\nIt's yeah it's um you know it is and and the show was so yeah but as you said there are so they're so different it was very hard to pigeon hole the twilight zone it covered the gamut from you know it's hard science fiction and fantasy too westernized comedies to you know it went across the board so um you know I you know I\nHave a couple of favorites you know just a you know to throw a couple of my favorite at this point probably as it's walking distance\nWrote songs for season a episode about his kind of archetype will you know businessman who stressed out and wants to go back to his home town and you know really this youth and go back to a easier less stressful life\nWas that and the Willoughby or it's just like really adds a stop it will be a kind of a companion piece to its well distance yeah so they both\nVery similar and they're both among among the favorites and that was that with a big theme is or was this idea of going back to his innocent youth and bring them to New York\nI I I Love like I mentioned I sing the body electric uh Fisher man that was a classic a\nMan is yeah absolutely a classic and and it's again one of those shows that people still know to this day they know that ending its a cookbook you know they that's ever [laughter]\nAnd uh they're just so many good Leo what was the name of the one where the guy was obsessed with the ah he hated gambling and then all of a sudden he was obsessed with a slot machine that kept calling his name\nYeah that was called the fever and start a effort Sloan who actually started rod Serling is very first breakthrough hit called patterns on crafts theater\nOr he started that and you start in the fever and yet exactly he was he was against gambling and he got kind of dragged Las Vegas and he became a you know addicted to this one particular slot machine thinks is taunting him\nAnd it drove him crazy after a while then ... exactly right yeah\nAll right Nick stay with us we're going to come back and take phone calls next our folks so if you want to chat about rod Serling talk about your favorite episode or just talk with Nicholas ... about some of the older type television

A. R. D. I. A. dot com\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\nAnd welcome back then it varies you with us rod Serling his life working imagination ticket for a rod Serling were alive today watching television what what do you say about the current state of TV\nWell I I think in a in one regard I think he would be thrilled with how adults television has become in you know in the in the realm of drama\nUh during the time the restaurant was riding obviously we talked about some of the censorship but not on the issues but also the language and and just the ... the subject matter in general even if it wasn't a social issue um you know today there's so many shows that are that are\nAre so adults in scope or you know I don't even have to name them but you know Mad Men and Breaking Bad and\nYou know not just cable but but um but network television I think it would be thrilled with how how uh the with the quality of those shows now of course we have many more channels now and he there's certainly a whole lot of you know of of jumped to but\nUm but I think in general he would be happy with it and one thing I could tell you for sure he he would hate reality TV on the um\nHe and and I don't say that just you know that's not just like me saying that at the time you know I guess reality television Ford's time a rod had some very negative things to say about a show called this is your life if you remember this is your life\nUh this is your life with a show where they bring somebody\nOnto the show in the normal you know regular everyday person and they will trot as family members out there and they would go through his you know scrapbook and look at you know it was kind of reality television for the time and he just\nDespise the the show or you know he thought it was just the invasion of privacy and everything else so the reality though and he would hate but but I think there are so many shows now that he would absolutely love\nWill an old time television to Nick are really did not understand racial mix ups demographics when you look at some of these old shows way gone back or even the comedians are the game shows\nThey were all older white guys you know in and I'm not I'm not talking like a middle age I'm Talking older white guys [laughter] where did the television you know it would be difficult to get that kind of a person like Jimmy Durante for example you you think of him\nHe was a big superstar very talented I don't think he would make it today\nYou might be right yeah yeah you could be right I mean well listen to the ... the um the field as has grown so tremendously there's so much more competition\nThat uh you know there'll be there'll be but it's kind of like talking about now major league baseball before the before Jackie Robinson you know help them you know they didn't have the competition from the from the black player from the Latin player from all these places and they were certainly people who played in the major leagues in Nineteen forty one\nWho may not have made it in Nineteen fifty one because there was so much more more competition\nWhat would rod say about all the different channels available now in his day there was just three major networks now my God you've got hundreds of channels\nYeah well he would he would love the freedom that it that it gives to ah to writers and creators that you know in his day you know if those three networks didn't want to hear it that was it I mean you know and in some cases if he was you know had on the contract to CBS\nCBS didn't want to hear it that was it nowadays you know you can go to so many different outlets to get your creation\nOr seen and heard uh so yeah he would be thrilled with that aspect of it for sure\nI mean Netflix and Amazon truly rival the networks now don't they\nOh absolutely I some of the best television being made right now is on on those platforms\nAnd it's amazing let's take some calls let's go west of the Rockies cursed in Boise idaho or to get us started Hi Kurt\nHey George I'm Glad he got Nick I Can't wait to read the book you mentioned earlier when you were talking about the impact of the fact that the entire series is in black and white and of course Nick mentioned that you know the film or look\nBut I've always been amazed at what I was able to do with regarding the size of this sets which to me it was as far as the visual impact was which is a testament to the you know the cinematographer or the lighting directors which I just\nI was just blown away with what they were able to accomplish was ordering from Nick if he knew how many cameras they used during the actual shoots\nOkay Nick do you know\nI Do not know the answer that question by will absolutely agree with that it that's one of the striking things about the series is\nIs that you know of course the production level in terms of budget\nYou know it was a fairly of generously budgeted show at the for the for the time but of course in terms of special effects they weren't going to be able to give you the brilliance you know spaceships a shooting across the sky and that kind of things so that ... had to work with a you know more a relatively modest ah set\nAnd the so and he did he got the most out of out of those particular sets and and every now and then to actually because budget was always a concern um he would write a particular show that only took place in one the one room\nBecause it was going to be cheaper to make you know there is one room and that's it\nAnd he would do one of those after they had a couple of expensive shows like eye of the beholder or you know and I married twenty thousand feet or something and then he would do one of these shows that we've got kinda got the budget back on the control\nHe jumps started many careers to did you not\nYeah I think so I mean it's it's certainly there are a lot of you know stars and\nSoon to be Robert Redford start yeah yeah has learned Redford\nActually got his first job not on the twilight zone but in another show that rod Serling had written cold in the presence of mind enemies on playoff Ninety it was the very first appearance by Robert Robert Redford on television a and that was a great great show when he was very good in it too\nYeah in the twilight zone episode he was a cop in the lady thought he was a death coming to get her yeah I'm not going to see what the ending is but that was a great show\nYeah was it was her that was written by George Clinton Johnson actually and that's a terrific show\nWhat was the name of the show Nicholas were ... more head was a woman in her house in a small flying saucer landed inside her house or something like that and she beat it with a broom\n[laughter] it's called the invaders and and that was written by Richard Matheson or the late great Richard Matheson uh he wrote several episodes of the show and that's one of the most well remembered episodes of the series is it's largely dialogue free there's almost no dialogue in it until the very end when the when the you know spill per se\nAnd you know a says a few things\nI found out who they were in the other one I like to was the lady who was having plastic surgery or because everybody thought she was ugly in a she wanted to look like everyone else and uh we sure found out what everyone else looked like and that's\nThat's the eye of the beholder and that is um you know if there is a quintessential twilight zone episode I think that's that's it that's that's the one uh and again one of the most well remembered episode\nAnd the one that really gave me the message of people was the shelter above that fallout shelter\nYeah the shelter is a great a great episode Serling wrote that one\nAnd uh yeah it's about the idea that there's going to you know there's a there's a bomb threat a nuclear threat and what this what does this community do when there's only one bomb shelter and they all want to get into and they can't get into it and they turn on each other and it was yes that was a terrifically a well known episode\nRenee in San Francisco is with us Hi Renee go ahead\nHi I you know um there's an episode that's a very rare episode that it was finally or at least ... years later I was called miniature\nMiniature I don't remember that Nicholas do you\nRather devolved absolutely or another great you know a great actor who one of his early early performances Robert Duvall a that was one of the hour long episode was the fourth season of the twilight zone they were all in our long as opposed to the half hour oh really yeah okay\nYeah and then you sure it was one of the hour long episodes and it it was involved in a in a lawsuit at the time that\nUh the series went into syndication so it was not initially syndicated so it was not seen for decades or at least Twenty years\nOr in so that was long long settled and um there was a special on pulled the twilight zone silver anniversary special and they showed that particular episode along with a couple of others that had been similarly left out of the syndication package\nWhat was the tragedy when they were doing the twilight zone movie a helicopter crashed or something like that\nOh he has a horrible horrible incident a helicopter crashed after an explosion you know special effects explosion and killed the moral\nStarring in that particular story and two young children who are on the set\nA as yeah you cast they pull over the entire movie of course\nHorrible horrible situation on Long Island New York is with us they just go ahead I\nMake a couple of questions or one would be the first one would be that seems like it was very escapist well then maybe someone stay back in the sexism just speculating if you had to write for a job and it came home and watch the twilight zone\nThat would be almost like an escape from your daily reality\nYou really can't Nick we're going to take a quick break them we're gonna come back with final phone calls with you a special guest Nick ... book of course has

right now and uh does an awful lot of good for the blind and for a students who need scholarships you know\nIt sure does how did you get involved in the collectibles\nWell I got involved in and takes away a lot of people do I just failed that everything else [laughter] not really but\nYou know I I was a middle aged guy always in a restaurant business I was a stock market forecaster\nI used to that was one of these guys who told Merrill Lynch which way the market was going I worked in a think tank yeah parents got sick got called back to Connecticut and ended up in the antique business after a restaurant jobs didn't work out but when things usually working life\n... ... that's true but people of color collectibles aren't going to tell you when I Wish I still have my baseball cards from the Nineteen fifties I don't know where they are I asked my mother who's eighty nine years old mom checked the ... where are they she says George ... we gave them away\nWhat I had in the fifties every baseball card and clear that play during that period what would they be worth today a fortune\nWell Nineteen fifty two mantle card suppose it was in great good shape your real good shape right what would you ... well suppose you were at a tag sale\nAll right you're running around out there in a city angels and you come across and old an old house I hundred years old big coup all out there and there's a farmer and I just sold the house I I'm just getting rid of the stuff so right away you got a feeling that this stuff might be a legit\nOr that tag sale where some facts you guys can outsmart right right you\nLook around and it's all real stuff that's been handed down for years you see a fifty two man told their and excellent condition ask them a few questions you find out it's right a guy says listen I've been told that is where the porch and I want ten thousand bucks for it by the by it\nI don't know I don't know until I call a guy like do you\nWell that's worth a town somewhere in the neighborhood of a you know two hundred thousand dollars you know yeah oh\nI had Alan Caroline's mental saying Willie Mays I haven't had 'em all\nTo myself I used to put those cards and my bicycle spokes\n[laughter] I had to duplicate so we did it with the duplicates remember\nYeah with the duplicates in generally you had like I had Fifteen Pete Rose rookie cards slum\nI ran into Pete Rose a couple of years ago in Los Angeles and the ... what would those cards have been worse if you'd given them to him to sign even more\nNow I I actually don't think that would help the value of very much uh probably would hurt the value you don't want to do that with a you know you're better off having 'em sign a napkin\nYeah exactly now old football cards and stuff are they worth money too\nThat's what you should be buying right now really I always think if you do little things a little different than the average guy you'll make a little extra money right everybody's\nOn the baseball cards that nobody's buying football cards which means you should be\nEyeing football ... interesting to\nWrite basketball cards I once saw a guy who had a complete he had Michael Jordan rookie cards that before they cut the cards it's called a big plate he had a whole plate of sixteen Michael Jordan rookie cards on got\nOh I don't know what the heck that'd be worth today jeeze banished basketball\nCard but nobody collects football cards and you can buy and real cheap and that's sort of thing you should be by you get yourself like a big by his rookie cup Dick Butkus card right some sort of thing if you can buy that for a couple of bucks you buy it\nI think I threw away a wholeness Wagner card was worth anything\n[laughter] I did have a an artist Wagner card\nDid you really do not like a million dollars isn't it\n[laughter] yeah it thought two million if it has a a a a a Piedmont back\nGosh yeah that's that's the most famous uh collectible and history\nWhen what makes these collectibles so expensive and so after\nI always say you know the way to make money in antiques just adjust instead of sitting around and saying well this is rare this is exceedingly rare there's only one of the world and it's obviously a four hundred years old the\nWicked dusty it is right that's not the kind of what makes things gives things value is what I called marketability\nAsk yourself who's going to buy it you know everybody loves baseball\nGot its unamerican the love baseball one of the reasons Mickey Mantle baseball cards are worth so much as it sounds like Mickey Mouse\nYeah you're right by
