um\nThe [noise]\nYou know and what what I tell people when when they asked me a question like that [noise] if people are still people when when you have a\nThey can't cut trees fast enough biggest

I'm sure I'm sure they're they're done in a in a very careful men are very logical manner\nI mean that's and that would create another problem all by itself how about the population in terms of ah the men and women fifty fifty what they're buying is that a market change\n[noise] yeah you know in you know what's interesting about the market is a women right now and and I don't know why it and no one's paying attention to this but women are about sixty five percent of the people in college it's sixty five thirty five men women and in law school at Seventy thirty I mean think\nAbout it really is it that high on that ... that's a clip from Twenty years ago right\nOh yeah I I said listen you what you want to half of the women there so you don't do it\nBut what you have to take into consideration is is that women are going to run things there's there's absolutely no question about that because they are going to be the most educated I mean the glass ceiling has been shattered for a long time but we're starting to see many many more women come into the c._e._o. positions\nAnd they're good want us all excellent and was absolutely excellent ones and and uh so\nWe're we're seeing a major major change in our culture Twenty years from now you won't you won't recognize a commerce you just want because if it's going to be run by women\nHum what's happening with the new generation Z what's in what is that\nA generation Z was born ... being going right now it's actually a two thousand five to ... thousand twenty four so in that fully there uh\nBut Gen Z is not going to be entirely different than Gen Y ... that they're going to be this the same cyber reliant generation or they won't be as big because the number of parents that they have is is much smaller in generation X.\nGeneration X essentially is the parents of Gen Z a but\nIt ... what we're watching is is is a a a new crop of kids and I tell folks that I feel if it ... ... people say well these these ... they complain about the new kids they complain about generation y they complain about the money if they can't complain about the\nSame you know the kids don't want to work there they're entitled that you know there's all kinds of things that are up I'm hearing about them and I said let alone let them grow up as soon as they have to feed themselves they're going to be fined or just going to be just like the hippies that everybody hated this as soon as they had to feed themselves\nAnd and and face reality I'm In my joke is they became Republicans so\n[laughter] you're gonna get blasted for that\nI don't care listen it is what it is what led listed here here's how it works is zero to a hundred years old when you're a baby\nYou want what you want when you want it you want it now you don't you want it for free\nYou're a liberal and then once you're about ten years old and you have a some positions that the other kids don't deserve suddenly become a conservative so what you have is you have conservatives at one end of the population and you have a a liberals at the other end of the population\nWhere we're gaining a liberal every eight seconds because they're coming of age to vote and we're losing their conservative every sixteen seconds because they're dying so\nOn and all we're we're going to be a nation of liberals\nWhy can't people just care about people whether you're a liberal or conservative who cares why can't they just do the right thing\nYeah what he told me that makes me crazy you know this whole division that we have going on now in our country that horrible yeah it it troubles me it really does we not it's not what we're supposed\nTo do I mean when you have a ... ... unless I'm I'm I'm a I'm a Republican but when you have a president that\nTakes on a porn star in public and they have a fight on Twitter give me a break\nThat's the problem yeah that's\nAnd that's part of the new technology again did anybody ever anticipate that you think a Jack Dorsey when he founded Twitter than it would be used the tools like that I don't think so\nNo that when when when you think of the mind if people in like the Eighteen hundreds there's more information in a in a single Wall Street journal and somebody would ever think about an individual would think about in the Eighteen hundreds so I I don't know\nWhen you talk about the trends and change this is what we're losing can we're losing the ability to debate question discuss with people screaming at each other I mean those days are gone I mean I I heard a couple of people in a restaurant tonight I'm instead of just talking about something they're\nScreaming at each other because they didn't you get ... they didn't agree with each other in I've never seen that this bad to have you know\nNo I haven't and it it's called diplomacy and I wonder where it's way where it's gone I I I just simply don't know you know people\n... I I I Can't tell you the number of people at George that say to me I you know why don't we run our our government like a business and and so we you know where you want to have these huge deficits and we won't make all these mistakes\nIf you think about it I'd rather have a government that runs like a government a diplomatic government or a Republican it's based on a constitution not one that's based on business principles\nWe used to have that\nYeah we used to have that but now we have a government that's essentially run on business principles and it's it seems like there's there's no you know we we've just taken all do we have removed the rules with what we've taken away that the we've taken away the diplomacy that was necessary to be a diplomat and what\nWill what's going on with China China's enter freaky position China right now uh they\nRelaxed they are under their their child law to write how many people are on many children family can help\nYeah they can have a really as many as they want now which is the absolute positive did last thing they should have done\nIt it's I you know I I drink I don't know why I really don't and I and listen I Am not that smart I'm really not in ... in a few few asked my wife or my kid they'll they'll tell you but the ... here you have a situation where we're trying to\nHold on for a second we're already at the top of the hour we'll come back and talk about China plus will open up the phone lines as we talk about demographics and trends we're talking paranormal later on tonight [noise]\nDo you want your TV show beyond belief with George ... beyond belief dot com\n\n\n\nNow look back in history\n...

thank you thanks guys hey can I I have I called\nBecause I have a phone compact with you um but just scare me out and then I'll listen to your response\nSo two things um that irritated me one was at a you mentioned the president having a Twitter war um he's not a diplomat so all of those politicians that have looked\nIn the I I Can't do that\nA human being or as a Christian but I'm saying this as a Christian and a woman I wanted to say two things you first of all I'm he called her a horse face she was trying to jump start her career uh um the orange star\nBecause she had nowhere to go and needed cash fast and that warrior here's what Italians referred to as an old fashioned grease off he thought he was actually going to that he would he could run and possibly win a presidential nomination for the Democrats\nUm this was sold the word self serving isn't strong enough for what both of those guys yet\nAnd all they had was temporarily side tracked I'm a booming economy or try to bring down that's nan but more importantly that man has had actually a little one still at home I yeah and that little one but a young white\nInclude and his wife\nAnd we had a president had did something so by all it can even be talked about on on on radio in the oval office while I was paying for him with my tax dollars and everybody said oh he has a right to a private life this guy did pass if he did that\nWas over a decade about so I don't have a problem with him saying whatever you want because you have to remember\nTrump it's reactionary he doesn't start fights you look at everything from his campaign going forward he has reactionary if you pick on him he's going to come back at you that's human nature of the second thing I disagree that is sad\nIs that I'm ... now I'm not a senior in high school but and but I'm the I'm not that old either when I was a senior in high school I said that this country is nothing more than a big business and it should be run like a business\nI have started to successful business myself is that men and women don't have time for nine states\nYou'd get a deal dies we're not going to have a meeting to have a meeting to have a meeting and then to pick a committee and then this and that we don't have time for that they're spending our money and\nSo the fact that you're saying we need more diplomacy diplomacy death when ward\nDiplomacy doesn't save money we need a businessman I voted for him he has he said no nonsense that is that anyone that was bankrupt it four times and they had the audacity to get back up yet on the horse\nI thought I I have\nIncredible admiration for people that are fighters in it and he doesn't care if people call him a racist because God Knows what than it is hard and other people know\nThat ... I ... it it doesn't matter about just diplomacy she knows she is as I as a man on and uh and as a prize of that\nSo I disagree with you on both of those um things\nFor let's skip skip this comment today not in your comments are warranted obviously and you have a right to say these things would get anyone to jumping\n[noise] well ... ... regarding running it but I'm the country as a business I think you need to run a country as a country that the the single biggest enemy to any country a period is corruption and the business model does not protect us from corruption\nI think one of the things that when people say you run the country as a business let me give you an example I think you know most businesses are bottom line oriented\nYou're not going to pay thirty thousand dollars for a screwdriver or toilet a fair market value or even try to get it for the last one I think when people say let's let the country run as a business\nThey're talking about things like that where let's not waste money as a nation\nYeah I Would I Would respect that I I Would I Would agree with that as well but it would also say that that our country is a republic with the constitution and the constitution works where we have the best country on earth we have the best system on earth and the thing that frightens me about it a bit ah [laughter]\nA government run like a business is that the business model cannot protect you against corruption but the but the um Republican Ken that that's that's my position on that\nRight and you want to comment on ... and you want to comment on the president's tweeting\nYeah you know I ...\nI I don't disagree with with um the fact that this you know porn star in it and our attorney are are self serving they absolutely are self serving what I Wish our president would do is just not areas you know this dirty laundry in public I just wish it wouldn't happen\nThat well they but ... let me ask you this devil's advocate in by the way I've commented on his tweeting too because I I think he needs to be a little more presidential he's got some great ideas I'm a a lot of great ideas I don't agree with everything he says\nBut I'd rather be a little more presidential a little more dignified when in back off the tweeting and stuff like that but\nIf he let them spot what they did without defending themselves then what happens to him\n[noise] I I think that would in their punishment will be [laughter] what they've said and and um [noise] uh I I don't know I I think what he has done is\nBut at the argument and I and I don't think there is one I really don't\nKnow I mean somebody got paid a lot of money to to do what they did and she got it and I mean there was a reason for that who led to it who pushed it who knows\nCan I Want to talk with you about India when we come back and also we'll take final calls in just a moment how about your books to people still get them ...\nOh yeah Casey direct dot com K.

they already killed some old lady in Arizona for crying out loud\nYeah well in the trucking trucking won't touch it\nWell no I support our truck drivers I don't want to see driverless trucks\nAnd I really don't have enough\nTruck driver you know what that that what we\nWould you like to have a truck behind you would know drivers sitting in it\nOr not going to do it might not you know we I have many you know what I mean he has little\nMini Cooper right\nI Am a mini Cooper GDP which is a high rise and I'm thinking to myself I the first time I pull up next to I'm a semi with no driver\n[laughter] I mean jeeze icy day could you imagine that truck barreling down behind you know and if there's one technical full paw just one it's going to rearrange you and you're out of it in a mini Cooper ... year history\nThat's that's what the truckers are telling me that people in the trucking industry say first time a truck takes out of school bus it's over it it's just not going to happen you know we're we're we're dreaming\nAnd a lot of truck drivers helped unload whenever they're carrying you know I've seen I've seen trucks at night stopping off at the let's say like subway and they're you know the truck is parked there in the truck driver guy is loading everything in the store\nI mean how how is he has a driverless trucks going to do that\nIt it's not it it just not going to do it you know hey hey can I go back to China for just a minute yeah please okay one of the\nThings that that a A R is troubling demographers about China right now is there are a from\nA forty years old and under there about Ninety million uh um men are males\nOr without that have no prospect of marrying because there's no female counterpart because of of either gender based abortion or is simply infanticide\nNinety million where are they they're in the military and that it's there there is just a ton and and ... that that is what happens when you have an imbalance in your population so that's another factor that China is dealing\nWith do you see another major war breaking oh\nNo I just I I I ... and\n... yeah I just don't see any reason to do it well I'll tell you what what what I Do see is I think the future of the earth or is the Americans and that is a you know Canada United States Mexico central and South America or we're self sufficient we don't need a Middle Eastern energy anymore we don't need the oil\nWe we've got water yeah we've got water we've got fracking we're we're almost impossible to invade because we're surrounded by water it it just it I don't know\nI Am one of those always missiles no guinea [laughter] yeah yeah but I I don't know it just doesn't seem to be any reason for for for that to to to take place even even with wackos like like a Kim Jong hut on and on North Korea I don't see that happening\nAre and if in fact I say I what\nI say in in Korea is going to be a unification of the north in the south [noise] do you know that the south is not having children\nThere for her that oh you sound like about one to\nHere's my concern although not from a country but from some terrorist group then obtains new ... or something like that and they do it and trying to planted on another country\nThat could happen that concerns me\nYeah that that could happen but what concerns me is a demographer is if if you have a South Korea with you know is having one child per couple you cannot maintain a market economy on a shrinking population\nIt has to grow so I don't know what's going to happen there with the north in the south I really don't North Korea is about ... they're they're right or just above replacement level fertility\nMichael a Jamestown North Carolina hey Michael go ahead\nYes Hi uh George and higher I guess I'm Hi my question is that uh is the\nTrend going to continue to where people are moving out of the north east into like down south and west coast of Florida is now the third most populous state outbreak in New York state and Phoenix has become the largest city out raking or Philadelphia\nPeople are moving to the warmer weather Bruce Kenny\n... that that is exactly correct in in in my new book the book that came out last year called upside profiting from the pound demographic shift ahead\nWe cover every single state if you go from Virginia all the way down to Florida go over to ... California Nevada Arizona and New Mexico\nOr the populations are going to increase the population of of Florida is going to go from twenty million to thirty million while or buy real estate bite in Florida now\nAnd just sit on it yeah it said I was in the the uh\nUh an interesting concept is the fact that the the the senior citizens in Florida are now Seventy five two Ninety five I had a real estate journalist or give me a bus and she said one is the baby boomer influence on Florida real estate going to be going to ask what is it one more big into\nYou know ... and I told her I said listen it hasn't started\n... ... ... does is going to be huge\n... it's going to be off the charts with the same thing is happening with healthcare elder care and death care\nFor a Vegas is that a good market\nShoot off the charts huge can't believe it I it it for one or if it's cheap there are plenty of job or a ...

you for that and for sure be my friend I really appreciate that\nWell uh yeah thank you very much and uh yeah thank you for having me on on the program I I I Love the show\nI'm looking forward to this is who says you got to tell me why me with the incredible background that you have in so many different things how did you get interested and involved in the paranormal\nWell it ... the paranormal it's been happening to me my whole life it started at age four with my first paranormal experiences and Angelica experience a near death experience\nAnd just from that point on it just the the things had been happening randomly but quite frequently and uh I've always had it on the back burner I you know I've been doing all these other things\nAnd have a lot of different interests and it's always been on the back burner but it wasn't until recently that I decided to finally put these all these experiences together into a book\nAnd a and then started talking openly you know not just with a couple of friends or family others but to to students and actually I I teach a class now at the college I'm On the paranormal that's been a very popular just started this this semester\nA lotta people Bruce or little hesitant to come out and talk about their paranormal experiences some of them you know pilots they don't want to talk about UFO experiences as there's been a problem for you since you've come out and talked about this\nUh it it hasn't been I I understand the the the nervousness it or the fear even that they would have it I was a I was afraid of that uh that maybe people wouldn't take my work seriously\nOr where that I'd be ridiculed or the administration would find a way to maybe I I get an early retirement or something but I haven't found that to be to be true at all I I think what has happened is that people now see me as a safe person to share their experiences with and they often do so privately\nOr some of them actually I have two colleagues that are taking the paranormal class that I'm teaching a\nTwo two of my colleagues at at the college so I it's been a very positive experience that I get the most\nNegative thing I can think about there was a\nA a friend of mine her daughter's a graduate student in history and she told her mother that uh well I think he's just committed academic suicide you know that was the perspective of a graduate student I can understand that you're just starting out in your doctoral program that's something you probably don't want to tell your your graduate advisor\n[noise] you know as as it's happening now Bruce and as you probably know the field of the paranormal and the activities and the studies\nIt's really growing now isn't it\nI I I I Believe it is and it's and it's gaining acceptance and it's it's always had the in the scientific community of which you know I I I have friends in the scientific community I'm not a I'm a social scientist you know historian\nUh but uh it from what I gather there there's always been a tremendous interest in the scientific community but it but a reluctance\nTo ah to do much with it in fact I think ah my friend dean ... who's the chief scientist at ions good guy he uh\nYeah seven he said they're Seventeen thousand five hundred institutions of higher learning in the world and there is only fifty\nFive zero academics openly interested in studying site and some of those are skeptics so that's a very small percentage fifty out of at Seventeen thousand five hundred uh schools uh in in in ... or colleges and universities\nAnd from what he told me there's only five or six her normal courses being offered in the United states right now which is very surprising\nAt one point Duke University had a department that's got to eat all of this ... under GB Rhine and now it's not there anymore but there is still the ... Institute thank God to study some of these things\nYeah no I it's it but I I think there is an eye confirmed this with with dean because he's doing and then you know he's traveling around the world talking about his research and very actively engaged in this research and there seems to be a and I suggested to him there seems to be like a paradigm shift going on of of gaining acceptance\nAnd I think people are are increasingly you know professional people are are are increasingly a supporting the research and and talking about their experiences more more openly\nWell and I and I look at this program you know six hundred and twenty radio stations we're on we're podcasting were on the Internet are there other podcast she was out there dealing with the paranormal\nUh millions of listeners it's growing it's getting bigger and bigger and I think people Bruce are looking for answers that they can't find and other traditional places\nI've ... I I think you're you're right and that's\nExactly what I've seen as people have come forward to you know colleagues and uh I've I've made a a I've made contacts with our um our custodial staff or at at that work at the college at night and they have incredible stories that I just that ah it's just as kind of blown me away and I never would have\nKnown and less somebody had said oh you should talk to a you know Mr D or whatever he he works in this building at night and he's got some story so it's like they're telling their friends who are then calling me and and saying hey I got something I Want to share with you so I think it's I I think once\nMore people in positions of authority or or you know academics are professional people or express their interest in and their support I think it's going to it's going to spread a lot faster\nWell with Bruce ... latest book is called timeless paranormal personal history he relates thirty four issues and cases that he had and just an incredible thing because in the beginning you say that it's not that you don't believe in ghosts they believe in she tells me about that\nYeah I I think that uh it it well in fact it's my my my uh spirit friends who I I I Do have contact with a they told me that experience is believing and believing is experience\nSo this this initial experience I had at age four kind of open the floodgates for me and even though I tried to every once in a while put it on the back burner\nAh because I didn't seem to have much control or just happened randomly these things uh it just kept coming back so they just kept coming back instead of a you know it it you know ... regardless of whether I wanted it to or not\nAnd then I just kind of accepted this is the ... this was the way my life is going to be and I just proceeded doing other things but it was always there and the background I think I was always destined to to explore this at a certain point in my life and ... and ... in the last couple of years that's that has been the the point at which to do this\nFirst one did you have if you can remember your first paranormal experience how old were you\nYeah that I was very I I was four but I Would and uh we had traveled to northern Norway or to an island two hundred miles above the Arctic Circle my parents are are from northern Norway from that island and we were staying with my grandmother for live there about nine months so it was a winter time\nAnd I was playing outside and I remember very distinctly what was going on and I I was a I got very sick very suddenly I I just my body was getting stiff and achy Mike I couldn't move my head from side to side my neck was totally step I had this fever coming on\nAnd I went home and I got home to the old farmhouse we were staying my grandmother's home\nAnd she had this little bed in the in the kitchen in the old farmhouse kitchen because sometimes she would you know it should be baking for a long time and just wanted to take a little nap and it's too hard to go up the steep stairs to the upper part of the house so anyway I was lying down there and I just kept feeling worse and worse than my\nBy the relatives came over and they said oh this is what happened to your eldest brother and then the next day he died and somebody said oh and that's what happened to\nUncle ... then when he got polio you know they would just scaring the heck out of me and my and my parents and my grandmother and um so I just I drifted off to sleep a crime myself to sleep I thought I was going to die and then in in the night uh I I I woke up and there was\nThis really bright light up in the in the ceiling and uh between the beams and this old farmhouse kitchen\nAnd ah it I felt like I it it was an end jelly presents it it was it was very bright it was very warm I felt like everything was going to be okay it took away all my fear and uh and I went to sleep and I slept soundly and when I woke up I was completely fine\nAnd and my mother and my grandmother said it was it was a miracle and that it was the guardian angel that had had saved me so that was the first experience and experience and I never questioned it I just said okay that's\nWhat happens and I think that's what open the floodgates and and and and also my mother was very psychic too she wasn't a practicing psychic a right to see 'em\nThere's always there seems to be somebody in the family who has this ability and it kind of passes down genetically doesn't it\nI I I Believe it does because her mother was also that way she was an herbalist she was a healer so and and and this is a very remote island at that point in the sixties they're the only way onto the island was by a\nA small plane or by a a ferry or vote or there was no bridge to that island so there's very remote there is no hospital so uh you know they they needed the services of folk healers and and and that's what my grandmother did my mother's mother\nPerson I don't know what I

I went to breakfast with my uh uh friends are just like a continental breakfast and I told them about this nightmare\nAnd then we proceeded to the uh the base and uh we were on a tour when the sirens went off and they closed off the base and we went back to the education center and saw what was happening on nine eleven so\nSo that was my um\nMy pre cognitive or premonition dream it wasn't specifically about airplanes or buildings but it certainly was\nA the you know in a very apocalyptic event that or or life changing and world changing event and later I learned that this was there were many people around the world who had a nightmare as some more much more specific\nThan mine but that very morning that this happened\nSo there there is my daughter had none of those two we didn't know what you're saying yeah we didn't know what it was Bruce but uh she she she had the vision she was in the in the city were ashes falling down on her she said it was about a foot deep\nUm but you know then then you like a day later it happened and she said that was it\nYeah yeah some people\nHad it that morning some people had it a few days before the day before but\nThere's there's so many people around the world who have who have a verified that this that this happened to them and\nSo there is something to that this is the ... that people had since that and and and I'm On a massive scale so which is and it's been studied uh I think a dean rating talks about in one of his books I I I Can't remember which one of his books but you know he does talk about that\nWhat do you think ...

camping on the Oregon Coast we'd have wonderful camping trips\nOn the uh uh Oregon Coast in at night my mom would bring out the deck of cards and we would uh try to read each others' minds so she would send you know she'd have a card she'd look at it and send me the you know try to send me with what the card was and a\nWet well above chance we would get the the suit right we would get the sometimes the number or the or the ... you know whether it was a king or jak face card\nA very often we get we get it a right to the to the point where it would make my dad upset because he was a very practical carpenter a blue collar guy no nonsense and he let us do it for a while and then once we had got a few hits he'd say okay that's it stop it\nNo more yeah he did he said when dad said stop if we had to stop a and my my mom you know so I had a special kind of relationship with my mom dealing with that and that she's the one that I think really cultivated it and I I that's where I got it from it so it wasn't for my dad I got the story telling thing from my dad that's how I ended up being a history teacher but\nI think I got the psychic stuff from my my mom\nDid you have a big foot

left a little bit of a sudden right on the edge of the road like with its feet on the on the pavement was this very tall creature and it was Harry and it was a very dark\nBut it was definitely a living creature and it and it was wearing of all things that was wearing a hat\nAnd a ... it was just kind of leaning into the truck is we drove by and it couldn't have been more than you know maybe a foot away from the you know my side view mirrors I drove by\nAnd or the immediately I I I I woke up my girlfriend and I said I I think I just saw big foot\nAnd and she she said what what are you talking about big foot I said well I think I thought I'm going to turn around and go back and then she she [laughter] she said no no that's okay just keep drive me\nAnd I said well we got to find a hotel there is one here another miles from here and she goes no no you keep going you keep going and uh so we kept driving but but later\nI found out that that that particular location near Oric was only I think about ten miles away from the location where that that one of the most famous big foot or videos is from\nThe Paterson given one yeah exactly yeah we'll be talking with them that this was in fact\nThere's been yeah there's been more siting there than than any other place in in the United states as far as I understand from what the ... the uh the reading that I did about it so now if it if it was a hoax\nOr this guy's taking a big chance by stand right on that on the edge of the highway and the dark total dark\nYup uh and they get shot out or anything she got\nRun over crazy you know

as well as we talk about time was the paranormal world just so many different kinds of paranormal stories you had a a lifetime of activity Bruce\nYeah I'm kind of I've I've kinda been a a a lightning rod for the paranormal that's how it someone described it and I agree with that description\nTell me about the open casket story\nYeah the open casket or\nThe title alone kind of makes you shiver [laughter]\nWell I grew up in a in a um [noise] in our region American community and we had this this older man who passed away and he was a good friend of the family and I he was a very very nice man and uh\nWe were at his funeral was the first uh open casket funeral it I'd ever been to and I was sitting next to my mother I'm not sure exactly what my father was a he might have been there too but I don't I just remember my mother sitting next to me\nAnd as we were going through the service and you know I the widow was crying and you know that that all the emotion of it all of a sudden I heard this a very distinct voice a very\nHeavy Norwegian accent and it was the man who had died that was in the casket and he was also to me and he said\nAh ah Bruce it's it's it's okay I'm okay there's nothing to be afraid of uh uh I'm okay and uh I I I I looked I kinda I looked around and looked at my mom and\nShe you know and I didn't ask her if she heard it I just kind of looked at her and she kinda nodded at me so I'm not sure what that meant\nBut ah I didn't actually ask her about it but and then he said it again there's nothing to be afraid of everything is going to be okay and he said it and then that typical you know Norwegian accent and uh but I was looking at him and of course he you know he was just in the casket and and dead but\nSo I I definitely heard his voice and um\nIt it it was\nKind of comforting in a way but very uh I'm not going to say frightening but very bizarre\nIt would be weird wasn't it\nYeah it was weird I Can't say I was afraid but it was it was very enlightening knowing that okay he's I don't think he's lying I think he is okay wherever he is and I wasn't quite sure at that time\nI I I think I Know now that are often times I've heard that um that people who have recently passed away do like to uh appear at their their funerals just to check everybody out\nSee what the suit was they're very curious\nI think I Would be curious to\nTell me about your paranormal class at the citrus college\nSure um\nWell it's kinda paranormal ended up itself that the college let me do it but uh\nWell do you have to fight for it\nI didn't really have to fight that was that that was the thing now it's it's a community education course so it's not like for college transfer credit but it is not for that at the college\nAnd I am a tenured professor there and and I think there are a little bit surprised that I I proposed it but this is part of my plan you know that started two years ago with the writing of this book\nSo I I've always wanted to do this and I I approached them and I said well they say well we've never done this before but we think it might be a pretty popular I said well I Hope so let's give it a shot and so I thought well maybe I'll get\nMaybe twenty people in there you know maybe if I'm lucky and that's about the standard size that most of these classes get but ah as it turned out we have thirty five people and there was a waiting list\nI probably could have had a hundred people if we could have accommodated them in this classroom but thirty five is a pretty is a pretty good number including two of my colleagues\nAnd and these people are from all walks of life I mean just the cross section of of of Southern California or younger people and and older people of different ethnicities and\nAnd uh and and and races and just it ... they all have one thing in common they ... they've either had these experiences a lot of them or they're very curious about it but there are a couple that are a little\nSkeptical including one of my colleagues he's no longer that skeptical I'll tell\nYou that after six weeks in the or seven weeks in the course into the course\nUm and uh it it it's been a wonderful experience that really what it what it turns out to be is you know I I present different theories about different types of paranormal phenomenon I relate my experiences they they read my book\nAnd we talk about that but the big part of it for them is having a safe place to share their stories\nAnd that's the biggest thing that I've seen that's that's what they like they like to come there and they like to share their stories and it's a safe and an environment where we all we don't judge anybody we just listen if they ask for any comments or you know what are your perceptions about this we we relate to them and\nSo

thirty I mean think\nAbout really isn't that high on that ... that's a clip from Twenty years ago right\nOh yeah I I said listen you want you you want to hassle of women there so you don't do it but we wish you have to take into consideration is is that women\nAre going to run things there's there's absolutely no question about that because they are going to be the most educated I mean the glass ceiling has been shattered for a long time but we're starting to see many many more women come into CEO positions\nAnd they're good one yeah oh excellent with absolutely excellent month and and uh\nSo

want it you want it now you don't you want it for free you're a liberal and then once you're about ten years old and you have a some positions that the other kids don't deserve suddenly become a

because they're coming of age to vote and we're losing their conservative every sixteen seconds because they're dying\nSo on and all we're we're going to be a nation of liberals\nWhy can't people just

demographic blunder and a history of the world with that one child policy\nThey did it for about forty years so what what they have in effect under forty years old down to about three years old which is like three years ago they they change the policy what now they're letting their populace have as many kids\nNow they're desperate but uh how's it going to catch up\nNow you can't fix it because you you you you can't suddenly um you know people are born babies and I bought his adult\n'cause they're not buyers that's for sure\nNo so what what you have is is they're missing now and it's this is a real number on a five hundred\nMillion people that were born five hundred million and a half billion so so it here's here's how it works in any country I don't care if you're if you're a Polynesian islands or you're you're a United States you need to have heavy lifters you need to have people\nThat make big incomes and have a big houses and could simulate state federal and local tax I mean China is run on tax just like the United states has but what they've done is they've eliminated a half billion taxpayers a half billion people that would go into their labor force and a half billion consumers\nAre and the ... the starting in about twenty Fifteen twenty sixteen their labor force is starting to shrink it had been expanding for years and years [noise] so what's gonna happen\nWell we'll let cooked himself because they're going to have a sexually a quarter of a billion elderly if they've got to support that can support themselves and now they they they have a whole new crop of of kids that can't support themselves and who's supposed to pay the tax\nGeez now what could happen in how could this affect us militarily would try to I mean would they do something desperate\nYeah ... whenever a country gets in trouble um ... with their economy the first thing that they do is they saber rattling which is what they're doing\nAnd that's right and then go to war\nYeah they well they may they may not go to war because you know how many wars China has one and in China's history zero they've never won a war I\nI don't know what's going to happen there but but it's it's it's a it's essentially the same thing that's happening in South Korea and it's the same thing that's happening in Japan and that is a they don't have enough people to to feed their system there there are the kind of he's not going to work period\nNo it's not let's take some calls this hour come ruin in here for the guinea let's go to ... in Grand Rapids Michigan to get things started Hi Dana\nHi Hi George I hope you're well I Am well I Hope you are too high okay thank you thanks guys hey can I have I called because\nI have a phone compact with you um but just scare me out and then I'll listen to your response\nSo two things um that irritated me one was at a you mentioned the president having a Twitter war um he's not a diplomat so all of those politicians that have looked us in the I I Can't do that\nAs a human being or as a Christian but I'm saying this as a Christian and a woman I wanted to see two things first of all I'm he called her a horse face she was trying to jump start her career uh um the porn star\nBecause she had nowhere to go and needed cash fast and that lawyer is what Italians referred to as an old fashioned grease off he thought he was actually going to that he was he put Iran and possibly win a presidential nomination for the Democrats\nUm this was sold the word self serving isn't strong enough for ... both of those guys yet and all they had was temporarily side tracked\nI'm a booming economy or try to bring down that's nan but more importantly Batman has kids actually a little one still at home I yeah and that little one buddy young wives\nAnd crude and his wife\nAnd we had to presidents had said something so by all it can even be talked about on on on radio in the oval office while I was paying for him with my tax dollars and everybody said oh she has a right to a private life this guy did pass if he did that\nWas over a decade about so I don't have a problem with him saying whatever you want because you have to remember\nFrom its reactionary he doesn't start fights you look at everything from his campaign going forward he has reactionary if you have found him he's going to come back at you that's human nature of the second thing I disagree that is sad\nIs that I'm ... now I'm not a senior in high school by it and it but I'm the I'm not that old either\nWhen I was a senior in high school I said that this country is nothing more than the things is that and it should be run like a business I have started to successful business as myself is that men and women don't have time for nine states\nYou'd get a deal dies we're not going to have a needing to have a meeting to have a meeting and then to pick up committee and then this and that we don't have time for that they're spending our money and\nSo the fact that you're saying we need more diplomacy that policy does when ward diplomacy doesn't save money we need a businessman I voted for him because he said no nonsense that is that anyone that was bankrupt it four times and they had\nThe audacity to get back up and get on the horse\nI thought I I have\nIncredible admiration for people that are fighters in a dish and she doesn't care if people call him a racist\nBecause God Knows what than it is hard and other people know that ... ... it doesn't matter about just diplomacy she knows who he is as I as a man and and uh and as a prize of that\nSo I disagree with you on both of those um things\nFor and let's get let's get his comments data in your comments are warranted obviously and you have a right to say these things with genuine a jumping\n[noise] well ... ... regarding running it but I'm the country as a business I think he did to run the country as a country that the the single biggest enemy to any country or in period is corruption and the business model does not protect us from corruption\nI think one of the things that when people say you run the country as business let me give you an example I I think you know most businesses are bottom line oriented\nYou're not going to pay thirty thousand dollars for a screwdriver or a toilet a fair market value or even try to get it for the last one I think when people say let's let the country run as a business\nThey're talking about things like that we're let's not waste money as a nation\nYeah I Would I Would respect that I I Would I Would agree with that as well but it would also say that that our country is a republic with a constitution and the constitution works what we have the best country on earth we have the best system on earth\nAnd the thing that frightens me about it a ... a a a government run like a business is that the business model cannot protect you against corruption but the but the um Republican camp that that's that's my position on that\nRight and you want to comment on that you want to comment on the president's tweeting\nYeah you know I I don't disagree with with um ah the fact that this you know porn star and in our attorney or self serving they absolutely are self serving what I Wish our president would do is just\nNot areas you know this dirty laundry in public I just wish it wouldn't happen\nWell ... ... ... let me ask you this devil's advocate in by the way I've commented on his tweeting too because I I think he needs to be a little more presidential he's got some great ideas um don't know a lot of great ideas I don't agree with everything he says\nBut I'd rather be a little more presidential a little more dignified when in back off the tweeting and stuff like that but\nIf he let them spoke what they did without defending themselves then what happens to him\n[noise] I think that was in the punishment would be what they've said and and um [noise]\nUh I I don't know I think what he has done his\nOr at the argument and I and I don't think there is one\nI really don't\nKnow I mean somebody got paid a lot of money to to do what they did and she got it and I mean it was a reason for that who led to it

trucking trucking won't touch it\nWell no I support our truck drivers I don't want to see driverless trucks and I really don't have enough\nTruck driver you know what that what we\nNow would you like to have a truck behind you would know drivers sitting in it\nOr not going to do it might not you know we I have many you know what I mean he has little mini Cooper right\nI Am a mini Cooper GDP which is a high rise and I'm thinking to myself but by the first time I pull up next to I'm a semi with no driver\n[laughter] I mean jeeze an icy day could you imagine that truck barreling down behind you know and if there's one tactical full paw just one it's going to rearrange you and you're out of it in a mini Cooper ... year history\nThat's that's what the truckers are telling me that people in the trucking industry say first time a truck takes out a school bus it's over it it's just not going to happen you know we're we're we're dreaming\nAnd a lot of truck drivers helped unload whenever they're carrying you know I've seen I've seen trucks at night stopping off at the let's say like subway and they're you know the truck is park there and the truck driver guy is loading everything in the store\nI mean how how is he has a driverless trucks going to do that\nIt it's not it it just not going to do it you know hey hey can I go back to China for just a minute yeah please\nOkay one of the things that that a A R is troubling demographers about China right now is there are a from a forty years old and under there about Ninety million uh um men are males\nOr without that have no prospect of marrying because there's no female counterpart because of of either gender based abortion or is simply infanticide Ninety million where are they they're in the military\nAnd that it's there there is just a ton and and that that is what happens when you have an imbalance in your population so that's another factor that China is dealing with\nDo you see another means you're more breaking oh\nNo I just I I I ... and\n... yeah I just don't see any reason to do it well I'll tell you what what what I Do see is I think the future of the earth or is the Americans and that is a you know Canada United States Mexico central and South America\nOr we're self sufficient we don't need a Middle Eastern energy anymore we don't need the oil\nWe we've got water\nYeah we've got water we've got fracking we're we're almost impossible to invade because we're surrounded by water it it just it I don't know I\nAm one of those always missiles no guinea\n[laughter] yeah yeah but I I don't know it just doesn't seem to be any reason for the for for that to to to take place even even with wackos like like a Kim Jong hut on and on North Korea I don't see that happening are and if in fact I say I what I say in in Korea is going to be a unification of\nThe north in the south [noise] do you know that the south is not having children\nThere for ... heard that oh you sound like about one to\nHere's my concern though not from a country but from some terrorist group than obtains new ... or something like that and they do it and trying to planted on another country\nThat could happen that concerns me\nYeah that that could happen but what concerns me as a demographer is if if you have a South Korea with you know is that even one child per couple\nYou cannot maintain a market economy on a shrinking population you know possible it has to grow so I don't know what's going to happen there with the north and the south I really don't North Korea is about ... their their rights that are just above replacement level fertility\nMichael in Jamestown North Carolina he Michael go ahead\nYes Hi ah George and higher against um Hi my question is that uh is the trend going to continue where people are moving out of the north east into like down south and at West because like Florida is now the third most\nPopulous state ranking New York state and also a Phoenix has become the largest city out raking or Philadelphia\nPeople are moving to the warmer weather Bruce Kenny\n... that that is exactly correct it and in in my new book the book that came out last year called upside profiting from the profound demographic shifts the head we cover every single state if you go from Virginia all the way down to Florida go over to ... California Nevada or a\n[noise] Arizona and a New Mexico um the populations are going to increase the population of of Florida is going to go from twenty million to thirty million want to buy real estate bite in Florida now and just sit on it\nYeah instead of ... the the uh\nUh an interesting concept is the fact that the the the senior citizens in Florida are now Seventy five two Ninety five I had a real estate journalist or give me a bus and she said one is the baby boomer influence on Florida real estate going to ... you're not going to ask what is it when when one of the big into\nYou know ... and I told her I said listen it hasn't started if\nYou're a woman does it's going to be huge\n... it's going to be off the charts what's the same thing that's happening with healthcare elder care and death care\nWhat our Vegas is that a good market\nHuge off the charts huge can't believe it I it it's a for one uh it it's cheap there are plenty of jobs or a ... I go there all the time my brother has a house there uh yeah Vegas is is unbelievable\nSuper All right Ken thanks keep in touch with us so you're always welcome on the program guinea\nYou I I Love it

I Want\nTo run over that nobody got stopped me nobody got soldiers people\nNow that's the first college course in the country designed specifically for recently returned veterans\nBruce first of all I Want to thank you for that and for sure be my friend I really appreciate that\nWell uh yeah thank you very much and that yeah thank you for having me on on the program I I I Love this show\nI'm looking forward to this is just as you you got to tell me why me with the incredible background that you have in so many different things how did you get interested and involved in the paranormal\nWell it's ... the paranormal it's been happening to me my whole life it started at age four with my first paranormal experiences and Angelica experience a near death experience\nAnd just from that point on it just the the things have been happening randomly but quite frequently and uh I've always had it on the back burner I you know I've been doing all these other things\nAnd have a lot of different interests and it's always been on the back burner but it wasn't until recently that I decided to finally put these all these experiences together into a book\nAnd a and then started talking openly you know not just with a couple of friends or family members but to to students than actually I I teach a class now at the college I'm On the paranormal if it's been a very popular just started this this semester\nA lot of people Bruce or little hesitant to come out and talk about the paranormal experiences some of them you know pilots they don't want to talk about UFO experiences as there's been a problem for you since you've come out and talked about this\nAh it it hasn't been I I understand the the the nervousness it or the fear even that they would have it I was a I was afraid of that that maybe people wouldn't take my work seriously or or that I'd be ridiculed or the administration would find a way to maybe I I get an early retirement or something but\nI haven't found that to be to be true at all I I think what has happened is that people now see me as a safe person to share their experiences with and they often do so privately\nOr some of them actually I have two colleagues that are taking the paranormal class that I'm teaching 'em\nTo two of my colleagues at at the college so I it's been a very positive experience I guess the most\nNegative thing I can think about there was um a friend of mine her daughter's a graduate student in history and she told her mother that uh well I think he's just committed academic suicide [laughter]\nYou know that was the perspective of a graduate student I can understand that you're just starting out in your doctoral program that's something you probably don't want to tell your your graduate advisor\nYou know as as it's happening now Bruce and as you probably know the fields of the paranormal and the activities and the studies it's really growing now isn't it\nI I I I Believe it is and it's and it's gaining acceptance and it's it's always had the in the scientific community up of which you know I I I have friends in the scientific community I'm not a I'm a social scientist you know historian\nA but from what I gather there there's always been a tremendous interest in the scientific community but it but a reluctance\nTo uh to do much with it in fact I think ah my friend\nDean raped and who is the chief scientist at ions good guy he uh\nYeah seven he said there's Seventeen thousand five hundred institutions of higher learning in the world and there's only fifty\nFive zero academics openly interested in studying site and some of those are skeptics so that's a very small percentage fifty out of at Seventeen thousand five hundred uh schools uh in in in ... or colleges and universities\nAnd from what he told me there's only five or six paranormal courses being offered in the United states right now which is very surprising\nAt one point Duke University had a department that's got to eat all of this under GB Rhine and now it's not there anymore but there are still did J. B. Ryan Institute thank God to study some of these things\nNo I it's it but I I think there is an eye confirmed this with with dean because he's doing and and you know he's traveling around the world talking about his research in very actively engaged in this research and there seems to be a and I suggested to me seems to be like a paradigm shift\nShift going on of of gaining acceptance and I think people are are increasingly you know professional people are are are increasingly are you supporting the research and and talking about their experiences more more openly\nWell and I and I look at this program you know six hundred and twenty radio stations we're on we're podcasting were on the Internet uh there are other podcast himself they're dealing with the pure normal\nUh millions of listeners it's growing it's getting bigger and bigger and I think people Bruce are looking for answers that they can't find and other traditional places\nI I I think you're you're right and that's exactly what I've seen as people have come forward to you know colleagues and ah I've I've made a I've made contacts with our um our custodial staff or at at that work at the college at night and they\nHave incredible stories that I just that ah it's just as kind of blown me away and I never would have known and less somebody had said oh you should talk to a you know Mr D or whatever he's he works in this building at night and he's got some stories so it's like they're telling their friends\nWho are then calling me and and saying hey I got something I Want to share with you so I think it's\nI I I think once\nMore people in positions of authority or or you know academics are professional people uh express their interest in in their support I think it's gonna it's going to spread a lot faster\nWith Bruce ... latest book is called timeless a paranormal personal history he relates thirty four issues and cases that he had been just an incredible thing because in the beginning you say that it's not that you don't believe in ghosts they believe in ... to tell me about that\nYeah I I think that uh it it well in fact it's my my my uh spirit friends who I I I Do have contact with a they told me that experience is believing and believing\nIs experience so this this initial experience I had at age four kind of open the floodgates for me and even though I tried to every once in a while put it on the back burner\nOr because I didn't seem to have much control it just happened randomly these things ah it just kept coming back so they just kept coming back instead of a you know it it you know ... regardless of whether I wanted it to or not\nAnd then I just kind of accepted this is the ... this was the way my life is going to be and I just proceeded doing other things but it was always there in the background I think I was always destined to to explore this at a certain point in my life and and the last couple of years that's that has been the the the point which to do this\nWhen did you have if you can remember your first paranormal experience how old were you\nYeah that I was very young I was four but I ... and uh we had traveled to northern Norway or to an island two hundred miles above the Arctic Circle my parents are are from northern Norway from that island and we were staying with my grandmother for lived there about nine months so it was a winter time\nAnd I was playing outside and I remember very distinctly what was going on and I I was a I got very sick very suddenly I I just my body was getting stiff and achy Mike I couldn't move my head from side to side my neck was totally step I had this fever coming on\nAnd I went home and I got home to the old farmhouse we were staying my grandmother's home\nAnd she had this little bed in the in the kitchen and the old farmhouse kitchen because\nSometimes she would you know it should be baking for a long time and just wanted to take a little nap and it's too hard to go up the steep stairs to the upper part of the house so anyway I was lying down there and I just kept feeling worse and worse than my\nBy the relatives came over and they said oh this is what happened to your eldest brother and then the next day he died and somebody said oh and that's what happened to\nUncle ... then when he got polio you know and they would just scaring the heck out of me and my and my parents and my grandmother and um so I just I drifted off to sleep or you know crying myself to sleep\nAnd I thought I was going to die and then in in the night uh I I I woke up and there was this really bright light up in the in the ceiling and uh between the beams and this old farmhouse kitchen\nAnd ah it I felt like I it it was an angelic presence ... it was it was very bright it was very warm I felt like everything was going to be OK took away all my fear and uh and I went to sleep and I slept soundly and when I woke up I was completely fine\nAnd and my mother and my grandmother said it was it was a miracle and that it was the guardian angel that had had saved me so that was the first experience and experience and I never questioned it I just said okay that's that's\nWhat happens and I think that's what open the floodgates and and and also my mother was very psychic too she wasn't a practicing psychic right to see 'em\nThere's always this seems to be somebody in the family who has this ability and it kind of passes down genetically doesn't it\nI I I Believe it does because her mother was also that way she was an herbalist she was a healer so in ... and this is a very remote island at that point in the sixties they're the only way onto the island was by a\nA small plane or buy a ferry boat or there was no bridge to that island so there's very remote there's no hospital so uh you know they they needed the services of folk healers and and and that's what my grandmother did my mother's mother\nAn eternal now and and that that's what I felt like and I and then I thought\nThis was probably this is an example of a fork in the road of time because then another dimension which\nWe might have had this horrible accident in ... you know it it it potentially at least the potential forty five miles an hour oh at each other like that or you know that there could have been people killed\nAnd it's at least seriously injured and ah and we were unscathed and so were the other two cars thank God but um so it so I I I ...\nThat is what I'm Talking about and I had other experiences that you know when I was younger I I at eight years old I had another uh experience where I I uh uh was playing around it was in ah I'm\nUp at deception pass I'm from Washington state and deception passing the north end to with the island there is a to bridge fans that go from the mainland to\nWhip the island the north end and there's a middle island called pass island and we always used to stop there when when we went camping and we we'd run around and it was beautiful you know you could overlook the narrow channels that\nThat that separate the island from the mainland and I was running around and of course in those days early sixties there were no safety fences or guard rails to speak on for the\nExactly ...\nI was running right towards the cliff and I remember running off the cliff and then\nEverything was I was just like suspended in in in in in mid air was like everything stopped and once again I felt this this light in this warm and the next thing I knew it was like everything it stopped and then all of a sudden boom like in fast motion I was back on the trail and my
