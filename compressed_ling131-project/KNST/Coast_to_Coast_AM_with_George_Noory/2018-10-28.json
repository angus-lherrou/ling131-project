I I think what was ... I I mean I I it's it's it's just it's still very solemn to me that you know the innocent people were hanged who were protesting their innocence and that the real the people who had confessed to being which is we're ... let out of\nJail then it's kind of you if you can test instead yet was really sorry about that then you go but it's only people said no I'm not going to get ... and I've never been a which those are the people who ended up dying for the most part I mean there's a large percentage of them in any\nWay you did write that as an avenue wants the tragedy of these people who did the right thing you know stuck out for their believe all the things are told to do in your life and it ended badly for them um which is why you know Arthur Miller's crucible of such a great work of a literature in place is because he tapped right into that kind of idea that these guys did the right thing\nAnd by doing the right thing they ended up at the end of a rope on a hill you know O'Neill America\nWhich the or the end the population you said under about fifty thousand but of balloons up to two hundred and fifty during the\nThe Halloween or ... ... ... the month long festivity of Halloween\nIs is there in Salem is there any other time of year where they they see that kind of bumped like that or is it just is like a it's a I mean I realize that they always kind of get a steady stream of tourists but as this they're big season this this this October you know these thirty one days October\nOh mathematically I mean some some this is only open in October and can make their whole year in October\nShot up really\nThey've been getting more and more a year round kind of tourist impulse not just for the stuff but for the maritime stuff they've amazing restaurant scene they have the ninth largest art museum by area in the country so they have like a lot of like kind of\nYou know arrows and their whole started to pull a tourist and still happens their biggest one is October which\nWill never go well\nI Do really I mean that's like a ... there are state fairs that have that right where people open up a booth at a state there they can make their entire year in the weeks that the teacher is open and I I I Would never guess their shops that are just open for one month in in ...\nYeah but it but other but they're realizing there's so many tourists coming to say on the court for a year but now they're starting to open longer if you go in the summertime you'll still see the shops are still open you might even feel haunted house opened the monster museum ... so they're starting to realize that they can do this year round that film grows and becomes more even\nBigger in popular culture than it is now\nWhat's not cool in Salem what are the rules a lake or curbs that they they are either written or unwritten about how people are just you know ... or to or how they want\n... just to be in in Salem\nYeah and they're they're getting better and better at that is figuring that especially like to be around if you're on the other time of year there's not that many curb\nBut in October for instance they are the burial ground which was the old seventeenth century um graveyard right in the middle of town and fail and this year they had to like put a cap on how many people could be in the grave at a time because it was just getting overrun and people were like using the grave as you know picnic table\nAnd climbing on them and doing all kinds of bad stuff to an actual historical artifacts but that there is on Halloween Night they have a curfew I think it's around\nTen pm that if you're not in front of a bar in federal part of you couldn't be on the streets for those shoot fireworks in the air to kind of how people have the nights over ... start heading to the train and start having their cars for their that's\nReally good at ten pm\nYeah I Believe that the ten pm yeah it it might be a little later maybe eleven but yeah they're trying to get for pushing the hundred thousand people to the train you take some time though by midnight nobody around on Halloween\nIs ironic did they make everybody get off the streets of Salem before the wishing our\nYeah yeah it was [laughter] it just gets a bath [laughter] you're not really that there are they going to\nGet them up before the ... or maybe the two and the real wishing happens after all the tourists Lee J double the locker or and or Edgar Award winning author thank you so much a season with the which the magic and mayhem of Halloween and Salem, Massachusetts it is now on my bucket list things do you like I didn't have enough of my bucket list [laughter]\nThings are and have a great night banked I'm checking off one when I go to ... in a couple of weeks I'll let you know about that coming up later on in November when I'll be back on Halloween of starting on Thanksgiving weekend on ... ...

the twenty nine charges Rob Bowers faces the forty six year old charged with opening fire inside a synagogue in Pittsburgh this is what it sounded like on police radio\nAnd one of the things I learned that sets true crime apart from great reporting is advocacy and proper journalism must stay focused on the facts of a murder and the prosecution of potential murderers so the result is a resistance to the expression\nOf sentiment you know the the\nOr sensationalism emotional manipulation of the accused because that could result in somebody not getting a fair trial this is why this is why journalism stresses terms like alleged and allegedly and how it is choose\nMainstream\nYou know notions of what sensationalism means stories that inflamed the senses right that sensational journalism the kind of news writing that stresses emotions over information risks riling the public up unnecessarily in it at one point by the way\nThis is a very real day to day concern regarding regarding the power of the press\nOr there was a time in us history not even a hundred years ago when angry mobs would storm a jail and Lynch somebody before trial ... just like you know the showdown in to kill a mocking bird or white or black Lynch mob justice is the opposite of the rule of law\nAnd journalism understood its place in keeping the public informed but at the same time call\nAnd letting the courts\nDo their work in educating some kind of justice our guest this hour by the way will attest to this because mob rule in lynchings played a key part in the injustices regarding the story of the men from the train\nUp but this is the same reason that love true crime and bear with me another minute or two where true crime reporting\nCan go where true crime story can tell something\nCrime reporting must not go right true crime\nIs allows for advocacy for justice giving victims of voice it's a central tenet to true crime before her death I interviewed I'm\nA true crime legend and rule about the conventions of great true crime writing an ad rules number one rule was that any true crime story you tell must be victims centric\nThe focus on the acts of the killer or a fetish size the details of somebody's death like a lot of these true crime shows do on TV where it's almost like crime porn\nRight they're really into all the blood and the wounds to a point where it starts to dehumanize the victim I think so I think true crime must always be about justice and on a day when eleven people are dead in\nA synagogue where they should have been saying the root cause sham that not run for your life\nOr all because of a story seemingly that had been told about a Jewish philanthropist George Soros we need to be mindful about this connection between the stories we tell and the unintended consequences that can happen\nOr these victims should burden our national heart for years they will mine\nWhen we tell the story of the shooting in Pittsburgh today we must remain victims centric\nJournalists need to be responsible in order to avoid whipping up torch bearing mobs right intent on lynching people accused of crimes but everybody in the media or anybody who uses social media needs to share that same sense of responsibility when it comes to conspiracy theories as well\nI'm not waiting and do a debate but who is responsible for today's mass shooting clearly the majority of the blame rests on the trigger finger of today's shooter but take it from me and my experience is on the radio it's\nImportant to be mindful about every thought seed you send out into the world that bears your name because once it hits the wind you'll never know where those thoughts seeds will take root that's what we know to be true\nThere's many other stories in the news this week that attest to that so not everything is a false flag up\nOnly a small percentage of such things I've ever happened not everything is die hard to that everything is a conspiracy if everything were conspiracy than we wouldn't have any media about it in fact the media\nWould be focused on what isn't a conspiracy right if everything was a conspiracy that old radio shows built around we don't have a conspiracy around this today\nSo I ask you whenever you talk about murder whenever you talk about up people who you believed to be\nGuilty of some thing\nStay victims centric in the stories that you tell and not just about the victims of crimes that have already happened in the case of true crime but stay victims centric about telling stories that could result in the victimization of somebody yet to come\nI ask you that in the name of all those people who died today\nSay a prayer for them if you will and they keep that in mind when we talk about the men from the train discovering America's

I had told my daughter that ... if\nYou walk the crimes back when you when he commits the first crime he will make mistakes that will give away who he is and I told her that\nBecause I Know from reading crime books and reading hundreds of crime books for very off of a serial murder when he convinced his first crime\nReveals who he is but then all the times he will be ... in the seventies he'd be sent to jail for five years and then he'd be out and start a series of crimes and he would coverage track so I I guess that that was what was going to happen in this case\n... we were just fantastically lucky\nAnd that is fresh crime happened to her the the two biggest newspaper towns in the country where New York and and Boston\nIs first crime occurred straight west of Boston straight north of New York\nAnd because of that both of New York and Boston papers covered it in depth and because of that there's lots and lots of information available about it and it's uncanny it's unbelievable how many points\nThat first murder matches up with against the eye out with uh with with all the last last murders and the series so uh we\nJust luck I mean we never in a million years expected to be able to find convincingly who was actually doing this but we found a evidence about this man and argued that this is Pam and almost nobody doesn't believe it because it's just there's lots of evidence\nAnd you so you found the arc type crimes for the prototype crushed right he and he modeled he he he perfected that crime then ... excessively after that it is is the use went forward and yet\n... there was kind of a mixed media rent I mean there's sometimes there were some times over guns involved\nIn all likelihood was carrying a gun all the time after about Nineteen oh five [noise] the ah\nWhile he used an ax who committed murders there are I think three crimes in which the man of the house was shot before he was hit in the head with an axe my belief is that he had a pistol stuck in his pocket or in his\nBelt or something that he would use if somebody was awake and could product yeah but um it was not what are you trying to do but it is why he would do if you had to do\nTo get back to some of the aspects of these crimes coming up next door but before I Do ... ... what did you hope to learn about\nThe human condition about people about crime what was that you thought you were going to learn when you went into researching and and being the first one to ... lead all these crimes together to determine you you found demand from the train\nThe what the general answered the question is the crime stories are fascinating to us because they they come from the parts of our of our ourselves that we don't like to talk about\nA all crime stories are about lost and greed and anger and hatred and all the things that are part of you and me I don't know you but\nThey are part of everybody that I've had the pleasure of knowing and and yet we we don't like to talk about them so\nWe cover them up crime stories expose those parts of ourselves that we are ashamed of the uh\nUh that's that's the general answer to why I'm obsessive reader crime but by the way of life book I read was the real crime but with the real world leader a it's a book by um that's why it's a A R rated Weinstein I could have a life name wrong\nOr the uh I I just screwed up her name I'm Sorry you know there should be a it'd be it\nAnd and one of the things I've learned from reading that is the white America Walker who was a an avid reader of crime stories\nUh Charles Dickens we're going to have him at an avid reader of crime stories or a Henry Fielding what it it's very common among writers to be avid reader Tolstoy was avid readers of crime stories because the ...\nWhat I just talked about that that they they tell us something about\nYou do get from a church somewhat\nBut the ... you don't get from\nSports I mean I live in the sports world for the most part and the sports world is\nIs about positive people trying to do positive things in general I mean we take a lot of abuse from people who don't understand it but but that is what we are and what we're trying to do with positive people try and do positive thing\nI'm willing to hang on to that thought on crime stories is this world picking up the men from the train discovering most Americans most elusive serial killer and there's one story or two here you need to know about before you go to bed and coast to coast\nMy name is ...

of a dichotomy of I'm working in the sports world is by day and writing crime at night\nOr the other thing that crime stories are very good because they they come from the parts of ourselves that we don't like to talk about and don't normally talk about\nThe man trying I didn't make a river and thought oh entry into the subject I just got her like a\nA I was I was a documentary about the murders in Boulder, Colorado a call ... living with a mystery it's an extremely well done a documentary and far above normal levels of crime documentary\nI was interested in it and it was clear that there was a part of the story that was my thing\nWhich is that it's relatively obvious that the ... murders are a part of a series so I started I was just going to put an hour and who and who's trying to learn more about the series but the the our became a week the week actually became five or six years\nOr so but I didn't I didn't decide to get into it I just wandered into it\nYou know it shows you a ... you can do you consider this a a true crime book sure\nYeah yeah you know and that's the interesting piece too is that true crime\nYou know the tradition for true crime is I discovered in in my research goes all the way back to execution sermons right sort of shares a similar DNA with American journalism\nUm except that in the case of true crime you know it was the it was the preachers who's the circuit riding preachers the ministers that would come to these towns in on the day of somebody's execution\nThey would do a sermon just before the execution that would try to provide the context for why this person was being executed\nAnd why the community overall would benefit from his or her desk\nAnd became became an important part of trying to understand\nExecutions in America and and this is where when the teachers decided there they used to just print up their sermons and people would snap them up and then you know what this will just sell it for a nickel and so they started to sell their execution sermons and then they would get passed around in these became some of the really best selling\nTrue crime near and is it it it just feels the same function is what you're doing in in demand from the tree and you're trying to bring in it even though which hundred plus years leader\nIn some cases you're trying to bring a kind of I'm kind of healing anyway not that anybody is still alive that was directly involved but for these communities maybe this just lingering sensitive some tragedy that it happened maybe some closure I'm On my\nOwn exactly what happened to their town and how their town was involved are not involved in in the the deaths of somebody that at one point you know were popular members of the community\nThe um ... there was an interesting thing that happened just a few weeks ago I actually got a letter from a man in London england who uh was a a a ... his great great\nAunt had been was one of the victims of crime engineer and he had always believed that uh uh the man who\nUh was accused of her murder and was locked up without any evidence for two years before he was released he always believe that he had gotten away with it and he said that reading it\nIn my book bag and our book that uh\nUh it wasn't that was not actually what had happened was just a tremendous relief twelve yeah it was that was a shock to me I hadn't thought about that\nBut it was it was this guy who said he was tremendously relieved to realize that it was just a a random crime and that this Manhattan actually that that ban hadn't actually gotten away with it was this other fellow at I don't know why it was important to him\nToo well I understand the understanding that sense it was important to have to know what had happened but you know one guy getting away with it or another guy getting away with it and punished I I've I don't know that there's a lot of different but it still didn't have that reaction to it\n[noise] yeah I think I could go ahead go ahead no please no a lot of the book and a lot of ...\nBook is about is is that all all books all good books are searched for understanding right a lot of the book is is trying to get people to understand the America in which these crimes occurred\nThey hurt a hundred years ago and ah I grew up in a small town very much like the crimes that these\n... that these murders occurred in\nAnd I grew up in them fifty sixty years ago so it's that sort of equal distance from me and them and that's one reason that the\nStory was powerful to me but I Am trying to get people to understand what what the criminal justice system was like how fantastically primitive it was really a whether they are or what how people lived that they they lived rich meaningful live a ...\nPeople\nIn urban areas today thank of people who lived in small towns a hundred years ago or often think of people who lived in small towns a hundred years ago I was living in these boring lives which nothing ever happened\nTo all of the things that happened to you and me and people in our lives happen to people in small towns I mean they they they got married they fell in love and got married and they got divorced and they started careers and got promoted and got fired they moved and they went on long trips and brought back souvenirs\nThey they had entertainment so they went to literally every night all of the things that that\nHappened who happen to us happened to them uh and I was trying to create a a picture\nUnfortunately it is a picture of their death so that's a terrible picture because they died terrible Beth I'd also is trying to create a picture of how they live and and and give the reader or a an understanding of what it was like to be in America and in a small town or a hundred years ago\nI think he did that very effectively in fact I think that's one of the interesting things about true crime in general is that the the focus can be on things which ... ... ... the inverted pyramid of journalism\nAnd you can spend a lot more time on the things which are less important to telling a story in proper journalism you can spend a lot more time talking about the atmosphere of the town or the um the things that people age\nOr the way that houses were constructed around your communities were laid out you can you can do that in and it brings up a fresh context\nTo these murders um you know as opposed to the traditional way that the crimes are covered in in St storytelling into journalism projects I that's what I really like what you were doing especially when you were getting into the fabric of these communities\nThey are and then there's ... there's what is it that that always sticks with me that illustrate the party or just banking\nAnd that has to do with the the soccer in the case of soccer and then that it\nUh one of them I think it was a co ... had an alibi for the time of one of the crime what are the crime was committed on December twenty fourth of I think\nNineteen Nineteen Nineteen Eighteen and he had a um a he had a witnesses who said that on that particular day he was delivering\nA to his neighbors and an Italian community or a pickle deal because pickled deals were a delicacy that we're eating on Christmas Day\nAnd there were there was but there was conflicting testimony that said no no no that couldn't have been done on December twenty fourth because you're never buy the pickled deals on December on Christmas Eve you have to buy them on December twenty second or something so that you have time to prepare them and put them in on on ice\nFor a couple of days before you eat them the a ... it's a it's a tiny detail that you would write\nWith not never survive I mean he would never know that that was true of Italian or the way the Italian American communities lived a hundred years ago except that it's important than a crime story that is what kinds of stories are\nThere are these little there's a flash of light that eliminates the details of uh uh or something that would otherwise be totally forgotten\nYou know I think that brings us very effectively ... Iowa I'm ended the crime story which\nAs you pointed out earlier is the one that starts to to give away um ... the communities are already catching on at this point to the fact that there's a a killer on the railway tickets tickets through what happened in ...\nOn on the night of of Jim nine Nineteen twelve oh the lights were out in Alaska due to a um a dispute between the ... city council and the power company so\nNext up the coast to coast am this is the opponent [noise]\n\n\nOne of the most important election we memory so much as they\nElections do have consequences and whether it's a red way out Republicans\nDemocrats have a shot take that back\nI don't trust the demographics of this term election we figured out there and\nRead about it to talk about it I just don't trust\nStimulating talk\nSummer handle large brought vessel ever held in the U.S banned the Grateful Dead and the Allman brothers and August those same Allman brothers will be there for\nListening to my heart radio from\nFrom Nineteen Seventy three\n[noise]\nSome time zones you know\nDown and\nMoney on\nAnd on the\n\n...

a way of understanding community sometimes the best way for us to understand ourselves\nA living is to look at the the stories of the dead and that's what that's what the with Bill James did the men from the train and he took a a ... view this giant\nLook from thirty thousand feet at a series of crimes Ninety murders that happened\nAnd started to see the patterns and went back to the earliest one

it does say that she lives with her husband not you [laughter] so sorry I got the wrong\nUm but you should be very proud of the work that you all did together not every father daughter team can do that kind of thing or you looked at these ah you looked at these murders\nAnd you put them in these different pockets you know the percentage that you believe were clearly done by the mentioned the train and then there's others that might be likely that he did but you could prove that\nA ... or ones that are very unlikely but they they shared some characteristics which would also really inform us as to how many unsolved murders\nWere going on back then we think that some sort of modern phenomenon but it certainly isn't right\nSomebody who might have grown up with a very dysfunctional household\nTends to cleave toward dysfunctional relationships not do the opposite direction but they know who they are in a dysfunctional relationship to know how to act in so they keep recreating that until they break the habit [noise] um so fractals theory often that explain whether it's your greatest moment you know like you and\nYou saved you know somebody from being\nDestroyed and the fire so you become a fireman so that you can spend the rest of your life replicating your greatest moment kind of thing so I Wonder what this this guy Paul Miller was trying to replicate by recreating the circumstances all along the various realism of America\nWell ... that\nThere is something odd about him the or that he he was not terribly young he was believed to be about thirty five when the first crime occurred but I Believe that exactly what you just said that that that that first crime was a his secret it was it was\nThe most thrilling and the most exciting thing that ever happened to him and that he was simply recreating at the ah ah again and again and again with more\nSome variation but more specimens ... along so that you know the ... the early patterns or not that type but the the later patterns get closer and closer to the first got it exactly what you're so what are you saying that that\nThat's who he was that that's a that's how he knew him so I I don't doubt\nThat Mr bell or had been the victim of terrible abuses young person or he was a it was an odd looking man he he uh he had tiny widely spaced teeth or he was not clean and I don't doubt that as a consequence of this odd look\nHere that he had suffered terrible abuse\nAnd it's a terrible abuse replicated itself and his anger and his outrageous not that is in any sense a justification for what he did but I don't doubt that that was true of him\n[noise] you know the the pedophilia peace or ... especially abusing decorum if that's what happened um speaks to\nThe age in which he might have been sort of frozen emotionally which makes me wonder whether and I'm sure you've done and this could have been committing similar crimes in Germany which forced him to go into the navy which forced him to you know do some barking income to the United states\nWell I don't know and and you know there is speculation\nIn the book because a lot of things we don't know about you how are you you're going to have no after you're gonna have a speculative after it's up to you\nI wouldn't speculate that he had never killed anyone before you kill the uh the Newt and family and in Eighteen Ninety eight I I ... I wouldn't I don't I doubt they'd ever killed anyone before that because there's an obvious lack of planning and\nI'm preparation for the of at ... I don't doubt that he had\nCommitted pieces of the same crime earlier I don't I just very much with respect that he had been\nAdding inappropriate interactions with young girls that he had a\nA while he had it had a chip on his shoulder it wasn't that like a nice guy and he said he ... his the documentation\nOf his life around around the time with the first crime mentions that he was um it wasn't hard to get him into a fight you know he was he was he had he had he carried a it carried a banker pretty open by the uh but I so I I don't doubt that there were other violent incidents screwing about his life\nThe um uh but I don't think the whole scenario had come together for him before that\nBut it still isn't that's that's a great point we're headed gone into the navy do you know\nWe don't know no I'd be curious whether to find the town in which she grew up in\nYes um and then check what\nYear he went into the navy and see whether prior to that year\nThere have been something which you know he knew he had to get on a ... he had to get out of dodge ... joining the navy it was a great way to do as to whether it's just one person who is the victim of his rage but gave him a great satisfaction and and you know I'm\nA nurse assist sociopath which is what this guy's sounds like the most dangerous kind\nI'm sociopaths ... are often rage killers and they they just you know the ... thing and and they they they just they do it as a kind of release and I I Wonder whether that that first released came long before he came to the new world\nBut it was not a nurse if there's a ... because he was not a ... he didn't have any charm it was not it was not a ... generally as a charming\nRight motive often well spoken truly\nMakes a good appearance he didn't do any of that he was he was a true psychopath a psychopath have no fear of over ... norm I Do not have normal fear and one thing with a parent about this the ... the man from the trade is that from his crime is he it was not\nEven not acting and fear he was he was calm and the middle of events that are horrific events that anyone else would have been shaking in their boots and that was one reason he was able to get by with his first of all I'd probably not that I should have made this this other point first\nThe story of a Paul Miller and Matt from the train is is much larger than our book and and we were fortunate enough to find this set of facts about him but I have no doubt that someone else is going to write another book about him in\nTen years or Fifteen and going to say well here's what the James has missed I missed this whole story about Paul Miller in Germany they missed the whole story about\nAh this this crime and it when that guy Illinois [laughter] and uh\nThe I don't we don't have any doubt that they're going to do that and and there'll be ride but we had spent years on it and we reached the limit of our particular research capacities so we moved on in front of the book but there is still more story to be discovered there\nYeah it's very interesting a Bill James you really take some questions as sure that'd be great okay so we'll give the phone numbers you're coming come just a

being the most prolific serial killer in America and as you say we don't know yet or maybe we can never know the numbers the actual numbers\nIt's fair to say that he was the most elusive in the way in which he operated because he was able to get away for so many years just\nAs it you know his vocation was I tend to rent blogger but his application was definitely somebody who we came to a town with the intent of murder and got away with it for years because really who thinks that there's people out there that do that\nYou know it means like even today we don't think about these people just driving around going up which Tuesday you know I'm really in the mood for murder [laughter] but there are there are\nThey get to Mike in Roswell New Mexico by two incidents where I'll be driving

evidence from any of these crime scenes\nThe uh I wouldn't say so I have held held in my hand the acts with which the less murders were committed they ah it it's still\nIt's still around and and uh has been presented with a guide to the to the murders and the uh uh but I wouldn't say I have physical evidence now\nAll right and you know what the palm will vary by nature\nDo without it disappeared in ... it was never caught my belief is that he probably went back to Europe and my guess would be but he ... he went back to Europe and continued to murder people but that is speculation and we do not know that for sure\nOkay well that's all I had to pick it up you pretty much got it all figured he might have worked for the road it how it got to every place that he did and maybe Sunday night where there's layover nights or something like that but thank you for being on the air I appreciate your story\nThat you might like we should that hey you know actually that's a really good question though about what was the connection to Sunday's why we're why we're most of these murders on a Sunday\nWhether what a in a modern criminal investigation if a criminal record and murders on weekends this is taking to be a sign that he's employed or if a ... and if it happens a lot actually out there quite a few serial murderers who will who committed murders on\nWeekends or the or because they they work during the week and I you know they have jobs go to\nThe um Miller probably did it on Sunday nights because he would spend the weekend working himself into the perhaps stocking as victims although I don't I don't know that it's a lotta stocking\nBut uh the uh just working itself into the frame of mind that he get where you needed to be\nA ... the ... and we do you think he did was just kind of trampling it as a you know and and riding the rails or was do you think he was paying you know cash money for a ticket to get on the ... these trains all over the country\nYou know it was it was just it wouldn't have paid cash money for a ticket because it would have been seen a ... and ... and he came into town\nMay no contact with anyone spoke to no one and that there that was part of his criminal intent is they ah they ah but ah so ... if his crime and the unplanned crime and Eighteen Ninety eight they did buy a ticket to leave\nThe town and the the lead\nTo a trail forming behind him and place followed his\nWhere he had gone on the trains are for quite a while but later he was just it was just job as white used to railroad he always used at the intersection to railroad so they

area bill\n... no ... ... ... did the uh uh although he would probably like through that area and Eighteen Ninety eight\nUh but uh it was cold cold a lot of the year and he he didn't he didn't federal ... it would create some crimes up north when it was warm weather but not never the half the year is limited to the south the uh um\nThe uh that area is a interesting because it it's always been a hotbed of um a reformist motion or a movement to its as you've no doubt no a a\nA a one of the foundation areas of the women's rights movement the uh uh is is a ... area of upstate New York but also many um\nReligious movements from the nineteenth century actually I'm a native from that part of the country I don't know what it has to do with my book but uh it it it is a very interesting area and I I'd like to know more about it\nYou know there's an argument in true crime that the ... the ... the the murders and unjust unsolved\nCrimes like that seep into the soil and then they tend to also then grow back out of it again which I was from ten to ... its poetic but they're interesting Doug is in New Jersey coast to coast am east of the Rockies for Bill James go ahead\nYes good afternoon gentleman a pleasure to speak with the as opposed to James ... hours of ah we have this show on cable it's called um\nUh give me a second here I'm a mystery is in America and they each week they have a different a show about among solve something or other and I'm not sure but the date sounds\nPretty familiar war or the arrow with this one this was going on there was a hobo camp or in a train yard in Chicago and ah [noise] along the shore on this one particular train ride and I came in and out of this yard um\nThey had four or five of these uh ... degenerate hobo was that stayed there in the yard that were actually killed\nAnd they found out that they were all killed by actresses they were they were chopped up the axes were supposedly taken off of the trains and there was I Believe a total of five bodies found\nAnd um I Believe at one point Eliot Ness or when he was first getting in to his position he was asked to go ahead and looked at this and this is one of the things that he had never solved and they said it bothered him greatly till he white you know till\nHe retired do you know if that has anything to do it or are you familiar with that case at all yeah they um uh\nI I I Know exactly it it's not Chicago technically but the um it's Nineteen thirties I I'm sure that's the case you're referring to it it's a Eliot Ness a after the uh what was hired to try to solve a series of a ... and I'm\nOut all been named by which the yeah prizes crime series is known but they've actually started in\nNewcastle Pennsylvania Nineteen twenty two and then spread the Cleveland in the Nineteen thirties I wrote about that the crime that some like in in a popular crime but that is it's not it's not it it it they were\nThey were axe murderer that were directed to train the but it it's twenty or the or it's twenty five thirty years after\nThe crimes that I wrote about it and I it is not connected\nYou know I'm not sure about that he would um I I I I knew the case you speaking of ... which become the public\nWould have to go to public safety officer public safety commissioner of Cleveland after Chicago um and those I thought were murders mostly of women again that they were talking about this as being sort of been American River um and that they\nWere ... they were all at the moment there's one woman was like OK\nRussian Women will get very interesting I we have time for John in Long Beach California and then we're going to have to wrap it up or go ahead John\nOkay thanks I'm not going to go about a nice to see again but but I think\nA a bill the guy in a in Cleveland\nOut here in LA I'm a longtime journalist out here they think he might have been a suspect in the black though you're killing or LA enough thought that uh and I just real quick about a

I I think what was ... I I mean I I it's it's it's just it's still very solemn to me that you know the innocent people were hanged who were protesting their innocence and that the real the people who had confessed to being which ones\nWere originally let out of jail then it's kind of you if you can test it said yep was really sorry about that then you go but it's only the people said no I'm not going to get this and then I've never been a which those are the people who ended up dying well for the most part I mean there's a large percentage of them in any\nWay you did write that as like a ... avenue wants the tragedy of these people who did the right thing you know stuck out for their believe all the things are told to do in your life and it ended badly for them um which is why you know Arthur Miller's crucible of such a great work of literature and plays is because he tapped right into that kind of idea that these guys did the right thing\nAnd by doing the right thing they ended up at the end of a rope on a hill you know O'Neill America\nWhich the or the end the population using under about fifty thousand but balloons up to two hundred and fifty during the\nThe Halloween or ... ... ... the month long festivity of Halloween\nIs is there in Salem is there any other time of year where they they see the kind of bumped like that or is it just is like a it's a I mean I realize that they always kind of getting a steady stream of tourists but as this they're big cheese in this this this October you know these thirty one days or a tumor\nOh mathematically I mean some some this is only open in October and can make their whole year in October\nShot up really\nThey've been getting more ... more a year round kind of tourist impulse not just for the stuff but for the maritime stuff they've amazing restaurants than they have the ninth largest art museum by area in the country so they have like a lot of like kind of\nYou know arrows and their whole started to pull a tourist and still happens the biggest one is October which\nWill never go well\nI Do really I mean that's like a ... there are state fairs that have that right where people open up a booth at a state there they can make their entire year in the weeks that the teacher is open and I I I Would never guess shops that are just open for one month in in Salem\nYeah but and but other but they're realizing there's so many tourists coming to fail him over the course of a year that now they're starting to open longer if you go in the summertime you'll still see the shops are still open you might even feel haunted house opened the monster museum so ... so they're starting to realize that they can do this year round that film grows and becomes more even\nBigger in popular culture than it is now\nWhat's not cool in Salem what are the rules a lake or curb that they they are either written or unwritten about how people aren't you know ... or to or how they want truths to be in in Salem\nYeah and they're they're getting better and better at that as figuring that especially like ... year round if you're on the other time of year there's not that many curbs\nBut in October for instance they are the burial ground which was the old seventeenth century um graveyard right in the middle of town there in Salem and this year they had to like put a cap on how many people could be in the grave at a time because it was just getting overrun and people were like using the graves as you know picnic table\nAnd climbing on them and doing all kinds of bad stuff to an actual historical artifacts\nThat do that there is on Halloween Night they have a curfew I think it's around ten pm that if you're not inside of a bar or inside of a party you couldn't be on the streets so they'll shoot fireworks in the air to kind of tell people have the nights over ... start heading to the train and start having your cars so there that's\nReally lately and ten pm\nYeah I Believe it the ten pm yeah it it might be a little later maybe eleven but yeah they're trying to sort of kept pushing that's a hundred thousand people to the train you take some time so by midnight money around on Halloween of\nIronic did they make everybody get off the streets seeing them before the wishing our\nYeah yeah it was [laughter] it just as bad [laughter] really bad that\nGot to get them out before the ... or maybe that's the real

chief federal prosecutor in western Pennsylvania after a gunman stormed a synagogue and opens fire\nWe are dedicating the entire resources of my office to this federal hate crime investigation and prosecution\nAnd proper journalism must stay focused on the facts of a murder and the prosecution of potential murderers so the result is a resistance to the expression of sentiment\nYou know the the or sensationalism emotional manipulation of the accused because that could result in somebody not getting a fair trial\nThis is why this is why journalism stresses terms like alleged and allegedly and how it is choose mainstream\nYou know notions of what sensationalism means stories that inflamed the senses right that sensational journalism the kind of news writing that stresses emotions over information risks rattling the public up unnecessarily in it at one point by the way\nThis is a very real day to day concern regarding regarding the power of the press\nOr there was a time in us history not even a hundred years ago when angry mobs would storm a jail and Lynch somebody before trial ... just like you know the showdown in to kill a mocking bird or white or black Lynch mob justice is the opposite of the rule of law\nAnd journalism understood its place in keeping the public informed but at the same time call\nAnd letting the courts do their work in educating some kind of justice our guest this hour by the way will attest to this because mob rule and link part in the injustices regarding the story of the men from the train\n[noise] uh but [noise] this is the same reason that love true crime and bear with me another minute or two where true crime reporting\nCan go where true crime story can tell something\nCrime reporting must not go right true crime\nIs allows for advocacy for justice giving victims of voice it's a central tenet to true crime before her death I interviewed I'm\nA true crime legend and rule about the conventions of great true crime writing an ad rules number one rule was that any true crime story you tell must be victims centric the focus on the acts of the killer worked a fetish size the details\nOf somebody's death like a lot of these true crime shows do on TV where it's almost like crime porn\nRight they're really into all the blood and the wounds to a point where it starts to dehumanize the victim I think so I think true crime must always be about justice and on a day when eleven people are dead\nIn a synagogue where they should have been saying the ...\nAnd not run for your life\nOr all because of a story seemingly that had been told about a Jewish philanthropist George Soros we need to be mindful about this connection between the stories we tell and the unintended consequences that can happen\nOr these victims should burden our national heart for years they will mine\nWhen we tell the story of the shooting in Pittsburgh today we must remain victims centric\nJournalists need to be responsible in order to avoid whipping up torch bearing mobs right intent on lynching people accused of crimes but everybody in the media or anybody who uses social media needs to share that same sense of responsibility when it comes to conspiracy theories as well\nI'm not waiting into a debate but who is responsible for today's mass shooting clearly\nThe majority of the blame rests on the trigger finger of today's shooter\nBut take it from me and my experience is on the radio it's important to be mindful about every thought seed you send out into the world that bears your name because once it hits the wind you'll never know where those thoughts seeds will take root\nThat's what we know to be true\nThere's many other stories in the news this week that attest to that so\nNot everything is a false flag up only a small percentage of such things I've ever happen not everything is die hard to not everything is a conspiracy if everything were conspiracy than we wouldn't have any media about in fact the media\nWould be focused on what isn't just conspiracy right if everything was a conspiracy devil radio shows built around we don't have a conspiracy around this today\nSo I ask you whenever you talk about murder whenever you talk about\nUp people who you believed to be\nGuilty of some thing stave victims centric in the stories that you tell and not just about the victims of crimes that have already happened in the case of true crime but stay victims centric about telling stories that could result in the victimization of somebody yet to come\nI ask you that in the name of all those people who died today\nSay a prayer for them if you will and and keep that in mind when we talk about the men from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer\nThat even though the story is over a hundred years old it's still not too late to get justice next coast to coast am this is Ian ...

I had told my daughter that ... if you walk the crimes back\nWhen you when he commits the first crime he will make mistakes that will give away who he is and I told her that\nBecause I Know from reading crime books and reading hundreds of crime books for very off of a serial murder when he convinced his first crime reveals who he is but then all of the times he will be ... in the seventies he'd be sent to jail for five years and then he'd be out and start a series of crimes\nAnd he would coverage track so I I guess that that was what was going to happen in this case\nBut we were just fantastically lucky\nAnd that is fresh crime happened to occur the the two biggest newspaper towns in the country where New York and Boston is first crime occurred straight west of Boston straight north of New York\nAnd because of that both of New York and Boston papers covered it in depth and because of that there's lots and lots of information available about it and it's uncanny it's unbelievable how many points\nThat first murder matches up with against the eye out with ... with with all the last ... last murders and the series so uh we\nJust luck I mean we never in a million years expected to be able to find convincingly who was actually doing this but we found a evidence about this man and argued that this is Pam and almost nobody doesn't believe it because it's just there's lots of evidence\nYou so you found the arc type crimes for the prototype crushed right he and he modeled he he he perfected that crime then successive Lee after that it is is the years went forward and yet\n... there was kind of a mixed media rent I mean there's sometimes there were some times you were guns involved\nIn all likelihood was carrying a gun all the time after about Nineteen oh five the uh I think that he while he used an axe to\nCommit the murders there are I think three crimes in which the man of the house was shot before he was hit in the head with an axe my belief is that he had a pistol stuck in his pocket or in his\nBelt or something that he would use if somebody was awake and could product yeah but um it was not what he was trying to do but it's why he would do if you had to do\nTo get back to some of the aspects of these crimes coming up next donor but\nBefore I Do ... ... ... ... what did you hope to learn about\nThe human condition about people about crime what was it that you thought you were going to learn when you went into researching and and being the first one to ... lead all these crimes together to determine you've you've found demand from the train\n[noise] they ... the general answer the question is a crime stories\nAre fascinating to us because they they come from the parts of our\nOf ourselves that we don't like to talk about a all crime stories are about lost and greed and anger and hatred and all the things that are part of you and me I don't know you but\nThey they are part of everybody that I've had the pleasure of knowing and and yet we we don't like to talk about them\nSo we cover them up crime stories exposed those parts of ourselves that we are ashamed of the uh\nUh that's that's the general answer to why I'm obsessive reader ... by the way the last book I read was the real prime but with the real world leader a it's a book by a ... a lot of weight with Weinstein I could have a last name wrong\nOr the or I've [laughter] I just screwed up her name I'm Sorry you know there surely it'd be it\nAnd and one of the things I learned from reading that is the white American ... who was a an avid reader of crime stories\nUh Charles Dickens was going to have him at an avid reader of crime stories or a Henry Fielding what it's it's very common among writers to be avid readers Tolstoy was avid readers of crime stories because the ...\nWhat I just talked about that that they they tell us something about\nThat you do get from a church somewhat but the ... you don't get from sports I mean it's I live in the sports world for the most part and the sports world is\nIs about positive people trying to do positive things in general I mean we take a lot of abuse from people who don't understand that but but that is what we are and what we're trying to do with positive people try and do positive things\nHang on hang on to that thought on crime stories is this world picking up the men from the train discovering most Americans most elusive serial killer and there's one story or two here you need to know about before you go to bed and coast to coast [noise]\nJackets you sit on the rise of the thing is\nAnd the consequences can be gambling\nLearn how to keep kids knock\nThree\nThree and seven three or ... now ...\nYears ago making a murderer became less than ... show then a force\nOf nature and uncovered a grave injustice in the criminal justice he was also completely dishonest and I would know I'm Dan O'Donnell I covered this even Avery and Brendan daffy trials and now they're making a murderer is back I Am too hard to re budding among the\nMurderer is now on the re I our radiolab just go in the\n\nRegion will studio your local but if we don't see why our radio station [noise]\nPlace of worship I'm Pam who sounds hunky this I synagogue in Pittsburgh the latest of a person with a gun\n[laughter]\n[noise] uh you're you're fading out here and I was not able to hear a lot of them\nI'm fading out no Kennedy that um I was just saying that you are presenting it as sort of a dichotomy of I'm working in the sports world did by day in\nWriting crime that night\n[noise] [noise] yeah they are uh I was saying that crime stories are passed on to it because they they uh come from the parts of ourselves that we don't like to talk about and don't normally talk about in the case of the man the train\nI didn't make a deliberate thoughtful entry into the subject I just got hooked like a fish\nOr I was I was I saw a documentary about the murders and ... called ... living with a mystery it's an extremely well done a documentary and far above normal levels of crime documentary I was interested\nIn it and it was clear that there was a part of the story that was messing which is that it's relatively obvious that the ... murders are a part of a series so I started\nI was just going to put an hour and to and to trying to learn more about the series but the the our became a week the week eventually became five or six years or so but I didn't I didn't decide to get into it I just wandered into it\nYou know it shows you a ... you can do you consider this a true crime booked sure yes it is\nYeah you know and that's the interesting piece too is that true crime [noise]\nYou know the tradition for true crime is I discovered in in my research goes all the way back to execution sermons right sort of shares a similar DNA with American journalism\nI'm accepted in the case of true crime you know it was the it was the preachers it was the ... circuit writing preachers diminished or is that would come to these towns in on the day and somebody's execution and they would do a sermon just before the execution\nThat we tried to provide the context for why this person was being executed in wide the community overall would benefit from his or her desk\nAnd became became an important part of trying to understand\nExecutions in America and and this is where when the preachers decided there they used to just print up their sermons and people would snap them up and then he thought well heck this will just sell it for a nickel and so they started to sell their execution sermons and then they would get passed around in these became some of the early bestselling\nTrue crime near and is it it it just feels the same function is what you're doing in in demand from the tree and you're trying to bring in it even though it's a hundred plus years leader\nIn some cases you're trying to bring a kind of um a a a kind of healing anyway I'm not that anybody is still alive that was directly involved but for these communities may be this this lingering sense of some tragedy that it happened maybe some closure I'm On\nA new jak Lee what happened to their town and how their town was involved are not involved in in the the deaths of somebody that at one point you know were popular members of the community\nUm ... there were just they pay that happened just a few weeks ago I actually got a letter from a man in London england who ah was a a a ... his great great\nAunt had been was one of the victims of crime engine and he had always believed that uh uh the man who\nAh was accused of her murder and was locked up without any evidence for two years before he was released a have always believed that he had gotten away with it and he said that reading it\nIn my book bag and our book that uh um it wasn't that was not actually what had happened was just a tremendous relief correct yeah\nIt was that was a shock to me I hadn't thought about that but it was it was this guy who said he was tremendously relieved to realize that it was just a a random crime and that this Manhattan actually that that Manhattan actually gotten away with it was the other fellow at I don't know why it was important to him\nToo well I understand the understanding is that there was important to have to know what had happened but you know one guy getting away with it or another guy getting away with it I'm ... I've I've I don't know a lot of different but it's still that have that reaction to it\nYeah I think what we can go ahead go ahead no please no a lot of the book them a lot of what the\nBook is about is is that all all book all good books our church for understanding right a lot of the book is is trying to get people to understand the America and with these crimes occurred\nThey hurt a hundred years ago and ah I grew up in a small town very much like the crimes that these\n... that these murders occur to him\nAnd I grew up in them fifty sixty years ago so it's sort of equal distance from me and them and that's one reason that the\nStory was powerful to me but I Am trying to get people to understand what what the criminal justice system was like how fantastically primitive it was a watery ... ah what how people live that they they lived rich meaningful live a ... ...\nPeople\nIn urban areas today thank of people who lived in small towns a hundred years ago or often think of people who lived in small towns the hundred years ago I was living in these boring lives which nothing ever happened\nTo all of the things that happened to you and me and people in our lives happened to people in small towns I mean they they\nThey got married they fell in love and got married and they got divorced and they\nStarted careers and got promoted and got fired they moved and they went on long trips and brought back souvenirs they they had entertainment so they went to\nLiterally every night all of the things that that happened ... who happened to us happened to them uh and I was trying to create a a picture unfortunately it is a picture of their death\nFor that's a terrible picture because they died terrible bath and also I was trying to create a picture of how they live and\nAnd and give the reader or\nA an understanding of what it was like to be in America and in a small town or a hundred years ago\nAnd I think he did that very effectively in fact I think that's one of the interesting things about true crime in general is\nThat the the focus can be on things which ... ... ... the inverted pyramid of journalism\nAnd you can spend a lot more time on the things which are less important to telling the story\nIn proper journalism you can spend a lot more time talking about the atmosphere of the town or the um the things that people age or the way the houses were constructed during their communities were laid out you can you can do that in and it brings up a fresh context\nTo these murders um you know as opposed to the traditional way that the crimes are covered in in St storytelling into journalism context I that's what I really like what you were doing especially when you were getting into the fabric of these communities\nThey are and then there's ... there's what is it up at all it takes with me that I looked at the party or the banking and that has to do with the the soccer in the case of taco invent that it\nUh one of them I think it would suck co ... had an alibi for the time of one of the crime what are the crime was committed on December twenty four\nOf I think Nineteen Nineteen or Nineteen Eighteen and he had a um a\nHe had a\nWitnesses who said that on that particular day he was delivering\nA to his neighbors and an Italian community um a pickle deal because pickled ... were a delicacy that we're eating on Christmas Day\nAnd there were there was but there was conflicting testimony that said no no no that couldn't have been done on December twenty fourth because\nYou're never buy the pickled deals on December on Christmas Eve you have to buy them on December twenty seconds or something so that you have time to prepare them and put them in on on ice for a couple of days before you eat them\nThe a ... it's a it's a tiny detail that you would right now or never survive I mean he would never know that that was true of Italian or the way that the Taliban American communities lived a hundred years ago\nExcept that it's important in a crime story ... that's what crime stories are they're these little there's a flash of light that illuminates the details of uh uh or something that would otherwise be totally forgotten\nYou know I think that brings us very effectively ... Iowa I'm ended the crime story which\nAs you pointed out earlier is the one that starts to to give away um ... the communities are already catching on at this point to the fact that there is a killer on the railway tickets tickets through what happened in ...\nIs still standing of his operated as a kind of a more tourism or it's the it's a shows up on paranormal t._v. shows and people have to take tours of the house\nThe um uh but if you drive around but let's go there's no sign anywhere that says where the houses are now that we at science thing where the doctors houses but that but ah where the ... ... knowing for is not mentioned anywhere\nThe um [noise] ah that's not an appropriate I I I it goes without saying that that's not an appropriate memorial on the um uh I don't know that\nYou raise an interesting question I don't know that in any of these cases there was a a\nProper memorial to the victims victims were mostly poor people mostly people without\nA without one and the more family was very well why they are and the community uh thought well I Am the vigorous efforts to solve the crime was a kind of memorial to them uh but I don't think there was any physical memorial to\nYou know sometimes it's just a place where somebody always brings flowers in Russia where there is an effort to try to so it doesn't even have to be like a statue\nBut it is interesting how communities will will sometimes do that because that that is their way of honoring so but I think you mentioned the economic speech that explains everything you know that\nThat's one of the reasons why it's usually prominent citizens that enjoy that kind of status or not or you know\nThe um the one of his role as a matter of trades crimes with the double murder in Colorado Springs it murder two families in one night and joining out the uh uh but if you if you go to that\nCommunity where that happened now the people that area's still remember it still they they could tell yeah oh that's a house right\nThere um but it still it has not forgotten or many places many places\nWhere these crimes occurred it was so long ago that it's totally I'm absolutely forgotten but it's a it's quite feel quite well remember\nSo I Want it you know I'm I'm going to make a sacrifice you because\nIt was really hoping to finish the book before the interview but I really want to get to the part about how you think you would have narrowed down this suspect so let's let's go do that let's go through that process Ninety victims [noise]\nStarting in the late Nineteen century going up to the early twentieth century of one men the men and the train does he have a name [noise] next one coast to coast am this is the opponent [noise]\n\n\nHe's one of the most important midterm elections we memory so much has\nElections do have consequences and whether it's a red wave\nDemocrat to have a shot in the outback\nI Would trust demographically the mid term election we figured out there in both\n... to talk about it I just don't trust the last seven\nStimulated and talk\nAnd spotting troubles way tougher\nThat's my parents' crushed blink blinked video cameras are motion activated so placing them around your home it's like having ice everywhere\nBlink cameras or wire free set up in Minnesota and run on to double A. batteries last up to two years Bree in technology\n[noise]\nCame\nDown\nOn\nThe\n\n...
