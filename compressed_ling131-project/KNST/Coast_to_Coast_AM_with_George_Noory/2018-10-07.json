{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KNST", "content": "About two years ago and he went to the the um the police saying that the ... the he'd found like a needle in in a Snickers bar or something and it turned out that he put that in their himself\nOh and we yeah when the police busted him he said well I was trying to make sure the kids knew not to trust strangers\n[laughter] yeah not to trust you that exactly\nI was just such an offensive I was like the first of all the ... you know the whole stranger danger thing is really it's really played on the fact is that most people are good most people don't want her kids at all and you know and of course every year there was X ray candies and it's I mean whatever if if\nIt makes me I wanted for but I wanted to ask you that are they still doing that I remember you know it was always go X ray or candy I mean really do you do people really go to the emergency rooms where they really sick ... you know people are really sick needing to get in and do they take the time to x-ray that did that really happened\nIt occasionally does happen and now I Know that because uh I I used to live in Buffalo and I remember there would be occasional announcements and it was also I'm a dentist office they would say you know come to the dentist office X. rated the candy\nAnd and I followed that for several years again I I Would I Would pay attention to the news stories and I'd follow up and say did you guys actually find anything in the candy and the answer was almost always know for something like you know\nIt's it's a piece of candy if you have any any doubt throw it out you don't\nNeed to wonder whether there's something in the candy if if there's any reason at all you think it's dubious you don't need to make but just toss it the way I just the whole thing is just silly\nNow my dad would go through it and say well let me let me look to the candy make sure it's okay but he did it just so that he could steal the stuff that he wanted\n[laughter] where where are the ethics here what we need to go back to the days when people were coming for soles of of of you know purgatory this ... you know this was something here\nWell what we did the you know sometimes I always think you know like little Linus commercialism when it comes to like a Christmas when did the haunted house has come out because you know those are cool and everything however it was it primarily for money [laughter] is it all these raises money right\nRight no no that that's a great question you know originally you know of course originally that the when when people begin first making disguised as I mentioned it was originally an Irish thing it it it was primarily restricts with the British Isles\nAnd then it came over with the with the first and second waves of of the ah the immigrants to the United states\nAnd in fact the you we mentioned a little while ago about some of the conservatives getting upset about it the Puritans\nI'm In New England or who of course you know part of the uh the witch trials they have they were they were dead set against Halloween and that was that was a an occult abomination\n... and so that for for so\nCertainly for for for many years\nUm of course before there was mass marketed commercialized stuff um you know you couldn't go to the local store you know Halloween spirit store and get a a teenage mutant ninja turtle mask so your people were having to be creative you know boy the horror right you'd actually\nYeah family is coming together\nTo make a kid's costume ... and what you find is that the first um the ... the first record that I found of Halloween masks are really emerged in about the Eighteen seventies so it really dates back over a hundred years\nI'm a they weren't they weren't of course you know as foreign aid and your plastic molded and stuff but what's happened that over over the decades as as you know as marketing is turned Halloween into you know a much more of a commercial enterprise\nAnd you know it it's B it's become commercialized for for better or for worse\nAnd this is when you start getting adults who were you know ... doing the the elaborate which costumes and you know the the you know the the sexy police officer costumes or\nThe drag yeah\nAnd of course as soon as you have mass marketing then you have\nA you know you have the princess is right you know and they're all you have peanuts and you have all that sort of stuff and so you know that that's fun I mean but I like you I I sort of ... I have a sweet spot for for homemade costumes that are really creative and not just you know something with a mask slapped on it\nYeah it's fun for sure and so you\nKnow you talk about the history of it we know basically what goes on now so how do you see since you study there's so much and you really continue to to to do that how do you see the future of Halloween how do you see it in about ten years Twenty years Thirty years\nWell on a good question you know I think that um you know\nWhen I mentioned I mean it's it's it's very much wrapped up in tradition and folklore and stuff and all these things changed right I mean we've we've talked about two different incarnations of Halloween going back to to win and then you've got the mixing it with all saints day in office all day and and you know we're with each interact with each\nYou know a couple of generations change a bit\nUm and I think that um I I think it's probably going to remain more or less the same for the time being a you have had occasional places where people taking it too far in Detroit for example it's it's known as el night I mean there's the other like art and stuff it's like a scary\nScary stuff going on um but for the most part you know most people keep it\nKeep it pretty simple I think that that there's a certain innocence about it\nBut I think it really peeling again it's not it's not Easter it's like Christmas it's not tied to a particular religion it it's something that anybody of any of any uh of any faith and creed hum when it was like a dress up like a dress up right I mean eight year old kid with\nAn eighty year old kid like to dress up and so it's there's something that is I think just\nInherently a humanistic in fun and and I don't think that's going to go away and\nUm you know it's still gonna be knocking on doors and asking for candy or you know I don't think it's going to change dramatically in the next ah in the next you know twenty or fifty years or so who knows maybe two hundred years now a ... there'll be a sort of your virtual go you\nKnow where you got like holy crap [laughter] oh you got to that because that was the giant thing that'd be cool\nThat's right that's what's going to be knocking at your door that'll be cool All right so we're talking with Benjamin Radford origins of Halloween we are going to ask them about the same panic part of it when we come back stay with us you are listening to coast to coast am I'm ... and this is ... tonight\nNever missed a detail on a show or a gift to sign up for the ... ... email newsletter available for free coast to coast am dot com\n\n\nSaturday I over six what's new day on the free our radio I talked\nFor decorating the house or just setting the burying our spicy platelets has ... with labor in mind when you know after day\nSwing mainstream break out all our great deal a party playlists whether you're at home or the stadium the new I our radio ... collection come out\nAnd I are media we know the marketing to your customers is a challenge to businesses of all sizes share\nWe can help not only does radio reached Ninety three percent of Americans die every week more than Facebook Google and television but recently privacy concerns of for social media platforms to scale down their advertising auctions while radio is expanding its reach and targeting through the\nIowa radio ads every day but I heard media dot com to learn more again visit I heart media dot com and put radio to work for your company\nRenting your home rocks when you find the right ten in Santa renters warehouse does that in just a few weeks on average they complete thorough background and credit checks they walk perspective tennis or your property they helped cut through the red tape even provided a free six months tenant warranty on all plays tennis so few ranchers default don't place them for free\nThere's no up front these no binding contracts and you can cancel it anytime renters warehouse great jazz lives here go to rent or somewhere else dot com right now [laughter]\n[noise] [noise] Hi this is Sherry host of law matters every Saturday one PM this week Pima County sheriff mark Napier why after all your questions ... calling eight eight zero five six seven eight to join the conversation\nJohn Lennon and you go oh imagining guinea some truth on DVD and Blu ray along with imagine the ultimate collection the ... been expanded album onto lp to C.

Willis here on the coast to coast am our gas tonight on Willis wean is Benjamin Radford we've been talking about the origins of Halloween\nAnd uh oriented ... we are also by the way because he's a science based paranormal investigator he goes all over the world and investigate all sorts of great themes great mysteries that we all love\nSo uh and he writes a lot of books his last book was on actually um investigating um goes goes hunting stuff so\nLet's say I want to talk a little bit more about the origins of Halloween and some of the areas and then I Want to talk about his book because it's very interesting stuff in there I think you guys are going to like and you know it works with the will of saline theme of goes tiny so Ben\nI'm as we talk about Halloween I Want to make sure you say everything that you wanted to say about it but I Want to know about that\nLet's say panic part of it I mean it can really can get pretty evil\nWith some people as much as I like the orange and black and the which isn't it you know and the Frankenstein and the Iraqi like kind of almost like the bubble gummy kind of Halloween that's what I like sure um but then there's this deep darkness and say panic part where people really do get creepy and scary\nWell yeah I mean it's one little thing for I mean there's always going to be a certain segment of the population that take things too far right there's always going to be you know some some creep in some you know mall haunted houses\nYou know reached out and grab the crow somebody or whatever I mean it's there are some of that but but you know that's for every one of those examples or you know there's you know hundreds and hundreds of other people who just have a good time with it\nUm you know what I mean as I mentioned before you know so and was not you know there's there's nothing the panic about it a lot of ... sometimes conservatives cause damage because of its roots with with with pagan ritual\nBut you know the the ancient a health I mean they they they they didn't worship anything\nResembling the Christian devil at all I mean they if you drink when if you ask them you know if you told them about some some horn goat creature that you know the\nThe evil they wouldn't have the right here what you're talking about it wasn't it wasn't part of the world view and and again you know it was before I went festival died out long before um before you know the the the Christian concept of of of a\nSeating and all that sort of came up and so what you find is that you know there there's there's tradition of course I mean you look at exit there's plenty to Eighteen you know ... not suffer which to live um and so there's a there's a strong tradition\nIn in being concerned rightly or wrongly about a a cult influences right and so this is fine uh this is of course not just Halloween that's that's one of the more uh\nObviously comes up every every year in coming up every year but I mean for example we saw the same thing in the Nineteen eighties with a concern over dungeons and dragons\nI'm and role playing games and heavy metal music and and ... and ... um I was up in uh I did a ghost investigation a couple of years back up at the heart to see James hotel in northern New Mexico\nAnd I was there during investigation and looking to go in and\nOn the wall I I'd never seen that before I have a I have a photo of it is it a where'd you board or strictly prohibited anyone using a ... will be kicked off the property and it was just it was just so interesting I mean the the owners were so\nSo concerned that using the ... board was going to open up you know demonic corals or whatever\nI I I agree with that one\nBut it said what was interesting was was that it was it was codified on a wall and I'd never seen that like you know in the rules you know sign this don't use it and so\nYou know typically the concern is uh it's about kids because again as I mentioned for for most of most Halloween\nIt wasn't it wasn't centered around kids or was it was something that mostly you know\nAdults and and and you know teenagers did you know whether it's a bobbing for Apple's are doing trick or treating but beginning in the Nineteen fifties that twin because it was centered on kids that were the concern came from and so it was ... that\nA kid the dresses up as a witch or a goal will become interested\nIn witchcraft or wicker or vehicle because of that and that's that's basically the foundation for that and so this is why a lot of times um the the ... parents who are concerned about that um they do a couple of things one of them is they have instead of a Halloween party have a harvest party\nSo the the the\nThe they make a case to distinguish it from home and this is our way into harbors party but there's lots of similar stuff and of course they'll they'll you know parents were concerned about that they'll have the kids dressing up as princesses or something ... anything that might be you know darker scary\nIt's so interesting because um you know everybody has their views and their opinions and and uh you know in in everything but I just um I just remember as a kid loving that it was\nIt was like a fun scary and it was you know creepy and like I said again you know black lights and the\nUh we were um and I grew up in Louisville, Kentucky and one of the local radio stations W. H. A. Y. was wacky and they had the wacky haunted house and it was\nIt was what your bigger brothers we take you to you know as a kid and it got to be a family event and everybody would be there and it was the coolest thing of all is one of the biggest advance like in the country I mean even though all the radio people still remember this from\nFrom back then it was all wacky haunted house it was nothing nothing scarier it was all so much fun back then everybody had a good time you'd be dressed up\nA it was fun to be scared you laugh and then you'd go home and the next day you know that was that you eat candy for awhile and sometime you still had that candy\nWhen it came to Christmas [laughter] just the way it was right down the\nMarathon bar amount either right away I Am doing those\n[laughter] you'd freeze those have you ever had them frozen\nThey were great under you're just taking you back your love is\nSomebody needs to a grand that recipe and make those again I don't know why they ever stop to because you knew that everybody loved marathon bars my gosh\nYeah they were and they came in that was like a red and black rapper written\nOr something yeah and the ruler on the back oh man I I mean anything Googled afterward on here\nAnd ah and ah I I didn't know that um that uh what's his face a lot for us for McGregor so I I I learned that tonight in fact if I weren't here talking to you I'd probably watch in the fight\nThere you go it's gone now is there any way\nYeah Yup yup yup never on all the producers were were watching that hey you guys are going on the air

was seen and we were just talking previously was all about the uh werewolf that we've seen holding something and if you go to the site you'll see featured a these sketches DePaul did by the way he's an artist as well just\nJust when you see when you see it coming to life\nWell someone you know drawn it it's a it really adds so much to the story from the witnesses now POM Wonderful artist uh sketching that you did I Know that you're an artist as well and a former carpenter\nAnd so now what you do is you like to ... year retired and you enjoy going and checking out all these mysteries correct\nA ... you know that that is the story I mean the the ... and kind of go\n... this cattle grazing it's looked slum where they'd be in the old so to lake but I imagine imagine the sediments and everything is produced sort of ... very fertile ground well yeah yeah I don't think that that's why the cows and not race or says in it you know they\nSaw\nIt in the Nineteen seventies once again now spoke to this guy numerous times and recorded is science thing that you know [noise] and he did a bit of poaching in the Nineteen seventies you know catching has and ... and places that he shouldn't have been on private land\nAnd um it was a place called Fox called the world in green Dale which is eight miles from flicks than and he still lives in Britain Dale and it's an interesting story he said did you ... it was with a friend said need noted for the past week or two weeks that\nSomething was ripping the prey out to the snap it will make him a snack to catch the rub it in the has the other game small game\nAnd it was ... ... is ...\nSort of Burlington type born and bred and he's with Iraqi them out to ...\nAs you said but we couldn't sort of what he was he said we just couldn't understand what was doing a sudden there was still a bit of snow on the ground you could see so two rows of its own as you look over towards the ... the the open fields and he's on the edge of folks ... with us it's friend who was doing the poaching\nIn the daytime and there's a large hedge hole forms and things about he said he probably eight to ten foot tall and he will he sought to turn round to speak to his friend and talk this thing and his peripheral vision and then looked and saw it on the left over the head ... he said\nHe thought he was a young hopes it meant halls so hate you go to bless you want to go off the first\n... believe what I was looking at so what we're saying is this thing was as big as a small pony or you you know your horse is it and the interesting thing was he left over the edge and just landed he said wait expects a horse to lend to move forward because the momentum this thing just one that I'm Still like a magnet\nSudden something not to be nice to look at that he said it was the most peculiar thing he'd ever seen he said he glad the before the runaway he said but he was on all fours\nAnd he said if it's still open to the being over seven Fulton looked like a body builder he said you know he said he went to the tiny waist and the main like a lion in the face of a bout of about ...\nAnd ... woods and he said he ... he was almost sort of Britain's gulag you know like a box that dog all the stuff that you both terriers and\nThat's not what he ... he says well he said I went to the edge of them to try and get sentenced Dave it's just to protect myself he says although there's nothing we could have done if this thing I decided they were going to come across to us they said the speed it covert crossing the field and into the world but what quite incredible and you know\nThat's four miles from the coast all the sightings are quite close to the coast Tony and if you if you go further down the coast too was whole or in the papers probably two years ago there was the beast of bumps than drain that were featured in the u._k. papers quite often and\nThis was such a supposed to be aware of that was such a ... going the bombs to train runs into the sea six miles from where I'm ... now so we got this where we'll type creature reported that moving along the coast and\nYou go for the coast you go oh folklore and I'll let you own legends of dogs with glowing red eyes the by the way the ravens Scottish what would they too hot and you know they started to come down looking I'm Down in time that\nI think the grains of truth in the story so that was the right thing\nIn the Nineteen seventies and the lifting all his life\nAnd it never seen it is never seen it before and it never seen it to that which is quite incredible if this thing I Believe his story thing was if you would think that the more evidence so why\nAre we only think small glimpses of it\nWas in a mate\nYeah and that's what you're saying that they pop in and they pop out along the way kind of like\nWhen I talk to people before uh we had um\nA friend of mine Laurie Williams she's a remote viewer in I Would have heard target Bigfoot and as she targeted she had mentioned how they they are actually didn't know what it was you know she just looking at this esoteric target that I gave her and she's talking about how they have these portals\nAnd they would and time warps and and they would just go through one time warp and then another and you just see them when they pop into that particular one you know in ... where where a human would see him\nUm I find I find it also interesting uh when you were saying that Ari yes is there the world's oldest the operational radar base is right there and all this area were all this crazy stuff happens\nAnd I think I remember seeing a pitcher\nThat might be my thought about it so people just it it's cutting in and out no well is showing Nobel laureates all now I'm a I'm Sorry about that you want me to hang up and you got me back but they don't know well\nWell you're fine right now for sure and will do that at the break for sure but yeah but I can hear you but again I think it's I think

H. two seven nine six four or five\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\nWelcome back because the coast am county Willis here discussing the origins of Halloween on Willis ... talking with then ran for then so as you tell us about the origins of Halloween it\nReally does have um an interesting history very rich in history um it's silly it's scary and you get said panicking gets kind of crazy I enjoy watching the\nTelevision shows around that time the Halloween and that were the fun ones the little peanuts you know characters that's always fun with the great I'm In and all that kind of stuff um but that like the fun ones and and I like when people dress up you know like the vampires and the Frankenstein I like the really good scary stuff\nThe the he'd found like a needle in in a Snickers bar or something and it turned out that he put that in their himself\nOh and we yeah when the police busted him he said well I was trying to make sure the kids knew not to trust strangers\n[laughter] yeah not to trust you that exactly\nI was just such an offensive like the first of all the ... you know the whole stranger danger thing is really it's really played on the fact is that most people are good most people don't want her kids at all and you know and of course every year they X ray candies and it's I mean whatever if if\nIt makes me I Would ever but I wanted to ask you that are they still doing that I remember you know it was always go X ray your candy I mean really do you do people really go to the emergency rooms where they really sick ... you know people are really sick needing to get in and do they take the time to x-ray that did that really happened\nIt occasionally does happen and now I Know that because uh I used to live in Buffalo and I remember there would be occasional announcements and it was also I'm a dentist office they would say you know come to the dentist office X. rated the candy\nAnd and I followed that for several years again I I Would I Would pay attention to the news stories and I'd follow up and say did you guys actually finding anything in the candy and the answer was almost always know\nFor something like you know it's it's a piece of candy if you have any any doubt throw it out you don't you don't need to wonder whether there's something in the candy if there's any reason at all you think its dubious you don't need to make but just toss it the way I just the whole thing is just silly\nNow my dad would go through it and say well let me let me look through the candy make sure that okay but he did it yes so they can feel the stuff that he wanted\n[laughter] where where are the ethics here what we need to go back to the days when people were coming for soles of of of you know purgatory this ... you know this was something here\nWell what we did the you know sometimes I always think you know like little Linus commercialism when it comes to like a Christmas when did the haunted house has come out because you know those are cool and everything however ... was it primarily for money [laughter] is it all these raises money right\nRight no no that that's a great question you know originally you know of course originally that the the when when people begin first making disguised as I mentioned it was originally an Irish thing it it was primarily restrict or the British Isles\nAnd then it came over with the with the first and second wave of the of the ah the immigrants to the United states\nAnd in fact we mentioned a little while ago about some of the conservatives getting upset about it the Puritans I'm In New England or who of course are you know part of the uh the with Charles ... have you know when they were they were dead set against Halloween and that was that was a an occult abomination\n... and so that for for so certainly for for for many years um of course before there was mass marketed commercialized stuff um you know you couldn't go to the local store you know Halloween spirit store and get a a teenage mutant ninja turtle mask\nSo your people were having to be creative you know boy the horror right you'd actually\nHave families coming together to make a kid's costume ...\nAnd what you find is that uh the the first um the ... the first record that I found of Halloween masks are really emerged in about the seventies so it really dates back over a hundred years\nI'm uh they weren't they weren't of course you know as foreign aid and your plastic molded and stuff but what's happened that over over the decades as as you know as marketing is turn Halloween into you know a much more of a commercial enterprise\nAnd you know it it's B it's become commercialized for for better or for worse\nAnd this is when you started getting adults who were you know ... doing the the elaborate which costumes and you know the the you know the the sexy police officer costumes or the\nDrag yeah\nAnd of course as soon as you have mass marketing then you have a you know you have the princess is right and you have Cinderella and you have peanuts\nAnd you have all that sort of stuff and so you know that that's fun I mean but I like you I I sort of ... I have a sweet spot for for homemade carpet really creative and not just you know something with a mask trapped on it\nYeah it's fun for sure um so you\nKnow you talk about the history of it we know basically what goes on now so how do you see since you studied it so much and you really continue to to to do that how do you see the future of Halloween how do you see it in about ten years Twenty years Thirty years\nWell on a really good question you know I think that um you know\nWhen I mentioned I mean it's it's it's very much wrapped up in tradition and folklore and stuff and all these things change right I mean we've we've talked about two different incarnations of Halloween going back to to win and then you've got the mixing it with all the ... and and you were with each with each\nYou know a couple of generations change a bit\nUm and I think that um I I think it's probably going to remain more or less the same for the time being a you have had occasional places where people taking it too far in Detroit for example it's it's known all night I mean there's the other like art and stuff it's like a scary scary stuff going on\nUm but for the most part you know most people keep it keep it pretty simple I think that but there's a certain innocence about it\nBut I think it really appealing and it's not it's not Easter it's like Christmas it's not tied to a particular religion it it's something that anybody of any of any uh of any faith and creed\nHum and it was like a dress up well like a dress up right I mean eight year old kid with an eighty year old kid like to dress up and so it's something that is I think just inherently a humanistic and fun and and I don't think that's going to go away and\nUm you know it's still gonna be knocking on doors and asking for candy or you know I don't think it's going to change dramatically in the next ah in the next you know twenty or fifty years or who knows maybe two hundred years now a ... there'll be a sort of your virtual a goat or you've\nGot like holy crap [laughter] oh you got that yeah that was a giant thing that'd be cool\nThat trade that's what's going to be knocking at your door that'll be cool

Carnegie Mellon university interview people about how they dealt with conflicts\nAnd how often they hung out their problems not just with their romantic partners but with friends and workmates the researchers found that yes the hug is a drug\nIt was no surprise that on the day of a conflict people described an increase of negative emotions and the decrease of positive emotions but among people said they received a hug at some point during the same day as the conflict those recipients report in a smaller increase in the negative feelings into smaller decrease in positive emotions\nThe researchers said this study is not fully conclusive the emotional differences could be explained by other reasons but in these times of intense political conflict hunger to might just help for more

we are also by the way because he's a science based paranormal investigator he goes all over the world and investigate all sorts of great themes great mysteries that we all love\nSo uh and he writes a lot of books his last book was on actually um investigating um goes goes hunting stuff so\nLet's I Want to talk a little bit more about the origins of Halloween and some of the areas and then I Want to talk about his book because it's very interesting stuff in there I think you guys are going to like and you know it works with the will\nOf saline theme of ghost tiny so Ben I'm as we talk about Halloween I Want to make sure you say everything that you wanted to say about it but I Want to know about that\nLet's say panic part of it I mean it can really can get pretty evil\nWith some people as much as I like the orange and black and the which isn't it you know and the Frankenstein and the Iraqi like kind of almost like the bubble gummy kind of Halloween that's what I like sure um but then there's this deep darkness in St panic part where people really do get creepy and scary\nWell yeah I mean one of those things where I mean there's always going to be a certain segment of the population that take things too far right there's always going to be you know some some creep in some you know a mall haunted houses\nYou know reached out and grab the crow somebody or whatever I mean it's there's always some of that but but you know that's you know for every one of those examples or you know there's you know hundreds and hundreds of other people who are just you know have a good time with it\nUm you know I mean as I mentioned before you know so and was not you know there's there's nothing the panic about it a lot of ... sometimes conservatives cause damage because of its roots with with with pagan ritual\nBut you know the the ancient a health I mean they they they they didn't worship anything\nResembling the Christian devil at all I mean they if during summer when if you ask them you know if you told them about some some horn goat creature that you know the\nThe evil they wouldn't have the fans Katie what you're talking about it wasn't it wasn't part of the role of you\nAnd and again you know as the ... festival died out long before um before you know the the the Christian concept of of of a\nScene and all that sort of came up and so what you find is that you know there there's but there's tradition of course I mean you look at Texas is twenty two Eighteen you know ... not suffer which to live on and so there's a there's a strong tradition\nIn in being concerned rightly or wrongly about a a cult influences right so this is why a ... and it is of course not just Halloween that that's one of the more uh obviously\nComes up every every year in coming up every year but I mean for example we saw the same thing in the Nineteen eighties with a concern over dungeons and dragons\nHum and role playing games and heavy metal music and and ... and ... um I was up in uh I did a ghost investigation a couple of years back up at the heart of the genes hotel in northern New Mexico\nAnd I was there during investigation and looking to go and and on the wall I I'd never seen that before I have a I have a photo of it if it ah where'd you board or strictly prohibited anyone using ... board will be kicked off the property and it was just it was just so interesting I mean the the owners were so\nSo concerned that using the board was going to open up you know do you want to ... or whatever\nI I I agree with that one\nBut it didn't say what was interesting was that it was it was codified on a wall and it was I'd never seen that like you know in the rule if you will find this don't use it and so you\nKnow typically the concern is uh it's about kids because again as I mentioned for for most of most Halloween\nIt wasn't it wasn't centered around kids or was it was something that mostly you know adults and and and you know teenagers did you know\nWhether it's a bobbing for Apple's are doing trick or treating but beginning in the Nineteen fifties that twin because it was centered on kids that's where the concern came from and so it was ... that\nA kid the dresses up as a witch or a goal will become interested in witchcraft or Wicca or vehicle because of that and that's that's basically the foundation for that and so this is why a lot of times um the the\n... parents who are concerned about that um they do a couple of things one of them is they have instead of a Halloween party they have a harvest party so the the the\nThe they make a case to distinguish it from home and this is our way into the harvest party but there's lots of similar stuff and of course they'll they'll you know parents were concerned about that they'll have the kids dressing up as princesses or something ... anything that might be you know darker scary\nIt's so interesting because um you\nKnow everybody has their views and their opinions and and uh you know in in everything\nBut I just um I just remember as a kid loving that it was\nIt was like a fun scary and it was you know creepy in that like I said again you know black lights in the\nUh we were um and I grew up in Louisville, Kentucky and one of the local radio stations W. H. A. Y. was wacky and they had the wacky haunted house and it was\nIt was what your bigger brothers would take you to you know as a kid and it got to be a family event and everybody would be there and it was the coolest thing of all is one of the biggest advance like in the country I mean even though all the radio people still remember this from\nFrom back then it was a wacky haunted house there was nothing nothing scary or it was all so much fun back then everybody had a good time you'd be dressed up\nA it was fun to be scared you laugh and then you go home and the next day you know that was that you eat eat candy for awhile and sometime you still had that candy\nWhen it came to Christmas [laughter] just the way it was right down the\nMarathon borrow either right away I Am doing those\n[laughter] you'd freeze those have you ever had them frozen\nOh they were great oh you're just taking me back your love is\nSomebody needs to a grand that recipe and make those again I don't know why they ever stop because you knew that everybody loved marathon bars my gosh\nYeah they were and they came and that was like a red and black rapper written\nOr something yeah and the real or on the back oh man I I mean anything Googled after we're done here\nAnd uh and uh I I didn't know that um that uh what's his face with lots of USC McGregor so I I I learned that tonight in fact if I weren't here talking to you I'd probably be watching the fight\nThere you go it's gone now is there any way Yeah Yup yup yup\nNever on all the producers were were watching that hey you guys are going on there now so well\nKnowing all the origins of Halloween talking about the the past and even what you think about the future and the say panic part and all that good stuff now another element is is some people they don't you know their past the trick or treat\nStage their past doing the tricks you know and all that kind of stuff and now what they do is they go into cemeteries or they go into the woods or they go into\nVisit you naive wages I die or the design of today because you're not in we out when you\nWatch the News I'm Teri and but you will take his seat on the bench Tuesday after weeks of protests and political back and forth Brett Kavanaugh sworn in as a one hundred and fourteen Supreme Court justice narrowly confirmed Saturday at a fifty to forty eight votes Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell says he believes the country will heal from the heated nomination proceedings\nOf the country will get past this\nOr we always do a Virginia sister put together this constitution or their what they were doing and uh we've had plenty of low points in our history and I think this is nowhere near the lowest points we experience\nKavanaugh's nomination was marked by allegations of sexual misconduct as part of the effort to where North Korea to give up its nukes secretary of state Mike Pompeo has met with North Korean leader Kim Jong on NPR on young Bombay oh says they're making progress on agreements made\nOf the Singapore so much ...
