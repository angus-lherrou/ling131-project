back to coast to coast George story with you Robert boss was with us almost three years to the ... this day Robert Moss has been a dream traveler\nSince doctors pronounced him clinically dead in a hospital in test mania when he was three years old from his experiences and many worlds he created his school of active dreaming his original\nSince this is a modern dream work with the ancient shut Monica mystical practices for journey to the realms beyond the physical though he leads popular workshops all over the planet including\nThree you're training for teachers of active dreaming an online courses for the shift network a noted the authors got a number of books the most recent mysterious realities Robert welcome back my friend\nGood debate dreaming weaving with George Foy\nLooking forward to this ... this tragedy that happened when you were three would you tell us again what happened\nFestival my mother took me a Melbourne, Australia where we live in West a stray that to see her on the upper thing I Am the psychic media and the main caliber\nAnd she looked in the ... the old fashioned way and she saw my that she didn't tell us she went out room came back white faced well she was right that when they had me when my other that'd be trends though it's quite an army officer\nI got pneumonia and I died and help build the old my parents that I had died but I couldn't agree dead and then they looked again they said oh you boy died and he came back so that that is why do the experiences of my life involving the stuff that goes into the new book\nI must tell you George I don't remember anything much what happened when I was out of my body three members rubber a living under the afterwards what happened afterwards when I was eight nine\nWas I died again pronounced dead again on drugs is a message and the conditions and the sister appendectomy in an operating room and that time I remember what happened it sounds like the classic empty to begin with I found that the ceiling looking at the the the the the scalpel and the so didn't not money to be around going down\nDown the beach down to loosen up talk of some pocket Melbourne, Australia big moon faces the gate wanted to do with an old and re nine year old kid would want to do go on the ride will go into some addresses\nSo I guarantee Luna Park age nine in my astrobiology and I'm drawn into I didn't know that goes straight maybe\nI'm drawn into another world and where I Am the sci fi very beautiful very very lovely people and they raised me is that right and I forget that I've got a buddy in hospital bed back eventually opt to seeming to live a whole life of Ninety years or so and I'm shocked\nTo find myself in the body as a kid and and now the hospital and from that George comes my lifelong understanding there will be on the physical you know nine years old who you talk about this she tried to talk the adults at the medication you're hallucinating or something like this person who could explain\nTo me what happened in any way that made sense was an aboriginal kid from the indigenous tradition is it oh yeah we do that we get sick really sick we got to live with the spirits and then we come back and sometimes we have the same\nAnd sometimes we're not so the gift of these experiences which rings like coal dissociation was an ability to travel beyond the body traveling consciousness without psychedelic club drugs quite easily and an understanding that there are well beyond the physical and they are accessible\nYou must have been an amazing little boy Robert\nWell I was not alone in a little boy you know I was sick I on my father's in the army and so we moving all the time army brat situation I'll tell you one of the things that kept me going is it amongst mind this book companions a phrase probably most of us remember from childhood was a big man and a lot of white hair and upping face\nBecoming sit on my dad didn't say backup Robin you know you're going to make it through you'll survive I can promise you that you're learning now that you know goals and they'll like you and one day all day you can't kill your dreams are easier right now people will want to hear you\nThat invisible companion George was the older rubber younger than I Am now traveling across time to cheer up his younger self help him come through one of the things I've learned is\nWe had time travel is in our dreams and when we develop the odds of conscious or active treated me as I call it one of the cool things we can do is we can actually go back to youngest self and be cheerleader and counselor to them in the right time and going the other way we can sometimes managed to talk\nTo a why is the self who sees what life looks like a bit further down the road that we have gotten and can help us to get the right perspective\nAmazing now let's get into your latest work of course mysterious realities a dream travelers tales from the imaginable realm you call yourself a dream travel or what is that\nWell it means that one of the things going on in dreams is that we traveled beyond our old and read dimension of reality into other will we traveled a parallel worlds for example\nWhere we're leading parallel lives this isn't as weird as it sounds science tells us in the many worlds hypothesis that you and I live in right now in one of many parallel worlds well how do we know about that in human terms while we might know it from our dreams in which we find ourselves for example\nIn consecutive episodes living a life a bit different from what we're living right now on may be radically different so that's part of a dream traveling mainstream traveling also means\nThat in our dreams in sleep dreams and then in conscious elusive dreaming we made travel to places where the dead or alive and this might be the source of understanding that solar consciousness survive physical test isn't it pretty pretty important area\nUh so the idea of dream travel goes beyond the routine idea about dreams as little bubble up from the U.S no subconscious not sold that's going on a this was the ancient an indigenous understanding as lived in my life and told and stories from that life\nBut in dreams we traveled to other places and we received visitations from people who come cooling those people to come calling my including clued but loving family members around says to the spiritual guy some kind or another\nSo dream travel means we get out that we get beyond the body and the brain we get into that whole field of non local mind that science tells us about to get in the condom information field to get into the ability to access sources of information beyond the Audrey and also part of this is that we are definitely a time travel is\nAnybody who follows their dreams for wild and writes down will notice that they dream of events before they happen and one function of time travel we see the possible future we can reverse the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead but we also traveled into the past from this my mother lives you learned about connections\nDrama is playing out in other realities and all the time periods in the multi dimensional universe so this is the key to the U.S hand understanding of what the multi dimensional universe is all about this is the path of direct experience this path and dream travel\nAnd my stories in the book come absolutely and entirely from mine experiences in these areas and the experiences of some other people who worked with me and to give them permission to use the story\nRobert if we did not dream of course we all do not everybody remembers him but if we did not dream what would we be lacking as human beings what would happen to us\nI think we'd be locking quite often a sense of purpose a sense of soul and spirit because you know one of the things that dreams do is they connect us to keep a source of knowledge of wisdom actually be on the old and remind this was one of the reasons why\nMost human ... human couches across history about dreams and dream of say believe the dreams put you in touch with the guard or the goddess if you like but you can talk to with nature with the ancestors with the big ... all the highest ... so we might be lacking that\nI'd say terribly relevant to our times is that we might be lacking conscience stickers dreams can be the voice of conscience and dreams can be\nA ... a magic mirror that shows us our actions and attitudes from a death on an more objective perspective than we can manage for our cells in indigenous people say if you lost your dream you've lost a vital part of your sold your dream sold in fact has gone missing\nAnd probably the scariest story in my book mysterious realities unquote dreamed takers\nAnd which takes a look at what that might begin to mean if you live in a society where people are divorced from their dreams have lost the sense of conscience\nI've lost the sense of a deep up to the sin of that by the gun to lose a sense of what it really means to be a human a fully a live human I think it's actually as important as that\nI was mentioning now Robert that some people don't remember their dreams what makes them not remember\nWell first of all we haven't made it socially rewarding fun to share dreams I mean we don't have good ways of talking about dreams most but it's when you're a member of something a bit embarrassed how do we talk about this how do we tell us\nSo one of the things lacking in our society is a way that makes it fun as I say socially rewarding to bring a dream to the table I invented the very simple full step prices to sharing a dream of a story that makes it on you can get it done in minutes you get some help ... feedback and you're guided tours action but there are other reasons\nWhy we're losing our genes I mean bad habits pots and that is part of it also to rush style to sleep by the alarm clock but the need to get the job of deal with the family we think that we should lie in the church in bed and don't pay and it took eight dollars or whatever and they pay any attention\nTo those in between twilight states of consciousness you'll between sleep in the wake that's a good time to catch it means good time to back them loose and dreaming but many people don't realize that that just seem because they're awake in the middle of the night yet ... says losing that others\nSometimes we close off our dream because they're scared of what they might be telling us we don't want to know that we might get sick we don't want to know that our actions may not be okay we don't want to know the relationship is in trouble so we'd slam the door and say no more dreams sometimes this is very interesting\nAnd that the ... Indian very well I found myself dreaming into his life but I had to study did live\nOn for a second Robert we're at the break but we'll be back with more and more than a coast to coast they um [noise]\nGet Daily Show updates right to your inbox for free with the ... newsletter sign up today at ... dot com [noise]\nLikes to play there you go again by the around wait I didn't mean by that I just wanted to see what I mean it's all about you I agree with him that\nKim and share like boxing around feeling the alley sorry\nMaybe people generally prefer the shooting and comforting kind of a female voice apology\nAccepted into K brown so what station did you want to hear again\nCain SPAM seven Ninety there's nothing artificial down there and telling them\nMore tires hard rockers maybe sit down with [noise]\n\n\nFrom Seventy six [noise]\nMovies this weekend because you're black history\nFears weekends white as new releases Halloween which is both eleven film in the series hand of direct sequel to the Nineteen Seventy eight original which ignores all the subsequent entries Jamie Lee Curtis returns is Laurie Strode one of the survivors of the [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise] nah nah nah nah\nNah\nNah nah\nNah\nNah\nNah nah nah\nMe [noise]\nFrom the gateway to the west coast to coast am with George ...\nWith our special guest tonight Robert Moss we'll take your phone calls about your dreams next hour here on the coast to coast am following the breaking story a helicopter has crashed on the USS Ronald Reagan sailors are hurt\nThat's all I have a we'll follow up on that later if we get more information but the the helicopters crashed on the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier and there are some hurt sailors show our prayers go up to them [noise]\nTurn on a date dot com is America's fastest growing dating site's really rolling along were over Seventy nine thousand members were now heading for eighty thousand members it's free to sign up\nUsed code Georgia being around there but they go to Peru normal day dot com that's paranormal date dot com ... technology ...

I was in a graveyard this week and I look at him\nAnd I was in a graveyard I've never been to before never been in this place and just having a walk\nAnd I'm thinking about a girl I loved and could never have from Thirty years ago and I looked down on the name of a headstone is her name the full name\nAnd there's the dates this person died last summer and I can't believe it or that ice cold\nShe'd never beat in the air as far as I Know I make some calls I discovered she died last summer and something drew me to a head start he says what do you think of that I said it's a great story the very great story I mean not introduce his whole themes about\nYou know the energy and the connection that might exist between the living in the dead and how someone who has died my coat and to sudden close to a certain place might even be an age of ... but\nAs I'm telling us it's also an example of how like attracts like I like stories so even on a day when I'm staying at the airport I don't need a news story today I'm given what else to live as a story immediately just like that and in the these examples proliferate so\n... you know what it how it works is that the the attitude and the energy you're carrying again to have results your attitude travels ahead of you in life\nShaping wanted waking foot waiting fuel round the next corner which is a very good reason everything in life to pause and check your attitude check what is playing when you're in a soundtrack check what you're saying to you so Trump the negative mantras and self limiting beliefs\nAnd be open to something more positive coming into your life\nRobert is there anything physical about this I mean I Know you need the brain the dream but we're also tapping into I think the subconscious and it does its thing outside of the physical body but how important is the physical body to all of this\nWell I think about is very important that the first of all I mean scientists telling us there is no barrier between mind and matter anywhere in the universe mind to match up into leave at every turn in every level in fact some scientists tell us that the hot a matter of reality is a dense conscious so\n... there's no hope of separating mind matter they're always play together\nBut when we think about the kinds of messages the kinds of discoveries that we're exploring we have to remember the party has its own messages discoveries there's the phenomena that used to be called pre sentiment which I experienced a lot maybe you do to what it means in terms of the body is the body sometimes seems to know\nThings that are going to happen before the the mind of the brain can recognize what is going on the body reacts\nTo something ahead of time for example I go to the doctor for routine annual physical one time my blood pressure is much higher than usual even though it's controlled it's surprisingly high and there's no explanation for this until the nuts trying to get get some blood for a blood analysis hits the gusher in my blood is boating and that's\nWhy you're living in tents and after\nThat I'm completely common my blood pressure is normal and she and the doctor trying to understand what just happened\nI said well this is pretty sentiment is what's called an Alice in wonderland the the white queen gamble the white queen screams\nBefore she ... she doesn't have to

dreams in the sense that you again to remember your dreams are going to share them the right way to you're going to take action that will empower your life and bring some healing energy and guide in July from your dreams I mean that's one aspect of it\nIt's also method of lose the dreaming you would call it shut medical use of dreaming we ... my favorite way of talking on the loose and dream adventure\nIs to start out lose to the state ... what does that need it means that we use shut many drumming in the workshops\nAnd we might take a dream that we remember as a starting point we might decide okay there's some romance an adventure still in the stream let's go on with the dream let's get back inside the treatment have more we might decide okay it's time to brave up to a nightmare terror and stuff that stuff going on\nBy going back inside the dream and facing the scary based on its own ground it might mean I Want to talk to someone who turned up in my dream whether it's spreading marrow someone else\nSo that's an example of traumatic looser dreamy another example is and I encourage people to spend a lot more time in that risky try like state\nTo eat and sleep and

and themselves as a deceptive\nI mean we can pick up things in the night of the problems with the floating around that we don't watch around we can pick up things from other other entities from whether they're just a bit confused or militias\nThat that can be confusing or deceptive but I think that any image that belongs to us that is truly our own\nCan be worked in the service of health and

that behind something that's scaring worrying and you and\nYour dream is a power power the understanding of power that might might give you a kind of spiritual ally or a life guide a life coach if

P. Morgan has accumulated the largest private stockpile of physical silver in the world more than a hundred and thirty million ounces that's over two billion dollars worth of silver I'm sure they're not doing it because they expect the price to go down\nThe hall I guess not but could super reach higher than a hundred dollars announced\nOr if you adjusted for inflation George sober would have to be about a hundred and thirty dollars announced to reach us all time high so we think are one hundred dollars is well within reach\nOne could that happen over the next seven to ten years but we believe most of the games will happen over the next three to five years just hard to ignore the potential in silver right now\nKevin our listeners are passionate about anything that you can set out to listeners so they can find out more about a hundred dollar Schober\nDo George or to make a special offer for you it's our latest sky high silver report listeners can learn more about China's massive move into solar and why experts the civil rights\nAnd do a hundred dollars announce the report is the twenty dollar value but it's free for your listeners by calling one eight hundred to nine nine Seventy four hundred one eight hundred to nine nine Seventy four hundred\nFolks this last week even for just came out with a report saying China was leading the way with Schumer and that in two thousand Eighteen global investments in the solar will outstrip cool gas didn't you clear combine\nLet's get leaders sky high silver report in some fascinating report it don't miss out on the ... revolution goal now to get your copy it's a twenty dollar value free with no obligation go one eight hundred\nTo nine nine Seventy four hundred that's one eight hundred\nTo nine nine Seventy four hundred [noise]\nWe've got a great ... of Oregon now one of\nThose botanical that is so absolutely so amazing David your guy that has overcome severe issue or\nWhether light the light bulb went on and I started to research on on the ... yeah it's a wonderful thing that is bringing me back and it's been almost eight years now\nHow did you have did you take the liquid did you take the cat [laughter]\nI was going through the capsules like uh they couldn't get enough it made me feel so much better\nSoon after you begin taking the council's you kind of felt this was going to be a good thing\nSix months eight months I can only tell you one thing the product war and not only works in one way it works in a whole bunch of different ways because it gives me energy gives me like Tallahassee caring and my how\nDid you have test to validate it and if so did you do when afterwards the doctors now a clean bill\nI Am ... [noise] since they're better way to earn a war on his bills to everything back into my body taken a while but you know on his back there and I ... I Can't say on a\nHow do you know the real Joyce as opposed to being some some ...\nYeah but you know it's very very hard to tell the difference it's very strange I Can't really differentiate what's real and what it is and\nBecause the the the frauds are very good at what they do\nThat's the thing and you know what I watch shows on TV about uh how magicians are pulling in public and I say this is so bad because it's so good at this and it makes all of us who are legitimate look really really bad and it looks like we're all\nDoing trickery up to them so I I'll tell you if you have a psychic reading you should not\nYou should not ask the person who's receiving their reading any questions I shouldn't say well you know it's your mother's name or anything like that why you're here you should be able to tell them that's the first test of legitimacy of what you are receiving\nThe retailer on a few days ago I heard it in the great guy and I I Believe he's got these powers are others who were critical of him say that he's just a great magician and and I told them I says hurry I got to tell you if you're a magician\nAnd you're doing this would sleight of hand you've got to be the best there ever was because I said we can't see how you been those spoons\nMagically you if you're a magician I Can't see the trick or you know we're we're you do the switch or anything like that ah I've looked at videos I've slowed him down a gun frame by frame you can't catch the guy I think he's the real deal\nI think he's probably the real deal I Believe he started out doing magic tricks as many of these wonderful psychic do they start out doing simple magic tricks and then it ethically from there\nAs a there are six cents kicks in and they start to weigh it legitimately and then it kinda well close together you can't tell the difference but it's wonderful that you're you're falling down frames and did you learn anything from that we were able to\n... you know what I just learned that the guys got some powers but a lot of us have that ability to generate some of those similar kinds of power she was starting up watch isn't blocks haven't started in years\n[laughter] try to say that when you were growing up you did magic tricks that you're involved with magic\nAnd did a little magic when I was kid um you know was ... I was really good at that but you know I dabble with that I had a lot of body experience when I was eleven uh which really I think Steve me\nInto the field that I Know I just wanted answers to all these unusual strange things and they're still unusual and strange for me Joyce\n[laughter] yes I Know but you you're really amazing because I find that most people are so skeptical and you spend so much energy trying to convince people are really saying something that will really be impressed and they'll say well I was a trick I it was a visiting a Web site last night that I thought was terrific and\nThere there were some uh doubters who\nHad captions over the whole thing saying this is obviously fraudulent\nAnd those are people I Believe who will not allow themselves to move out of out of the third dimensional way of thinking that's so restrictive eliminating you know into higher consciousness go into fourth dimension and beyond let's all move forward and it's the people who are very mired in a monetary\nAnd ah other um financial interests or very earthy that will not leave that dimension and that's really a shame because the earth is supposed to be in growing in a consciousness so they're kind of a\nDigging their heels and it's like a little bit of resistance\nYeah you do now Georgia we take calls next hour what do you need from our callers listeners your birth month in

out as so many\nWill cut it short would try to get right in there as quickly as\nYou believe in reincarnation\n[noise] I don't see how it's not possible how could we possibly have the experience as we have\nIf we weren't for more than one time in either on the earth or another dimension so I think people can be here the first time because they've been in other dimensions other\nPlanets I I don't think anyone is new so I'd have to say where I Believe in reincarnation as say a variation of it and other churches need to catch up a little bit which I think they are and they're related disorders\nAs a psychic or anything out there that bothers you the the the ... very strange about\nWhat you said very strange about like um\nAre you picking on are you picking up ... feelings or anything like that\nI don't like going the cemetery I don't like the energy there and people who are loose loved ones and they go to the cemetery frequently our polling\nThat person back to their grave site and they they really want to go and why they want to be elevated themselves and yet the grieving process is really not good it's not healthy for anyone I Know I Know that grief but you don't dwell on it you say you know I Love this person and good luck God Bless you and try to relate to them and\nAnd I always think about the right things and\nThink about that we can we well like I Want to like God Bless you I Love you thank you for what we had to go there and let them go I'm going to the cemetery very bad uh you know my my parents were big cemetery guard when I was growing up is that a good work [laughter]\nI don't like cemeteries and I don't like funerals\nExactly but my parents were part of a generation with cemetery it's a lot you know and I found myself a cemetery great you're growing up and at one point my parents\nWere pointing to a muscle am driving through Greenwich cemetery and my mom that she I think we should get one of those\nOh and I think every time yeah I I'm thinking to myself I really don't want to live here they'll play no they're not going to stay here\nAs I started crying and what's wrong with you I I don't want to live here and they said

matter and I think Robin Williams and a lot of people have taught us a lot about suicide\n... very sad\nYes don't do it [laughter]\nNo you'd asked me if I see or is that I don't but I Do feel or as Joyce I Do have them below the ...\nIs feeling the threat class that you a sense than you're feeling that's very intuitive so you can feel oppressed and it's like when you're with and there are field is that what you mean George\nYes oh I bet ya impressive\nSo if you're with the press is not that good to step away from them you would pull back right\nYeah absolutely now there are some people who when I called psyche\nVampires but they're not necessarily bad people they just have the ability to dream people's energy I tried to work with those people by the way George I try to help them and I've had some stories where they've changed and people began to like them again in surround themselves are on the person but\nI get a kick out of trying to help people who want to help themselves but\nJust don't know how that's a form of hailing and that's a terrific that's really really great because they don't know how to help themselves and you come in and it could be training for you but it's not because you know how to control your own energy which is really extraordinary [noise] so that's a wonderful form of hailing\nLet's take some calls are lining up here for you I'm going to give you a name and the birth dates ... uh the ... day in year and then if they want to ask you a question to start would that be appropriate Joyce\nSure that'll be great however you're on a charge that\nThe one that started with Christian Tampa Bay Florida Chris's ah been born on October ten on October sixteen Nineteen Seventy October sixteen Nineteen Seventy Hey Chris welcome\nOh thank you didn't have happy birthday [laughter] I don't have much I just had one\nOkay so tense exchange so you have a really wonderful cycle beginning but it has to do with creativity\nYou have a question Chris oh I'm\nVery much a creature routine and I just wanted their routines and our break his routine can get boring after a while\nYeah but here in Tampa that area's not boring it all to shift their antagonistic a terrific area and do you ever do any kind of painting or art work\nI'm I'm looking I used to I I Do some writing now yes well you have\nMore than ... at the time you were born and that tells me that your your extremely intuitive and you're very caught up with details when you paid you should be painted again that's very therapeutic pie crust and that'll bring and wonderful spirit energy as well\nSo you have a lot of intuitive ability to have enough now I see so I Know you can read people very quickly so I thank you very much for calling it if you have a question\nNo that was there but thank you very much\n... much less yeah hey there's nothing wrong with being in a routine is their Joyce\nNo but you know I sometimes have become really really discouraged and you say that to be something else so at that point you have to it's very very hard to get out of Iraq really difficult for the most difficult things on the planet at that point you have to force yourself to do something you really don't want to like whatever that might be\nA you know just just do it and go out you fit your energy will change change your energy so change your life I tried prayer and meditation than what God I'm really stuck\nAnd bring me something fresh and something no unfair it will work with you\nDo you work with people teaching them a psychic abilities\nSure uh not only that but what the new website was starting which I mentioned before which is on my website we're going to be training people going to be helping them and uh in in all my books I say the same thing you don't have to pay a psychic or anything you can do this yourself\nIt's a God given talent that we all have just pay attention to your feelings listen to what you're hearing and stop doubting yourself and stopped saying if my imagination\nYou know when you get that late night phone number going you're going to get a lot of insomniacs calling you\n[laughter] well that's okay [laughter] I'm probably

adventure the opposite seeming to live a whole life of Ninety year old so and I'm shocked\nTo find myself in the body of a kid and and now the hospital and from that George comes my lifelong understanding that there will be on the physical you know nine years old who you talk about that you try to talk it out that the medication you're hallucinating or something but\nThen who could explained to me what happened in any way that made sense with an aboriginal kid from the indigenous tradition is that oh yeah we do that we get really thick we've got to live with the spirit and then we come back and sometimes we have the\nAnd sometimes we're not so the gift of these experiences with shrinks by coal dissociation\n... ability to travel beyond the body traveling consciousness without psychedelic club drugs quite easily and an understanding that there will be on the physical and they are accessible\nYou must have been an amazing little boy Robert\nWell I'm not alone in a little boy you know I was sick I on my fathers and the army's that we're moving all the time army brat situation I'll tell you one of the things that kept me going is it amongst mind this book companions a phrase probably most of us remember from childhood was a big man and a lot of white hair and a pink face\nCome and sit on my dad didn't say backup Robin you know you're going to make it through your survive I can promise you that you're learning now that you know goals and they'll like you and one day that you can't tell your dreams are easier right now people will want to hear you\nThat invisible companion George was the older brother younger than I Am now traveling across time to cheer up his younger self and help him come through one of the things I've learned is\nWe had time travel is in our dreams and when we developed the odds of conscious or active treated me as I call it one of the cool things we can do is we can actually go back to youngest self and be cheerleader and counselor to them in the right time and going the other way we can sometimes managed to talk\nTo a why is the self who sees what life looks like a bit further down the road that we have gotten and can help us to get the right perspective\nAmazing now let's get into your latest work of course mysterious realities dream travelers tales from the imagine all realm you call yourself a dream travel or what is that\nWell it means that one of the things going on in dreams is that we traveled beyond our old and read dimension of reality into other will we traveled a parallel worlds for example\nBut we're leading parallel lives this isn't as we or does it sound science tells us in the many worlds hypothesis that you and I live in right now in one of many parallel worlds well how do we know about that in human terms while we might know it from our dreams in which we find ourselves for example\nIn consecutive episodes living a life a bit different from what we're living right now on may be radically different so that's part of a dream traveling mainstream trampling also means\nThat in our dreams in sleep dreams and then and conscious elusive dreaming we made travel to places where the dead or alive and this might be the source of understanding the solar consciousness survived physical test is is a pretty pretty important area\nOr so the idea of dream travel goes beyond the routine idea about dreams as they'll bubble up from the U.S no subconscious not sold that's going on a this was the ancient an indigenous understanding as lived in my life and told and stories from that life\nBut in dreams we traveled to other places and we received visitations from people who come cooling those people to come calling my employer include but loving family members around says to the spiritual guy some kind or another\nSo dream travel means we get out that we get beyond the body in the brain we get into that whole field of non local mind that science tells us about to get in\nInformation field to get into the ability to access sources of information beyond the Audrey and also part of this is that we are definitely a time travel is\nAnybody who follows their dreams for wild and writes down will notice that they dream of events before they happen and one function of time travel we see the possible future we can reduce the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead\nBut we also traveled into the ... from this my mother lives you learned about our connections\nWith drama is playing out and other realities and all the time periods in the multi dimensional universe so this is the key to the U.S hand understanding of what the multi dimensional universe is all about this is the path of direct experience this papa dreamed travel\nAnd my stories in the book come absolutely and entirely from mine experiences in these areas and the experiences of some other people who worked with me and to give me permission to use the story\nRobert if we did not dream of course we all do not everybody remembers him but if we did not dream what would we be lacking as human beings what would happen to us\nI think we'd be locking quite often a sense of purpose a sense of Seoul since the spirit because you know one of the things that dreams do is they connect us to keep a source of knowledge of wisdom actually be on the old and remind this is one of the reasons why\nMost human kill human couches across history about dreams and dream of say believe the dreams put you in touch with the guard or the goddess if you like\nThat you can talk to with nature with the ancestors with the big self all the highest sold so we might be lacking that I'd say terribly relevant to our time is that we might be lacking conscience stickers dreams can be the voice of conscience and dreams can be\nA ... a magic mirror that shows us our actions and attitudes from the data and more objective perspective than we can manage for ourselves\nAn indigenous people say if you lost your dream you've lost a vital part of your sold your dream sold in fact has gone missing and probably the scariest story in my book mysterious realities unquote dreamed takers\nAnd ... which takes a look at what that might begin to mean if you live in a society where people are divorced from their dreams have lost the sense of conscience\nI've lost the sense of a deep up to the sin of that by the gun to lose a sense of what it really means to be a human a fully alive human I think it's actually it's important that that\nI was mentioning now Robert that some people don't remember their dreams what makes them not remember\nWell first of all we haven't made it socially rewarding oath on to share dreams I mean we don't have good ways of talking about dreams most of us when we remember something a bit embarrassed how do we talk about is how do we tell us\nSo one of the things like you know society is a way that makes it fun and as I say socially rewarding to bring a dream to the table I invented the very simple false step prices to sharing a dream of a story that makes it on you can get it done in minutes you get some help ... feedback and your guide to towards action but there are other reasons\nWhy we're losing our genes I mean bad habits apart from that is part of it to be let out so the rushed out of sleep by the alarm clock but the need to get the job of deal with the family\nWe think that we should lie in the in bed and don't pay and it took eight dollars or whatever and they pay any attention to those in between twilight states of consciousness between sleep in the wake\nThat's a good time to catch it means good time to back them loose and dreaming but many people don't realize that that just seemed because they're awake in the middle of the night yet ... set of losing that others\nSometimes we close off our dream because they're scared of what they might be telling us we don't want to know that we might get sick we don't want to know that our actions may not be okay we don't want to know the relationship is in trouble so he'd slam the door and say no more dreams sometimes this is very interesting\nSo much to say and not enough
