{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KNST", "content": "With incredible strength and five and when they said that there another tribe of people\nThis community and the big foot world that\nIs very adamant that they're an ape\nThrows this completely off the wall and when you dig deeper in it most Native American tribes in fact probably Ninety nine percent say it's another type of people were tribe and this article goes right to that point and nobody was ever written a book before tribal ever brought that out\nAnd when I when I found it I couldn't believe that nobody was talking about it and it it's stunning still that nobody wants to talk about it\nYeah I Wonder what those tribes if they're still around would say about it now\nYears later years\nWell I can I can tell you that being around tribes in the Midwest and in the west like Harvey and I were it's consistent they still say that it's a type of people\nYou know the descriptions of course as you have noted that the term big what started to Nineteen fifty eight so before then people had other words for it and it and then many or most of the early clippings and stories that you have elected they call them wild man of course I guess that would fit I mean\nThey they're humanoid shape they're out in the forest there Harry\nUm they don't know what else to call them\nFor walks like a man walks up right it doesn't walk bent over and their knuckles aren't dragging on the ground like an eight um\nIf I I always tell people I said well if it's an animal then it's probably going to be found and it's probably going to be identified and you could probably go view and study\nAnd wild man ... that's a different sort of thing it's a different kind of topic very elusive a\n... I don't know anybody that's claimed to have studied them in the wild walking into the wilderness and found a spot and study them year after year so they have intelligence that it's quite a bit different than the average animal quote unquote that you see in the woods\nAnd even the animals on the ape gorilla\nEt cetera side of the equation totally different they they act different they walk different they look different and one thing that everyone has to think about it never in North America have there been any wild ape gorilla bones found ever\nBut we have how I'd while or giant human bones found\nAnd that's that you really make you think\nYou know some of the descriptions any articles uh are made me chuckle a little bit because the writers who have no familiarity with the topic of course because it's new to them they're they're explaining it must have been old Fred ... who disappeared into the forest a couple of years ago and now he's grown hair all over his body\n\nThat I [laughter] I traveled with you on us and I think people are scratching to bring in some rationality to an irrational observation\nUm and and the parts of the country where these things are seen you know get way way below zero it snows huh how Fred that decided to leave his farm going to live and that type of environment\nAnd and grow hair all over his body like that a thick long hair you mentioned in the in the clip that I was reading there from a middle aged Seventeen hundreds you had a notation at the bottom\nThat said maybe this is what Daniel Boone saw ah I didn't see the Daniel Boone any Daniel Boone story in here other than that reference that you made but he had an encounter is a fairly famous encounter right\nThat's correct and uh I I couldn't find an archive news article about it but I saw other secondary in third level things that were written about what Daniel called I I think it was a Yahoo\nYeah and the description was pretty close and I don't know it's it sure seemed possible but again if you went into the quote unquote credible archives you really not going to find that you have to do really deep and and find out what\nMaybe some explorers wrote about that they heard in which he encountered so but again and tribal Bigfoot I've written about things where an explorer from the Watergate church\nWas coming across country on a horse and he wrote in his explore notes that\nThis thing came up to him while he's on his horse and look them either I actually spoke to him large hairy by pat he'd never seen before that matched the description of a wild man or a big foot and it came from the archives with a ... church butter de saint church\nAnd it's in there so to say that these things\nHappen happen with ... with\nUh the first entry the oldest entry comes to us from Jacques ballet you wrote about it and have a clip from\nSeptember Seventeen sixteen eighty it was a reported in his book wonder in the sky a large black wildlife mass landed in a field releasing a huge here Hubbard being that was seen briefly and disappeared now that's the kind of thing that will drive\nUm big foot people who think it's an ape just crazy\n[laughter] you know I I'm not sure how many people listening actually bought a ... book on a about this but when I was going through it\nI I like to think I'm a mile wide and an inch deep I like to read about different things that could be associated with topics I'm doing research on and what I read this I'm a fellow over and said wow I don't think anybody's ever heard of this and uh his book which was a Kickstarter project right\nUm which kind of did the same thing with the UFO topic that I did on this big topic it was a stunner I again I don't think a lot of people want to hear that\nYeah I I uh I was part of that project and um and supported it and uh it's a tremendous book and people can find it anywhere they should check it out we're talking with Dave ... about his latest work big foot Wildman and

I don't remember where it is in the in the book but there was a an incident where somebody's camp fire\nTheir camp kept being messed with while they're out in the woods somewhere\nSo they they waited in a work in the bushes to wait to see what came and did it and the as I recall the creatures that came it was one or two they were short they were like fibers five or six feet tall not to ten or twelve feet tall but covered with hair and they were just kind of playing with fire\nSo think about\nUh let's say a twelve year old kid\nWho doesn't have much association with fire not a grown adult comes into the fire is playing with it because they have this unique opportunity that's kinda what I was thinking as I read that article from California\nUh I think from the mid Eighteen hundreds and I think it was a hunter that knew something was messing around but he couldn't figure it out so he waited on a ridge line they came in and he saw this\nAnd the um it's not unusual that hunters and campers and other things in the woods have seen these things doing an unusual things other times or they're seen them awake playing like kids in the water um it\nAgain the behavior that you read about reminds you sometimes have children and especially when the sizes match\nProportionally a smaller Bigfoot you think well must be young kid the attitudes are different\nDifferent reports to a generally not hostile shy when they get away from people when they encounter him but they can be pretty nasty when provoked a there's a phenomenon it's reported in several these clubs where they throw rocks big rocks that humans disorder to chase them off\nA and there's one report I think it's I I forget where it is in the book I'll have to look for a of a big boy that's supposedly killed a hunter right that was the first one you've found\nOh it was ... and you know sometimes I question the credibility of some of these articles because who saw it how did they get to those conclusions um was there any evidence left behind these older articles or sometimes tough to get to the root of where they came from or how they came to those conclusions\nAnd I don't I don't put a lot of emphasis on that but\nIn the near term I've never found a big foot nowadays that's conclusively killed anybody and\nWhen I started writing the missing for one one books there's a lot of erroneous information that I have associated this topic on pick for with missing for one one I never have I've never stayed at that I thought that pick for was involved in these things\nWhy because I've never read a credible article implying that they did and since the fall on on books came out all of a sudden people have started saying oh yeah you know this campsite these campers were killed this was happening and I get these once a year or say\nAnd every time I followed up I find that it's not a credible source it never happened yet the myth keep perpetuating on the Internet and they're not true and\nSome people believe all you know it's a cover up\nBut as someone who has spent an enormous amount of time in these rural areas with these rural sheriff's deputies\nOf people do not give a damn about what the federal government thinks about their behavior and trying to convince them to keep their mouth shut it's never going to happen they will tell the truth and you're the feds aren't going to be able to keep 'em clamped up\nSo when you hear these stories all these campers were killed by something really mysterious if it was happening I'd hear about it from these guys and they say half the time they say it never happened it's a completely phony story so\nI get emails I I can imagine what your emails or like but I get them or just because people know that we know each other or why doesn't ... go ahead and admitted big with its kidnapping people and I I Would have to say this a day there are some accounts in this book these newspaper clippings where there\nAre references to these huge Wildman carrying all women and children you know there was never any names attached to it though you know no\nNo and that's a that's the tough part of it how can you how can you leverage it as credible if supposedly they were getting carried off who saw it and why aren't they name there and if somebody's writing about it since it\nSeems to be a there are instances where in in these accounts where\nA humans who are not aggressive and don't take shots at these animals are not only did they described them as a I think it's it's gay they describe ... gay and I don't think it's in the context to gay as we used the term these days but gay humor is what they said like a friendly\nAnd the number of times I have heard a hunter say there's no way I could shoot it it looked to human\nIt ... I I have never heard of a hunter say oh yeah I had to kill this thing I shot it in the head or it it looked like an animal I've not heard that and I've heard the human side of it from a fireman\nA policeman credible credible sources that continually say the same thing and it isn't just one time in history goes way back in history or so there's something to this they got got skew where they said they started looking like him are apes than animals and\nAs you know Georgia's this segment of the big foot world that wants to go out and kill one and\nI don't have any idea why they think they need to kill one may be some kind of over loaded on testosterone but they they should wake up to the reality they're never going to kill them but it's not going to happen\nThere are some reports of where these people claimed to have killed one or they've captured a wild man and they brought him back somewhere on the ship or they've got him in jail and they invariably he gets away or the evidence disappears however\nSo this is the part that really really unusual several years ago one of my best friends their parents on a dairy farm\nAnd I started talking to him about this and I said you know I I keep reading that they may be milking cows you know what do you think about that because you know I'm going to talk to my parents\nSo they own a huge Jerry for anyone out there and talk to them in this well I think he's eighty years old this guy's dad and he looked at him and he said you know\nEvery once in a wall Mike how will come back from nowhere completely though\nHe goes I don't understand it [laughter] then\nThe same man told them he says you know every once in a while I'm On the far corner my property something tells me\nDon't turn around get back on the horse or get back on my ... a TV and leave and he does and then the man said well you know every once in a while I found a bucket way out in the corner of the property I don't know how it got their\nSo called jobs [laughter] I I think when you get the trust of some of these dairy farmers way out in the middle they are going to tell you the same thing 'cause I've heard it many times\nUm you know there are some funny stories I they're not in this book but I recall I think you and I have talked about before about big what are what they eat and they'll you know they're kind of particular this image of a big what milking a cow a sticks in my head but I mean they've been known to eat a lot of berries and\nDifferent kinds of groups um do they eat meat as far as you know\nAccording to the tribal people who are seen them take deer terror there an omnivore\nAnd many times when the natives are in the\nMiddle of the woods hunting themselves they'll come across a deer that stuck up in a tree and like a two hundred and fifty pound deer native could have done it and\nThey don't know how it got way up in the tree and it's a tornado or hurricane zone so how did it get their\n... big wild bend the giants as the book in a moment we'll open up the phone lines are with your calls and questions and comments white flag into the break your own coast it goes to a um [noise]\n\nFind out more about two nights gifts to log on to ... am dot com [noise]\n\nTwenty four hours making team divergent somebody's\nTrying to say I'm Sorry I mean are you if you listen or just sent in size actually gets you argue is my first shady at ... am liberal colleges we have one\n... users either anymore it's reality t._v.

I Want everyone to think about what was the percentage of people in the wilderness in Nineteen sixty seven that had the ability to take film or anything while\nThey were in the wilderness with my new topic about today\nNobody has ever come close to taking video or film of a big foot in the wilderness for a minute to have like they got on a PG ... day there's probably pushed one hundred percent of everybody in the wilderness carrion ...\nWhich has the ability to catch that so I Want everyone to understand that I Do believe the person film is real\nWhy haven't we caught the spy on film and that quality of a location and segment like they did in sixty seven there was something phenomenal about that event that caused that female big foot stay there\nBecause every other time they immediately run they all look at the camera like this one did they won't hang around and lingering knowing the people were watching him something unusual happened\nWell again not to take everything back your skin Walker day but it the the comparison is pretty clear is that that ... there was a loose if there are cameras all over the place\nIf you uh had activity in one area and set a camera up it would move somewhere else and it goes back to sort of the question that one of the callers asked about drones say you had a drone that had heat seeking technology it attached to it\nUm the description from the tribes the you mentioned in your books suggest this thing has camouflage abilities that he can poke itself the change of shapes and it can hide\nCorrect that's again one of the reasons that makes her different topic cope research\nYeah I mean we see it when it wants to be seen I guess yeah\nTry to get one more call in Tom in Vancouver up there in big what country Hey Tom are you doing\n\nIs Tom on the ... fellow\nI think Tom has gone ah okay so we're about out of time to have a great work or the title being sixteen eighty to Nineteen twenty two does that suggest that another a book of archived articles about these sightings good from some other time\n[noise] [noise] well not really no I ... and just so everyone knows the book that contains the actual article rewrite for the articles this is the real deal\nNineteen twenty was cut off point for copyright criminals article oh so by more than\nYou could print them after them you can't because they're so for\nA while it's a terrific a piece of work uh I Love reading it I I Want to go back and read it again because there's so many details that escaped me as I was preparing for the program but I I said some of the writing and this is just terrific\nAnd it's always great to have you on the program and I don't know what your sleep but I Hope you're taking care of yourself\nI'm always I'm always eager to be on your show Georgia and and the response I get from being on your show out of this world good so I appreciate the effort you put into it\nWell thanks very much I appreciate it and maybe we'll have you know get Melba catch them back on here some time to talk about that DNA stuff that'd be great\nOr I ... just again the big for a while bend a giant is the new book check it out if you get a chance at the moment we shift gears to talk about the true story of the worst the disaster in us naval history and the fifty year fight to exonerate an innocent man Indianapolis coming up momentarily we'll be right back [noise]\n\nNever missed a DJ on a show just sign up for the ... ... email newsletters relief for ...

the worst disaster in us naval history the two authors are Sarah ... and the claim documentary filmmaker one of the world's leading experts on the USS Indianapolis she became obsessed with the story at the age of Thirteen\nAnd over the next two decades she met and interviewed one hundred and seven of the ships survivors she produced and award winning documentary film about the disaster\nAnd a has a lot of other research still researching this story Lynn Vincent is the number one New York times best selling writer of Lebanon non fiction books with more than sixteen million copies in print\nHe's a veteran journalist and author of more than a thousand articles has done investigative pieces that have been so I did before Congress and the U.S Supreme Court\nI'm Sarah and Lynn welcome to the program ah I I'm blown away by your book grey tabby here\nHere from\nSarah like to start with you how did you get hooked on this story at age Thirteen ah most ah teenagers at Thirteen or not reading about the USS Indianapolis\nOr actually it was a documentary that I saw um I was watching it with my dad it was about the Pacific war and they reduced the story of the ship to a single line which was the ship that carry the bomb in stock\nAnd add to know more about it and so you know at the time there was no Google or anything like that so I actually had to go to the library [laughter] imagine that and you know\nThrough looking to what was available at the library I still couldn't find anything so I I Hope someone's got to tell the story you know from what I did learn about it it was very interesting and I think there was a lot of mystery surrounding it though I\nYou know I thought out what I could that thought you know someone will tell this story before I'm old enough to do it and you fast forward graduated from college and no one told the story you know the right way\nSo I thought out the survivors and found Paul Murphy who is the chairman of the survivors organization at the time and he invited me to a reunion and that's where I actually got to me of the men who survived Indianapolis and I mean you know I was a\nKid who was a meeting her heroes for the first time and they exceeded all expectations and they took me and kind of became like family so yeah they have a couple of years later after I had spent time with them and visit them at their homes\nThey asked me to be their storyteller and that kind of the clip notes version of it [noise]\nAnd Lynn for you how did you uh hook up with Sarah on working on this project you've done so many other books I I Would imagine that being able to write the true story and correct\nWide and great misperceptions a and strike a blow for justice for the for some of the key characters would be an amazing draw for you\nWell it was a very high and high tech from either way I got involved when I had actually been praying I'm I pray that might work and I had been praying have an opportunity to work on an iconic over story\nAnd all of a sudden in two thousand eleven additive I get this email from that young filmmaker and a lot it\nWell what they didn't say about her journey with an apple is with that I'm ... I'm going to have a story tell her she wanted to render the story as it rained play and she actually said that she wrote an part little ... than to and major\nProduction at home when we found a brother\nThat we only they when they are even\nThough you're getting ready to train ride or I don't know how to raise a family and friends theories that and contact with ...\nAnd I'm no number one that I'm a veteran now that I I've been trying for an opportunity to a story that's like this one um\n[noise] and my only problem was is that also wanting to fight and I wanted to help her write the book [laughter] ...\nThat I had to figure out how to manipulate or in a way to help her but uh eventually over the course of several men finally met\nAnd then a green could work on it together and they didn't really get started in earnest of twenty four and then when we get a project and a half\nSo Sarah where you are on a campaign to write a wrong that the story had been wrong that a lot of the that did people had who were key players had been treated unfairly is that how you started or you didn't know about that when you started\nI didn't you know I I knew a mall part of that um that was definitely\nOf what I wanted to tell but really I mean that major objective of it with to tell the whole story of this shit you know she'd been reduced to thinking story or shark story and no one knew she was this incredible ship that admiral Brent demanded\nMost of the Pacific war and the campaigns that he participated in from her deck or that Roosevelt took her on the first cruise you know us acting president ever left the country on so it was so much more like well you know everyone's got to know what an incredible shift this was in what she did\nA besides being sent [noise]\nBut I'll tell you grab me ... my father was a an open now and he ... he drove a landing craft from uh the ships to good troops on the shores so of course you know the the fact that the Indianapolis was involved in those conflicts grab my attention I'm imagining him being there and some of the scenes that you describe\nI'm Lynn what do we start with you describe in a sort of the ... the ... version of what the world knows about uh the USS Indianapolis and then we'll go to Sarah to ah give us the version that did you guys would help uncover\nOkay that would be great um Indianapolis as Sarah mentioned ... was the fifth the Fifth Fleet flagship and I'm\nA small park that a lot of people don't know is that she was the flagship at the battle if that's an hour where your father drove the landing craft and I'm\nIn the weeks leading up to the the actual invasion she was protesting sitting in the shore of environment and during that time and march thirty first Nineteen forty five she was hit by a kamikaze\nNine men were killed twenty six injured and that was what really sent for on the state full journey had that not happened she might have gone down in history as the victorious flagship of the world war two specific theater I'm Victoria said okay now as well as nine other major battle\nAnd what we tried to do with you even who recognize it even though men were at any time that they were all acting out of your content and doing what\nI'll tell you what we I'm Sorry to interrupt we have to take a break into a will come back and you can talk a little bit more about ...

somebody\n\n\n\n\n\nSo Lynn Vincent I interrupted you before the break we you're about to tell me about the uh Japanese commander a little bit\nYet a commander ... lieutenant commander ... as I was saying we tried to present the Japanese point of view\nIn a sympathetic way I'm meaning that they were acting out of there since their conscience and conviction and so um we were able to make great use the ... um\nWell it was it and then more sports that he had left after the war who first published in Nineteen fifty two and Japanese language\nAnd it was later published by Henry Holt in the fifties or here in America in English\nAnd it was really an examination of Japanese submarine warfare in World War two that written from commander had him at his point of view and there was a chapter on his devoted in Indianapolis\nBut because we were looking at the larger Pacific War in the end of the of World War two in general we were able to really develop his personality alive he was a commander who cared for his men\nHe was the commander who was very very frustrated with the state of technology on death and submarines and really against protocol at the time because Japanese had a very autocratic top down military\nUm he went around banging on doors asking for radar and more technology for his that marine because that means that Marines didn't have radar right up until the end of the war and so he was very frustrated because he was saying a lot of his rather than commanders\nAbout Fifteen men on a floater net and those are the kinds of nets that had the cork pieces throughout the net to keep it afloat and then we're spread out on this and just this huge frenzy of sharks attacked\nAnd there was nothing left and so reports like this were coming in that you know and even all the way until rescue I mean part of the rescuers that counts because by the time that the rescue arrived the men were really incoherent they were able to tell or know what was happening\nBy that point in the story but you know the rescuers are reporting that they're fighting off sharks are literally punching sharks in the face to be able to pull men bored\nThe shark ... attacks increased as the I guess you know I don't know how much sharks ... things but they said it seemed as they were pulling the men from the water the shirts um the attacks increased and you know this is\nI Can't imagine how horrifying that would be I think saying one shark would give me a heart attack and imagine hundreds of them you know one of the sailors reported they were so sick they could walk on their back you know from sharp to shark that we're underneath them just swimming there they\nCould stand on them there's one account you have the sailor who you sort of go becoming delirious and he's looking things drugs thinking oh there's food I'll just reached out and grabs a boot right\nMhm [noise] yeah I'm young intern by the name of John ... and he actually took his socks off and thinking he was going to wiggling toes as bait to lower the sharks in and catch one [laughter] and then you know he kind of came to a sense is that the last minute and realize oh this is probably not a good idea but you know he was\nNearly out of his head at this point and put a sock back on quickly and managed to stay safe you know so they\nWere doing the worst thing [laughter]\nSo some of the worst effects Lynn are uh happened to those people who drink the water they just went completely crazy\nYeah that was really chilling to me because you know here you know if you can imagine they're they're on their ship ah the everyone knows it's almost the end of the war they were having this leisurely a sale they think across the Philippines see\n'em and then you know the next thing they know they're trying to survive this horrible ordeal these these young sailors who were just playing pranks on each other the day before and then by the second day forty eight hours then now we were talking about the hoarding of water but it's Sara mentioned there were only a\nSixteen rats between there were there were four groups within three groups that there were four groups of four rap\nOr three groups of four rats in any case\nThere were four groups of four raft but then the one group split apart on the second day okay that's\nRight so so there were so any water that was available with only available on the raft and so there were only about forty men among all these hundreds and hundreds of men who had any water at all and so by you know second day in in the third day and\nThey were starting to get very desperate from dehydration and so\nThere were some men who absolutely knew not\nTo drink the salt water no matter how their God but there were others who\nAlthough they knew that the sun and the measure and the the hydration itself with perversely causing them to lose their faculties lose their ability to reason\nThat some of them to come to the idea that they could drain the salt out of the water and so you see one sailor holding up a torn piece of his shirt\nA while the other one toward the water through it into the into his mouth and thinking that that would drain the folk out well of course it didn't and then other when you know take mall heard is that the water\nI'm hoping that no one would see them and talk them out of it but then eventually they would just begin gold thing it like they were hoping it out of the mountain stream\nAnd what happens with this is a condition called hyper ... and\nBlood vessels bird\nBlood cells ... from the brain um brain short circuit just like when a tree branch falls on a high voltage line and they would just go out of their heads and um they died very horrible deaths from drinking the water\nYou know you have the the Japanese commander a who decides oh let's get outta here because he figures there's no way the ship is here by itself something else has to be around you that or it without a site all of a sudden and he thinks oh it must have gone away or\nYou couldn't imagine I guess it immediately that it'd sunk quickly so he leaves I'm which is I guess fortunate because they could have surfaced and finished them off\nYou have a somewhere I was a pilot who winds up testifying at the court marshal later\nA un American pilot who saw what he thought was a battle he ended up telling somebody about it but no one paid attention are we going to go to a break in about a minute maybe a ... Sarah you want to talk about that guy\nYeah there was a gentleman by the name of Richard With Francis and he was an army pilot he was transporting a general who would have been wounded and you know that the generals up in the cockpit with him and it's a late night patrol you know it's just after midnight and\nThey the the you know kind of explosion coming from below and there's no report coming in saying that there is any kind of enemy action so he thinks well maybe this is true or something of that nature but yeah I guess it seemed kind of out of sorts for him so he said well you know report it\nAnd he did actually try to report it a couple of times and yeah the army side of things that will let the navy do whatever they're doing just ignore it\nAnd he's still want to hear a navy personnel at Guam I Believe\nYou know hey I saw this should anyone look into it and they said no there's nothing reported in that area don't worry about it\nAnd so you know\nThere's actually more to the story with that where you know they\nHis son who you know this gentleman Richard ... to have passed away but his son carries on a story and you know there he actually had diary entries of the time and coordinate the when his father and it did line up with it but he didn't find out and tell a few days after\nWhen were released about it that he would\nWe're talking with Linda incidents are a lot about Indianapolis the true story of the worst disaster in us naval history in a moment we'll talk about sort of the aftermath it's amazing that anyone survive but so there were survivors and uh what came next is equally amazing we'll be right back\nFind out more about tonight just going to go to ... stadium dot com\nRound on why\nSeventy five Paul Simon issues for solo album still crazy after all these years gone at last\nFifty ways to leave your lover and the title track all reached the U.

things worse is if things just sort of dropped through the cracks that made their survival you've been more improbable\nWell at their mentioned there with the um\nDeparture methods that didn't go through from ... to the Philippines there with the tenant Philippine I who had read the the thing that\nA ... a combatant ships arrived there didn't need to be a report made well\nHe wasn't the brightest guy in the world\nAnd that as a matter of fact hadn't received to report thing as match that he thought well\nIf I don't have to report a rival that shit I guess that means I don't have to report NATO rattles either and then you know to be fair to the navy the entire focus was on the pending invasion of the Japanese island\nSo all of these things along with the lack of a stretch signal combine to make it in Indianapolis but crack\nAnd it wasn't until a PD one inch or a bomber piloted by lieutenant check when um it happened to be flying over the area that the survivor's on it in the water\nThere was a very poignant story you tell in the book Sarah ah about these pilots that they dropped all the supplies and trying to ...\nYou have these uh guys in the water or something you hang onto their they can't do any more there are other supplies they have to hit back and there was one guy who's swimming way up in the middle all by himself just swimming is if I don't know where he was swimming do or what he was doing but there was nothing they could do for them\nI mean I imagine that being\nSo terrible to witness you know your did everything you could you find out there's no there's nothing left in your plane to help this loan swimmer\nAnd you know and then I Believe when they got to land they actually found one more life jacket or something they could have thrown and you know speaking to any of these men reading\nTheir testimonies later on it affected them the rest of their lives they were devastated about not being able to do more and that was really the sentiment and most of the rescuers you know they were out there feeling like they were playing God you know are these men alive or they\nYou know who do we take it for you know our ship or else the VP is the landing craft is full what do we do if we can't say one more man and he's still alive and you know that was a burden they carry till the end of their lives\nYou know it's war time is when the focus is on you know Japan and ending the war and a lot of big stuff going on all things did fall through the cracks but uh [noise] is it an accident that the story was all out of the newspapers do BJ day well reporters\nAre reporting on at the at reporting on the incident at the times did not believe it was an accident so the rescue occurred beginning on August second uh Nineteen forty five and the war ended on August\nFourteenth that between the time zones fourteenth and fifteenth Nineteen forty five\nAnd they did not announce that Indianapolis had been sunk the newspapers did not release it Washington not didn't Washington did not release it\nUntil v J day until they announced that Japan had surrendered and that the war was over so if you can imagine huge banner headlines on August fifteenth Nineteen forty five and Seventy two point headlines you know Japan quit the war is over\nAnd then maybe below the fold in a very small articles USS Indianapolis cruiser sunk\nAnd reporters that time believed that Washington and the navy specifically did that to divert attention away from this disaster that was you know resulted in the last of almost nine hundred men\nOn the very brink of the end of the war\nSooner or talk to me about like captain McVeigh and what's going through his head and saying was the court marshal inevitable let him slide given that the war did or did they have to pursue this\nWill really there was an enormous pressure from the eight hundred and Seventy nine families\nWho lost loved ones on the ship to have answers to have someone to point a finger at and so you know this is a tremendous loss for the navy and you know so many people and it was a very public you know [noise]\nLike Clinton said this was announced when the victory of Japan over Japan was announced to the world and people are out celebrating this in the streets but there are families now grieving that their son or their brother uncle is not coming home and people wanted answers and so\nYou know it wasn't obvious that a court martial would be taking place I think on the onset\nBut as the investigation started you know revealing things and who is involved and who knew what was happening and what did happen prior to the sinking and how it could have prevented and maybe not the sinking prevented but certainly the fact that no one new thing\nAnd that they were left out there to die you know\nSomeone needed to be to blame\nAnd a lot of people got blamed right\nThere were there were a lot of people who were brought in for questioning there was a quarter of inquiry that was done and you know it's revealing that\nThese are pretty important people that had information that could have prevented the situation\nAnd so really you know\nAt the time these names the you know admiral king and ruin the limits and all these these men who were essentially the rock stars of that area you know we won the war and\nYou know the the American public you know holds these men on this high platform and we can and they are the same time are we supposed to bring them into a courtroom and have them testify in tarnish their name like I don't think that the navy wanted to take that route and essentially you know the captain is responsible for the vessel so the moment that he was\nBrought to cart court marshal there was nothing to do but find him guilty even though it wasn't just\nA little is to talk about the court marshal or or mentioned earlier uh the unusual step of bringing the the Japanese commanders to testify that had never happened before and then uh I guess the main thrust of the argument against the captain that he failed to zigzag than the exact thing could have prevented the Japanese from sinking ship\nThat was one of the two churches um and not only was it unprecedented to bring in command her how she invited to testify but it was unprecedented that a captain with the court martialed at all\nFor having his shit sunk in World War two there were hundreds of vessels son captain Charles McVeigh was the only captain who was ever court martialed\n[noise] excuse me and I'm\nSo glad he did have to charges against him one was and by the way the navy we we found in a records because we went to the national archives we went to the library of Congress Naval War college and so forth and we found these records where\nThe navy was actually casting about to find that charge that they thought would stick\n'em and as Sarah mentioned there were all these leading lights of the Pacific war who were involved in this you know the the commander of the civic forces the commander at Guam and these were men who had really been the architects of this new global sea power\nAnd admiral Ernest King who was the fleet admiral our theory is that he didn't want to see all these leading lights dragged into open court and so that's why they were casting about for something that would stick with McVeigh and so what they charged him with was\nFailure to call a band and shit in a timely manner which was quickly disproven because there were a lot of witnesses who um heard him call abandoned ship and then heard it passed man demand the second ship as you are the second charge rather as you mentioned was failure to think that\n... was an anti submarine warfare tactic worship which they're back and forth across space course\nHoping to throw off the aim of the Japanese said commander\nAnd indeed had to make they did see stick as these ... evening twilight or just before the ship was sunk\nBut the standing orders that the military put that in his purview that was at his discretion and he chose to exercise that discretion um and then when commander ... testified at the trial he said\nThat he would have stuck to the day whether he had been ... or not and then it didn't make a difference but he was testifying and Japanese through translator and the translator did not\nTranslate exactly what he said uh correctly and commander ... could understand enough English to know that but not enough to really repair the damage and also he was you know\nIn this very intimidating environment and so I don't think it was really can conducive for him to sit there and argue either but I'm In\nHay fell a sports fans that Danny west that I'm here to take you on a journey back to this week in sports history are back in Nineteen sixty four for the

news I think it was last year that the ah Indianapolis had been found a there's a mission funded by Paul Allen\nActually it was about four in the morning when I received a phone call from bill Tony who was the gentleman I mentioned earlier the some commander of Indianapolis and you know bill was contacted by the navy and he called me and since there they found the ship\nI didn't know what he was talking about it for the way of [noise] and so you know dating my faculty and you realize what was going on very quickly and was astonished I mean this was something that several people before the petrol group which has the vessel that\nYeah even uh even the cap and didn't know what it was that this with\nThe most closely guarded secret as the entire war and the most highly classified naval mission of the war\nAnd so even a even as I said even the captain didn't know what it was only major from and what it was and his uh his companion happening fame now when it was along to monitor the radiation so\nThere was a little chance that a Japan would've known and I don't know that extra precaution with taken\nBecause ship with traveling so fast almost at thirty not that they cut it out ran

that no distress signal got off the ship so they were saying that that was happening they followed that with the ship fault for getting hit by torpedoes and having her power you know flown out\nI'm

missing for one one series of books\nAnd a documentary film by that title in fact ... was here last month to talk about the latest in that series broaden his uh his Web is net and his uh focus again\nOn the popularity of those books has overshadowed his original project but one that got him on the path of pursuing missing persons cases\nTen years ago next month they made his first appearance on this program with me to talk about the ... project\nA groundbreaking investigation into the big mystery in which Dave applied many of the techniques and strategies you learned as a police officer\nWho the sasquatch legend immersed himself in it lived among the group of people of northern California unemployed the talents of a forensic sketch artist to get accurate portrayals of what people have been seeing for very long time\nWell you may have been focusing on missing for one one the last few years but never lost interest in big foot so eerie is with a new work gets an archive of big foot and wild man stories and news reports dating all the way back to the year's sixteen eighty\nAnd well I think David is probably not likely to take a position on what the answer to the mystery might be he has pulled together a pretty amazing collection of reports from eyewitnesses newspapers journalists hunters and others who've seen these creatures up close and personal ... welcome back\nHey George thanks again for having me a\nAbsolutely no good\nTimes on the show and I appreciate it\nSo returning to work on big what does this feel like you're dating your ex\n[laughter] [noise] it's a it's kind of odd like you said it's it's always been doing in the background and it's something that's always had my interest I think it's an elusive topic that uh there's a lot of conjecture out there but not a lot of facts\nYou'd never stopped working on it did you I mean you're focused may have been elsewhere but it's always been sort of a you kept an eye out for articles and information\nYou know I Can't say that I've committed much energy to it in the last say seven eight years focused on missing people but\nWhen you're going through the archives and you're trying to pull out articles about missing people I'm always reading about all kinds of things that I see on the first pages of new news articles and such and\nI started to come across these ah these stories about\nUm something that looked like ... when you read the articles but when you read the title of it like Ninety percent of the time it will say wild man and I hadn't done a lot of archived work on the topic before but\nYou know eight years of digging through these archives for missing people articles I just started to pull them and put them in a folder and over the years that got large\nAnd eventually I said you know this is pretty intriguing I I think even if you're an optimist or a pessimist on the topic it's it's convincing that something over the years has been around us\nAnd it's been documented and and it shows the historical aspect that most people don't understand\nUm ... we're going to get into the specifics articles about big foot Wildman and giants and sometimes they're the same and sometimes they're different but I wanted to just for those who were not listening ten years ago when you were first year you recap the ... project how you got started on that what you learned\nAnd how it kind of got its hooks into you are all these years later\nSo I I never had a dog in the fight or I was working for a technology company I was getting ready to retire and raise a couple of kids and\nTo the guys I was working with that were super wealthy came to me and they sent me in this room and they told the story that independently without knowing each other when they were kids they had a big for the encounter in the mountains to the earth\nAnd they found each other later in business and you know we're sort of fed acquaintance I started talking about Bigfoot and they found each other and and were shocked\nThat they each had a similar and counter and they said you know if you have Twenty years of police officer you have years of investigating an HR you're the guy really to give it that independent look will finance it you go about it at your own pace you know your kids to raise that\nHelp us out with this we really we really want to find out and initially I said no and they kept coming back coming back and they said at your own pace you can do it\nSo I Wonder about looking for an area that had a few things first of all I wanted Internet I needed a hotel and I knew that there was Native American history with the topic that ran deep and I needed it within say six to eight hour driving location from where I Lived at the time in Los Gatos California\nAnd I coordinate down in the area to ... which is about thirty miles south of bluff creek where the Paterson given one film was made sixty seven\nSo I started to do some geographical research on top of graphical some weather\nAnd I started to bring this together and then I went up there and make contact with the hoop of police that a police background I approach them and I said hey maybe you could break down some doors for me I'm not going to I'm not going to stretch the truth I'm going to tell the truth\nAnd every witness to come forward they're going to have to write an affidavit to what they saw under penalty of perjury\nAnd I wanted to raise the bar on the topic a little bit so that that would be no question about what was stated because they sign it and there'd be no question about it for the story was fabricated because it was done under perjury\nMany of The Elders and this was so helpful and breaking down the doors these guys with introduced me and they'd say hey you can trust this guy ah he's a friend he's credible\nWith a scientist who reads that science behind the paper they know that\nThose hundred and ten samples so tell a story for normal\nWhen we come back we're

I don't know anybody that's claimed to have studied them in the wild walking into the wilderness and found a spot and studied them year after year so they have intelligence that's quite a bit different than the average animal quote unquote that you see in the woods\nAnd even the animals on the eighth gorilla et cetera side of the equation totally different they they act different they walk different they look different\nAnd one thing that everyone has to think about it never in North America have there been any wild ape gorilla bones found ever\nBut we have how I'd while or giant human bones found\nAnd that's that you really make you think\nYou know some of the descriptions in the articles uh\nAre made me chuckle a little bit because the writers who have no ... but the topic of course because it's new to them they're they're explaining it must have been old Fred so and so who disappeared into the forest a couple of years ago and now he's grown hair all over his body\nThat I [laughter] I traveled with you on those and I think people are scratching to bring in some rationality to an irrational observation\nUm and and the parts of the country where these things are seen you know get way way below zero it snows how's Fred that decided to leave his farm going to live and that type of environment\nAnd and grow hair all over his body like that a snake long hair you mentioned in the in the clip that I was reading there from a middle aged Seventeen hundreds you had a notation at the bottom\nThat said maybe this is what Daniel Boone so uh I didn't see the Daniel Boone any Daniel Boone story in here other than that reference that you've made but he had an encounter is a fairly famous encounter right\nThat's correct and uh I I couldn't find an archive news article about it but I saw other secondary in third level things that were written about what Daniel called I I think it was a Yahoo\nYeah and the description was pretty close and I don't know it's it sure seemed possible but again if you went into the quote unquote credible archives you're really not going to find that you have to do really deep and and find out what\nMaybe some explorers wrote about that they heard in which he encountered so but again in tribal Bigfoot I've written about things where and explore from the latter day church\nWas coming across country on a horse and he wrote in his explored notes\nThat this thing came up to them while he's on his horse and looked him I'd I actually spoke to him large hairy by Ted he'd never seen before that matched the description of a wild man or a big foot and it came from the archives with the latter day church latter day saint church and it's in there so\nSay that these things haven't happened ...\nUh the first entry the oldest entry comes to us from Jacques ballet you wrote about it and have a clip from\nSeptember Seventy sixteen eighty it was a reported in his book wonder in the sky a large black white mass landed in a field releasing a huge error covered being that we're seeing briefly and disappear now that's the kind of thing that will drive\nA big what people who think it's an ape just crazy\nYou know I I'm not sure how many people listening actually bought a book on about this but when I was going through it\nI I like to think I'm a mile wide and an inch deep I like to read about different things that go shit topics I'm doing research on and what I read this all over for a while I don't think anybody's ever heard of it\nAnd a book which was a Kickstarter project right um which kind of did the same thing with you a topic that I did on this topic\nStarter I again I don't think a lot of people want to hear that\nYeah I I uh I was part of that project and um and supported it and uh it's a tremendous book

it\nIn in the field and you look at these drawings by Harvey Pratt these look like human\nFaces these are individual basis that he's drawn a\nDrawings based on witness descriptions are\nThey looked like a people are just big hairy people but people\nNo I I think that the general consensus that a\nThird of matches what other tribes dated all across the U.S and uh\nYou try to find a group of people that have been here hundreds and hundreds of years and occupy the land to find a group or an animal I never could find it and you know again I have no dog in the fight I'm willing to listen to anything but that just isn't there\nYou look back at the Patterson gambling film and it's you know people can argue about it all they want as far as I'm concerned it has not been debunked but that that's being in that film looks closer to a gorilla or eight\nNot exactly a match but it's closer to it than some of the creatures at the beginning is that that that you're you have drawings up and this and the beings that are described in the\nIn in the uh the new book as well I mean I'm\nYou know they're very close to human like just much larger\nOne I did a good one film and wanting Harvey has the ability yet if let's say somebody goes in to a bank Rob the bank has a beard on as a hat on and they're caught on camera leaving\nArmy has an ability to take the here are the face I can see with the face looks like so you can identify the perfect\nSo apply that to the powder and get one film Harvey took the hair a face a ... bike it's in trouble for it and it doesn't work like a native uh\nAmerican man\nI guess the argument could be made in probably has been made there are different types there are different tribes which is why some of the descriptions are so different I mean you have\nYou know in the history of the phenomena you have reports of different colors different sizes in your ... accounts and news clippings from over the last couple of centuries there are male and clearly distinctions between male and female\nThat are seen right\nWell I I think people forget how different humans are\nAre in my presentations at conferences they sometimes will take a variety of photos of Amazon tribal members\nOf people from northern Ukraine of people from China and I put these pictures up there\nAnd it's phenomenal how different humans look if they are some type of human as I think they are then it it just follows ... with what we understand about our own people\nYeah if you were a space aliens you came here and and went back home and describe what humans looked like a ...\nYou know you might have some trouble or they can't all look like that you know from 'cause we we bury so differently in these clips you have some of them that are pretty short I ... I don't remember where it is in the in the book but there was a an incident where somebody's camp fire\nTheir camp kept being messed with while they're out in the woods somewhere\nSo they they waited in a work in the bushes to wait to see what came and did it and the as I recall the creatures that came it was one or two they were short they were like fibers five or six feet tall not to ten or twelve feet tall but covered with hair and they were just signed up playing with fire\nSo think about\nUh let's say a twelve year old kid\nWho doesn't have much association with fire not a grown adult comes into the fire is playing with it because they have this unique opportunity that's kinda what I was thinking as I read that article from California\nUh I think from the mid Eighteen hundreds and I think it was a hunter that knew something was messing around but he couldn't figure it out so he waited on originally and they came in and he saw this\nAnd the um it's not unusual that hunters and campers and other things in the woods have seen these things\nDo an unusual things other times or they're seen in a lake playing like kids in the water um it's\nAgain the behavior that you read about reminds you sometimes have children and especially when the sizes match proportionally a smaller Bigfoot you think well it must be young kid\nThe attitudes are different in different reports to a generally not hostile shy when they get away from people when they encounter him but they can be pretty nasty when provoked a there's a phenomenon it's reported in several these clubs where they throw rocks big rocks that humans disorder to chase them off\nA and there's one report I think it's I I forget where it is in the book I'll have to look for a of a big boy that's supposedly killed a hunter right that was the first one you've found\nOh it was ... and you know sometimes I question the credibility of some of these articles because who side how did they get to those conclusions um was there any evidence left behind these older articles or sometimes tough to get to the root of where they came from or how they came to those conclusions\nAnd I don't I don't put a lot of emphasis on that but\nIn the near term I've never found a big foot nowadays that's conclusively killed anybody and\nWhen I started writing the missing for one one books there's a lot of erroneous information that I have associated this topic on pick for with missing for one one I never have I've never stayed at that I thought the big for was involved in these things\nWhy because I've never read a credible article implying that they did and since the fall on on books came out all of a sudden people have started saying oh yeah you know this campsite these campers were killed this was happening and I get these once a year or say\nAnd every time I followed up I find that it's not a credible source it never happened yet the myth keep perpetuating on the Internet and they're not true and\nSome people believe all you know it's a cover up\nBut as someone who has spent an enormous amount of time in these rural areas with these rural sheriff's deputies\nOf people do not give a damn about what the federal government thinks about their behavior and trying to convince them to keep their mouth shut it's never going to happen they will tell the truth and you're the feds aren't going to be able to keep 'em clamped up\nSo when you hear these stories all these campers were killed by something really mysterious if it was happening I'd hear about it from these guys and they say half the time they say it never happened it's a completely phony story so\nI get emails I I can imagine what your emails or like but I get a ... ah just because people know that we know each other or why doesn't ... go ahead and admitted big with its kidnapping people\nAnd I I wouldn't have to say this a day there are some accounts in this book these newspaper clippings where there are references to these huge Wildman carrying all women and children you know there was never any names attached to it though you know no no and that's a that's\nThe tough part of it how can you how can you leverage it as credible if supposedly they were getting carried off who saw it and why aren't the name there and if somebody's writing about it and say it\nSeems to be a there are instances where in in these accounts where\nA humans who are not aggressive and don't take shots at these animals are not only did they described them as a I think it's it's gay they describe ... gay and I don't think it's in the context to gay as we used the term these days but gay humor is what they said\nA friendly\nAnd the number of times I have heard a hunter say there's no way I could shoot it it looked to him and\nIt ... I I have never heard of a hunter say oh yeah I had to kill this thing I shot it in the head or it it looked like an animal I've not heard that and I've heard the human side of it from a fireman\nA policeman credible credible sources that continually say the same thing and it isn't just one time in history goes way back in history or so there's something to this they got gotta skew where they said they started looking like him are apes than animals and\nAs you know Georgia's this segment of the big foot world that wants to go out and kill one and\nI don't have any idea why they think they need to kill one maybe some kind of over loaded on testosterone but they they should wake up to the reality they're never going to kill them it's not going to happen\nThere are some reports of where these people claimed to have killed one or they've captured a wild man and they brought him back somewhere on the ship or they've got him in jail and they invariably he gets away or the evidence disappears however\nMontreal Canadians set the time of his retirement she was the leading defense men and leach history was two hundred and Seventy goals [noise] this week in Nineteen sixty seven the New Jersey Americans who later became the New York and New Jersey nets played their first KBA game and jumping ahead this week in Nineteen Ninety three\nJoke Carter heads only the second baseball World Series winning home run\nAt the Toronto blue jays when game six of the world series to beat the Philadelphia Phillies games to two\nAnd I can still remember every fossil moment\nYeah I'm a Phillies fan that your heart radio weekends porridge time capsule\nYou have an old car taking up space be a hero and support our nation's veterans by donating your car to the Purple Heart foundation your car donations\nSome people still think an education from northern Virginia community colleges just settling well how about settling for the skills\nThat people still think an education from northern Virginia community colleges just\nSettling but when you think about it I\nRemember thinking mum had ice in the back of her head like or a superpower which spot in trouble before it happened well now it's on us to protect our home and family\nWhen you meet a veteran [noise] you're meeting a hero\nWhen you donate your car to the Purple Heart foundation\nAnd spotting troubles way tougher\nThat's why parents trust blink blinked video cameras are motion activated so placing them around your home is like having ice everywhere\nBlink cameras or wire free set up and minutes and run on to double A. batteries last up to two years brilliant technology\nWendy what a spot that burglar when he's case in your home or after easy in ...

two authors are Sarah ... and the claim documentary filmmaker one of the world's leading experts on the USS Indianapolis she became obsessed with the story at the age of Thirteen\nAnd over the next two decades she met and interviewed one hundred and seven of the ships survivors she produced an award winning documentary film about the disaster\nAnd a has a lot of other research still researching this story Lynn Vincent is the number one New York times best selling writer of Lebanon non fiction books with more than sixteen million copies in print\nShe's a veteran journalist and author of more than a thousand articles has done investigative pieces that have been so I did before Congress and the U.S Supreme Court I'm Sarah and Lynn welcome to the program ah I I'm blown away by your book grey tabby here\nHere\nSarah I'd like to start with you how did you get hooked on the story at age Thirteen ah most ah teenagers at Thirteen or not reading about the USS Indianapolis\nWell actually it was a documentary that I saw um I was watching it with my dad it was about the Pacific war and they reduced the story of this ship to a single line which was it was a ship that carry the bomb in stock\nAnd add to know more about it and so you know at the time there was no Google or anything like that so I actually had to go to the library [laughter] imagine that and you know\nThrough looking to what was available at the library I still really couldn't find anything so I I Hope someone's got to tell the story you know from what I did learn about it it was very interesting and I think there was a lot of mystery surrounding it and so I\nYou know I thought out what I could say that you know someone will tell the story before I'm old enough to do it and you fast forward graduated from college and said well no one told the story you know the right way\nSo I sought out the survivors and found Paul Murphy who is the chairman of the survivors organization at the time and he invited me to a reunion and that's where I actually got to meet the men\nWho survived Indianapolis and\nI mean yeah I was a kid who was a meeting her heroes for the first time and they exceeded all expectations and they took me and kind of became like family so you know they have a couple of years later after I had spent time with them and visit them at their homes\nThey asked me to be their story teller and that kind of the cliff notes version of it\nAnd Lynn for you how did you uh hook up with Sarah on working on this project you've done so many other books I I Would imagine that being able to write the true story and correct\nWide and greet misperceptions a and strike a blow for justice for the for some of the key characters would be an amazing draw for you\nWell it was a very tight and project from either way I got involved when I had actually been praying I'm I pray that my work and I had been praying to have an opportunity to work on an eye on it for over ... story\nAnd all of a sudden in two thousand eleven additive to get this email from this young filmmakers when they're flat it\nWell what they didn't say about her journey with Indianapolis with that I'm going into an apple is a storyteller she wanted to render the story as a screenplay and she actually did that she wrote an eight part series and the two major\nProduction company and they said hey this is the ... on the other\nThat we only they carry on foot\nSo you're going to be the right stuff she thing right or I don't know how to raise a family and friends the race that and they've contact with them\nAnd I'm no number one that I moved to veterans and know that I I've been praying for an opportunity to a story that's like this one um [noise] and\nMy only problem was is that all the with wanting to fight and I wanted to help rewrite the book [laughter] [noise] ...\nThat I had to figure out how to manipulate or in the way to help her a eventually over the course of several months we finally met\nAnd then a agreed to work on it together and we didn't really get started in earnest and a twenty four and um and then when we fit it OK project tickle me and a half\nSo Sarah where you are on a campaign to right or wrong that the story had been wrong that a lot of the that did people had who were key players had been treated unfairly is that how you started or you didn't know about that when you started\nI didn't you know I I knew a small part of that um that was definitely part of what I wanted to tell but really I mean the major objective was to tell the whole story of this shit you know she'd been reduced to\nThinking story or shark story and no one knew she was this incredible ship that admiral Brent commanded you know most of the Pacific war and the campaign that have participated in from her deck or that Roosevelt took her on the first cruise\nYou know us acting president ever left the country on so it was so much more like well\nYou know everyone's got to know what it incredible shift is less than what she did\nA besides being sent [noise]\nAh I tell you grab ... my father was a at open now and he ... he drove a landing craft from the ship's took good troops on to the shores so of course you know that the fact that the Indianapolis was involved in those conflicts grab my attention I'm imagining him being there and some of the scenes that you describe\nI'm Lynn why don't we start with you describe in a sort of the ... the ... version of what the world knows about the the USS Indianapolis and then we'll go to Sarah to uh give us the version that that you guys have helped uncover\nOkay that would be great um Indianapolis as Sarah mentioned ... ... ... ... ... ... and I'm\nA small park that a lot of people don't know that he was the fact is at the battle if
