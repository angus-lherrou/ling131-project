age if I were on the line mosques delete Stephen Hawking name were petrified warning us about the dangers\nOf artificial intelligence isn't that bad\nA well I I Would say that I don't think so but I Will say this what what they're worried about a was look we mentioned earlier which is that kind of artificial intelligence we don't know how to build a general intelligence and that's\nWe don't know how to build it but the idea that we could build it is based on his simple a\nSupposition and that is that people are machines if if you are a machine and your brain as a machine in your mind as a machine and it stands to reason at some point in the future we can build a mechanical you and then over time\nThat will become better and better and better it'll have an eye you have a hundred and two hundred and two thousand\nAnd two million and then it won't even know what you are um\nI find that idea that people are machines to be very pervasive in Silicon valley um my probably cost about it I I I find maybe one person in twenty that doesn't believe that and yet when we take surveys\nThat that may be more ... than they do is a lot more harm than than than good it it it's very little suggest the machine would do that now through through accidents are absolutely you\nKnow you had a you had a rocket blow up because the single one was a transposed with uh I I always transposed with a zero so a lot of our systems are quite brittle and that is very true you know if you had a um\nYou could have an airline pilot had a heart attack and that's bad for one air air airplane full of people\nThink I think when you got the co pilot right\nThere you go but if you have a um if you have a computer flying a network computer flying all the airplanes in it a quote has a heart attack like that\nYeah that may that may propagate through a systems maybe much ... much more brittle much one that had been made breaking big ways now that being said they haven't done that yet and and\nAnd we come you know we're better now I think uh at writing good software that we were a few years back\n[noise] what is fueling the gross and the ... and just really the incredible growth on this kind of technology\n... ... is it the human being\nThe main thing that fuels that technology is it's actually finally working a\nHey I even the term was coined in Nineteen fifty six by a man named McCarthy McCarthy and uh he got together with a few of the computer scientist and they said you know we work really hard we can solve artificial intelligence and one summer or they thought that very interesting reason which was\nNew and you know three laws of planetary motion the laws of magnetism laws of physics laws of electricity very few simple laws that explain everything and they hope to find that with intelligence we did\nThat being said people get excited about a a bunch of money came in everybody was disappointed funding dried up all the people you know took him out for ten years\nThen there was a breakthrough more funding everybody neither a winter it kept going well now for the first time\nIn space up to space up his face up to space up to space it's delivering the goods\nIt can it if you out of business it can make probably any department in your business than ten percent ... percent better ten percent more profitable or it can it can do all of these things he couldn't do before until we're never going to have another one of those yeah winters we now\nHave the technology that we know how to do some cool things if there were no more advances in a ah ah we probably have twenty five years worth of stuff just to apply what we know today to the world but of course we're going to have you know more dense is uh they they come to light speed almost\nJust amazing now we ever have a series of artificial intelligence soldiers by the millions sending them into warfare in battle\nIt's a fantastic question um\n\nIntelligence the simplest definition is it's a system that responds to its environment so land mine is the kind of artificial intelligence if it were a program that is if something weighs more than fifty pounds explode that's a very rudimentary\nVery rudimentary ah yeah if somebody came out with a landmine just hypothetically that said uh it has a camera and it can make sure it's somebody wearing a petite ... or\nCarrying a gun mhm and then it was up you would say well that's that's that's better isn't it and then if you say well it can also sniff for gun powder and you know we can do for other things to make sure it's blowing up the right person you say well\nBetter I guess that's better right and you you eventually get your way all the way up\nTo um if you could have ... to to an artificial intelligence that fights wars and instead of people um\nThere there is a quote debate about whether we're gonna make autonomy Skilling systems I think it's disingenuous the debate is I personally think it's disingenuous I think you've got twelve or Thirteen countries that are ... that have significant military budgets that are spending money on these systems and no one\nOf them can say you know let the other guys all habits but I'm not going to do it I just don't think that's going to happen or the south Koreans came out with the forty million dollar automatic gun turrets that\nCould could shoot people at a distance automatically and it it's required by law to say you know leave before the shoot\n'em and it now requires a person to approve it's tiring but originally uh they only put that in because people requested and show a it could easily be turned off so even if you make decisions that require people to make decisions\nYou always disabled them so I think it's inevitable that we're going to for better or worse whatever you think that we're going to build weapons\nSystems it's going to have it well for\nFor three very easy reasons you could argue that ah the the better the more effective at their mission and there'll be less collateral damage wherever they are you\nArgue that you will be saving lives are soldiers ... or ... whatever country you are and and\nA third you know they won't they won't work and be effective and probably cost effective while enabling Portugal eat alone were the political cost going to war which is there's not not necessarily a good thing\n\nWell it may not be a good thing but in the long run if we don't do it some other country will\nOh absolutely absolutely I'm just saying that it isn't necessarily good for all nations to feel like oh well it's just these weapon systems fighting each other it doesn't really matter and and you know if if there's no cost a than perhaps it's entered into more rationally\nI mean do you see the day though by

Hooper a Google Amazon you wouldn't have seen any of the million companies that were made so that these technologies are the same way you it's easy to say that jobs going to go away\nIt's hard to see the better job that's created and what happens is\nEverybody every time technology makes a great new job and destroys bad job everybody kind of ships up one level\nIf you had a robot that was a waiter and delivered food to you you get a tip that I'm not\nI don't I hear the waiter wonder why I don't I don't think a robot can do\nA what a way to do you know they use spell a drink\nYou know the robot can't a clean it up that would take you know tons of programming\nDo you have a special order and you want you want to send your flew back there's something you didn't like about it you have a question about where the radishes were I mean there are so many things it's funny we we we have every human on this planet has ten thousand skills than thousand things you can do\nAnd then we have this vision that if you can do those ten thousand things and you can do estate planning than your high skilled otherwise you're low skilled but in reality every human being is incredibly high skilled we don't have robots that can\nThey can do what a two year old can do let alone and an adult yeah so well correct correct but it's proved very difficult\nLike right now I heard somebody say if there was ever a robot uprising just wait Fifteen minutes all their batteries there'll be dead 'cause we can't even you know make batteries that the power these things for very long so right now heads down and and I think for for decades to come\nA people aren't gonna you're not going to make machines that had the same range of movement generally going to have a robot electrician who comes in and look at your house over and figure out where to punch your well out to run the wires it's just way beyond\nYou know when I called my airline of choice and it tells me you know say your number I Am happy when it gets started right when it doesn't get a an age and ate all mixed up so that's kind of wherever that um\n\nBut like you said that oh you know yet um\nAnd that's it and that's a big yet because one day at the progression we're going we're going to get there\nWell with physical robots maybe that's true it's an open question on intelligence it's an open question whether a computer can be creative with a computer\nAnd\nIt may be that that you have to experience the world in order to do a lot of the things we have and it's it's unclear that computers will be able to do it I ... let me let me say a real quick thing about our brains you know we have these brains that we don't really understand and then we had these mines are which is kind of all the things the brain does that we\nCan't really explain like I have a sense of humor you know your liver doesn't have a sense of humor but some of your brain does\nAnd then we have consciousness and people think we don't understand the brain 'cause there's just so stinking so many neurons but people who spent Twenty years working on something called the open worm project to try to take this little worm he's got three hundred and two neurons in his brain they spent Twenty years trying to model that in the computer\nJust make a worm that lives in a computer with a brain that three hundred new neurons and even among the people have been working on it they're not even sure it's possible so\nThere are so many we're we're so\nSpectacularly amazing\nAh beings that that to duplicate what we do with the machine is you know ... one leading a researcher said worrying about those kinds of things it's like worrying about overpopulation on Mars yeah maybe some day we'll have to worry about overpopulation of Mars but it's like that far out\nSo you call your book the fourth age because you believe we've had three ages we already going way back but tell me about this\nSo we learned this trick humans did which is technology which is multiplying what we are able to do and\nAnd we've used it to overcome scarcity because for all of human history there's just never been enough of the good stuff never in a food and medicine never enough of any of the good stuff but we learned this trick technology and sometimes we learned something so\nBig and knew that it just changed the productivity of humanity forever and the first of these was a hundred thousand years ago I think it was language that's this thing we do where we coordinated action\nAbout what it means is that you know twelve humans working together you know man of was a match for us anymore 'cause 'cause we could all communicate and the man it's couldn't um then the second one I think is when we got agriculture and that actually wasn't the big deal because agriculture give us the city and the density gave us a division of labor\nAnd the division of labor says you know you specialize I specialize in we're all better off because of it so agriculture indirectly gave us prosperity and that changed everything we have prosperity and then the third time things changed I think it was five thousand years ago when we got\nTwo technologies coincidentally at the same moment we got the wheel and we got writing and when those two things happened or you invented the nation state and that's why five thousand years ago you can kind of set your clock by it all over the world\nA giant civilizations emerge ... Mesopotamia missile America and just go all over the world and so I Do think\nThat um that\nArtificial intelligence and robots are another thing of that magnitude if you if you actually can take human thought and put it in the machine and human action and put it in a machine and and and multiply us both you know we're number one on this planet because we're the smartest thing on it\nImagine if you can just make us a whole lot smarter huh I don't I Can't predict what that's going to what's that's going to do but it's going to be a big one\nWell we know for example that machines called 'em robots or revolutionize the automobile industry with mass production I mean they they did things faster\nThan humans can I'm coming from St Louis I've been in in in ...

interesting topic I I just wanted to ask the your guest there or if you think that the way technologies progress thing that we may get to that you are to be an age where we only have to work just to better ourselves as human beings 'cause working alongside with technology\nI Love that question you know you don't Maynard Keynes the economist in Nineteen thirty wrote an essay and he said in a hundred years so basically our time GDP will be up eight fold and real dollars and people will only work Fifteen hours and so you have to ask like\nWell what happened because GDP did kill off a poll just like you thought so why are we still working all these hours and what it turns out is that if you want to live the way somebody lived in Nineteen thirty\nBel Air conditioning six hundred square feet no medical insurance no higher education vacation grow your own food make your own clothes you can work Fifteen hours a week and live like you did in Nineteen thirty\nAre the people decided they

flying cars that the neighbor has a so\nWe're not completely materialistic interestingly the the time we save at home but not hauling water up from the well and not run washing her clothes at the river we turn that into hobbies but\nIt turns out we've always worked forty hours a week if if if I productivity goes off we just work more to get more and we always pocket the time we save at home I'm with labor saving devices\nWhere do you see this fifty years from now this technology\nUm\nI I think that question I asked earlier which is you know if you can imagine a machine doing a job I think we will have machines doing the kinds of jobs you can imagine a machine doing you just start looking around you and say you know who to machine a\nFix my road probably could've machine teach kindergarten probably not a ... would we want it to until I think machines will be doing almost anything that you can imagine a machine doing that doesn't require unique human ability\nBarber in Los

bombs uh I mean the nature of warfare is rebuilding machines that they kill a so I didn't mean to say\nThat uh that we that we don't do that\nWe've always done that we built machines that that we push a button and we don't know who's going to die or the debate that is allegedly going on is whether are we going to\nMake more advanced systems that operate completely economists say that you can just release in an area and it will go and decide that's a non combative that's about it I'll kill them and so forth a it's a subtle distinctions that part I agree with you\nBefore the smart robots conscious computers in the future of humanity where do you get the book Byron\nWherever find books are sold I think is the expression Amazon dot com Barnes and noble or is it by ... dot com and there'll be a lot of like\nSo what do you see is the most dramatic change coming for us through artificial intelligence what's gonna how jump to a very\nSimple things one uh\nIndividual worldwide average income\nPer capita for the last two thousand years or if you look at it for Seventeen hundred and fifty years from say the birth of Christ Seventy fifty nothing happened what if you looked

up\nYou know you're the you're the nerd you wouldn't make that stuff and you know um I Would say Ninety nine point nine percent of the people have kind of gone with me on the journey\nUm I I think that's a very small you know point zero one percent um you know they they just\nThey can't make their way over right to our mind that's right\nUm but I'll tell you at least half if not more than half the people that when I started telling them one of my stories\nThey could to interrupt me fast enough to tell me there's [noise]\nAnd I realized you know during this time that I was kind of thinking about you know put it writing it all down like oh my gosh people don't want to come out about this like there in the closet they're afraid to tell these stories because they're afraid that they're going to sound like they're crazy\nWhich is one of the reasons I actually wanted to write the book was so you know people could feel liberated to just to tell their do you have talked about their experiences 'cause there's so many people have had him\nAnd I also wanted them to you know I wanted to write it so people also will believe in themselves and believe that has actually happened and not you know their their brain playing tricks on them or something\nWell what's so amazing to is that people are all into the sunlight you should not a lot of ... minutes well once they feel comfortable with you or somebody who is going through the same thing they open up\nOh my gosh they talk to your ear off and you know just just for your listeners then because I Am a nerd do you mind if I roll

about goes photography a little bit about medium shift just you know some of those things a little bit about but I started um I started researching and there is a Harris Poll um that says that between forty and forty five percent of Americans believe and goes\nSo we're almost\nThe majority were barely a minority and that's grown up\nAnd and you know what I think it was done maybe three years ago four years ago something like that\nWould be over fifty percent\nI I Would think so and the second is that um I worked with my friends I'm at Google um to get this and\nEvery two seconds to say it again for everybody every two seconds someone in North America is Googling the word ghost\nCosting yes every two seconds so none of us are alone I think everybody knows they're not alone because of you whose whose listening\nUm but they can also now use them statistics to tell their friends hey either way I'm barely a minority and I'm probably a majority now\nYou have nothing to hide\nAnd you

it scared the heck out of me um I actually want to I'd open a like a ghost portal\nBecause you know I Do live in the world of movies so everything in my life I think about it tends to get exaggerated

a Hollywood executives true story of discovering the real world would make believe it's coming true isn't it\n[noise] it it it it definitely is coming true it it it was funny I um when I was sitting with my publisher she was asking me about some of my photographs and I said you know some of the creatures and then that I that I get and these photographs looked like they ... out of movies that I've marketed\nThere was a it was a man who was a experience they probably actually spoke to the ... man 'cause ... man like\nDoesn't really have facial features he where it's like a foot door and sometimes a coat but what people get the feeling they have is just out of fear right because they'll see this kind of shadowy figure while they are their bodies paralyzed but they're awake and\n\nAnd one man asked you know who are you and he said they called me scratch and scratches another name for the devil\nBack in the day when he tried to Adam and Eve away from God to really\nGet scratched out of the book of life\nAnd so clearly he's not a nice guy right so my theory and it's just a theory it's all it's just a theory is that you know if you subscribe to the idea that we're spirit having a human experience\nThat when we sleep it's our physical body that needs to sleep not our spirit spirit goes off and parties in the actual space I'm sure many people have talked to about this for planes and\nYou know when our spirit is getting ready to land back into our body I think what happens is that it doesn't fully land\nAnd there's like this little space and I think that that's a little space before it lands properly and you are a line on is when this can happen again it's just a theory\nWe're pretty sure it's not terrible so I really consider it more of a spiritual condition than I Do a medical condition and it's not that people who have at our bad because you know what\nThe light doesn't need more light or the dark doesn't need more dark but dark needs a lot you know the the the darkness one flight so I think it's you know people are are these bright lights that I think that this entity kind of makes its way and and I don't really want to spoil for folks 'cause I I I Hope people will read the book\nI'm a I've what happened that last time that alec saw the ... man because of that is probably the most profound event that has happened in my entire life\nWould you want to

yeah so I I so how how about you just tell everybody instead of just the thing\nAbout them having to read the book to find out because what happened was that Alex called in one night and said\nI saw the ... man again and and he spoke to me\nAnd what he said to me was how her my name is Ron and I went he he said what he said how her by name as wrong as I notice that the message for you and I said yeah that's the name of my step dad who was not\nVery nice and I said I'm he's trying to scare me away from you\n\nYou see that was him\nI don't think it was my extent that but I think it was the ... man who knows I Would say a lot about a lot of people fair to say um but I think that you know\nIf anybody tries to if if there's any darkness that is trying to scare you they're going to find that thing that triggers you right there and find that deep dark thing they're going to find who was\nThe antagonist and this person's life and mine is my accept that and and he brought that up and Alex didn't didn't even know about my accept it didn't even know his name\nWhen all this was happening [laughter] we went weird yeah I mean\nAre you under control which now I mean do you do you lose your

exactly where\nIt was almost to the court I mean you could you yeah I mean that's how we measure we measure Les Miserables with that and then we always try to show you how deep it is\nAnd I think when you do something like that it's a little more scientific than just having a cat that something that you think the big footprint but when you start looking at it in the scientific method it just doesn't pan out because it's probably put some of the slips and then as Longate it and that's why it's only a quarter of an inch deep in soccer\nThree talented people put on the fringe investigations

across we'll take your phone calls next hour as we talk about the high technology artificial intelligence Byron Reese with us his book the fourth age if I were on the line mosques delete Stephen Hawking they were petrified warning us about the dangers\nOf artificial intelligence isn't that bad\nA well I I Would say that I don't think so but I Will say this what what they're worried about a was look we mentioned earlier which is that kind of artificial intelligence we don't know how to build a general intelligence and that's\nWe don't know how to build it but the idea that we could build it is based on the simple a\nSupposition and that is that people are machines if if you are a machine and your brain as a machine in your mind as a machine and it stands to reason at some point in the future we can build a mechanical you and then over time\nThat will become better and better and better it'll have an eye view of a hundred and two hundred and two thousand and two million and then it won't even know what you are um\nI find that idea that people are machines to be very pervasive in Silicon valley I'm On my part cost about it I I I find that the one person in twenty that doesn't believe that and yet when we take surveys\nThat that may be more ... than they do is a lot more harm than than than good it it it's very little suggest the machine which did not know\nThrough through accidents are absolutely you know you had a had a rocket blow up because the single one was a transposed with the ... and opens transposed with a zero so a lot of our systems are quite brittle and that is very true you know if you had a um\nYou could have an airline pilot had a heart attack and that's bad for one air air airplane full of people\nThink thank God you got the co pilot right\nThere you go but if you have a um if you have a computer flying a network computer fly all the airplanes in it a quote has a heart attack like that\nYeah that may that may propagate through a systems maybe much ... much more brittle much one better they may break in big ways now that being said they haven't done that yet and and and\nWe come you know we're better now I think uh at writing good software that we were a few years back\n[noise] what is fueling the roads in the ... and just really the incredible growth of this kind of technology\n... ... is it the human being\nThe main thing that fuels that technology is it's actually finally working a\nHey I even the term was calling to Nineteen fifty six by a man named McCarthy McCarthy and uh he got together with a few of the computer scientist and they said you know we work really hard we can solve artificial intelligence and one summer or they thought that was very interesting reason which was\nNewt and you know three laws of planetary motion laws magnetism laws of physics laws of electricity very few simple laws that explain everything and they hope to find that with intelligence we did\nThat being said people get excited about a a bunch of money came in everybody was disappointed funding dried up all the people you know took him out for ten years\nThen there was a breakthrough more funding everybody that winter it kept going well now for the first time\nIn space up his face up to space up his face up to space it's delivering the goods it can if if you out of business it can make probably any department in your business\nThan ten percent ... percent better ten percent more profitable or it can it can do all of these things you couldn't do before and so we're never going to have another one of those yeah winters we now\nHave the technology that we know how to do some cool things if there were no more advanced ... and I ah we probably had twenty five years worth of stuff just to apply what we know today to the world but of course we're going to have you know more dense has a ... they come at lights\nYou'd almost just to Beijing now will we ever have a series of artificial intelligence soldiers by the millions sending them into warfare in battle\nIt's a fantastic question um\nArtificial intelligence the simplest definition is it's a system that response to its environment so land mine is the kind of artificial intelligence if it weren't a program that is something weighs more than fifty pounds explode that's a very rudimentary\nVery rudimentary uh yeah if somebody came up with a landmine just hypothetically that said uh it was a camera and it can make sure\nSomebody wearing a petite ... or carrying a gun mhm and then it was up you would say well that that's\nThat's better isn't it and then if you say well it can also step for gun powder and\nYou know we can do for other things to make sure it's blowing up the right person you say well that's better I guess it's better right and you you eventually get your way all the way up to um if you could ... to to an artificial intelligence\nThat fights wars and instead of people um\nThere there is a quote debate about whether we're going to make a ton of Skilling systems I think it's disingenuous the debate is I personally think it's disingenuous I think you've got twelve or Thirteen countries that are ... that have significant military budgets that are spending money on these systems and no one of them can say\nYou know I let the other guys all have it but I'm not going to do it I just don't think that's going to happen or the south Koreans came out with the forty million dollar automatic Gunter it that\nCould could shoot people at a distance automatically and it it's required by law to say you know leave before the shoot 'em\nAnd it now requires a person to approve it's tiring but originally I didn't uh they only put that in because people requested it and show\nOr it could easily be turned off so even if you make decisions that require people to make killed decisions you always disabled them so I think it's inevitable that we're going to for better or worse whatever you think there were going to build a a weapon systems it's good to have it well for for three very easy reasons\nYou could argue that ah the the better they're more effective it their mission\nAnd there'll be less collateral damage wherever they are you then argue that you will be saving lives of soldiers ... or ... whatever country you are and and\nA third you know they won't they won't work and be effective and probably cost effective will enable unfortunately what were the political cost going to war which uh is is not not necessarily a good thing\nWell it may not be a good thing but in the long run if we don't do it some other country will\nOh absolutely absolutely I'm just saying that it isn't necessarily good for all nations to feel like oh well it's just these weapons systems fighting each other it doesn't really matter and and you know if if one has no cost a then perhaps it's entered into more rationally\nI mean I Do you see the day though by run that were coming up to the top of the hour ... finishes up when we come back next hour but\nYou know we've got drones delivering packages were talking about artificial like cars with driverless cars\nDo you see the day that the\nYou know all the entire

Hooper a Google Amazon you wouldn't have seen any of the million companies that were made so that these technologies are the same way you it's easy to say that jobs going to go away\nIt's hard to see the better job that's created\nAnd what happens is\nEvery body Everytime technology makes a great new job and destroys bad job everybody kind of ships up one level\nIf you had a robot that was a waiter and delivered food to you you get a tip that I'm not\nI don't I hear the waiter when a lot I don't\nI don't think a robot can do a what a waiter can do you know they use spell a drink\nYou know the robot can't a clean it up that would take you know tons of programming\nYou have a special order and you want you want to send your flew back there is something you didn't like about it you have a question about where the radishes were I mean there are so many\nThings it's it's funny we we we have every human on this planet has ten thousand skills than thousand things you can do\nAnd then we have this vision that if you can do those ten thousand things and you can do estate planning than your high skilled otherwise you're low skilled but in reality every human being is incredibly high skilled\nWe don't have robots that can they can do what a two year old can do let alone in an adult yeah so well\nCorrect correct but it's proved very difficult like right now I heard somebody say if there was ever a robot uprising just wait Fifteen minutes all their batteries there'll be dead 'cause we can't even you know make batteries that the power these things for very long so right now hands down and and I think for for decades to come\nA people aren't going to you're not going to make machines that had the same range of movements you're going to have a robot electrician who comes in and look at your house over and figure out where to punch your well out to run the wires it's just way beyond\nYou know when I called my airline of choice and it tells me you know say your number I'm happy when it gets that right when it doesn't get a an age and ate all mixed up so that's kinda wherever that um\nBut like you said that oh you know yet I'm\nIn that today and that's a big yet because one day at the progression we're going we're going to get there\nWell with physical robots maybe that's true it's an open question on intelligence it's an open question whether a computer can be creative with a computer can\nIt may be that that you have to experience the world in order to do a lot of the things we have and it's it's unclear that computers will be able to do it I ... let me let me say a real quick thing about our brains you know we have these brains that we don't really understand and then we had these by ... which is kind of all the things the brain does that we\nCan't really explain like I have a sense of humor you know your liver doesn't have a sense of humor but somebody your brain does\nAnd then we have consciousness and people think we don't understand the brain 'cause it's just so stinking so many neurons but people who spent Twenty years working on something called the open worm project to try to take this little worm you got three hundred and two neurons in his brain basement Twenty years trying to model out of the computer\nJust pick a worm that lives in a computer with a brain of three hundred two neurons and even among the people have been working on it they're not even sure it's possible so\nThere are so many we we are so spectacularly\nAmazing uh beings that that\nTo duplicate what we do with the machine is you know ... one leading a researcher said worrying about those kinds of things it's like worrying about overpopulation on Mars yeah maybe some day we'll have to worry about overpopulation of bars but it's like that far out\nSo you call your book the fourth age because you believe we've had three ages week already going way back but tell me about this\nSo we learned this trick humans did which is technology which is multiplying what we were able to do\nAnd and we've used it\nTo overcome scarcity because for all of human history there's just never been enough of the good stuff never in a food and medicine never enough of any of the good stuff but we learned this trick technology and sometimes we learned something so\nBig it knew that it just changed the productivity of humanity forever and the first of these was a hundred thousand years ago I think it was language that's this thing we do where we coordinate action\nAbout what it means is that you know twelve humans working together you know man of was a match for us anymore 'cause 'cause we could all communicate and the man it's couldn't um then the second one I think is when we got agriculture and that actually wasn't the big deal because agriculture give us the city and the density gave us a division of labor\nAnd the division of labor says you know you specialize I specialize in we're all better off because of it so agriculture indirectly gave us prosperity and that changed everything we have prosperity and then the third time things changed I think was five thousand years ago when we got\nTwo technologies coincidentally at the same moment we got the wheel and we got writing and when those two things happened uh you invented the nation state and that's why five dollars and years ago you can kind of shut your clock by it

technical problem you've all these problems technology cancel why do I say that because\nThey don't have to be that there are there are lots of problems that aren't technical like there's hatred bigotry and all of that but there are certain things we just haven't figured out how old are you in disease how do you slow down aging how do you do all these things and so\nThey're suffering people around the world that just are waiting for technology to come through and and finally deliver on all the utopias people used to dream about whether it be great if and now finally we've learned

and thanks for having me on the show and say ... interesting topic I I just wanted to ask your guest there um if you think that the way technologies progress thing that we may get to that you are to be an age where we only have to work just to better ourselves as human beings as working alongside with technology\nI oh I Love that question you know you don't Maynard Keynes the economist in Nineteen thirty wrote an essay and he said in a hundred years so basically our time GDP will be up eight fold and real dollars and people will only work Fifteen hours until you have to ask like\nWell what happened because GDP did kill off a default would just like you thought so why are we still working all these hours and what it turns out is that if you want to live the way somebody lived in Nineteen thirty\nBel Air conditioning six hundred square feet no medical insurance no higher education vacation grow your own food make your own clothes you can work Fifteen hours a week and live like you did in Nineteen thirty are the people decided they wanted more and so there is no\nLimit to human wants it turns out into the future people are going to say I'm going to stay late at the fusion reactor 'cause I Want you know the the same flying cars that the neighbor has a\nSo we're not completely materialistic interestingly the the time we save at home but not holy water up from the well and not run washing her clothes at the river we turn that into hobbies but\nIt turns out we've always worked forty hours a week if if if I productivity goes up we just work more to get more and we always talk at the time we save at home I'm with labor saving devices\nWhere do you see this fifty years from now Barbara this technology\nUm I I think that question I ask earlier which is you know if you could imagine a machine doing a job I think we all have machines doing the kinds of jobs you can imagine a machine doing you just start looking around you and say you know who the machine a\nFixed by rote probably couldn't machine teach kindergarten probably not a ... or what we want it to it so I think machines will be doing almost anything that you can imagine\nA machine doing that doesn't require unique human ability\nBarber in Los Angeles ... go ahead\n... stop them from being there for more than now can pay for an income for ... ... ... ... and ...\nAnd ... it gets half an hour with enough talking about automatic guns\nWell okay I Know you're you're the guest barbed is entirely right uh we are using a ton of his\nWeapons which may kill decision of course we've done that since landmines wheat crop were dropped dumb bombs uh I mean the nature of warfare is we build machines that they kill a so I didn't mean to say that uh that we that we don't do that\nWe've always done that we build machines that that we push a button and we don't know who's going to die\nOr the debate that is allegedly going on is whether are we going to\nYou know make more advanced systems that operate completely economists say that you can just release in an area and it will go and decide that Saddam combative that's about it I'll kill them and so forth a it's a subtle distinctions but bart I agree with you\nBefore the age smart robots conscious computers in the future of humanity where do you get the book Byron\nWherever find books were sold I think is the expression Amazon dot com Barnes and noble or just visit by road rage dot com and there'll be a lot of links\nTo what do you see is the most dramatic change coming for us through artificial intelligence what's going to out\nJumped to very simple things one uh\nIndividual worldwide average income\nPer capita for the last two thousand years or if you look at it for Seventeen hundred and fifty years from say the birth of Christ Seventy fifty nothing happened what if you look starting seventeenth fifty shot up like a rocket um\nWhy because we learned how to system because the acquisition of knowledge we made the scientific method and there's no limit to where that line is going to go so vast amounts of wealth created\nA eliminating poverty and then the second thing I think will happen is all purely technical problems like disease and hunger you will live to see the end up I Know that sounds like a I'm dreaming or all kinds of people said it would be possible but um you know this country the United states already Throws Away in a food to eat all the hungry people\nIn the world no question that the world's strains to feed them or we just need to get a little better at it\nWell and I hope we do solve all these

organization is being in a very direct honest kind of\nPerson that when I started telling these stories and they couldn't help but believe even if they were kind of on the fence 'cause they're like way you would make\nThis up you know you're the you're the nerd we wouldn't be stuff and you know and I would say Ninety nine point nine percent of the people have kind of gone with me on the journey\nUm I I think that's a very small you know point zero one percent um you know they they just\nThey can't make their way over right to our nine that's right\nUm but I'll tell you at least half if not more than half the people that when I started telling them one of my stories\nThey could to interrupt me fast enough to tell me there's [noise]\nAnd I realized you know during this time that I was kind of thinking about you know put it writing it all down like oh my gosh people don't want to come out about this like there in the closet they're afraid to tell these stories because they're afraid that they're going to sound like they're crazy\nWhich is one of the reasons I actually wanted to write the book was so you know people could feel liberated to just to tell their you know talk about their experiences because so many people have had him\nAnd I also wanted them to you know I wanted to write it so people also will believe in themselves and believe that it's actually happening and not you know their their brain playing tricks on them or something\nWell what's so amazing to is that people are all into the ... like you said not a lot of um admit it but once they feel comfortable with you or somebody who is going through the same thing they open up\nOh my gosh they talk your ear off and you know just just for your listeners then because I Am a nerd do you mind if I roll through just a couple of stats for them yeah go because I you know when this started happening to me um I didn't know a lot about it you know I didn't understand\nUm a lot about what really anything about goes photography a little bit about medium ship just you know some of those things are a little bit about but I started um I started researching and there is a Harris Poll on that says that between forty and forty five percent of Americans believe and go sit we're almost the majority\nAttorney were barely a minority and that's grown I bet\nAnd and you know what I think it was done maybe three years ago four years ago something like that\nWould be over fifty percent\nI I Would think so and the second is that um I worked with my friends I'm at Google um to get this and every two seconds to say it again for everybody every two seconds someone in North America is doing the work is\nThat all of a thing\nYes every two seconds so none of us are alone I think everybody knows they're not alone because of you who is listening um but they can also now use them statistics that tell their friends hey I had a way I'm barely a minority and I'm probably a majority now\nYou have nothing to hide and have nothing to hide\n... journey started for you because of a personal situation\nYes so did you did\nThis started for me I'm I'm I mean the book really is a journey and well a transformational Journey Through grief\nUm I lost my mother to all timers are and you know I I you you'd only deal with the the eight to ten years prior to it because it's a very it's a painful disease for everyone um and when she passed I was devastated I was broken she I was her person in this world\nAnd not long after she passed I started seeing ghosts and photograph\nAnd at first it scared the heck out of me\nUm I actually want to I'd open a like a ghost portal because you know I Do live in the world of movies so everything in my life I think about tends to get exaggerated when it's like oh my gosh he goes world holder guys what am I done 'em\nAnd and then I started the aging you know the house the perimeter everything um and kept taking photographs and I now have a crazy collection of nine thousand photographs with if\nYou have been doing Sam me these what kind of cameras [laughter]\nAnd I found\nI use and what a great ad by the way right shouldn't apple say have an ad that says shot on an iPhone and have scroll through a bunch of pictures of ghost [noise]\nUm it was an iPhone I I ... at one point and and the journey I bought a real cameras like Samsung camera not have found but like a regular camera and it was interesting because all I capture on that um or or not that ... you know are unimportant and special in our ecosystem\nI wasn't getting everything else it's interesting\nNow\nWhen this was going on for the entire journey let's let's get into your mother's situation and the old timers but how did that really gets you going\n[noise] how did you I'm Sorry say even get me going through\nThis year I mean how did I start to heal from that\nYou started to these strange thing\nYeah I Am you know I I was I'm very lucky I um have found some
