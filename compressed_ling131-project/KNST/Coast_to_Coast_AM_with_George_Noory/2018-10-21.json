car accident\nAnd his healing processes hated by pain killers and some of this is um morphine and he becomes addicted to more than a need for the rest of his life has morphine and alcohol problems\nAnd I think this might have affected his ability to function as a psychic and much later you know the end of his life and I'm Sorry I don't have the dates on this he was involved in a very high profile\nSaid on 'em with pike that's the name that comes to\nMy old James Pike up yes he was up here on on I'm In Canada upon earn a Canadian and so there's another Canadian connection yeah\nYeah and I think it's in I'm looking at it now Nineteen sixty seven forty how let's say on for pike now pike son had tragically committed suicide\nThe year before now what Ford did for this high profile say on with the with all the things that\nYou kind of breaking up a sign on his Thomas ah I'm not sure if it's a cordless phone or a cell phone but\nMaybe if you keep very still speak maybe okay that\nI'm there where it's actually a voiceover IT line and sometimes it does break up is that a little better\nIt is okay\nUm the James Pike this is the ... an Episcopal bishop his son had committed suicide of your earlier and now Ford is doing a say on on Canadian TV\nYes and and he does a little up front research brings it into the than says if he's getting it in a psychic way whereas in fact he got it from a conventional way this was discovered after four died and people went through his papers\nAnd found his research preparing for the ... and that's why people say this\nSo this is another black mark against or if they're bored and it's again muddy the water for this case Houdini case as fun as it is and as exciting as it is it it's not going to be the first to break through convince all the hard no skeptics who just isn't\nRight but but okay so Ford is discredited because of the sense in Canada in Nineteen sixty seven but as you point out he had been taking morphine he had been drinking has a perhaps that had damaged his a medium abilities does that necessarily discredit the work that he did on on the Houdini case\nYes yes that's the way I see it and it does or doesn't I I just that it's it puts a cloud over it but it doesn't necessarily directly bear on it\nNow despite basses\nRe catching\nAnd you know saying no I I don't believe that Harry communicated with me nor could he then why did she continue to do these ... high profile public say ounces on the anniversary of Harry's death for the next ten years\nShe did it for ten years after his death but she didn't start them until a couple of years into that so she did about seven of them as my count but the point is still well taken and here's the way I look at it when she was with Harry um\nShe would be on stage at times and Harry was the one in the spotlight but when Harry dies she's in the spotlight but she doesn't have anything to do\nYou know and so all of a sudden\nShe's in an unusual place and so by stepping into the spotlight only once a year for one night to do the ... and I think the last one was in LA I'm On the top of a building you know the first they were going to do it down into building but then they said let's do that on the top where we'll be higher closer to God and the spirit\nAnyway I think she knew these were going to be a failure because she was the one that was acting as the medium and she's not a medium so you're pretty much guaranteed they're gonna fail\nSo she can say that statement at the end you know ten years is long enough to wait for any man and and that kind of thing and it kinda makes it safe for her to say well I tried I open minded I tried but it didn't work and so I'm going to go\nBack with my friends and embrace the standard mainstream believe\nBut you're inclined to believe that the original statement released in the New York times in Nineteen twenty nine affirming that she had been contacted through a Arthur for its been contacted by her beloved Harry that that that\nQuite possibly happened\nYes yes I Do in the other letter that you wrote to wind chill is also it has a fair amount of passion to it she's very strong you know and so I'm not someone would say well if she was tricked and didn't know she was trick she would still feel very strongly so I'm I'm open minded\nTo that comment to you you finish the essay with a I don't know if you have in front of you if you could share with is the final words of Harry Houdini as brought forth by Fletcher and Ford Fletcher being spared guidance for it at the end of that successful session can you share those words as we head into the break\nSure um and this is the words of Harry so it's um [noise]\nDo a whole world that Harry Houdini still live\nAnd he will prove it a thousand times and more in my life I was perfectly honest and sincere and trying to prove the survival of consciousness and I resorted to trick to prove my point for the simple reason that I did not believe communication was possible\nI Am now and here in my desire to undo this mistake how all those lost faith because of my mistake to lay a whole can of hope and to live with the knowledge that life is

I have a a on a like a question that are like this are you going to the table was\nSo I mean very careful when I write the book is not the following the confirmation bias on election by its meaning on what I'm finding just the fact that you want to claim that sort of losing\nIt it'd be very careful not to fall into that because out of every four or five books that I start to look into one might

really even I mean listen all\nRight well truth is often uncomfortable it's a it's it's not about necessarily making people feel good it's it's like a scorpion sometimes it stings um but you it needs to say\nYou don't paint a flattering picture of of FDR you mentioned a communism although you know let's be honest\nIs it was was kind of the fat back then before people knew I guess the real truth about what was happening in Stalin's Russia and the er the programs in the ... the the forced\nStarvation in Ukraine and so forth um but um let's let's talk about a young FDR talk about someone born

third cousin\nI think it was the second week of\nRight and and he was he was a Republican how did he was a Republican how did he received his younger cousin and the Democrats\nWell they got along really well I'm actually our father wasn't too thrilled about what because that was just not the way that he was raised with a that Roosevelt was done anything to find out if he was\nA ordinarily a full on you know the special unlike some of those so that a lot of things over unsavory than some self marrying\nHis cousin on finding a number Teddy Roosevelt you know that name felt it was awful lot of ways so you know he was a ... benefitted from the laws will name as well so\nRight and he was also a governor of New York classic now he was you know he was also governor of New York which is was has always been sort of a stepping stone to the White House\nYeah and it has happened that way through history\nAbsolutely there's no doubt about that\nAnd a young FDR didn't exactly have the common touch daddy I mean he didn't have um\nThese sort of I think of George Bush a senior in trying to buy succeed Kmart back in the er remember that back in Nineteen eighty eighty tried to show people he he was the common man and there was a famous\nTV report he's trying to buy a pair of socks of Kmart to show you know well he's just one of us and he had no idea what to do when he got up to the cash

August to discuss the murder of Elvis Presley or now we're discussing the murder of\nFranklin Delano Roosevelt the thirty second president um before we get into the the Second World war I just wanted to mention Mussolini\nAnd um there was a time when and I don't I don't believe you address this in the book but\nFDR was also a a an admirer of Mosul leaning or when he first came to power because Mussolini was kind of build as a um as a real progressive\nUm you know he was he and he wrote for the communist newspaper mostly when you did in his latest propaganda minister was sort of the um one of the top a communist thinker so you know fascism in its early beginnings they were communists and that's just the way it is it's a fact\nUh and and I think they kind of ... a mutual admiration society going back and forth I think um when Mussolini was still writing for this worker party magazine he admired Roosevelt Roosevelt wanted to send a delegation over to Italy to see how they did things so\nI I just thought that was kind of an interesting chapter but um\nWhen they entered the war\nRoosevelt wanted a pact with the Soviet Union to kind of squeezed Germany how did that I did go over with Churchill\nWell when it first started to address your Mussolini thing you're absolutely right with that as a matter of fact Hitler also idolized Mussolini at first\nWas an author of Mussolini so Mussolini actually started the whole thing\nBut you know again I'm history books being what they are that times are you the last um [noise] so America gets into the war in Britain is getting polarized ah being bombed at night for\nMore than a month every night\nUm people are taking shelter in the tubes in the book I have a first hand account of that I actually\nMy great aunt is still alive she lived through it through the ... bombings in Birmingham she watched the city's burn 'em every inch of entry and in Birmingham a very interesting stuff so um that was really neat that I have that personal contact with with her and she's still alive and doing well by the way\nI'm anyway are we going into the war and we're we don't have anything to do a stone at the moment we're just trying to help Churchill and because they were really they have no people have no idea according to my end it was there\nHow close England came to losing your island they were lined up on the other side of the day being the Germans were lined up on the other side of the English Channel and this was what their MO was they used to go in weight on airstrikes bomb them into oblivion and then just paper on your ground troops over and it worked exceedingly well especially\nWith France and they thought the same thing was going to work in a in in Britain and of course it didn't because of you know church does resolve a and you know of course so we're going to the war\nAnd now we're there to help out Churchill so we're talking amongst ourselves now working hand in glove with a with the Brits\nNow all of a sudden we get the rainy idea to bring styling into the war and Churchill loses his mind he ate style one doesn't want anything to do with them never trust them\nI'm of course the two had met previously and I'm sure she'll really masterminded the whole thing to be honest with you chose the one who got the two together but he he just pay the fact that the Americans because they were so similar at the time\nThat style and in America and the the American president FDR were working in unison on this it was great for the war it was bad for the world because Stalin was a temporary ally\nHe had his eye completely on the post war world he knew that after the war we went in to be from so you know the answer your question around about fashion um church show like that for the war hated it for the world and I don't know if he completely trusted that FDR wasn't going to become a small one only a less aggressive one\nWell at this point was FDR still a a huge fan of style needs to say that they called them uncle Joe\nOh yeah absolutely absolutely it was a there was of course you have to understand we\nWeren't getting things from Russia we didn't know much about that rate for I think of FDR had known about the butchery and everything going on and he wouldn't have been as fan but of course we weren't getting that\nUntil decades and decades later\nRight in the New York times where they were writing glowing a pieces about uncle Joe and how wonderful sure calling us I mean there's ...\nThere's still a communist newspaper as far as I'm concerned and you know um they're right down the street from the the Communist Party of the United states of America so you know I mean they're still carrying their faces a ... billion\nFDR it seemed a bit from reading your book that FDR was very anxious to get a face to face was down and I don't know if this was because he admired him or like that he was burned and Stalin was playing a little hard to get\nStoned and need us we needed style and spelling didn't need us\nHe was already you know when when the Nazis started to hit a pact with style and of course we know as Hitler and it's and spelling ... well it was violated the act and\nWent after style in which completely blue silence mine and they were on the march to Moscow and they were doing good doing well with this march and then\nYou know it was ego took over and he decided he was going to go to ...\nRight because it held his namesake so now Hitler's leading under the illusion right now that he's unstoppable\nIs completely unstoppable so uh of course we didn't know anything about Hillary's drug habit at the time he was on like\nThirty some odd different drugs so he was such a delusional dictator at the at this time he thinks he's completely unstoppable so he decides to switch course midstream and go towards styling read um meanwhile the weather is changing\nA winter is following the Germans are ill equipped and he'll close to do this it doesn't matter you know his generals are coming back saying it's a suicide mission and he'll just says well I don't care I Want to go do it so Stalin is already beating him or he doesn't need us\nSo Hitler has he has he ever hand here he has the opportunity to play a little a little hard to get in he certainly was so when we really had to go begging it is it's down on the table and which they get this done\nRight so there was a conference in Casablanca and and then later to Iran I think in a was terrain in Nineteen forty three and again for forty three correct they have that even at this point they have their eye and sort of carving up the post war world\nA instill at this point you know I I think teachers Roosevelt still it's pretty robots\nOr you know he you know by by standard to Nineteen forties he was an older guy but by today's standards he was only like sixty years old we tend to think of him and you know in our mind that he was like eighty but he was he was a relatively young guy\nUm but he looked pretty healthy even in in Nineteen forty three um but I I Want to back up all the minute and talk about the assassination squads Hitler was sending over the United states because I didn't know about this until I read your book\nSo this was an experiment in amongst itself so there's a lot going on here there's a lot of the backdoor dealings in the spring going by stone stone is the puppet master\n... this guy would be managed to accomplish with his wife was incredible it was one of the six original members of the most of the revolution\nAnd he ended up there just to make fun of stone\nHe was nothing more than a used to keep the party journals are used to call them um red or was it on hundred index card used to own Ghraib we're used to make fun of him because he was just so worthless when the party\nOne by one he knocked off every one of the party to take control I mean the guy was it was just incredible what a what a ruthless megalomaniac this guy was\nStanding stop I'm I'm sort of Lenin wrote the it is a quote from one of those will I'm rich donors to root too dangerous remove him\nAnd after his dollars that they they called him a you know a

voices offering some of the clearest guidance on enlightenment and spiritual awakening Thomas dig deeply into these subjects to reveal their core wisdom in simple clear English the first time Thomas heard this wisdom was when he attended one of Timothy Conway's sat sang in the summer of two thousand and five\nThomas's taught a class based on the SAT sang for the center for lifelong learning he's spoken publicly numerous times both in person and on the radio and in September twenty twelve you spoke for the prestigious lecture series mind and super mind which is run by the SBC see\nGraham Hancock selected Thomas as he is author of the months for march twenty twelve and again for August twenty four team is the author of living the paradox of enlightenment and his article Houdini afterlife experiment did it work Thomas resentful\nWelcome to the coast to coast am how are you\nI'm way Richard thanks for having me on\nMy pleasure let's talk about Harry Houdini ease\nUm how should we described his I mean he was not just a skeptic of after death communication he\nWas an of vowed to bunker and I don't even think that is saying it strongly enough I mean he there was almost a hatred for these people that he considered to be frauds where did that you know why did that happen how did it come about\nThat that's a very interesting place to start 'em because you're absolutely right I mean he wrote two books as you mentioned and he really um [noise] he um\nWas not just on the side he his mother died in Nineteen Thirteen\nAt that point he tried to get in touch with her through some psychic but he could tell they were all faking what they were doing and so um\nThat kind of got him going and so he has an excellent magician he was able to replicate some of the things that these fake mediums would do\nSo he was always looking for that and actually I think this is ultimately got him killed because I think that the people these fake psychic we're talking amongst themselves and I think they wanted to wrap them up a little bit I don't think they wanted to kill him\nBut I think they wanted to say back off and we don't get in your way get out of our way and I think they might have spent some money to get that um\nThat young student who had done the boxing team\nTo punch him in the stomach which was a trick he did in public and as you know Richard he\nHe would pick someone out of the crowd pick someone like you or me you know right and there and have them come up to the stage and he would make his muscles ready and he would be ready for that\nBut this time there's this guy came backstage and Harry wasn't expecting it at all muscles aren't from this guy really late into him and the trauma in his abdomen so intense that um you know you had those problems and his appendix first and this is why passed away\nRight and and had he had he gone to the doctor immediately to receive a medical uh help he probably would've lived but always the showman he the show must go on and he went on and he performed or four or five more shows and and then finally collapsed in Detroit\nYes he was doing little tiny handkerchief magic 'cause that was all he had the strength for 'em but one other point I on this subject about these fake medium he would send his assistance out and they would find\nPeople and they would see the show and he would find a point in time where the show could be busted so to speak\nAnd he wouldn't even get the guy that was in control of the light and on the deal and Harry would show up with a photographer from the newspaper Harry would be wearing a disguise\nThe magician would be in the middle of his you know if they aren't where they're whatever we the hidden string making something flight guy or whatever and the lights would come up and the photographer we take a picture and\nAnd that you know the fake media would totally surprising and why are you and he'd say I'm Harry Houdini him to pull off his mask and so these guys are very that\nFascinating I I had not heard the the theory that perhaps some of these a cabal of of disgruntled psychics mediums had put this young student at McGill University up to the task of of uh yeah this writing on beating on Harry right I'm going to my\nThat's my own idea I haven't heard it from anyone else it seems to make sense a few phone calls hey you know I mean so I had\nNothing on Henry you know I mean he didn't add any kind of reason to go there or do anything\nRight right I thought it was in I just wanted to ask you about briefly about a ... sir Arthur Conan Doyle because they were ... and he were were good friends and yet a ... was a prominent spiritual so how did that\nHow did that friendship survive or the fact that Harry was such an avowed to bunker didn't have time for spiritual list and yet he's good friend uh and his wife ah we're both very much into spiritualism movement\nYes the spirit was movement is not exactly out and find in some kind of permanent structure you know you can't say there is a leader but a lot of people did looked at the oil as the leader of the spiritual as a matter of friendship starting in around Nineteen twenty for about two years and I think the friendship came about\nThrough fame just fame crossing pass and hey how are you and they enjoy the fact that they had a different perspective and they talked about it um but eventually um there was a little bit of a discord between them\nThat got so much that they did break off their friendship after a couple of years it was the oil's wife who gave a I think it was a [noise] what do you call it a automatic writing kind of reading for Harry where she claims that\nArthur Ford was well aware of\nHoudini reputation and how strongly he was pushing back against the

work and that is posted up at the coast to coast am dot com website and Thomas's website as well infinitely mystical dot com\nThat time is tight Thomas so let's get to the other say on a at a best his house in January of Nineteen twenty nine and a Arthur Ford is there this is the the medium would reached out to her\nA couple of years after the say on\nHe was in a really bad car accident he was with his sister eyes car accident and his healing processes hated by pain killers and some of this is a morphine and he becomes addicted to more than a need for the rest of his life has morphine and alcohol problems\nAnd I think this might have affected his ability to function as a psychic and much later you know the end of his life and I'm Sorry I don't have the dates on this he was involved in a very high profile\nSaid on 'em with pike that's the name that comes\nTo my old James hike up yes he was up here on on I'm In Canada upon are now a Canadian ... another Canadian connection yeah\nYeah yeah and I think it's in I'm looking at it now Nineteen sixty seven forty how a say on for pike now pike son had tragically committed suicide the year before now what Ford did for this high profile say on\nWith the tip of the secret history is the only thing that\nYou kind of breaking up a sign on his Thomas ah I'm not sure if it's a cordless phone or a cell phone but maybe if you keep very steel and speak maybe OK I'm area\nIt's actually a voiceover IT line and sometimes it does break up is that a little better\nIt is okay\nUm the James Pike this was the ... an Episcopal bishop his son had committed suicide a year earlier and now Ford is doing a say on on Canadian TV\nYes and and he does a little upfront research\nBrings it into the ... as if he's getting it in a psychic way whereas in fact he got it from the conventional way this was discovered after four died and people went through his papers and found his research preparing for this say on and that's why people say this\nSo this is another black mark against or if they're bored and it's again muddy the water so this case Houdini case as fun as it is and is exciting it is it it's not going to be the first to break through convince all the hard no skeptics who just isn't\nRight but but okay so Ford is discredited because of the sense in Canada in Nineteen sixty seven but as you point out he had been taking morphine he had been drinking or perhaps that had damaged his a medium ... abilities does that necessarily discredit the work that he did on on the Houdini case\nYes yes that's the way I see it and it does or doesn't I I just that it's it puts a cloud over it but it doesn't necessarily directly bear on it\nNow despite best is\nRe catching\nAnd you know saying no I I don't believe that Harry communicated with me nor could he then why did she continue to do the same ... high profile public say ounces on the anniversary of Harry's death for the next ten years\n[noise] um she did it for ten years after his death but she didn't start them until a couple of years into that so she did about seven of them as my count but the point is still well taken and here's the way I look at it when she was with Harry\nUm\nShe would be on stage at times and Harry was the one in the spotlight but when Harry dies she's in the spotlight but she doesn't have anything to do\nYou know and so all of a sudden she's in an an unusual place and so by stepping into the spotlight only once a year for one night to do the ... and I think the last one was in LA\nI'm On the top of a building you know that first they were going to do it down into building but then they said let's do step on the top where we'll be higher closer to God and the spirits\nAnyway I think she knew these were going to be a failure because she was the one that was acting as the medium and she's not a medium so you're pretty much guaranteed they're gonna fail\nSo she can say that statement at the end you know ten years is long enough to wait for any man and and that kind of thing and it kinda makes it safe for her to say well I tried I open minded I tried but it didn't work and so I'm going to go\nBack with my friends and embrace the standard mainstream believe\nBut you're inclined to believe that the original statement released in the New York times in Nineteen twenty nine affirming that she had been contacted\nThrough or are there for ... been contacted by her beloved Harry that that that quite possibly happened\nYes yes I Do and the other letter that she wrote to wind chill is also it has a fair amount of passion to it and she's very strong you know and so I'm now someone would say well if she was tricked and didn't know she was tricked she would still feel very strongly so I'm I'm open minded to that comment to\nYou you finish the essay with a I don't know if you have in front of ...\nYou if you could share with is the final words of Harry Houdini as brought forth by Fletcher and Ford Flex your being the spirit guide and for it at the end of that successful session can you share those words as we head into the break\nSure um and this is the words of Harry so it's um [noise]\nDo the whole world that Harry Houdini still live and they will prove it a thousand times and more in my life I was perfectly honest and here in trying to prove the survival of consciousness\nAnd I resorted to trick to prove

before people knew I guess the real truth about what was happening in Stalin's Russia and the er the programs in the ... the the forced\nA started nations in the Ukraine and so forth um but um let's let's talk about young FDR talk about someone born with a silver spoon in his mouth\nA paint me I'm a ... a portrait of the young FDR\n... you know at the Iowa lose uh I ...

I I think of George Bush senior trying to buy Taksim Kmart back in the ... member that back in Nineteen eighty eighty tried to show people he he was the common man and there was a famous\nTV report he's trying to buy a pair of socks at Kmart to show you know well he's just one of us and he had no idea what to do when he got up to the cash register [laughter] it's funny how that\nGuess I\nJust don't want to be wrestling\nOn seven Ninety\nHumiliating talk\nYou're in rock spotlight Seventy three November Seventy three Billy Joel second album you'll some minor will manage\nWindows ... success was unable to album and we talked ten years including two number one's photographs and you were sixteen [noise] meanwhile John Lennon Lucy show out of mind games\n[noise]\n\nAnd the December the single taken care of business tries to second album by Canadian Robin maternal overdrive number more damage than Lincoln formerly with the album range salads surgery which goes to number eleven and after passing away in a plane crash in September of Jim Crow she has a number one with time in a bottle\nListening to her radio more from Nineteen Seventy three coming up\n... ...\nYour would your\n\n\nReview [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\nWhich I Know [noise]\n\n\n[noise] [noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\n... suits coast to coast through you know here's your just to Richard center ridge ... that's a pretty\nVersion of across the universe David Bowie I'm here to tell you folks are maps are all wrong\nAll the wrong and a a scientist has created a representation of what the world really looks like\nA true map of the world and you can check it out it's a posted in the in the news section of the coast to coast am dot com or webmaster shot a store a tonight is all over that and he's a posted that there are many countries for example including Russia and Canada are are not nearly as big as we think\nAnd the problem is it's very difficult to portray the reality of a ... world on a flat map and so you get this distortion\nIt's called their Mercator projection map or the the most commonly seen hanging in classrooms in textbooks it was created back in Fifteen Ninety six I think it's maybe time we have to wait and see what was it was designed to help sailors navigate the world the ... the Mercator projection buddy distorts\nSeriously distorts the size of land masses\nSo for example you may have noticed that a while Africa is around fourteen times larger than Greenland and yet on the map\nBoth are almost the same size Greenland is huge on these maps Brazil another example Brazil is more than five times larger than Alaska yet Alaska is much larger than Brazil on the map much larger\nMap also suggested Scandinavian countries are larger than India whereas in reality India is three times the size of all Scandinavian countries put together\nLooks like Europe is larger than North America on on these old maps but in reality the reverse is true Russia isn't as large as its depicted with Africa larger than Russia in reality\nSo if you want to see the world is it really is represented on a map you want to check out this fascinating story again in the in the new section up at coast to coast am dot com\nDo you have you're a fan of coast to coast you're going to love beyond belief George ... streamed Internet TV program beyond belief you can sign up today started joined dynamic discussions on paranormal phenomena conspiracies and all things unexplained\nThere are terrific gassed basically it's just coast to coast with video beyond belief dot com you can start watching episodes right now beyond belief\nDot com back to who murdered FDR the true story they don't want you to know we'll find out who they are a little later ...

I was right on the money with the\nRight but as you as you are in many great pains to point out and you just mentioned this earlier that the Germans\nAre and there'd be T. V. to rocket program I'm almost ... they were getting close to being able to deliver um nuclear bombs and had the United states not done yet\nA when they did it may have been too late and imagine nuclear weapons attached to those me two rockets raining down on on England\nYou know it's incredible uh it's just absolutely incredible when you think about the situation\nUm you know America is an economic chaos they know they have to get into this war for many reasons to the to spark the economy as well and uh it was just in the he had to FDR was put in a real bad situation\nAnd you know in the first chapter of my book I paint FDR is kind of a villain and I have to do that to set up and murder so I Apologize in advance for anybody reads that gets a time when FDR had\nTo sell our country on this war and I believe he had to sacrifice Pearl Harbor and the lives that I Know it's a terrible thing to say but I I think that's that's how it happened\nIn order to galvanize public support\nRight yeah 'cause he he had already been saying this was Europe's war this is Europe's were well between the the ... the horrible economy which was not doing anything and the necessary time to get into the war coming through our spies and it was he knew it was time to write gut wrenching decision very gut wrenching decision\nSo that that's a that's how that came in to pass you\nKnow before we get into the the us in World War two and FDR's relationship with Churchill and and then later style\nAnd I'm just shocked me a little bit about sort of the enemies list that he had already cultivated through you know the over regulation and and um with with the big corporations in the United states\nOh boy ah [laughter] this guy had a you know there were enemy hated money you really didn't affect account because he is much goal is to get his hands on and so um and he really\nAnybody who was interested in industry are making money it was definitely not his friend I mean he really pissed off some powerful people\nUm I'll run through the list here are the ones that I came up with um the dupont family um George Eastman from Eastman Kodak hurry Firestone\nSame old Colgate Colgate toothpaste or Henry Ford parents still head I'm Henry Frick Heinz family the Hilton family who had hotels the melon family who was in charge of the world banks\nUm William top man who was president of Liberia and even um ... Robert ... who was the chairman of the border Coca Cola I mean these people would have done anything to get this guy out of power because he was costing them millions of dollars not only in production but in personal wealth\nSo he he certainly had some some enemies and and here we're starting to get into the motive of murder and as with all of my books I run all the suspects through motive means an opportunity to come up with the person or people connected to this and how it happened\nAnd I just want to tell I just want to jump in and tell everybody don't buy this book on Amazon\nI Am I'm

desperate measures at Mexico's border with Guatemala we're about two thousand migrants despite police orders yesterday to turn back\nAnd then just paper on your ground troops over and it worked exceedingly well especially France and they thought the same thing was going to work in a in in Britain and of course it didn't because of you know church does resolve a and you know of course so we're going to the war\nAnd now we're there to help out Churchill so we're talking amongst ourselves now working you know hand in glove with a with the Brits\nNow all of a sudden we get the rainy idea to bring styling into the war and Churchill loses his mind he hates style and doesn't want anything to do with um never trust them I'm of course to admit previously and I'm\nChurchill really masterminded the whole thing to be be honest with you Churchill was the one who got the two together but he he just pay the fact that the Americans because they were so similar at the time that style and in America and the American president FDR were working\nIn unison on this it was great for the war it was bad for the world because Stalin was a temporary ally\nHe had his eye completely on the post war world he knew that after the war we weren't going to be friends so you know to answer your question around about fashion um Churchill elected for the war hated it for the world and I don't know if he completely trusted that FDR wasn't going to become a small one only a less aggressive one\nWell at this point was FDR still a huge fan of style needs to say that they called them uncle Joe\nOh yeah absolutely absolutely he was a there was of course you have to understand\nWe weren't getting things from Russia we didn't know much about the great birds I think of FDR had known about the butchery and everything going on and he wouldn't have been as fan but of course we weren't getting that until decades and decades later\nRight in New York Times wherever they were writing glowing a pieces about uncle Joe and how wonderful sure communist\nI mean there's ... there's still a communist newspaper today as far as I'm concerned and [laughter] you know um they're right down the street from the the Communist Party of the United states of America so you know I mean they're still carrying their pieces are ...\nMillion NPR it seemed that the ... and reading your book an FDR was very anxious to get a face to face was down and I don't know if this was because he admired him or like that he was burns and Stalin was playing a little hard to get\nStolen didn't need us we needed style and Stalin didn't need us\nHe was already you know when when the Nazis started to hit a pact with style and of course we know as Hitler and installing a pack well Hitler violated the pack and\nWent after style in which completely loose islands mind and they were on the march to Moscow and they were doing good doing well with this march and then\nYou know Hitler's ego took over and he\nDecided he was going to go to ... because it held his namesake so now Hitler's leading under the illusion right now that he's unstoppable is completely unstoppable so uh of course we didn't know anything about Hillary's drug habit at the time he was on like\nThirty some odd different drugs so he was such a delusional dictator at the at this time he thinks he's completely unstoppable so he decides to switch course midstream and go towards styling read\nMeanwhile the weather is changing\nA winter is following the Germans are ill equipped and he'll close to do this it doesn't matter you know his generals are coming back saying it's a suicide mission and he'll just says well I don't care I Want to go do it so styling is already beating him or he doesn't need us\nSo Hitler has he has he ever hand here he has the opportunity to play a little a little harder to get and he certainly was so when we really had to go begging it is it's down on the table and wish to get this done\nRight so there was a conference in Casablanca and and then later to Iran I think\nIn a was terrain in Nineteen forty three and a gang member forty three correct they have that even at this point they have their eye it sort of carving up the post war world ah instill at this point you know I I see pictures Roosevelt still it's pretty robots\nOr you know he you know by by standard to Nineteen forties he was an older guy but by today's standards he was only like sixty years old we tend to think of him and you know in our mind that he was like eighty but he was he was a relatively young guy\nUm but he looked pretty healthy even in in Nineteen forty three um but I I Want to back up all the minute and talk about the assassination squads Hitler was sending over the United states because I didn't know about this until I read your book\nRight I I had an author on a couple of years ago who wrote a book about Ernest Hemingway and how and they tried to recruit anyway you add loudly\nSo it was a fictitious count that didn't exist there was made a cardboard basically\nSo they can village a Potemkin village and there you go um\nHe sends all of these people home with literature and propaganda as to how they can transform their country meeting our country and to this wonderful new ideology you didn't know anything about evil empires\nKnow in the new deal you've got to cut Roosevelt will get a break here which I've never been done before\nSo this was an experiment in amongst itself so there's a lot going on here there's a lot of the backdoor dealings in the spring party by Stalin spelling is the puppet master\nHe uh he's this guy would he managed to accomplish and his wife was incredible it was one of the six original members of the ... revolution\nAnd he ended up they just don't make fun of style and\nHe was nothing more than a used to keep the party\nJournals are used to call them comrade I'm with the tone Conrad index card it was to come Ghraib we're used to make fun of him because he was just so worthless when the party\nOne by one knocked off everyone in the party to take control I mean the guy was it was just incredible what a what a ruthless megalomaniac this guy was\nStanding stop I'm I'm Sorry I'm Lenin wrote the un quote from lens will come redstone is to root too dangerous remove him\nAnd after stoned to death they they called him a you know a pencil pusher and all kinds of
