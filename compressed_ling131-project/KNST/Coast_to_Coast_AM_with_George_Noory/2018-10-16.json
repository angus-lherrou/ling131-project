spirituality Mitch has also in award winning historian longtime friend the coast to coast am off gorge and missions are very popular voice of audio books as well his latest the miracle club Mitch welcome back\nMuch George great to be here always a pleasure my friend what you've been up to these days\nWell a today is the launch day of the miracle club which is very exciting for me because it's probably the first book I've written that is strictly practical that goes into techniques and methods and ah it's a big bridge that I've crossed with this book and I'm very grateful to have the chance to talk to the coast family about it\nIt's a great title to by the way the miracle club it sounds like a movie already\n[laughter] you know it was a group of a cult explores here in New York City and the nineteenth century and they were dedicated to exploring everything just like you do on your show and I really wanted to revive the spirit of that original group\nOr their motto was try that that just one more try and that's really been my informal motto throughout my whole life so I use the term in tribute to them\nHow many members of that club\n[laughter] that was probably about five of them they were just a little group [laughter] side of Manhattan and Eighteen Seventy five while we're experimenting\nWith finances and medium ship and talking to the dead end table rapping and so on they weren't around for very long but they formed the nucleus of a much larger and more influential group the esophageal society which is still around today and which is probably responsible for the whole revolution and alternative spirituality\nThat is amazing too because during that era the Eighteen hundreds it seems like the dabbling in the paranormal was different than today Mitch yeah and they really took it seriously didn't they\nVery seriously and they had the spirit of childlike wonder I mean they were delving into mysterious things and they were looking into some dark places\nBut they were doing it with their sense of just asking themselves what is out there how can we understand life you know it was a period of time when a Darwinism was in the attendance and people were starting to think maybe we've been wrong about\nGod and spirits any invisible world and these people said listen we don't want to throw science out we embrace science but we want to use science to try to experiment with whether we can detect things about the invisible world\nComments at us and believe it or not with a member of this original group and he talked about wanting to construct a machine that can help people talk to the dead it's not clear whether edits and ultimately did that but he and a major general Adnan Doubleday uh we're both early members\nThat's amazing now tell us a little bit about the book ... club and and because it's also a practical guide book isn't it\nIt really is you know for many years I've written and I've been on the show talking about alternative spiritual history the history of the cold but I've always also considered myself a believing historian I experiment with the ideas and the methods and approaches that I write about and I wanted to take the opportunity\nTo write about the things that I've tried myself I Believe very strongly in the powers of the mind I Believe that thoughts are cause of death I Believe that if you walk around with a deeply held emotionally charged mental\nPicture that is going to affect what happens to you and you can use that and there are reasons for this and I wanted to write a book that would give people concrete hands on the\nWhat do you think a miracle is Mitch\nA miracle very simply put is something that is a radical departure from all natural expectation and currents that breaks away from everything that you could naturally and reasonably expect to arise\nFrom circumstances and I've experienced miracles in my own life the very fact that you and I are talking you know I didn't start reading my own books until I was into middle age I Am currently fifty two years old and my career did not take off\nUntil I was in my forties and that didn't happen by accident that was the mental picturing there was a visualization with an affirmation as well as a lot of sweat equity but I Do believe if you can find a miracle has a radical departure from circumstance miracles do occur today\nAnd the subtitle of the book which is how thoughts become reality and you're you're a very strong believer in that aren't you\nI really am and you know it's funny if you actually take a look at your life sometimes there is a long\nInterval sometimes there was a long gestation period between a fought in the event but if if if listeners really sit back and survey their lives they will find an uncanny ... grew in sea between things that they've thought about and things that have happened to them\nMitch have you found that people who dabble with the dark side tend to do some of the similar things that the positive people do but that's something always goes awry for them\nWell it's an interesting question you know we face these ethical questions of how to use our powers\nAll the time in life you know a person could be completely materialist he or she could be an atheist\nAnd they still face ethical questions every single day about whether they're treating other people fairly honorably if you take seriously as I Do that our minds have these extra physical capacity that responsibility becomes\nAll the more that responsibility becomes that much stronger my contention is that however\nA field buffet by the winds and currents of life we are much more powerful than we think we are we have a hand in events\nMentally and and often the shows up in ways that we don't suspect so my messages also be careful be careful because what you're thinking about absolutely has a practical dimension on your life and on the lives of other\n... before you came on and he uses that he was in Israel and of course great Mentalist news telling us the story and how he was commissioned to help the Brits in a soccer match against Scotland\nAnd over the stadium they put him in a helicopter in he was supposed to influence the ball and and I guess when the when the Scottish kicker was going to the ball or a mentally moved it and the guy missed it or something like\nThat [laughter] now here's a story about or he's an old or a family friend and he was over at the house hold up my brother in law I've and when I was Fifteen Years old\nAnd I've and expressed all kinds of skepticism and er he said to him do me a favor arrive and go into your bedroom and draw a picture and so I have and when his bedroom drew a picture came out and said\nYou drew a house and I was shocked that that that's absolutely true\n[laughter] I Know ...

to consciousness in the morning use that time that is the prime time for science\nLee reciting African nations do so\nIt it seems to work doesn't it\nThat's been my experience George when people ask me for a simple step to take that is always the step I give them again my mantra is never neglect simple things we have a habit of overlooking simple things used them there's more depth there than one might expect\nOne or some of the positives of mind control methods we should use\nWell one of the things that's most important is writing things down right down your goals and I don't mean on a computer I mean get out and old fashioned pencil and paper and do it\nBecause once you do that you've actually created a physical manifestation so to speak of the things that you're looking for the actual tactile act of writing something I think not only helps\nPersuade you mentally and in terms of your neural pathways of the goals that you're moving towards\nBut you've actually done something empowering you've done something real if you sit down and for a sustained period of time make a list of things that you truly want in life and you know these are things you want with all your heart there not diversionary but they are essential life goals take that list\nPut it on to some sort of a laminated card or something that you can carry with you look at it morning noon and night\nThink about it as much as possible and when things on that list come to you and over time they will come to you and they may come to quicker than you think just expressed gratitude and most important of all\nDon't tell anyone what you're doing remain silent but sometimes you share these things with other people and the roll their eyes or they'll say it's nonsense than they knock you off your resolve remain silent make your list\nCarry it with you review it three times a day memorize it and when the results arrive\nExpress things that the method we can all do and it's easy isn't it once you get into it\nIt is easy that the the the important thing is to do it with consistency is to do it with silence and it's to do it with total stark honesty arriving at a definite aim in life or a\n... a small number of things that coalesce around one aim has enormous power an aim is really another way of saying focus and we know that\nWhen you focus the sun's rays with a magnifying glass prism they become enormously powerful what is a laser other than focused light natural laws are consistent your mind is powerful when it is focused which is why I keep emphasizing the idea that you have to really\nNailed down what you want in a very concrete way and be very honest with yourself that's we're focused comes from\nMitch since you've been doing this have you use these techniques for yourselves\nEvery day every single day George and I must tell you you know I my life has gone in directions that I never could have expected\nI've done television then narrating and and and and written many books and articles including in places that are not known for their cult enthusiasm type written about these topics in the Washington Post the wall Street Journal the New York times I never\nDreamt that was possible and so I feel\nLike I'm an example of the effectiveness of these methods and everything that are offered to the coast family or things that I wrote tested myself I Would never ask somebody to do something\nThat I hadn't experimented with myself\nOr you could tell you love doing what you're doing\nI really do I really do I\nMean you know it's a dream come true and the most literal sense you know Fifteen Years ago this is exactly what I pictured myself doing and exactly what I wanted to do be patient sometimes things happen quickly but sometimes a gestation period is also necessary\nIt is amazing we're kind of people get this membership and do the miracles\nOr the miracle club I used to say\nThat anybody can join the vertical club you didn't have to sign your name up any where there was no magic decoder ring in anything and of course that's true everybody who's listening is automatically a member in the ... of the miracle club but I got to thinking\nYou know speaking of magic decoder rings maybe it would be fun if people had a little membership card so I asked a friend of mine a great artist named Tim boat\nTo draw up a membership card in America club but anybody who emailed me and I'm super easy to find throw my name into Google it'll take it on my website and my email email me and I will send you your own\nMembership card to be in the miracle club you could sign that you can folded laminated carry it in your wallet just something fun to have with you to sort of keep you on course throughout the day to keep your thoughts steady

gonna take calls next hour with Mitch or which of course we will take your miracle stories as well I Would guess Mitch it's surprising how many people have miracle stories\nIt it is overwhelming you\nKnow we have to understand that life is made up of of of joys and and sometimes great tragedies but in as much as we do experience catastrophes in life and let's face it that's part of life\nWe also experienced extraordinary absurdly unexpected moments of good news there are in fact times George where we get just what we're looking for and I would say that's more than just the turn of the

back to coast to coast George Norris what'd you along with Mitch Horwitz Mitch told me about the power behind writing down a goal women going for it\nYou know it's interesting when we write down a goal it really demand that we pull something out of us that's authentic and that's kind of the magic key\nTo all of this material I Would say that absolute passionate intensity is the one the hidden key behind every self help program with it or something will work without it nothing happens now one of my contention is\nThat we really need to have one absolute definite chief aim in life and that can be something that we very often resist\nWriting things down can help us with that because if you write down what you really care about over a course of days are over the course of weeks you'll see that it will all tend\nIn one direction and my challenge to the listener is whether you can come up with one overarching goals that facilitates\nAll of the smaller ones what would that be if you can come up with one chief aim you have arrived at mental focus and mental focus is the open sesame so to speak to everything that we've been talking about\nInteresting work miniature what's with us and Mitch did you get some professional help when you put those together or did you do this on your own\nSo all of my own you know this is really my tribute to the thought of my own heroes and the mental human tradition or things that they've thought about things that I have experimented with ideas that I came up with myself\nA you know I view the miracle club is something that we all belong to all of us who were drivers all of us who are experimenter as we are all automatically in the miracle club and my idea was just to create something around which we could all gather and experiment with our minds\nWhat would you say would be a great miracles story that you've heard about\nA great miracles story that I've heard about was a financial miracle I had a friend\nIn New England who was recovering from a very serious disease and he was facing financial disaster he had only one hundred and two dollars left\nTo his name and he was on the brink of losing his health insurance one night I challenged people like challenged people to make a marathon reading of the book George that I Know you love very deeply the magic of believe\nAnd yes and ... yeah and my friend\nRather than reading the book decided to get hold of an audio version of it that I happen to narrate he listened to it over and over and over for about five days on the fifth day he got a call from an old boss\nWho said to him you know you left behind a four O. one K. account here have you checked that account and my friend said on that you know you can carry thought it was a few dollars and cents is old boss had to have you looked at it\nThere's over fifty thousand dollars\nIn ...\nYeah I can only tell you that that's what happened and to my friend it truly felt like a miracle\nThat is America it really is yeah it's exactly what the experience and it was quite recent that when you least expect it you know yes\nYes that's what I tell people you know again George it can sound sort of Hackney to say never give up at these things do happen when you least expect it\nYou can always give it another twenty four hours you have no idea what twists and turns life is going to take in as much as life visits catastrophe on us and it does\nIt also visit extraordinary absurdly good news on us and you never know you never know what life is going to take in twenty four hours I always in poor people who feel desperate among other things among other things give it twenty four hours more\nYou are a believer in visualizing before something happens aren't you have\n... absolutely I think that if you can get

of something that you want to happen but don't enact it is if you're looking at it on a movie screen\nAnd acted as if you're in it if you want to climb the ladder for example don't see yourself climbing the ladder like climb climb you know really feel those rungs in your hands really feel the weight of your of your feet\nPressing on each run as you climb put yourself in a simple scene and then run that seen through your mind over and over again it's important to choose one simple scene in order to keep your mind from wandering because you will find that your mind wanders\nAnd you always need to bring it back if you can feel the emotions\nOf what would be happening as you're acting out that scene like somebody shaking her hand and saying congratulations maybe your boss telling you you've got a promotion at work in time\nAnd time that will Congress ties into reality it may be in ways that you don't expect there may be a long period of gestation or an interval but in time it

it's seven pm that would be great\nBut many space scientists are saying realistically will have to push this back to march twenty Nineteen\nAnd finally in the lives sky don't forget folks the moon

Mitch has also oh in award winning historian longtime friend the coast to coast am a coach and missions are very popular voice of audio books as well his latest the miracle club Mitch welcome back\nMuch George great to be here I'll always a pleasure my friend what you've been up to these days\nWell a today is the launch day of the miracle club which is very exciting for me because it's probably the first book I've written that is strictly practical that goes into techniques and methods and ah it's a big bridge that I've crossed with this book and I'm very grateful to have the chance to talk to the coast family about it\nIt's a great title to by the way the miracle club it sounds like a movie already\n[laughter] you know it was a group of a cult explores here in New York City in the nineteenth century and they were dedicated to exploring everything just like you do on your show and I really wanted to revive the spirit of that original group\nOr their motto was try that that just one more try and that's really been my and form a motto throughout my whole life so I use the term in tribute to them\nHow many members of that club\n[laughter] that was probably about five of them they were just a little group outside of Manhattan and Eighteen Seventy five while we're experimenting\nWith finances and medium ship and talking to the dead end table rapping and so on they weren't around for very long but they formed the nucleus of a much larger and more influential group the esophageal society which is still around today and which is probably responsible for the whole revolution and alternative spirituality\nThat is amazing too because during that era the Eighteen hundreds it seems like the dabbling in the paranormal was different than today Mitch yeah and they really took it seriously didn't they\nVery seriously and they had the spirit of childlike wonder I mean they were delving into mysterious things than they were looking into some dark places\nBut they were doing it with this offensive just asking themselves what is out there how can we understand life you know it was a period of time when a Darwinism was in the attendance and people were starting to think maybe we've been wrong about\nGod and spirits and the invisible world and these people said listen we don't want to throw science out we embrace science but we want to use science to try to experiment with whether we can detect things about the invisible world\nThomas Edison believe it or not was a member of this original group and he talked about wanting to construct a machine that could help people talk to the dead it's not clear whether edits and ultimately did that but he and a major general Adnan Doubleday uh we're both early members\nThat's amazing now tell us a little bit about the book the miracle club and and because it's also a practical guide book isn't it\nIt really is you know for many years I've written and I've been on the show talking about alternative spiritual history the history of the occult but I've always also considered myself a believing historian I experiment with the ideas and the methods and approaches that I write about and I wanted to take the opportunity\nTo write about the things that I've tried myself I Believe very strongly in the powers of the mind I Believe that thoughts are cause it if I Believe that if you walk around with a deeply held emotionally charged mental\nPicture that is going to affect what happens to you and you can use that and there are reasons for this and I wanted to write a book that would give people concrete hands on or\nWhat do you think a miracle is Mitch\nA miracle very simply put is something that is a radical departure from all natural expectation and currents that breaks away from everything that you could naturally and reasonably expect to arrive\nFrom circumstances and I've experienced miracles in my own life the very fact that you and I are talking you know I didn't start reading my own books until I was into middle age I Am currently fifty two years old and my career did not take off\nUntil I was in my forties and that didn't happen by accident there was a mental picturing there was a visualization with an affirmation as well as a lot of sweat equity but I Do believe if you can find a miracle as a radical departure from circumstance miracles do occur today\nHence the subtitle of the book which is how thoughts become reality and you're you're very strong believer in that aren't you\nI really am and you know it's funny if you actually take a look at your life sometimes there is a long\nInterval sometimes there was a long gestation period between a fought in the event but if if if listeners really sit back and survey their lives they will find an uncanny ... grew in sea between things that they've thought about and things that have happened to them\nMitch have you found the people who dabble with the dark side tend to do some of ... this similar things that the positive people do but that's something always goes awry for them\nWell it's an interesting question you know we face these ethical questions of how to use our powers\nAll the time in life you know a person could be completely materialist he or she could be an atheist\nAnd they still face ethical questions every single day about whether they're treating other people fairly and honorably if you take seriously as I Do that our minds\nHave these extra physical capacities that responsibility becomes all the more that responsibility becomes that much stronger my contention is that however we may feel buffet by\nThe winds and currents of life we are much more powerful than we think we are we have a hand in events\nMentally and and often the shows up in ways that we don't suspect so my message is also be careful be careful because what you're thinking about absolutely as a practical dimension on your life and on the lives of others\nI had a rebel or on before you came on and you use that he was in Israel and of course great Mentalist news telling us the story and how he was commissioned to help the Brits in a soccer match against Scotland\nAnd over the stadium they put him in a helicopter in he was supposed to influence the ball and and I guess when the when the Scottish kicker was going to the ball or a mentally moved in and the guy missed it or something like\nThat [laughter] now here's a story about or he's an old or a family friend and he was over at the house hold up my brother in law I've and when I was Fifteen Years old\nAnd I've and expressed all kinds of skepticism and er he said to him do me a favor arrive and go into your bedroom and draw a picture and so I haven't went in his bedroom drew a picture came out and said\nYou drew a house and I was shocked and said that's absolutely true\n[laughter] I Know we had gr Mitchell delayed astronaut when he was on our program\nWas talking about a tie class episode yet at NASA tie class in the ... or or type pin and he lost and you couldn't find it and he was telling or you bought into and out of the sky just out of nowhere they heard upping\nAnd it was the tight class that that fell on the ground and came out of nowhere the other part of it the the part that class ... into the the pointed at the end of it\nYeah was in ... ice cream [laughter]\nYellow swallowed it I mean it's amazing the ... he\nWas there for that [laughter] it's amazing but back to these miracles and we take calls next hour\nI'd like for people to share miracle stories with you Mitch if we can but back to the dark side of it and I don't want to dabble in the dark in too much but that'd be too but you know people dabble in the dark side the curse of other people they put ... on other people\nIn in a lot of cases those things happened to these people yeah how how come than the dark side has that kind of power\n[noise] well it represents something that's in us you know we we we we are being of of of a broad spectrum\nAnd my contention is that thoughts are positive and whether you are using your thoughts through spell or whether you using your thoughts through a ritual or whether you are projecting thoughts at other people\nSomething's going to happen there is going to be some effect however one of my favorite teachers never God or to grade teacher in the mind power tradition\nTeaches that the only way that you can project\nA negative spell or thought on to another person is if that person could wish the same thing for someone else is if that person could wish the same thing for someone else if he or she could not get rebounds to use so in a certain sense well we grew up calling the golden rule is protection\nAgainst evil forces and I want people to listen to that very carefully because we are apt to overlook familiar things we are apt to overlook temple things\nIf you are concerned about negative forces in your life the golden rule can serve as an enormous source of protection there is an esoteric and a cult dimensions of the golden rule that we don't always appreciate\nWell that's absolutely true now why do our thoughts shape the reality of what happens\nThis is my contention in the book and I felt they really had to put myself out there and come up with a theory of positive thinking I'm going to be very brief about it across all kinds of scientists from cyclical research to quantify the arising we have made the determination over the past eight years\nThings that we would have thought were unbelievable a generation ago are being validated in clinical experiments today I think the universe is ultimately mental that doesn't mean that we don't live under many laws enforces\nBut if one can understand how much that means your thoughts are more powerful than anything you've been brought up to realize\nIs the power of the brain or are we dealing with something outside of the physical body\nWe're dealing with something outside of the physical body and I think we could say that conclusively today because we have actual experiments but the thought change the brain\nYour sustained thoughts will actually alter the neural pathways the electrical pathways in your brain that's demonstrable by brain scans it's literally mind over matter so if fought changes the brain and fought has to be something that's extra physical that goes beyond the brain\nWoodward's human beings sometimes things work sometimes they don't ... if they don't work what does that mean\nYou know it's very important that that's an extremely important point because people will sometimes try a method it works they're thrilled they try it again it doesn't work and then they feel project one of the things that I read about on the book is that we live\nWithin a cosmic framework where we experienced many different laws enforces the law of mind is constant as a law must be but so is the law of gravity but you're going to experience gravity differently on earth\nThan you would on the moon around Jupiter doesn't mean gravity isn't there doesn't mean gravity is an operative but it's affected by mass the mind just the same way circumstances\nAre going to intrude upon how we experience these things so we're ... we experiment very clearly and very carefully\n... going to come back and talk more about your work\nThe miracle club [noise] next hour we'll
