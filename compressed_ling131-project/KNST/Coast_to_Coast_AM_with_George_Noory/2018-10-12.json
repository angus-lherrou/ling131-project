a week and a whole from just like a ten to Fifteen Percent correction here which are already close to that\nUm we may make it you know in the next year but but this is the greatest bubble in modern

know it was Seventy eight percent for the tech stocks and stuff and and this could be the beginning I've got some signs I can talk about and stuff but but this could be the beginning of it and\nAnd this is not something you want to sit through ... you know most of the times stocks go up and then they correct ten or twenty percent that's fine most people should sit through that\nNot I call this a great reset this only happens once in a generation and even more so every Ninety years like a clock and we're\nComing right on that clock in stocks can be down Seventy eighty Ninety percent and take twenty to twenty five years to get back there you do not hold through this and you do not listen to your stockbroker at this time\nYou buy back in when things at the bottom\n... you know that's the

bubble I mean the tech bubble took five years the bill but the dot com crash came in the last year and a half a six\nTo seven times kind of like the bitcoin bubble here recently cracked and a lot of companies when other well which what were the survivors will companies like apple and Amazon if it apart Amazon there oh my God I was\nIs the far left and this is around the world but it's the most extreme here and Trump is playing this like a federal\nThat's why how he won he picked off the far right and and win against the centrist Republicans and then the Republicans had to follow him because he now has the baton\nAnd he has all the power so so this is this is this is going to make this I'm much more difficult if the social and political level again down here\nTwelve years of recession twelve and I think now Fifteen Percent unemployment after Hurricane Maria no civil unrest these people just aren't like that they're not as polarized down here\nIn the U.S we are polarized this cabin off thing it was just pure partisan you know the Republicans\nBelieved him and the Democrats believed her the men believed him don't women believe ... I've never I mean it this there was no common sense no rationality it was just political partisanship and the people the Republicans hated the Democrats for attacking this guy\nAnd the Democrats hated the Republicans for defending him in and installing this thing and cutting I mean this is like\nI mean and and and who's got all the guns in the world we do so so this is really\nThe I think that that social unrest in this downturn\nIs going to top the great depression where it was more people roaming around in their cars and not having housing and no jobs and soup lines this is going to be different people\nThe the blue and the red extremes are going to blame each other for the crisis to Republican and say you damn Democrats let all this debt run up and all this you know free money and stuff\nAnd the and the Democrats are and say Republicans you didn't let us stimulate on up and blah blah blah blah blah and and and they're gonna hate each other and and so I I think that's going to be the worst part of this\nThat we really and and and I really think there's a possibility that there's going to be movements and this time in the civil war I compare there's more to the civil war\nOn the social political level at that time the south seceded from the more industrial and urbanized north they were totally different I mean the north was blue the south has read this time\nEspecially with Republicans in charge now I think there's going to be facts I think\nStates like California or the whole west coast or the whole northeast is going to threaten to succeed from the red states because they can't agree on anything there is nothing that can be agreed on his cabinet thing was the perfect example of that no middle ground it's\nEither red or blue you know\nAnd it's hard to argue mid hatred on both sides\nAnd even you know the Democrats are always a nice guy I Know that Democrats are jumping up and down and women you know almost the sole thing you know ... senators and in the

condo there for a quarter of the price\nAnd and and and and but I Want to see what happens first and and the thing about it the next year also George's this is this is when it's gonna it's gonna happen or not it it's either starting to happen now or or the latest by my calculations with every cycle we have an everything we got her it's ...\nIt's going to start by late next year and that's going to be a Ninety year anniversary of the greatest\nStock crash in modern history Nineteen twenty nine to thirty two and that is one of many of our cycles we cover and zero our\nIn our newsletters that Ninety year cycle is the most powerful for the biggest what I call you know downturns depressions and the biggest stock crashes and this has happened every Ninety years since the industrial revolution caused the greatest boom in global\nHis lawn you know here we have had a couple of guests on who ah say very similar things to what you're saying the timing was off some of them said things were going to happen back last September or you know there was one the fellow who was talking about Jewish prophecy and he called it the ...\nOh yeah yeah I remember that guy and if I did or didn't happen it didn't happen then but it could happen now you're saying\nWell yeah I mean we we were the same position we're coming into a tree fell sixteen the marketed gone sideways for you were saying you know this looks like it made that finally Tom and then\nTrump got elected I mean we turned boys I mean when Trump\nHad that surprised when in the markets were had a two thousand point reversal from down nine hundred to eleven hundred just overnight and end of the morning I said look this is a river so\nThis is a tax cut coming in and all this sort of stuff this is going to extend this boom another year or two another twenty to thirty percent or more\nAnd that's what's happened but now we're on the other side of that now we've seen most of that\nUm and we're running out of tricks I mean what can you do now and the Democrats may when the house it looks likely\nPossibly the Senate but it's going to be much harder for Trump to push his gravy train for businesses it as the Democrats get more control and I see the economy falling apart by two thousand twenty at the latest and that\nThat's not going to win reelection I was just ...\nI don't think Trump gets reelected and he may not even make it we're tracking Watergate on a forty five year cycle almost to the tea\nWhich would say you're about to see the special prosecutor get fired up elections early next year and\nTrump could be in trouble by late next year so so are there were peaking now or at best Trump holds on and notice after we're going to peak late next year and see the greatest crash in history I don't see any other two options\nI don't see this bubble laughing path next to the end of next year but there is there's a fifty fifty chance it's happening now and you don't want to get hit by that for

done\n\n\nAnd welcome back to cruise to grocery done with us we'll get to your calls as well area within the can you predict dumped five years from now\n[noise] [noise] yes you know we can predict out decades I mean I was predicting this you know\nThe trouble and the economy started in two thousand eight back in the late eighties I'm just from the baby boom generation when they were predictably spent and when they would stop spending so yes what we\nSee is that the worst of this downturn in what we call the winter season that started in two thousand eight will be over a bout about probably about late two thousand twenty two for stocks\nUh two thousand twenty three for the economy will be the worst and and probably real estate out there maybe a little longer real estate takes longer to crash and longer to come back\nAnd then we'll start to see\nA global boom again from about twenty two thousand twenty three all the way into two thousand thirty six that'll be the next\nGlobal boom the differences George is that it will be concentrated as it has been thus far but even more so in Asia and especially in India and south east Asia most developed countries a lot of Europe Japan and East Asia have continued bad demographics in the United states is kind of the best house in a bad neighborhood\nOr where our demographics are we have a strong millennial generation but not as strong as the baby boom so we'll we'll be in the middle but yeah we can tell about when the economy will turn around and where it will be the strongest the other thing we the biggest Boston bubble burst already has been in commodities\nAnd things like oil and iron ore commodities are down Seventy percent it worse so far oil and iron ore eighty percent there's going to be another big commodity boom and bubble which will be driven by the emerging world and they're the biggest commodity producers\nAnd consumers they spent much more of their money there so you can buy these metals and things like that everything from gold\nTo iron ore and and and\nCopper and things like that there'll be an incredible boom and again you just wait for them to go down first so yeah the next\nBut between now and two thousand twenty two twenty three is going to be way more than a downside and after that the world starts to recover and again that's when you buy stuff into the only difference orange or just a real estate has a new factor this never had before because the baby boom was so large because older people\nWhen they die they are literally permanent shelters if you want to call it a real estate\nAnd more and more countries including the U.S today and massively in Japan\nAnd places like Germany there's more old people dying and selling homes than young people at the next generation coming in buying so\nWhen we adjust for that real estate is not going to come zooming back and a lot of countries like stocks will so and and of course the aging baby boom sectors like health care will do better than other sectors so in our newsletter which by the way people can get on our free newsletter by just going to Harry Dent dot com and that's going to be\nBest place to be the next year that that it's going to be different sectors the next boom is not going to pay for everything eighty three two thousand and seven everything went up the next boom is going to be more selective but there will be\nThe next global boom and and we can tell you when it's going to comment we can tell you about when it's going to peak\nEvery what happens if we ever regional war somewhere what's that going to do to to the economy\nWell you know wars are actually stimulate I've been a lot of ways especially if you're not fighting of people don't realize World War one\nWas the greatest gift ever given the United States Europe was at war and we were supplying them with everything from farm and commodity products to you know a transportation automobiles are tanks and everything we became a major exporter to Europe over that\nSo you know that goes both ways but wars tend to cause higher inflation\nWars disrupt things and and uh the great depression\nWas followed by World War two the disruption a around the world that makes people angry as we're seeing now and even worse this time and and when things get scarce and there was a fixed pie countries tend to fight over things we this trade war and we said this and the zero our book\nCame out a year ago this trade war with China and in in a global thing as well this is not just a short term thing and Jack Ma from LA Bob came out just a month ago and said this is going to take at least Twenty years to sort out\nThis is a major war between the leading to countries the U.S and China who's going to be king and that's why China China should be giving in more because Trump's right about this ... they need us or our trade is three times tilted towards them\nThis is going to hurt them more but it's more important to them because they're the up and coming and they don't want to get in too much because they see this is a long term battle and they think longer term so so I don't know if it's more a trade war but but there's certainly after this downturn coming out of this downturn [noise]\nThe the potential for wars around the world will tend to grow\nAnd that's where I go to Peter in ... Arizona did get things started with us I'm Peter\nHi hey thank you for taking my call this is great I'm sure they're going to be a bank holiday during the crash\nThat's an interesting question what do you think ...\nYeah yeah I mean that definitely tends to happen and and that's what happened in the great depression of course because people don't realize banks can lend up to ten times their reserves and guess what their reserves are ten percent of their deposits and whose money is that that's our money they're pledging they also tend to have you know capital they raise up to about ten percent\nSo so they're they're at risk or two but yes when when you get problem like this banking system will get in trouble especially when real estate goes down that we saw that in two thousand eight and nine forward and all of a sudden they don't have money now the new trick\nAnd then I'm I'm getting ready to go into a ... city tour in Australia is the big concern there because their housing bubbles already starting to crack a head of ours this time\nIs it banks in Cyprus just said well you know what we need money we're just going to wipe out of the the more affluent accounts were just going to take\nYou know ten twenty thirty forty fifty percent of their count and say look I'm Sorry we need this we're going to take your deposit and we're going to hurt them into equity and are dying bank who wants to equity in a dying bank\nSo this is in in in ... even in Australia that people are realizing\nThey're not supposed to do that but there's loopholes were in an emergency banks can do that so\nPeople have to worry you know you need to spread your money around I tell people all your access money other than you need to pay your bills should be in a brokerage account whether it's in a bank or a brokerage firm on on line from I I prefer firms that are not into lending that's why I like a lot of the online trading firms that have\nHave it in a brokerage account 'cause they can't borrow against that they can't swipe that but they can deposits in savings account so yes this can happen and people\nLost their deposits a lot of people there was a run on the banks this happens and and and and the magnitude of what I'm Talking about\nIs exactly when it happened doesn't happen in a normal recession like we've seen it started to happen in some countries the last global crisis it will happen big time in in in some countries worse than others\nNext stop we go to Keith in Rochester New York He's taken away\nOr Mr debt I Want to ask about Puerto Rico which was already Seventy three billion dollars in for the hurricane struck him because of all the corruption there which is the real reason why recovery has been slow\nThe former New York governor George Pataki is having to head a committee so that the bondholders\nGet their money back to questions I live in Rochester here were a lot of the Puerto Ricans believe it or not or ending up they are lower yield workers who are not finding work in us taxpayers are having to pay for their relief\nAnd the you're the first one to say that we're getting the better trained people laugh not happening up here ah in New York the former Empire State\nAnd secondly California which is not friendly to business when people leave the state\nThey insist on taking their short sighted left wing politics with them they go to places like Texas formerly all red state which is now only purple a to sum this up uh these people when they're left wing politics\nThey're spreading their disease all over the place or anti five the extreme left wing organization\nHas taken over Portland Ore than the official\nThere are lending\nAnti or run the city and like you to wrap up here a very conservative guy like me I'm saying flat out we're facing prove civil war\nAnd us conservatives are ready to fight and some of what you're saying makes sense but it's much more dire than they were going to be at each other's throats and a starting with the Puerto Rican example a and I'm going to say\nThis bluntly if I can too many Hispanics like black Americans vote democratic they will not give Republicans and conservatives the chance and and the same way that all all of these urban areas have been\nStruck dumb because of liberal democratic policies uh we're having them going to say this bluntly the non white people blacks and Hispanics they vote in a herd instincts Democrat\nThere's problems they're Middle East I don't see a major war between like say the United states or Europe and Russia there could be limited because nobody's big enough to challenge just the one advantage we have\nIs there's there is no counter bailing power that could really take us on one on one somebody hit us they would be dead long before we were so I think that's\nKind of a good thing we're in in the early Nineteen hundreds of Nineteen hundred no there were major countervailing power has how you could have World War two but we're gonna definitely have\nA political huge political views this trade war we said in zero hour before this became of it this is gonna last two to three decades exactly what Jack Ma just said and\nThere there could be some physical or but there's certainly\nGoing to be huge a political and trade wars and things\nLike rain here each day with us for coming back from final phone calls with you in just a

gonna have to have forgiveness these loans are going to have to be restructured all loans are going to have to be restructured um except for the most sovereign like U.S Treasury bonds and that may not be but but this is the key to going through this the countries that restructure their debt and we restructured massive\nOf private debt and the great depression it made a stronger coming out\nJapan never restructured any of their debt and they're in a coma economy forever even when they're next young generation is come along so I I my\nBet is that they're going to come to point we're going to have to say no we have to allow restructuring of student loans there too onerous we went to find that to me what happened the education establishment I'll even call it a mafia\nBasically overcharging had the greatest inflation next you know of any sector education even more than health care there on a run and win win that got too hard they say okay we can encourage student loans\nThen people can afford these higher prices we can keep our bubble going this bubble has burst and and and too many students are never going to be able to pay off his loan so when you have excess loans it's better to admit it just like a drug addict\nAnd then change policies and restructure detox I call it the leveraging go on we're gonna have to forgive or restructure down these student loans however it happens if it makes it changing in the rulings yes I I Would say that's highly likely in the next couple of years\nIn two thousand eight hearing I saw one way to bail out everything would be to give people like a hundred thousand dollars in a voucher to buy some good ... what do you think\nWhat will hit the I don't like money printing except in emergencies like I think they should have done money printing quantitative easing for the first year in two thousand I like they did just to make sure the banking system doesn't just melt down like it did rapidly in the great depression but to put it on\nA permanent quantitative easing just perverts the entire system is bad but the second thing I always said if you're going to print money don't give it to the damn banks\nWho got us in trouble and did all this leverage and\nAnd the rivers and all this crazy stuff in the first place just sin if you know send period to to to get us out of the at least send the money to everyday people send them a check I wouldn't say that but if they just sent everybody at twenty five every household at twenty thousand dollar check\nThat would have done a lot better for the economy and then in that that would help banks cause things wouldn't have been as bad for the economy but it would have helped people instead of the banking system this whole bailout this whole quantitative easing has only made\nWall Street stronger only made the rich richer is only benefitted corporate including these tax cuts and has not benefited main steal\nThe reason why I wanted it as a volunteer as opposed to check the ... because I wanted them to be forced to spend it rambling them but you\nKnow right if they don't spend it or they got you're right that that's much better way the point is to get every day people some relief and and have them spend that money or to stimulate the economy and then that helps that you know businesses and banks and everything but it should have gone to the people and not to the damn banks\nNext up we're going to Harry in Port Huron hello Harry Good to have you\nKnow hello there George and that area of that question you mentioned earlier about the bank and you can't just now but uh the taking the money I'm wiping my what about credit unions are they going to be doing the same thing or what's what's up with those\nOkay I I Would much rather have my money in a credit union than a than a money center bank\nBecause that's where all the leverage has been it was kind of opposite of the great depression a lot of people a lot a lot of the problems worse farms were over expanding\nAnd borrowing money and those were in more rural areas and that's where the trouble is and it was rural banks going under more than the money center by this is totally money center bank thing\nAnd and also when you do a bank if governments have takes brokerage money or pull ... they're going to do for the more fluent towns and those going to be in the in the bigger money center banks so I'd much rather have my money and a credit union\nThan you know bank of America or Wells Fargo or ... or city bank and stuff like that\nOkay let's take a call or two before we wrap things up with Harry Dent Hi Barbara in North Carolina\nRight okay thank you\nAnd I think here I just think that part of one of my question is why I asked\nA direct than I Am one of my way around ... why oh why oh why oh hey humiliate ... combat can line\nRight yup play all about timing\nIt all of that time one of my guiding the looming psychology I'm hearing that you just answered my question like about the smaller amount so my hearing income that much\nUm I don't have to worry about that so much and I'm a larger account hold her is that what I understand\nYes I mean if they're gonna have to restructure Social Security there's certainly going to take the benefits off of a larger\nAccounts and more affluent people first I mean the everyday person is going to be more protected and whatever's scenario\nAnd bank insurance agree that they can insured deposits and they can insure them all that's all right oh deposits are insured they can ensure everything if you have a major club but the smaller accounts it'd be spread out a few accounts and you have more money and your brokerage accounts which they can't get at\nYes you're going to be way less vulnerable than and what happened in Cyprus it was a lot of rich Russians that had big accounts those were the biggest losers those were the ones they hit and of course when\nWhen things go bad people gonna hit foreign deposit there's more Iceland went down and basically stiffed all the foreign depositors and foreign loans and protected their own people so yes the smaller towns domestic accounts\nAre going to be safer but again\nI still say have as much as your money in a\nProtected account and your name that is not just the general deposit they lend against those deposits in real estate loans and business loans go back there going against your deposits but if you have a brokerage account with your stocks or bonds or cash in it they can't\nPay they can't pledge doses reserves\nAnd well that's a good thing Harry thank you were on a time Harry's website it comes to ... dot com next psychiatrist looks at the paranormal\n\n[noise]\nMy name is Joe Tom I'm twenty nine years old and they have a career that I Love is a

or a novelist experiences visions breed cognitive dreams out of body experiences encounters with message ... says well welcome to the program Dr many meters on coast to coast Dr welcome to the show I'm looking forward to this\nThanks for inviting me\nVery interesting that the somebody with your medical and psychiatric background would be so heavily involved in the paranormal and how did that all happened for you was the near death experiences that started it\nWell I think it was because I almost died so many times you know when my book the borders of normal first came out many people asked me if the book was based on stories with my patients had told me that my aunt was always no not at all because whatever patient tells the doctor is confidential\nDoctors bound by the Hippocratic Oath states that are doctors should not be Pete anything he's told by patience and I don't so the material in my book was based entirely on my own personal experiences\nPlus stories from my readers and for my audiences and from family and friends and from my own extensive reading research into the paranormal in terms of why I have these experiences I think it is related to the fact that I had so many close calls with that so many ... that [noise] um you know\nThere's been a lot of literature written about near death experience mhm\n[noise] but the um term near death experience\nYou know it's going back to talk to him and moody in Nineteen Seventy five so that's over forty years ago that's right I think he estimated that something like one thirty Americans that they had a near death experience or know someone who has had one and that's a large group of people\nBut there's an even larger group of people who have almost died but never would pronounce clinically dead and never had the typical near death experience\nBut when I look at how my close brushes with death effected me I see that I have some of the things after the effects that Dr moody described in his patients who had a classic near death experience\nIn other words I'm having had all these close calls this death I tend to have a deeper appreciation of life and I I also have overcome my fear of dying and I have found get myself a shift from materialism into spirituality and then they an increased need to find meaning and purpose in life\nWas that a pretty dramatic shift for you\nKnow not at all I I Would say was gradual the first couple of paranormal experiences I had I was quite young and I honestly I didn't think anything of that might just kind of ... the ... you know\nI just thought well that was weird but I didn't tell anyone about them because I didn't think anyone would believe me and in those days no one talked about those experiences because there was no rational way to explain them\nBut then as time went on and I got more and more of these experiences and then when I went to a um a life threatening illness and and came out on the other side thanks to a stem cell transplant from an anonymous donor\nOh jeez well yeah that was that was quite dramatic um that at that point I felt like I Need to share what I've been going through because that would help other people\nIn the ... stem cell transplant so why didn't they let's harvest stem cells from yourself\n[noise] [noise] well that's one way of doing it but the the um anonymous stem cells donated pollen allergen it transplant mhm\nWas more effective they actually found someone on the worldwide ... computer I just feel like I'm the owner bank and they found his name on the computer and he was a perfect match for me\nAlthough super ... what was what was wrong if you want to get into that\nOh sure well I had leukemia ... um\nYeah and I had it for many years well actually I had leukemia for sixteen years and I was in the hospital I had numerous um five transfusions numerous courses of chemotherapy and then finally the doctor said we can't keep giving you a chemotherapy because it's doing tremendous damage to your body\nYou was it was still in remission\n[noise] well you have to be in the mission in order to receive a transplant so they gave me chemotherapy um and I was in remission but then I Would keep having relapses and that fight against that they gave me the parents find\nHuh [noise] now that the person who gave me the transplant she was an anonymous donor that the rule at the time was that actually when you I was allowed to contact him if he agreed to be contact mhm\nAnd I did write to him just to thank him for his generosity and I found out that he was in the he's the ... was the name of the U.S navy\nAnd when his name came up on the computer he was stationed on an aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf wow so he was flown back into the donors sent from Washington DC and the team from the city where I live flew down to Washington and took a sample of his themselves and then flew back my city\nAnd that's what happened and that was eight years ago and I've been fine of ...\nHave you still in touch with him the death happened\nYes um I actually met him in in DC and we kept in touch and we've become friends\nThat's amazing you saved your life\nHe did I can thank him enough he did save my life\nAnd they hear altruism you know he said the way it came about was um [noise] they were having a donor to drive and one of the bases where he was stationed and he just got in line with his buddies and all is required is itchy swab\n... that's it yeah it just it takes time to get the DNA so that's when his name entered the donor bank\nAnd then I'm ... years later by name came up on the computer and at that point he's even forgotten that he had agreed to be a donor\n[noise] but then once you know we found out that he was a perfect match for me and he was flown back to the ... center in DC they gave him some injections to stimulate his bone marrow would produce more stem cells\nAnd they gave me the injection for five days and then he had produced enough themselves so they took a blood sample which contain to stem cells and that was what was brought back to where I live in but yes we've become friends and I just I'm not too long ago\nDr ... the fact that you are dabbling so heavily into the psychic realm has that help or hurt your psyche has your practice [noise]\n[noise] well I tried to keep the two things separate I mean you know in terms of the psychiatric patients generally they don't talk about paranormal experiences they have you know serious mental disorders that they need help with and that's why they come to the psychiatrist [noise] however since ...\nHave that experience in psychiatry I'm able to help people distinguish between what's his psychic experience and much a psychotic experience\nRight and and and there's a big difference here\nWell absolutely there is a big difference I mean sometimes if a person the something or here's something they don't know what it is they think they're losing their mind but in fact these types of experiences are quite common\nYou know for example um if someone is believed if they've lost it I'm a spouse or a child quite often will be some type of post death contact with the deceased loved one\nSo let's say a widow might see her deceased has been in her bedroom at night and she may talk to him or she might feel we've touched on her shoulder or something like that\nAnd these experiences are quite common in fact one study showed that up to fifty percent of people who've lost of of a left alone will have some type of post death contact with a loved one\nEven if a person has no belief in an afterlife and many of them don't I mean these these types of experiences are not related to religious beliefs or belief in an afterlife\nUm in in fact you know an atheist and nice to have these experiences while as religious people\nSee that everyone is like you and I I tend to believe you can agree with you\nOK but\nUh when you said that ... what's the basis for them what makes you say that\n[noise] well the thing is the word psyche covers a lot of territory you know includes things such as ESP or telepathy or Pete cognitive beams and other things you talk to both touches stations and voices and so on death that vision is near death experiences\nSo certain types of fake experiences such as ESP\nUntil after the extremely common and a lot of people have experienced that type of thing um for example someone phones you and you're thinking about that person then you say oh you must be ... that was just thinking about\nYou right was that very common um and I think everyone has the ability\nIf they're interested to nurture their intuition or their ESP or they have a path a fence but a lot of people aren't interested in it as I said when I first had these experiences myself I just kind of brush them off I didn't think too much of them\nWas really only after I got sick that I start to think that maybe there was more to it than meets the eye\nWith with the psychic roam out there in the ability to tap into it have you found that certain people are better rather than the others\nYes definitely um well I think the most important thing is whether the person is interested in it and whether or not they are paying attention to it but the other thing I've noticed is that the second ability often runs in families\nAnd then once the ... state the Centers for giving random images and they told the country it on the images I Try to send them to any secrets and they found that people were more susceptible to lead to telepathy when they're asleep\nAnd it's also true that people are more susceptible to like the when they were under hypnosis so there are ways to augment leprosy but\nIn my case and in most people's cases it just happens spontaneously\nDo you have a lot of patients that have these abilities\n[noise] no I wouldn't say so\nAll right stay with us Dr we're going to take a quick break we'll be back with the more Dr Mandy majors with us his book the

back with Dr many major U.S we're talking about his work the borders of normal a clinical psychiatrist de stigmatize per normal phenomenon many let's talk a little bit about the death bed visions and your thoughts about that though you believe they're extremely common don't you\n[noise] that's right a lot of studies have shown that it's it's very common for someone who is dying to see a deceased friend or relative\nUm that actually happened with my dad when he was in the hospital he saw his late sister he mentioned oh they're so until you mentioned her name she was out in the hall and there was one study that was done in a hospice\nWith dying patients and they found a lot of these patients I'm said\nSomeone who is coming to take them and they called they didn't call them vision they called them visitors and as they got closer to death is visitors became more frequent and these visitors are these visions weren't disturbing at all they were very comforting [noise]\nWho's giving them the ...\nThat's the question like where's this message coming from [noise] you know we can we can speculate you know we can say it's coming from the unconscious or we could say it's coming from something they've added or we can say it's coming from the spirit\nWorld you know but some of these\nMessages for example this woman I mentioned who had the dream that should be killed in a terrorist attack where would that be coming from that could have been her fear\nMhm you know um\nAnd maybe it was just a coincidence that somehow when something like that happens it seems to be more than a coincidence\nNews there was a movie about to a group of people government people who tried to enter the date of other government to leaders\nTo to assassinate them and you know the wanted them to die of heart attacks and they were going to put fear into their dreams and stuff like that do you think that really might be going on many\nWell that reminds me of the collapse of the studies that they mentioned that were being conducted at my monitor these medical center in New York because I think people can be more susceptible to telepathy I don't know while they're dreaming while they're asleep I don't know to the point of\nGetting having making someone to have a heart attack I don't know if that would be possible if that's ever been done\nWell who knows when people die in their sleep what caused right that's\nRight that's right because you know I sort of take the position that anything is possible you know and I think that's possible although\nWe don't really know and that and how how did we know it's right you know um so yeah\nThat could be pretty remarkable\n[noise] yeah I was also talking about messages in dreams 'cause I've also had that experience where I received a message but it wasn't um wasn't a pre cognitive gene was just a message and I didn't even know what to make of it but I remember that just clear as day when I woke up\nThis is the message I got I I just saw these words it said this is a world of illusion and the biggest illusion is time\nDidn't Caesar's wife have a premonition about the ides of march\n[noise] that's right in fact she dreamt the night before he just tells you that he was going to be assassinated\nShe begged him not to go to the Senate he ignored who plays also with ... told Julius Caesar it'd be where the ides of march which is the fifteenth of march and he he north ... ignored his wife and he was killed so yeah that was a very strong premonition premonition is usually a warning\nHow many people don't act on their promotions do maybe\nI'd say probably the majority I Would agree because I don't think people believe them they don't believe they're intuition\nAnd then they do the water should go after the fact\nExactly and how many times has that happened I Know that said the majority of people don't pay attention to it because they they\nThink well we live in a you know scientific rational society and we need to think of things rationally and they did the guard things which could be dismissed that superstition is always the fear of being labeled superstition\nThere was a a movie called let it ride with Richard ... was about horse racing and oh yeah one of his friends apparently really understood who's gonna win the race but didn't bet on that horse spent on something else and lost\nIn ... in the movie screaming at you knew you knew you knew that is a little like not acting on your premonition\nYeah for sure that is yeah and you wonder why I think in theory\nI think people are they don't believe in\nThey don't believe in alpha they were afraid of getting into something which appears irrational\nTell me a little bit about blind people in a obese and things like that\nWell that that's very interesting story because\nThere have been any parts of blind patients who've been blind since birth will have another body during during surgery\nAnd then when they ah we have from the anesthesia and they wake up a book to tell the doctors and nurses are what they thought and what they heard while they were out of their bodies with one patient with blind who when he returned to his body after the surgery was able to describe the color and the patent on his\nDoctor pie and quite the doctor was founded there was another case for the blind patients who left his body during surgery I think no he was he was wasn't surgery he had a cardiac arrest\nAnd they took out his dentures and he left his body and ended up serving everything that was going on and then when he when he be covered and they couldn't find where she put it that you\nAnd he wanted his teeth back right you have you\nBack but then then that said I don't know I put them and he said well when I was out of my body I fire you put them in that there are over there and she open that door and sure enough there\nThey were they were wow yeah it works it would work yeah\nWhat what have you learned many about all of this what do you think it is\n[noise] I think well I think that there's a spiritual component like I have to say that\nYou do I do and you don't think it's paranormal\nWell I think it's related to the I think it's ... I think it's paranormal and I think it's virtual I mean there's certain words that are used to describe these experiences are these phenomena some people call them fake people call them paranormal\nSome people call them spiritual or anomalous or Mexico their mysterious Israel different words of being used to describe the same event but I think paranormal\nYou then can have a spiritual component yeah but I'm not saying every paranormal event but some do of course it depends on the person having experience how they want to interpret it or what they want to how they want to think about it\nDo you think science should do a better job investigating these things\n[noise] [noise] oh definitely I think it improves the quality of life for people to feel like there is something more out there that we don't have to live in nine to five eight you know day to day lives that if something more than we don't really know about and I think it should be explored\nUp next when we come back with Dr many make this we're going to take phone calls your calls you your stories about pretty cognitive dreams and so many of the things\nYou've heard us talk about here on the coast to coast

sea no cleanup begins on jak Callahan Fox News this monster storm devastated the Gulf Coast enter panhandle orders governor Rick Scott heal the devastation caused by hurricane Michael so many families have lost everything\n[noise]\nOkay well come back to our final hour with Dr many ... we're talking about his work the borders of normal as a psychiatrist in you do have to decide whether a person is truly experiencing a psychic issue or is a psychotic how do you tell the difference Manny\n[noise] well the thing is if someone has a vision for example or someone hearing voices hitting a quality that would distinguish the psychic psychotic experience example of someone here though boy I'm\nA psychotic ... nation tends to be very very frightening it's also a frequent it could be everyday auditory hallucination could also be other things besides boy\nIt could be hounded machinery and in fact it may\nMore than one voice to the voices talking to each other about the earth and it might be a accusatory or threatening where I'm taking a leaf nation and can be ... feet when\nThey may occur only one had probably in a lifetime and they tend to be a reassuring and climbing yeah the thing is with fake ... you can't just say one thing to hearing a voice you have to look at the whole earth and because\nIt's like whoa major mental disorder which affect me\nBill easy to function in society whether the person as a student or whether they're going to work or within the family if they're\nIf they're not able to function and if they have a lot of other symptoms aside from the least nation for example the thought disorder or paranoid id Asian or you know feelings have ...\n... people are talking about them this type of thing so there's more than just one symptom that you need to make a diagnosis of psychosis\nAnd you make a misdiagnosis ... conceivable\nYes in fact it has happened there is a psychologist that did it and experiment where he had a group of eight people including himself and he had to each one of them go to a different emergency room and had different hospitals around the country and it tells the doctor in the emergency room that they were hearing voices and in each case\nThe patients well they weren't patients they were actors pretending to be patient but they were misdiagnosed as it gets ... there were admitted to the word they were given medication they didn't take\nMedication and once they got the where the patients knew that they were faking so\nThey were able to fool the doctors but they weren't able to fool the other patients\nPatients knew how do they know\nWell because these people were otherwise normal aside from the fact that they said they were hearing voices in terms of their appearance their behavior that conversation the way they were thinking the way they presented themselves everything else about them is completely normal so that's why I say you can make a diagnosis on the basis of a single symptom\nHow come to the doctors could do that well unfortunately you know sometimes doctors make mistakes well that's true [laughter] but but the patients that I think because well the patients live with it they they know the illness so well they know the symptoms and everything that's right\nAll right let's take some calls for your duty in the Ozarks in Missouri hey Judy go ahead\nThank you so much for taking my call waiting and waiting to talk to someone who knows a little bit about the brain are a lot about brain I have been a mistake in had visions all my life and I have that many many near death experiences where I have left my body\nBut I think one of the most interesting things that ever happened to me is when I went to London as an adult\nAnd I saw a picture of the war room where they did all the major planning for their European front ... well that's where I used to go and out of body experience when I was little and there were a whole bunch of us up\nUp above kind of sitting like in the balcony and we were all in spirit\nNot who's ... and they were very upset because I was so young and they didn't think I should be easy\n[laughter] would you do that as a remote viewing huh\nNo I ... I was out of the body travel and when I saw the picture of the war room I realize that's where I had been as a child\nAbuse still been able to duplicate that\nWell not lately I usually go where there's really intense suffering like when the Israeli\nPeople and we were fighting on the along with sewage canal yeah what was that the fifty seven more Nineteen sixty seven sixty seven yeah um\nI I go to places that are are really really\nBad why I don't know whether I'm there to help balance\nWhat do you what do you think of as many\nWell I'm curious to know do you have these experiences when you're sleeping or when you were when\nWhen I was little they were when I've been sleeping all the other ones where I've been out of body I'm just waking up okay between sleep in and awake but it's the most interesting experience I think I've ever had\nIs what I was looking searching for meaning because I was very depressed\nBecause I'm In physical form and there is no we're on\nThe love that you feel when you were in that particular place of knowing what all the companies seem love is and when I was during meditation or we've taken and\nI could see if you know what glitter looks like in a in a like a a helmet for a motorcycle helmet yes how different angles\nWell this was alive light and the whole screen of my vision was filled with his glittering beautiful different colors of orange and yellow\nAnd I could hear the voice saying this is love and I was\nTo totally engulfed in it and it was just a beautiful experience but\nI found listening to people talk about near death experiences mine near death experiences aren't when ...\nI'm Out of my body and I'm seeing what's going on and I the last time it happened I was in surgery and as I came back into my body I could hear the the anesthesiologist saying we're losing her and I thought\nYou were saying I'm back here yeah All right [laughter] but ...\nYou know that type of stuff and that's the reason I I called was the question about what is the difference between schizophrenia and having these types of visions because I'd been up\nAll right so that's that's kind of a fine line isn't it many\nWell yes and no like I said with had study where these patients were misdiagnosed\nBecause they reported hearing voices but otherwise they were fine so the question is whether the person can carry on with their daily life or whether they're able to function or whether\nIs an illness that's interfering with their life so it you can make a diagnosis just on the basis of the fact that person is hearing voices are having other body experiences that would lead to a diagnosis of schizophrenia\nSomeone with a diagnosis gets feeding it has to have a thought disorder as well they have to have problems with their thinking and with their emotions and you know with their parents with their behavior it's all encompassing so the types of description the description of the type that experiences you you've had doesn't sound like schizophrenia to me\nWhat about ... nations compared to actual psychic things which the person they're\nWell there again like police nations can be found in a lot of different medical conditions not just schizophrenia and it can also be released nations and also be found in people who are mentally and physically healthy\nSo you know I guess ... each person has to be assessed you know in terms of you know what their symptoms are and and you know how how much they're affecting that person's ability to function [noise] but I was just going to say about your caller I was thinking maybe one of the reasons she goes to places when she's out of her body she goes to places of pain in the\nDark and places that are dark maybe he's trying to help maybe in some way she's thinking on a on a spiritual level she can help these people\nYou think she's doing it on purpose\nI think so I think there must be a reason why she's going to those places\nTo go to Joe in Monterey, California Hey Joe ... go ahead\n[noise] a nine to charge a duck the matters\nOr you're a breath of fresh air and let me tell you thank you um [noise] I have a a two questions and I have a really interesting experience

spiritual emergency or all the states he's a psychiatrist by the way yes\nDefinitely I'm familiar with Dr growth in terms of psychic fairs I don't put a psychic votes but I have attended um international confidence is on science and spirituality and I do find that when I'm with like minded individuals are these types of experiences are more common\nYeah that that I could see that

take the future and they have all kinds of psychic abilities which they never had before\nNext up let's go to Gary in Monterey, California Hi Jerry go ahead\nHi uh I like their practices 'cause uh I'm a skeptical person and uh I've got to agree to a couple of degrees and says it and I taught a physics engineering for years so I'm kind of a you know that kinda gosh you're however\nUh I had a dream that seem to come true uh many years ago when I was in my thirties and a ... and ... and it says a ... that's disturbing you know our view of space and time\nAh right now it doesn't seem to allow information flow backward in time so I thought I Would make myself an experimental subject\nAnd I tried for a year to a record my dream and his first I tried a member of the seventies\nThe portable tape recorders are kind of clunky mhm and uh and to record you'd have to hit two buttons I drink like record and play at the same time right right\nYeah so it turns out that was a nightmare like getting up at three in the morning and trying to hit those buttons so I went back to just writing things down on paper and of course then the problem is uh getting yourself up out of a drain I figured that method for that that took me some of them were reliable\nOne night I had a very unusual dream or it doesn't seem unusual ally ... and then I decided but what happened later will be interesting and what it was as a as a I was in a situation where I'm sitting with two other people and we're sitting outside it's some kind of a table\nAnd we're enjoying ourselves having like lunch or something and the one person in the mail and I feel very very close to him I'm comfortable with him and then there's a woman and I don't know her and uh at one point\nThe the nail says uh and we're outside some kind of a format outside I like you know couldn't figure out the map but anyway he says I'm a dairy I have to go to the bathroom you know where it is\nAnd I said no you know I Do too we were had been drinking a cup of the line I thought I Do too\nAnd so uh yeah let's go look for it and and the dream we have to walk up a rock side but some kind of structure outside with all of a couple of steps and then there's another walkway going both ways more cables and then with a couple of them just like many level and finally I said oh look a there is the bathroom down there\nAnd so I'm walking ahead a and the and the dream\nAnd I get to the door and I pushed to the bathroom door open\nAnd there and I'm trying to not be grossed about this but there I see something unusual and what it was is in men's rooms have toilets of course we're you know the doors closing and you're going to vote and then they have you're All right someone\nHad in urine all gone number two\nI mean in other words [laughter] so I stopped in my tracks and and he ran it can be the cello and my parents and he said what are you doing and I said oh\nAh somebody just as something really awful in here and he said what and he ... them and uh at that point\nI had a lot of foreign students I taught in college we recruited all over the middle east and uh and and the Pacific region in Asia Japan and a lot of foreign students in my physics classes\nAnd so I said well you know maybe it's a person from another culture if we didn't understand and you know he thought that was the place to go to the bathroom and you know [noise] okay so I wake up\nAnd I thought that's a weird written I'm going to write that down in some detail\nWell I thought well okay so that's like on a Monday I'm almost out of time here so I got to push a\nCouple of days later I get it from an old friend of mine is how we were roommates were good friends for four years\nAnd Gary I might be a saffron I'm In Monterey I'll be in San Francisco later this

I've never I mean is this there was no common sense no rationality it was just\nPolitical partisanship and the people the Republicans hated the Democrats for attacking this guy and the Democrats hated the Republicans for defending him and in installing this thing and cutting I mean this is like\nI mean and and and who's got all the guns in the world we do so so this is really\nI think that that social unrest in this downturn\nIs going to top the great depression where it was more people roaming around in their cars and not having housing\nAnd no jobs and soup lines this is going to be different people the the blue and the red extremes are going to blame each other for the crisis to Republican and say you damn Democrats let all this debt run up and all this you know free money and stuff\nAnd the and the Democrats are and say Republicans you didn't let us stimulate on up and blah blah blah blah blah and and and they're gonna hate each other and and so I I think that's going to be the worst part of this\nThat we really and and and I really think there's a possibility that there's going to be movements in this time or in the civil war I compare there's more to the civil war\nOn the social political level at that time the south seceded from the more industrial an urbanized north they were totally different I mean the north was blue the south has read this time\nEspecially with Republicans in charge now I think there's going to be fact I think\nStates like California or the whole west coast or the whole northeast is going to threaten to succeed plumb the red states because they can't agree on anything there's nothing that can be agreed on his cabinet shop thing was the perfect example that no middle ground\nIt's either red or blue you know\nAnd his argument and its arguments in hatred in the Internet or on both sides\nAnd and even you know the Democrats are always a nice guy I Know that Democrats are jumping up and down and women you know almost assaulting you know ... senators and in the elevator and stop this ... every body yeah there's a very high tensions and\nI tell ya I don't feel that here and it's another advantage to being Puerto Rican I'm kinda like watching on the sidelines to see what happens and then if I Do decide to move back to Florida where I'd probably move 'em\nBack to 'cause we're familiar there and know everybody you know I I Will do it when I can buy a condo there for a quarter of the price\nAnd and and and and but I Want to see what happens first and and the thing about the next year also George's this is this is when it's going to you know it's going to happen or not it it's either starting to happen now or or the latest by my calculations with every cycle we have an everything we got her I suppose\nIt's going to start by late next year and that's going to be a Ninety year anniversary of the greatest\nStock crash in modern history Nineteen twenty nine to thirty two and that is one of many of our cycles we cover in zero our\nIn our news letters than Ninety year cycle is the most powerful for the biggest what I call you know downturns depressions and the biggest stock crashes and this has happened every Ninety years since the industrial revolution cause the greatest boom and global\nHis lawn you know here we had a couple of guests on who ah say very similar things to what you're saying the timing was off some of them said things were going to happen back last September a news one the fellow who was talking about Jewish prophecy and he called it the ...\nOh yeah yeah I remember that guy and it didn't happen it didn't happen then but you could happen now you're saying\nWell yeah I mean we were in the same position we were coming into a two thousand sixteen the marketed gone sideways for you were saying you know this looks like it made that finally Tom and then\nTrump got elected I mean we turned boys I mean when Trump had that surprise when and the markets were had a two thousand point reversal from down nine hundred to eleven hundred just overnight and end of the morning I said look this is a river so\nThis is a tax cut coming in and all this sort of stuff this is going to extend this boom another year or two another twenty to thirty percent or more\nAnd that's what's happened but now we're on the other side of that now we've seen most of that um and we're running out of tricks I mean what can you do now and the Democrats may when the house it looks likely\nPossibly the Senate but it's going to be much harder for Trump to push his gravy train for businesses it as the Democrats get more control and I see the economy falling apart by two thousand twenty at the latest and that's\nThat's not going to win reelection I was just ...\nI don't think Trump gets reelected and he may not even make it we're tracking Watergate on a forty five year cycle almost to the tea\nWhich would say you're about to see the special prosecutor get fired after elections early next year and\nTrump could be in trouble by late next year so so either were peaking now or best Trump polls on and no disaster we're going to peak late next year and see the greatest crash in history I don't see any other two options\nI don't see this bubble lasting pass next to the end of next year but there there is a fifty fifty chance it's happening now and you don't want to get hit by that for forty\nPursue we know what's happening with overnight stocks I mean can you tell what could happen when the when the clock opens tomorrow\nYes yes uh China went down a little bit and China made the biggest was the only stock market that violated a critical point yesterday it went down some more but came back up to even but it's still\nViolated but the U.S markets looked like the Dow is going to open up two to three hundred points tomorrow now that's minor compared to fourteen hundred points over just the last\nNight that you stay with us we're going to come right back

we can predict out decades I mean I was predicting this you know\nThe trouble in the economy starting in two thousand eight back in the late eighties I'm just from the baby boom generation when they would predictably spent and when they would stop spending so yes what we see\nIs it the worst of this downturn in what we call the winter season that started in two thousand eight will be over a bout about probably about late two thousand twenty two for stocks uh two thousand twenty three for the economy will be the worst\nAnd and probably real estate out there maybe a little longer real estate takes longer to crash and longer to come back\nAnd then we'll start to see\nA global boom again from about twenty two thousand twenty three all the way into two thousand thirty six that'll be the next\nGlobal boom the differences George is that it will be concentrated as it has been thus far but even more so in Asia and especially in India and Southeast Asia most developed countries a lot of Europe Japan and East Asia have continued bad demographics of the United states has kind of the best house and the bad neighborhood\nOr where our demographics are we have a strong millennial generation but not as strong as the baby boom so we'll we'll be in the middle but yeah we can tell about when the economy will turn around and where it will be the strongest the other thing we the biggest Boston bubble burst already has been in commodities\nAnd things like oil and iron ore commodities are down Seventy percent it worse so far oil and iron ore eighty percent there's going to be another big commodity boom and bobble which will be driven by the emerging world and they're the biggest commodity producers\nAnd consumers they spent much more of their money and so you can buy these metals and things like that everything from gold\nTo iron ore and and and\nCopper and things like that and there'll be an incredible boom and again you just wait for them to go down first so yeah the next but between now and two thousand twenty two twenty three\nIs going to be way more on the downside and after that the world starts to recover and again that's when you buy stuff into the only on George is a real estate has a new factor this never had before because the baby boom was so large because older people\nWhen they die they are literally permanent shelters if you want to call it a real estate\nAnd more and more countries including the U.S today and massively in Japan\nAnd places like Germany there's more old people dying and selling homes than young people at the next generation coming in buying so when we just for that real estate is not going to come zooming back and a lot of countries like stocks will so and and of course the aging baby boom sectors like health care will do better than other sector so\nIn our newsletter which by the way people can get on our free newsletter by just going to Harry Dent dot com and that's going to be best place to be the next year that that it's going to be different sectors the next boom is not going to favor everything eighty three two thousand and seven everything went up the next boom is going to be more selective but there will be\nThe next global boom and and we can tell you when it's going to come and we can tell you about when it's going to peak\nEvery what happens if we ever regional war more what's that going to do to the economy\nWell you know wars are actually stimulate I've been a lot of ways especially if you're not fighting of people don't realize World War one\nWas the greatest gift ever given the United States Europe was at war and we were supplying them with everything from farm and commodity products to you know a transportation automobiles are tanks and everything we became a major exporter to Europe over that\nSo you know that goes both ways but wars tend to cause higher inflation\nWars disrupt things and and uh the great depression\nWas followed by World War two the disruption a around the world and that makes people angry as we're seeing now an even worse this time and then when things get scarce and there's a fixed pie countries tend to fight over things we've this trade war and we said this and is zero our book\nCame out a year ago this trade war with China and in in a global thing as well this is not just a short term thing and Jack Ma from LA Bob came out just a month ago and said this is going to take at least Twenty years to sort out\nThis is a major war between the leading to countries the U.S and China who's going to be king and that's why China China should be giving in more because Trump's right about this ... they need us or our trade is three times tilted towards them\nThis is going to hurt them more but it's more important to them because they're the up and coming in there don't want to get in too much because they see this is a long term battle and they think longer term so so I don't know if it's more a trade war but but there's certainly after this downturn coming out of this downturn [noise]\nThe the potential for war is around the world will tend to grow\nThat's where I go to Peter and cotton wood Arizona to get things started with us I'm Peter\nHi hey thank you for taking my call this is great I'm sure they're going to be a bank holiday during the crash\nThat's an interesting question what do you think\nYeah I mean that definitely tends to happen and and and that's what happened in the great depression of course because people don't realize banks can lend up to ten times their reserves and guess what their reserves are ten percent of their deposits and whose money is that that's our money they're pledging they also tend to have you know capital they raise up to about ten percent [noise]\nSo so they're they're at risk it too but yes when when you get problem like this banking system will get in trouble especially when real estate goes down that we saw that in two thousand eight nine forward and all of a sudden they don't have money now the new trick\nAnd then I'm I'm getting ready to go into a ... city tour in Australia and it's a big concern there because their housing bubbles already starting to crack a head of ours this time\nIs it banks in Cyprus just said well you know what we need money we're just going to wipe out of the the more affluent accounts were just going to take you know ten twenty thirty forty fifty percent of their count and say look I'm Sorry we need this\nWe're gonna take your deposit and we're going to hurt them into equity in our dying bank who wants to equity in a dying bank\nSo this is in in in even in Australia that people are realizing\nThey're not supposed to do that but there's loopholes were in an emergency bank can do that so\nPeople have to worry you know you need to spread your money around I tell people all your access money other than you need to pay your bills should be in a brokerage account whether it's in a bank or a brokerage firm or an on line from I I prefer firms that are not into lending that's why I like a lot of the online trading firms that have\nHave it in a brokerage account 'cause they can't borrow against that they can't swipe that but they can deposits in savings account so yes this can happen to people\nLost their deposits a lot of people there was a run on the banks this happens in in in in the magnitude of what I'm Talking about is exactly what had happened doesn't happen in a normal recession like we've seen it started to happen in some countries the last global crisis\nIt will happen big time and and in some countries worse than others\nAnd that's something we go to Keith in Rochester New York He's taken away\nA Mr debt I Want to ask about Puerto Rico which was already Seventy three billion dollars in ... for the hurricanes struck him because of all the corruption there which is the real reason why the recovery has been slow\nThe former New York governor George Pataki is having had a committee so that the bondholders\nGet their money back to questions I live in Rochester here where a lot of the Puerto Ricans believe it or not or ending up they are lower skilled workers who are not finding work in us taxpayers are having to pay for their relief\nAnd uh the you're the first one to say that we're getting the better trained people last not happening up here ah in New York former Empire State\nAnd secondly California which is not friendly to business when people bleed state they insist on taking their short sighted left wing politics with them they go to places like\nTexas formerly all red state which is now only purple a to sum this up ah these people with their left wing politics they're spreading their disease all over the place\nUh anti five the extreme left wing organization has taken over Portland Ore than the officials there are ...\nAnti run the city and like you to wrap it up here a very conservative guy like me I Am saying flat out we're facing prove civil\nWar and us conservatives are ready to fight and some of what you're saying makes sense but it's much more dire than they were going to be at each other's throats and a starting\nWith that Puerto Rican example a and I'm going to say\nThis bluntly if I can too many Hispanics like black Americans vote democratic they will not give Republicans and conservatives the chance and and the same way that all all of these urban areas have been\nStruck dumb because of liberal democratic policies uh we're having them going to say this bluntly the non white people blacks and Hispanics they vote you know heard instinct Democrat and because not too many of them vote Republican and conservative we're heading for dire times\nAnd a day or two you know with electro magnetic off its cetera what is the probability of a shooting war\nYou know I think that's much more likely between emerging countries like India and Pakistan I'm there but what we're saying and zero hour we we trade global trade back to the Eighteen hundreds and there was a big surge in World War one people don't realize globalization global trade collapse sixty\nPercent between World War one\nAnd World War two with the great depression in the middle with a big trade war with rising tariffs just like we're seeing now everything's happening like happened that this works ... it's it everybody does the selfish thing of the country but it works against the whole everybody loses or at least most countries loose\nAnd and that's what's happening now this trade war with China whether it ends up a shooting war or limited like you say in the south China Sea they can definitely be stopped there there's no question\nThere's problems they're Middle East I don't see a major war between like say the United states or Europe\nAnd Russia

business I started over eight years ago when my wife and I moved into a new home and needed custom blind we did what many homeowners do prices from quote unquote professionals\nAnd we couldn't believe the high prices\nNot long afterwards I decided to take a chance and with no experience in the industry I quit my job in sales for a fortune five hundred company and I started a business selling custom lines on the Internet\nIn two thousand ten lines ... dot com was born I not only guarantee you love our blind I offer a bitter free guarantee meaning if you are blind don't fit for any reason oh remake them free of charge you only pay shipping\nAnd that kind of has made it even easier checkout blind students know two of cellular shades at first and only shades in stone without screws or tools because listeners take up to fifty percent off any learning or just use the coast and check out that's blind stirred dot com lines\nThat I I Do thing I mean this is going to have to happen a lot of rules are going to change just like banks may suddenly start swiping money out of more fluent accounts\nThey're going to have to have forgiveness these loans are going to have to be restructured all loans are going to have to be restructured um except for the most sovereign like U.S Treasury bonds and that may not be but\nBut this is the key to going through this the countries that restructure their debt and we restructured massive amounts of private debt and the great depression it made a stronger coming out\nJapan never restructured any of their debt and they're in a coma economy forever even when they're next young generation is come along so I I my\nBet is that they're going to come to the point we're gonna have to say no we have to allow restructuring of student loans there to owner as we went to find that to me what happened the education establishment I'll even call it a mafia\nBasically overcharging had the greatest inflation next you know of any sector education even more than healthcare they're on a run and win win that got too hard they say okay we can encourage student loans\nThen people can afford these higher prices we can keep our bubble going this bubble has burst and and and too many students are never going to be able to pay off these loans so when you have excess loans it's better to admit it just like a drug addict\nAnd then change policies and restructure detox I call it de leveraging go on and we're gonna have to forgive or restructure down these student loans however it happens if it makes a changing in the rulings yes I I Would say that's highly likely in the next couple of years\nTwo thousand eight Uri I saw one way to bail out everything would be to give people like a hundred thousand dollars voucher to buy some good what do you think\nWell here's the I don't like money printing except in emergencies like I think they should have done money printing quantitative easing for the first year in two thousand I like they did just to make sure the banking system doesn't just melt down like it did rapidly in the great depression but to put it on\nAnd on you know permanent quantitative easing just perverts the entire system is bad but the second thing I always said if you're going to print money don't give it to the damn banks\nWho got us in trouble and did all this leverage and\nInto rivers and all this crazy stuff in the first place just send you know send period to to to get us out of the at least send the money to everyday people send them a check I wouldn't say a hundred thousand but if they just sent everybody at twenty five every household at twenty thousand dollar check\nThat would have done a lot better for the economy and then in that that would help banks because things wouldn't have been as bad for the economy but it would have helped people\nInstead of the banking system this whole bailout this whole quantitative easing has only made Wall Street stronger only made the rich richer is only benefitted corporation including these tax cuts and has not benefited mainstream\nOf the reason why I wanted it as a volunteer as opposed to check the ... because I wanted them to be forced to spend that rebel and them you\nKnow right if they don't spend it or they you're right that that's much better way the point is to get every day people some relief and and have them spend that money or to stimulate the economy and then that helps that you know businesses and banks and everything but it should have gone to the people and not to the damn banks\nNext up we're going to hear in Port Huron download very good that you\nKnow hello there orange and not Harry him that question you mentioned earlier about the banks and you can't just now but uh he's taking the money I'm wiping my what about credit unions are they going to be doing the same thing or what what's up with those\nI I Would much rather have my money in a credit union than a than a money center bank\nBecause that's where all the leverage is been it was kind of opposite and the great depression a lot of people a lot a lot of the problems was farms were over expanding\nAnd borrowing money and those were in more rural areas and that's where the trouble is and it was rural banks going under more than the money center by this is totally a money center bank thing\nAnd and also when you do a bank if governments have to procreate money or pull accounts\nFor the more fluent accounts and those going to be in the end the bigger money center banks so I'd much rather have my money and a credit union than you know bank of America or Wells Fargo or ... or sitting back and stuff like that\nOkay let's take a call or two before we wrap things up with Harry Dent Hi Barbara North Carolina\nOr tell yeah okay thank you and\nI just answered that part of one of my question is why I asked\nA direct tonight at ... at night when he played a part of my way around ... why I Do not like I said well wait on line\nYup put all about timing\nIt's all of that time one of my gardening moments I call 'em hey what about you just answered my question like about the smaller amount so my Social Security income that much\nUm I don't have to worry about that so much and I'm at a larger account hold her is that what I understand\nYes I mean if they're going to have to restructure Social Security there's certainly going to take the benefits of a larger accounts and more fluent people first I mean the everyday person is going to be more protected in whatever scenario\nAnd bank insurance agree that they can insured deposits and they can insure them all that so what oh deposits are insured they can't insure everything if you have a major club but the smaller account it'd be spread out a few accounts and you have more money and your brokerage accounts which they can't get at\nYes you're going to be weightless all a bold and what happened in Cyprus it was a lot of rich Russians that had big accounting those were the biggest losers those were the ones they hit and of course\nWhen when things go bad people going to hit foreign deposit there's more Iceland went down and basically all the foreign depositors and foreign loans and protected their own people so yes the smaller accounts domestic accounts\nAre going to be safer but again\nI still say have as much as your money in a\nProtected account and your name that is not just the general deposit they lend against those deposits in real estate loans business loans go bad they're going against your deposits but if you have a brokerage account with your stocks or bonds or cash at it they can't\nThey can't pledge those reserves\nAnd well that's a good thing Carrie thank you were at a time Harry's website at coast to coast damn dot com up next a psychiatrist looks at the\nParanormal\nOr from the region will studio your local sushi areas where you don't see them and I are radio station and\nMichael's filing gone moving out to sea I'm Dave Anthony Fox News I've been in\nPanama City over sixty years this is the worst I've ever seen\nThe damage even worse than other panhandle communities in Florida like Mexico beach many homes there were obliterated nothing left\nHe has had many close brushes with death as well starting in the room\nYou said a number of paranormal or a novelist experiences visions pre cognitive dreams auto body experiences encounters with message Barry ... says well welcome to the program Dr many meters on coast to coast Dr welcome to the show I'm looking forward to this\nAnd for inviting me\nVery interesting that the somebody with your medical and psychiatric background would be so heavily involved in the paranormal and how did that all happened for you was it the near death experiences that started it\n[noise] well I think it was because I almost died so many times you know when my book the borders for normal first came out many people asked me if the ... based on stories with my patients had told me but my aunt was always no not at all because whatever patient tells the doctor it's confidential\nA doctorate bound by the Hippocratic Oath states that are doctors should not repeat anything he's told by a sense and I don't so the material in my book was based entirely on my own personal experiences\nPie stories from my readers and for my audiences and from family and friends and from I own extensive reading research into the paranormal in terms of why I have these experiences I think it is related to the fact that I had so many close politics that so many Russians that that [noise] um you know\nIt's been a lot of literature written about the near death experience\nMhm [noise] but the um term near death experience you know it's going back Dr vehement moody in Nineteen Seventy five for that's over forty years ago that's right I think he estimated\nThat something like one thirty Americans that had a near death experience or know someone who has had one and that's a large group of people but it's an even larger group of people who have almost died but never would pronounce clinically dead and never had the typical near death experience\nBut when I look at how my close brushes that effected me I see that I have some of the things after effects that Dr moody described in his patients who had a classic near death experience\nIn other words I'm having had all these clothes closet that I tend to have a deeper appreciation of life and I I also have over my fear of dying and I have found get myself a shift from ... to let them into spirituality and they and an increased need to find meaning and purpose in life\nWas at a pretty dramatic shift for you\nKnow not at all I I Would say was gradual the truth I'm up all the paranormal experiences I had I was quite young and I honestly I didn't think anything that might just kind of ... you know\nI just thought well that was weird but I didn't tell anyone about them because I didn't think anyone would believe me and in those days no one talked about those experiences because there was no rational way to explain them\nBut then as time went on and I got more and more of these experiences and when I went to a um a life threatening illness and and came out on the other side thanks to a stem cell transplant from an anonymous donor\nOh jeez wow yeah that was that was quite dramatic I'm at that point I felt like I Need to share what I've been going through because that would help other people\nIn the ... stem cell transplant so why didn't they let harvest stem cells from yourself\n[noise] [noise] well that's one way of doing it but the the um anonymous stem cell donated pollen allergen it ... ...\nWith more effective they actually found someone on the worldwide ... computer I just feel like I'm the owner bank and they found his name on the computer and he was a perfect match for me\nOr the super ... what was what was wrong if you want to get into that\nOh sure well I got leukemia oh gee I'm yeah\nAnd I had it for many years well actually I had leukemia\nThere is and I was in the hospital I had numerous um fled transfusions numerous courses of chemotherapy and then finally the doctor said you can't keep giving you a chemotherapy because it's doing tremendous damage to your body\nYeah was it was still in remission\n[noise] well you have to be in the mission in order to receive a transplant so they gave me chemotherapy um and I was in remission but then I Would keep having relapses and that fight against that they gave me the transplant\nHuh [noise] now is the person who gave me the transplant she lives in an anonymous donor that the rule at the time was that actually when you I was allowed to contact him if he agreed to contact them and\nI did write him just to thank him for his generosity and I found out that he was in the he's the ... was the name of the U.S navy\nAnd when his name came up on the computer he was stationed on an aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf wow [noise] so he was flown back into that don't you send for Washington DC and the team from the city where I live flew down to Washington and took a sample of stem cells and then flew back to my city\nAnd that's what happened and that was eight years ago and I've been fined ever since\nThen have you still in touch with him did that happen\nYes um I actually met him in in DC and we kept in touch and we've become friends\nThat's amazing you save your life\nHe did I can thank him enough he did save my life and they\nHear all for them you know he said the way it came about was um [noise] they were having a donor to drive and one of the bases where he was stationed then he just got in line with his buddies and all is required is that she swab\n... that's it yeah just to ... to get the DNA so that's when his name into the donor bank\nAnd then I'm ... years later by name came up on the computer and at that point he's even forgotten that he had agreed to be a donor [noise] but then once you know we found out that he was a perfect\nMatch for me and he was flown back to the ... center in DC they gave him some injections to stimulate his bone marrow seafood produce more stem cells\nAnd they gave him these injections for five days and then he had produced enough themselves so they took a blood sample which contain to stem cells and that was what was brought back to where I live ... yes we've become friends and I just I'm not too long ago\nDr ... the fact that you were dabbling so heavily into the psychic Rome has that help or hurt your psyche asked your practice [noise]\n[noise] well I tried to keep the two things separate I mean you know in terms of the psychiatric patients generally they don't talk about paranormal experiences they have you know serious mental disorders that they need help with and that's why they come to the psychiatrist [noise]\nHowever since I have that experience in psychiatry I'm able to help people distinguish between what's a fake experience and much a psychotic experience\nRight and and and there's a big difference there\nWell absolutely there is a big difference I mean sometimes if a person the something or here's something they don't know what it is they think they're losing their mind but in fact these types of experiences are quite common\nYou know for example um if someone is believed to the last ... I'm a spouse or a child quite often will be some type of posts death contact with the deceased loved one\nSo let's say a widow might see her deceased has been in her bedroom at night and she may talk to him or she might feel\nJust touched on her shoulder or something like that and these experiences are quite common in fact one study showed that up to fifty percent of people who've lost of of a left lung will have some type of post death contact with a loved one\nEven if a person has no belief in an afterlife and many of them don't I mean these these types of experiences are not related to religious beliefs are belief in an afterlife\nUm in in fact you know an atheist and agnostics having experience as well as religious people\nYou see that everyone is like you and I I tend to believe you can agree with you\nOK but uh when you said that ... what's the basis for that what makes you say that\n[noise] well the thing is the word psychic covers a lot of territory you know it includes things such as ESP or telepathy or Pete cognitive beams and other things you talk to both types of visions and voices and so on death that vision is near death experiences\nSo certain types of fake experiences such as ESP\nUntil after the extremely common and a lot of people have experienced that type of thing um for example someone phones you and you're thinking about that person then you say oh it must be ... I was just thinking about\nYou right that's very common um and I think everyone has the ability if they're interested to nurture their intuition or their ESP or they have a path a fence but a lot of people are interested in it as I said when I first had these experiences myself I just kind of brush them off I didn't think too much of them\nWas really only after I got sick that I start to think that maybe there was more to it than meets the eye\nWith with the psychic roam out there\nIn the ability to tap into it have you found that certain people are better at it than others\nYes definitely um well I think the most important thing is whether the person is interested in it and whether or not they are paying attention to it but the other thing I've noticed is that the second ability often runs in families\nYeah you're going to enjoy them I mean she she just the the devoted her entire career to that uh she uh she passed away and very bizarre way she was in the bath tub in a radio\nFilled in there oh no I Hope to God I wasn't listening to my show her no that's terrible ...\nHow does he got so interested in ...\nShe just always wires and there were so many things that had happened to her and she just decided to do something to do this and she's going to study it and she she went into it in a big way\nWell that's good but I Know there's been some studies done on telepathy at my monitor his medical center in New York\nWhere they were studying the ... the the ability to transmit information to people who are dreaming\nAnd in that study they had Sanders and receivers and the receivers were in a sleep lab and they were hooked up to an EEG to um the AG could measure what we call REM sleep rapid eye movement\nAnd then once the ... dream state the Centers for giving random images\nAnd they were told to concentrate on those images and try to send them to be the face and they found that people were more susceptible to lead to telepathy when they're asleep and it's also true that people are more susceptible to collapse of the when they're under hypnosis so there are ways to augment leprosy but\nIn my case and in most people's cases it just happened spontaneously\nDo you have a lot of patients that have these abilities\n[noise] no I wouldn't say so\nAll right stay with us Dr we're going to take a quick break we'll be back with the more Dr Mandy majors with us his book the borders of norm [noise]\n\nGo students ... the new version of the coast to coast am apple is now available for I don't know Android ... listen live on demand anywhere anytime good acoustic ... dot com and downloaded today [noise]\n\nThe news you want to know when we go high\nSingle\nFile and try and make us look like a lot of you know\n...\nNeeds you know they say yes and the market stay in the no I just love try west\nIs\nSeven Ninety\n... stimulating talk\nGive back to your community and she had to sign you carry United lamps you sign in southern Arizona is that was a Nineteen year old Jean tearing nineteenth ...
