movement she's the author of several great books including the field and the intention experiment in a way it is the power of eight\nLynn is the editorial director of what doctors don't tell you and also the architect of the intention experiments and she has conducted many Lynn welcome back to the program\nHey George it's great to be back you two are you still doing intention\nExperiments I Am I mean we just had two amazing ones last autumn and we just calculated the results a few months ago\nYou know I did an intention a bit when a shovel weeks ago a Hurricane Florence was heading toward the Carolinas or they could you know the category four or five and we did a little too much bring it down in the ... a tropical storm really fast\nOr something happens at work so they\nDefinitely does work I mean I worked with a group in Florida to keep that uh the last hurricane not this latest one away from Tampa Bay and it just skirted around it\nSo there's something going on and I mean now\nWe've run about six piece intention experiments trying to lower violence um last September we ran a six day experiment to lower violence in the most violent place in America which is believe it or not a U.S\nA neighborhood in St Louis Missouri ... and we calculated the results Georgia and it was amazing um we looked and I had a professor of statistics look at this from University of California\nAnd she saw that\nCrime went up in St Louis has a whole property crime went up in St Louis as a whole property crime went up went\nUp in fairground the neighborhood we we concentrated on the violent crime the thing we were focusing on went down by forty three percent from now before and it just completely bucked the trend from the time we did the intention so something's going on here\nWhat do you think this is what are people tapping into force you touched on it a lot with the book the fuel for what's out there\nWell what's out there we're in a collective consciousness and I liked I called it the field it's a quantum energy field and what seems to be the case is we can\nShift what's going on with our thoughts I mean you know the bottom line is our phone everything is energy and our thoughts are another kind of energy when there\nAre worked together collectively we have an amazing power that can change things and now you know I run the thirty three of these experiments and we've done everything from trying to make seeds\nGrow faster to purify water healing somebody of pie TST to lowering violence and you know of those thirty three twenty nine shown measurable positive significant effect\nDecided to trend the odds\nWell yeah because you know there's no drug out there to be honest George that that has that kind of track record you know pharmaceutical drug\nHas his good record is that in terms of studies so so as I say what really seems to be the case his thoughts are things that affect other things and when you get a group of people doing thoughts together there is a collective field that seems to be created that has great power\nTo change things now he'll think\nThe experiments you been working on a blade are primarily piece intentioned experiments\nYeah we did that one we did that one in St Louis and then I tried something really amazing I had the chance to work in a studio in southern England that had where I live in the u._k.\nAnd we had nine different screens with the studio I can be beamed down to nine different locations so we had cameras and nine different locations\nAnd we had those cameras in eight Arab countries I was working with a guy who's like the Deepak of the middle east and also very prominent Israeli\n... a documentary producer so we had eight in Arab countries you know Saudi Arabia Bahrain et cetera on Kuwait\nAnd then the ninth one was in an audience of Israeli Jews so these are guys who have been brought up to hate each other and I also beamed at this live over my YouTube channel to um my followers around the world so we all did intention to lower violence in Jerusalem\nThere was an area of the old city that was suffering a lot of violence and we chose it because it's you know the seat of all the major religions and we thought everybody would come together\nAnd what was amazing is afterward I could call on the people in the different locations you know and just calling their screen and they could talk to everyone else\nAnd the Jews started saying to the Arabs we love you it's time to you know ... and all of this and the Arabs were saying your God is my God and everybody was crying and everybody was sending love and it was\nAmazing it made the papers all over the middle east it was historic and it was incredible to me to see what was going on with these peace experiments wasn't just the outcome it was the effect on the participants\nHow much does added to play ... in the if you're a beach in positive will that generally work better than someone who goes into these experiments as a doubting Thomas\n[noise] well I thought so but no I mean and and when I looked at\nWhen we've done intention for individuals for instance we didn't intention once for a kid call Luke who is Fifteen Years old who tried to commit suicide is through and so forth of forty foot structure after is he broke up with this for a serious girlfriend and\nHe'd broken everything he had brain damage she had a you know he had nerve damage\nAnd so I got my my community to start sending intention to him for three weeks while his stepfather with keeping notes and careful you know tracking what was happening when we were sending intention\nLuca better in record time the doctors didn't even think of is going to live but he got better he got out of the hospital a far quicker than anybody could have estimated but here's the funny thing of it you know he's Fifteen Years old and like most\nTeenagers he thought his parents belief in the power of intention was pretty stupid so it worked for him and he didn't believe a word of it\n... with these experiments how do you start conducting them how do you scientifically put it together\n[noise] I get a team of scientists George I now I work with a lot ...

she over spent\nOn a holiday her group doesn't intention for she hears from the hotel says we accidentally overcharged you buy exactly the money she was overdrawn\nI'm somebody else was down to her last two hundred dollars she wanted to set up a website she had a port wine staying and wanted and was wanting to do a website and set up a business to help other people not feel bad about their birth marks\nAnd she's down through last two hundred dollars and she\nSuddenly here from Lloyd's of London to she had been a former employee to say that she could get a special amount of money because she had been part of this again out of the blue so this happens so often that it it has convinced me it's not just luck is not just happenstance\nAnd universities are studying the power me what are they doing\nWill we did the um we did the brain study you know and then we found and as I say we compared it to things like meditation and we found that it's not the same in all brain state during meditation still makes you feel like you're you\nThis what makes you feel like you're part of something much much\nBigger the power of eight you feel like you're part of you you kind of feel like you're part of the field that you're not this little lonely individual anymore you're part of something much bigger and grander um and again we've looked at it compared to other\nUm mystical states and its\nIdentical to a Buddhist\nMonk and ecstatic prayer but now we're moving forward um life university the one who studied this hot largest chiropractic university um has their nervous scientists and we're planning a study or with their biology department to looking at immune system workers so what changes\nIn your immune system when you do this [noise] um but one of the other\nBig pieces of this I talked about it with altruism\nWas the University of California Berkeley who did this big study of what goes on when you do something else rustic when you do something compassionate like our piece experiments and they found something incredible that goes on a with a thing called the Vegas nerve\nIt's the longest nerve the body and it winds its way from your neck through all the major Oregon's\nAnd it has a big effect on\nUm things like releasing oxytocin which is that hormone that gets released the feel good hormone when we're when we're caring for babies and\nThen the result of this activating is that it has a really positive effect on the immune system so when we do good or feel compassionate or ... something like that we um you know we\nWe actually get healthier\nBut the other big piece of this which is why that Middle Eastern experiment came about and the Arabs started you know sending love to the Israelis they found that when you do something compassionate like be part of an intention experiment or power of a group [noise]\nUm that Vegas nerve also makes us more tolerant more tolerant of people not like us so that was a big piece for me George because I started thinking wow\nAmerica America is so polarized now what if we started doing intention experiments where we had Republicans and Democrats together would that\nWould be ... that would be an interesting for them\n[laughter] will you know we're doing one this that this Sunday on doing a pilot experiment like that in\n... county in Florida um we're going to do something about lowering violence but we've got Republicans and Democrats as part of this experiment in the same room together to see what happens to them afterwards and we're planning to roll down in a big way next\nNext spring um we're we want people you know of the different political persuasion in the same room together to see what happens to them afterward\nYou talked about a mirror of what is that\nWell the mirror effect to me was the biggest piece of this George because you know we weren't just seeing affects among the receivers of stuff and the receivers of the big intentioned experiments you know the outcome of\nThe biggest change all that was amazing to me was what happened\nTo the participants in these intention experiments so when\nWe started doing these peace experiments I started surveying the people to find out you know what happened to them and were they able to get on the website and all that kind of stuff but more amazingly\nAh I asked them how it was for them and I was getting answers back like this um I felt like I was part of a higher network you know my body\nThe shivering and I was you know shaking uncontrollably and crying I felt like I was in the tractor beaming Star Trek and remember these are people who were participating\nIn their own home in front of their own computer by themselves but yet they were feeling this extraordinary energy and the extraordinary emotion but more interestingly after\nThey participated in a piece experiment their line became more peaceful they were making up with relatives that we're getting along better with their partners that we're getting along better with the ball is in their co workers\nThey were and they were hugging strangers about half of them said I feel more love for everybody I come in contact with him that to me with the amazing thing about it the mirror effect and when we did healing experiment we had loads of healing\nWhen we had peace experiments we had loads of people finding their line we're more peaceful\nIn a way that's probably the most powerful part of the intention experiment it's not the outcome that's pretty interesting definitely but it's more the active participation and what happened to the people it changes their lives being part of that\nWhen we're gonna come back in the moment and take phone calls I've still got a few more questions for you as we talk about the power of aid but we'll take

need an amount of silvery equal to half of the global annual mighty production batch just China the whole world is moving to China just recently California's now requiring all new homes to have solar panels they're just not enough silver supply that kind of demand\nSo we're going to see a shortage Kevin\nAll I can say is that some smart people like J.

doing it because they expect the price to go down\nThe hall I guess not but could super reach higher than a hundred dollars announced\nOr if you adjusted for inflation George sober would have to be about a hundred and thirty dollars announced to reach us all time high so we think or one hundred dollars is well within rich\nRight when that happened over the next seven to ten years but we believe

they're out my mom has essential tremor and I'm afraid I'm getting it and I'm taking the ah Ninety for life everyday and wonder what else there has to do to avoid this disease\nWhat's happening to what do you\nDeal essential tremors or not genetic are there other actually caused by a nutritional deficiencies in and of course\nUm and you get them they can be called\nOr things like Parkinson's disease or the ... and of course in parking Aziz MS Lou Gehrig's disease hunting is these are all kinds of the same diseases different parts of the brain or randomly or more severely deficient and things and you get different symptoms based on the different part of the brain is more severely affected\nAnd so what I like to do for people with essential tremors were those diagnosed with Parkinson's easily essential tremors and matter billionaires come from all over the world for me to treat them for those need to get rid of all the bad stuff no fried foods and processed meats no oil so blues no sugar and then you take one healthy brain and heart attack or a hundred pounds of body weight one healthy brain and heart back for a hundred pounds of body weight\nI'm taking photos everything twice a day for a hundred pounds of body weight then you throw in the distrust castles capital D like David ... three of those twice a day for a hundred pounds of body weight the ultimate nice and plus a to those twice a day for a hundred pounds of body weight that will be to ... a month and the ultimate nice and plus or a hundred pounds of body weight\nAnd then I Need you to eat uh let's see here what do you weigh\nA hundred and Seventy two hundred and Seventy two pounds I have eaten nine eggs today [noise] and they can be solved ... what was so I feel self self scrambling butter I Do want to eat a stick of butter day and they help me understand that we do have a CD called\nA stick of butter day keeps the doctor away a stick of butter day keeps the doctor away\nAnd urge you to listen to that CD many many times and you're just shake your head and say well there was my problem you've been listening to doctors and staying away from cholesterol ... as your best friend when reading that butter you want to be eating dairy products that has to have high fat dairy is a big study with a hundred and twenty thousand people with a central tremors and Parkinson's disease\nThey found that they had a deficiency of dairy fat they were eating zero fat yogurt the reading skills drinking skim milk or non dairy coffee creamer is indeed the whole creme de a stick of butter day um and you need to drink whole milk\nRemember my breakfast stock remember my breakfast berries strawberries blueberries blackberries brass burns and some whipped cream\nThere you go with whipped cream is the best part [laughter] really\nYeah because that's what your brain requires maintained so people don't realize that the George Seventy five percent of all very raised brain including human beings and porpoises mistakes in Wales and when he goes and giraffes overt raised Seventy five percent of their brain wages the white matter the brain which has a hundred percent cholesterol\nYou need that that came to censor the egg\nEgg yolks come in days are so important um and so I'm all these things the essential tremors go away Parkinson's it goes away Huntington goes away these are not genetic things or even if everybody in your family's gone they're all eating the same way cooking in the same way of living in the same place off\nThe Boise idaho we go Hasan's with

diagnosed with lung cancer stage for which he's gone into remission through a radiation sure which you would weigh only a few\nMoments you're how much the way\nYou know how how much is the way he's white and now he's about three hundred he's a little over six feet tall and normally about two hundred\nOkay so three hundred pounds and he gave it all the bad food in the fried food processed means

to coast to coast when big tag or what those Lynn is one of the central voices and the new consciousness movement she's the author of several great books including the field and the intention experiment\nIn her latest the power of eight Lynn is the editorial director of what doctors don't tell you and also the architect of the intention experiments and she has conducted many Lynn welcome back to the program\nHey George it's great to be back\nYou two are you still doing intentioned experiments\nI Am I mean we just had two amazing on last autumn and we just calculated the results a few months ago\nYou know I did an intention a bit when several weeks ago Hurricane Florence was heading toward the Carolinas or they could see it as a category four or five and we did a little over let's bring it down and it the you'd hit a tropical storm really fast\nOr something happens it works it\nDefinitely does work I mean I worked with a group in Florida to keep the uh the last hurricane not this latest one away from Tampa Bay and it just skirted around it\nSo there's something going on and I mean now\nWe've run about thick piece intention experiments trying to lower violence um last September we ran a six day experiment to lower violence in the violent place in America which is believe it or not at a neighborhood in St Louis Missouri yeah ...\nAnd we calculated the result Georgia and it was amazing um we looked and I had a professor at ... look at it from the University of California and she saw that\nCrime went up in St Louis is a whole property crime went up in St Louis at home property crime went out went\nUp in fairground and neighborhood we we concentrated on the violent crime the thing we were focusing on went down by forty three percent from before and it just completely bucked the trend from the time we did the intention so it's going on here\nWhat do you think this is what people tapping into of course you touched on it a lot with the book the field but what's out there\nWell what's out there we're in a collective consciousness and I like I called it the field it's a quantum energy field and what seems to be the case is we can\nShare what's going on with our thoughts I mean you know the bottom line is our thought everything is energy and our thoughts are another kind of energy when there\nAre worked together collectively we\nHave an amazing power that can change things and now you know I'm runs thirty three of these experiments and we've done everything from trying to make seeds\nGrow faster to purify water healing somebody of pie TST to lowering violence and you know of those thirty three twenty nine shown measurable positive significant effect\nDesigner trend the odds\nWell yeah because you know there's no drug out there to be honest George that that has that kind of track record you know pharmaceutical drug has is good or record is that in terms of studies so so as I say what\nReally seems to be the case his thoughts are things that affect other things and when you get a group of people doing thoughts together there is a collective field that seems to be created that has great power\nTo change things now he'll think\nThe experiments you been working on oh boy you are primarily piece intentioned experiments\nYeah we did that one we did that one in St Louis and then I tried something really amazing I had the chance to work in a studio in southern England that had where I live in the u._k.\nAnd we had nine different screens with the studio I can be beamed down to nine different locations so we had cameras and nine different locations\nAnd we had those cameras in eight Arab countries I was working with a guy who's like the Deepak of the middle east and also a very prominent Israeli\n... a documentary producer so we had eight in Arab countries you know Saudi Arabia Bahrain et cetera on Kuwait\nAnd then the ninth one was in an audience of Israeli Jews so these are guys who have been brought up to hate each other and I also beamed at this live over my YouTube channel to um my followers around the world so we all did intention to lower violence in Jerusalem\nThere was an area of the old city that was suffering a lot of violence and we chose it because it's you know the seat of all the major religions and we thought everybody would come together\nAnd what was amazing is afterward I could call on the people in the different locations you know and just calling their screen and they could talk to everyone else\nAnd the Jews started saying to the Arabs we love you it's time to you know to end all of this and the Arabs were saying your God is my God and everybody was crying and everybody was sending love and it was\nAmazing it made the papers all over the middle east it was historic and it was incredible to me to see what was going on with these peace experiments wasn't just the outcome it was the effect on the participants\nHow much does added to play ... ... if you're a beach in positive will that generally work better than someone who goes into these experiments as a doubting Thomas\n[noise] well I thought so but no I mean and and when I looked at\nWhen we've done intention for individuals for instance we didn't intention once for a kid call Luke who is Fifteen Years old who tried to commit suicide is through self off of forty foot structure after is he broke up with this for a serious girlfriend and he broke and everything he had brain damage she had\nA you know he had nerve damage and so I got my my community just start sending intention to him for three weeks while his stepfather with keeping notes and careful you know tracking what was happening when we were sending intention\nLoop got better in record time the doctors didn't even think of is going to live but he got better he got out of the hospital a far quicker than anybody could have estimated but here's the funny thing of it you know he's Fifteen Years old and like most\nTeenagers he thought his parents belief in the power of intention was pretty stupid so it worked for him and he didn't believe a word of it\n... with these experiments how do you start conducting them how do you ... scientific can we put it together\n[noise] I get a team of scientists George I know I work with a lot ... Gary Schwartz at the University of of Arizona the noted psychologist and a Jessica it's who is a very well known professors statistics and has been doing working consciousness research\nI worked with the late ... rural I I worked with people from from Penn State university water expert um I worked with um people from uh uh I'm from Princeton University\nYou know just really prestigious universities so we'll get an odd kick around ideas with them and see what's measurable and then the team will talk about well how are we going to measure this and how to set it up and some of them you know we do it in a laboratory like with\nDr Schwartz we did some seed experiments where we had four sets the seeds and we sent intention to one set of seeds and then the scientist didn't know which ones we were sending intention to so we had you know real scientific type of experiment and they planted the seeds and carefully measured them\nSo it's all done with the scientific protocol that they really helped me set up because they're the scientists and then I just invite my readers all over the globe and we've had people from a hundred and fifty countries participate or I'm an audience if I'm speaking in front of a large group to\nTo do the intention and I'll be in and out of my uh Internet site or YouTube or own Web TV or radio you and I did one together\nAnd um and then we calculate that we wait a while and we calculate the results and the reason we wait a while is safe for the peace experiments if you just do it\nA week after well could you know violence could go down but if you look at what's gone on for a couple of years before and then look for about six months afterwards if you have bucked the trend then it starts to get pretty interesting\nAnd you know losing the title of your newborn the power of each has to do with the number of people you put in the group detached why ... why not three earn Fifteen\n[laughter] will the town of eight really came about when I tried to scale this down remember I was doing these big experiments\nI wanted to know what happens if we put people in groups of you know groups small groups in my workshop you know will\nWill they heel and so this is just another experiment in my own mind and I was sitting there trying to figure out how to do this in a workshop because this is back in two thousand and eight and then I wasn't I hadn't really done\n\nDiamond Ninety three sons\nMost stimulating talk\nYou're shot at one thousand dollars now tend toward cash to two hundred two hundred now you're going to hang on for me ...
