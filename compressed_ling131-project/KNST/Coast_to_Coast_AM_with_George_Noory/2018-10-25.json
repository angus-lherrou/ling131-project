get to the bottom and I want to hear what the authorities have to say about this\nAnd I don't want to jump to conclusions because it could be\nA left wing conspirator doing them is to try to make Republicans good look bad but on the surface it looks like and I know everybody's saying\nYou know Trump and his rhetoric has made you know things ... he's create an environment so somebody would be induced to do this you don't know that now you don't know that we need to wait\nAnd get the official verdict from our authorities in intelligence communities in the United states and then the American people can chew on it but bottom line you and me both know that the rhetoric in this country\nI'm Talking about the grass roots level I'm not talking about leadership because these guys have always been you know at one another stroked\nBut we have to understand that at the grassroots level\nAmerica is best when we can debate ideas vigorously debate these ideas and then you know come up with a viable solution to whatever problem that we're facing to try to assassinate former presidents\nAnd leaders in government is not the way to solve this problem and whoever did that whoever did it they're not\nBenefiting this country they're hurting the United states of America and George I'm so glad you guys let me way on that weigh in on this because I Love my country I Love it with all my heart I told you once on this there that would give them my life for the United states of America and I and I will but George\nThis right here it's got to come to win and hopefully this a wakeup call for all of us for all of us to realize that if you're a Republican don't look at a Democrat is your enemy if you're a Democrat don't look at the Republican as your enemy as an opponent yes but not an enemy\nWe're all on the same team and the media\nNot not coast to coast but the media\nHas definitely because George you giving everybody a platform you're giving everybody a platform and you've been reasonable you've been honest I've heard your commercials saying listen you know just because I let a person to say what he wants to say don't think that I'm On one side or the other and that's the proper and healthy way to look at it but George\nThe media has exacerbated this problem I Do believe that the media bears\nAs you know a little culpability in this we've got to stop demonizing and looking at one another as we are enemies were all on the same team the only people that are clapping and I are our adversaries overseas\nAnd build on and the individual or the group that sent these packages exactly George\nTed Kaczynski the Unabomber killed three people injured twenty three others\nHe was caught because his manifesto was publicly let go in his brother recognized it as Ted Kaczynski he's in turned him into the FBI\nAre we going to happen hopefully some kind of a person because I'm convinced Andre that one person always tells another person somebody knows something about who sent these packages out maybe they'll go to the public or if\nThis is a conspiracy I don't think that this conspiracy will hold wax too much longer you cannot have a conspiracy like this and everybody keep those do their mouth shut\nI think that if this is a conspiracy we will get a resolution to this we'll find out the truth a whole lot faster than if this is one lone but I Am convinced in our law enforcement\nUh individuals and are individuals in institutions and in the intelligence community entire US intelligence apparatus they will get to the bottom of this and it won't ever did this\nWhether it was somebody on the left or to somebody on the right because I Will say again\nI Will say again 'cause I Know you've got people on the right thing this could be a false flag it'd be somebody on the left that did this\nAnd you got most of the media saying that President Trump still this weight shut up way let the intelligence officials do their jobs then wants their job is completed\nAnd they've determined who'd done this then we can begin as a nation\nTo try to put the pieces back together and come together as one country we are the United states of America\nYou know every group has you know had their time to be stepped on that just the way empires are established and America is an empire and people are going to get stepped on but\nYou have to wait and do things proper in order I'm thinking about the Tuskegee Airman right now who President Roosevelt said well they can't fly on a piece for the one less thing but they flew it and they flew it most six more successfully and they protected more bombers than anybody in front\nOf they sure did in in ... in when they landed white pilots went up to them and hugged him\nExactly George exactly you know we all want to contribute to the greatness of America and we're on a good path right now let this path continue LS stop this rhetoric that drives us apart\nAnd and I'm not talking about Trump I'm Talking

and our galaxy the Milky Way has ... billion stars\nAll that means is one hundred and sixty billion planets so they're all over the\nDarn plays and you know that changed as our picture we used to think ah we're pretty special you know there's only a few civilizations ... around and we're at the top of the heap well\nRoll over the place and that changed our perception of how important we are of course from the most important things around because we haven't been around very long and leave plenty of room in other words\nFor others and we come to realize that you know get to hear from there is not quite the big deal we used to think it was\nA hell of a primary comes from doing things differently [noise] so the notion that the you know it's going to take a very long time many years to get between stars and can't be much crepes and back and forth\nNow we realize I Would look we're fusion for example or you can get ... hours we also realize that the country a sixteen fifty I guess a bishop Russia and thought that the world was created and four thousand ... see that's really can't be too late beings around you know\nWell it was off a little bit four billion be seeing this\nJust a little the little uh our ...\nNatural we were not as important I I hate to say this to people but we're not as important as we might think we are in the larger scheme of things\nThe ultimate you know her only um we're beginning to realize that the busy place out there and there should be no surprise that the people see others coming here\nBecause\nApparently they seem to be all over the place ... as a result of spontaneous generation of life everywhere or migration colonization or maybe people are being exiled and all you do you find out is saying that the nearest one is a lot of that they\nPut in incarcerated people you know like yeah like a ... boy guy's been brought on earth\nAnd you never know the way they've been treating people ... it's it's you're\nSaying to you were one of the first if not the first to break the Roswell New Mexico story nationwide yet but in ... have you changed your thoughts in views at all about that case over the years were you pretty steadfast that what we've been talking about would you especially is still what it was\nI think it's Italy and visitors and as a matter of ... kind of the notion of wired tried to tell you a first time I was on that well we think there's one point six planets for stars so like if you like huge number of planets and [noise]\nYou know they're probably come in here uh I I'd have been left that there's only a few thousand flights you know if there were a life out there and we see it mhm you know they wouldn't make contact and land on the White House lawn and all kinds of crazy so\nNow I think it's more like realizing that at North America has more than a few people money coast is jammed full of people all over the place\nAnd we that makes us less important than we'd like to think we are and there's still people thinking that the world is only a few thousand years old so what's the\nBig or or still slapped\n[laughter] and\nAnd so uh what most of us have learned that it's more complex place than we thought it was and we hate to admit it but you know what we're not the most advanced\nAnd much shouldn't be surprising again because we know now we measured the age of land and the stars and things like that\nAnd uh hey we're not number ... ... no [laughter] no ... and so what we\nAnd you can tell from another thing or the military budget on apply to about a trillion dollars this year or so we

know about this matter was Margaret from like super who also is a former police officer he lives in Carmel New York\nAnd he um somehow got connected with officer Godwin\nAnd went and actually interviewed him so that's how this all came about and and that I've had dialogue with officer God when since then\nHe's very credible and it was not only him but seven other officers are over it two nights ban that actually solve this creature so it was the original two witnesses that reported hearing just God awful shrieking sounds coming out of the woods\nAnd they reported it to the local police\nAnd so the first night there were I Believe five police officers present and then\nThe second night there were two more present and had these I Witness accounts of this gigantic big foot

Conley was sitting in front of the president\nSo he got he bought but what I don't know is whether he was in a bench before him how that seating arrangement was I I I think he was sitting in a bench in front of the president uh the way I like the front seat I think he was in the front\nAnd so the so governor currently and his wife or in front of President Kennedy and his wife\nSo there were three people in the front seat\nNo they weren't another so it it would have been another ... sitting there and then they drive early or the other Secret Service agent was on the passenger side so you would have had six people\nAnd that would have been six that strange route and Tom is looking at it and what do you look to can you turn Tom spike up for just one second Denny to put your speaker downtime in a you tell me what you're saying\nWell I just I just pulled up to the ... film and I'm watching them come over and what are your is describing Kennedy back with his wife right and I'm hoping you can hear me 'cause I'm I'm looking at the film are now I hear you [noise] and uh and then I ...

do this you don't know I Know you don't know that we need to wait\nAnd get your fish will verdict from our authorities and the intelligence communities in the United states and then the American people can chew on it but bottom line you and me both know that the rhetoric in this country\nI'm Talking about the grass roots level I'm not talking about leadership because these guys have always been you know at one another stroke\nBut we have to understand that at the grassroots level\nAmerica is best when we can debate ideas vigorously bake these ideas\nAnd then you know come up with a

something about who sent these packages out maybe they'll go to the public I mean\nThis is a conspiracy I don't think that this conspiracy will hold wax too much longer\nYou cannot have a conspiracy like this and everybody keep this keeps their mouth shut I think that if this is a conspiracy we will get a resolution to this we'll find out the truth a whole lot faster than if this is one lone but I Am convinced that our law enforcement uh individuals\nAnd are individuals and institutions and in the intelligence community entire US intelligence apparatus\nThey will get to the bottom of this and it won't ever did this\nWith somebody on the left or to somebody on the right because I Will say again I Will say again because I Know you've got people on the right thing this could be a false flag somebody on the left that did this\nAnd you got most of the media thing that President Trump still this weight shut up wait let the intelligence officials do their job then wants their job is completed\nAnd they've determined who've done this then we can begin as a nation to try to put the pieces back together and come together as one country we are the United states of America\nYou know every group has you know had their time to be stepped on that just the weight empires are established and America is an empire and people are going to get stepped on but\nYou have to wait and do things proper in order I'm thinking about the Tuskegee Airman right now who President Roosevelt said well they can't fly on a piece for the one less thing but they flew it and they flew it most six more successfully and they protected more bombers than anybody in front\nOf they sure did in ... in when they landed white pilots went up to them and hugged him\nExactly George exactly you know we all want to contribute to the greatness of America and we're on a good path right now let this path continue unless stop this rhetoric\nThat drives us apart and and I'm not talking about Trump I'm Talking about individuals the guy at a gas station your best friend the guy who you talk to on the phone you know stop it realize we're all in the same boat together we're all Americans\nAll right bye ...

I comment on that I I'd like to make a technical comment on the fence today um\nI Would I Would estimate that the probability of this thing track down to either the perpetrator or perpetrators of a very short period of time as as being very very high um for purely technical reasons I mean these are all unexploded devices that means\nAll kind of trace evidence is available from them and they're all they've all gone are all going to the FBI you and some of them were sent through the regular mail for us you\nKnow I just wanted to know if they're from one city one location or a number of

pictures of the person if he delivered it to the post office camera\nAt the post offices ... I mean this is the kind of thing where where if you wanted to have the best possible evidence it's almost as if someone wants to be caught so I I think probably within a day or two days are certainly a short period of time we're going to find out who is behind this and then some of these questions are are going to start to be possible\nAnd she'll say that again about a minute left the optics story really like\nI I mean this is mostly a a a you know it kind of future kind of\nIssue with it more it it's more involving a inter ISP communications rather than individuals I think the question it always comes up when you when we talk about higher speed Internet is are we going to be able to afford it or the eye of the is going to raise the band with caps enough so that we won't use up our whole allocation for the month and in two minutes\nAnd where it's going to go because right now the ISPs have tended to put the high speed a new advanced system in the ah high rent urban areas they haven't showed a lot of interest and putting them into rural areas so there's that question to are we ever going to actually see it depending on where you live\nOr am I from Lauren thank you so much will be in touch with you this week as well while\nA lottery ticket holder in South Carolina has scoop the largest jackpot in us history\nMega millions confirmed that was one winner for the one point six billion dollars\nLet's see how that he's probably obviously meeting with his lawyers and accountants or she is and will figure out what's going on in a moment we'll be talking about dark forces demons with a which that's right next on coast to coast day um [noise]\n\nI Am Kevin the mirror with me again and we all knew Kevin from ... capital we're here to talk about bitcoin Kevin I was surprised when you called me and said you were also getting into crypto currency is what's going on\nWith George we've set up a specific program that allows people do hold crypto currency inside their IRAs well\nAre you suggesting people have a bitcoin i._r._a. instead of a gold or silver IRA\nNot at all we give investors the option don't\nIn their ... now explain that force or\nWhen I first heard about it pointed treated for pennies in fact there's an incredible story about how one guy bought two pizzas with ten thousand bitcoins\nWe're about twenty dollars at the time but here's the shocker today those ten thousand bitcoins are worth more than sixty million dollars and what stories like that more people are interested in owning it\nWith us sicker Russia will come back and talk about the ... in just a moment of coast to coast they all\nGo students ... the new version of the\nCoast to coast am app is now available for ... and now Android four dollars on a boat listen libre on demand anywhere anytime go to goes to goes to um dot com and downloaded today\nNo dog in a way too\nLong ago\nAnd then let's say\n\nThink ...

tough I'm fine how are you\n[noise] well my my buddy up oh I Know I got older I got her\nIt's the attendance ... anymore it's Stanton Friedman\nBoy am I allowed\nHeightened I you know what you've got that little tiny accent that I picked up stand how are you and how you're feeling\nWell it's in the middle of the night but I'm I'm a before I'm going to limit the man under\nAnd yes you are we need we need you on this program my friend look I heard these rumors that you were retiring no way right\nOh well I Am sort of retiring I Am a much wider scheduled for the first time in ten years I have no engagement and ... of January November and December I Can't believe it too much about going anywhere\nAgainst my nature [laughter]\nWell I tell ya ... we'd love your stand that I'm going to tell everybody who might be brand new to the program when I was a Twenty one year old reporter in Detroit Michigan\nMy very first interview was with a fellow named Stanton Friedman I saw a little clip being in the Detroit News that he was going to be speaking before group\nOr an Oakland University and I told my news director I Want to go out there and interviewed this guy who's you know nuclear physicist expert in UFOs my news director said I'm not paying for this this is not going to be an overtime for this you want to go out there and interview this guy you do it on your own time so I took my tape recorder\nOut I went ... interviewed stance and Friedman had a great interview and I've known him ever since then when I eventually\nMatured and did my night talk show in St Louis he was the gas and then when I replaced art on coast to coast stance was a staple to the program anyways and we continued and he's been at some live events with me I think I'm going to be with you at alien fest the end of January up near a big beer\nAnd I think so at least that's what the plans were assuming there is no getting away you know [laughter]\nSo they stand tell me tell me what's going on in the field have you followed these days I mean you you were out there way in the beginning telling people about you ... talking about the Benny and Barney he'll case you've got books out\nWhat's the latest based on your work your research\nWell I think there's been a much wider acceptance I think the biggest thing that's happened as we've come to realize that our vision of the world was that not quite right\nWhen Frank Drake talked about there might be aliens out there you said there might be eight thousand places in the galaxy or were they going to be sending a signal\nWell the latest word began looks like there's about one point six climates per star\nOpera galaxy starred in our galaxy the Milky Way has about a hundred billion\nStars all that means is one hundred and sixty billion on it so they're all over that darn plays and\nYou know that changes our picture we used to think ah we're pretty special you know there's only a few solution to the ... around and we're at the top of the heap well\nRoll over the place and that changed our perception of how important we are of course from the most important things around because we haven't been around very long and leave plenty of room in other words\nFor others and we've come to realize that you know get in here from there is not quite the big deal we used to think it was\nA hell of a primary comes from doing things differently [noise] so the notion that uh you know it's going to take a very long time many years to get between stars and that I Can't be much crepes and back and forth\nNow we're ... we're fusion for example or you can get ... hours we also realize that the country a sixteen fifty I guess a bishop Russia and thought that the world was created in four thousand ... see that's right can't be too late beings around you know\nWell it was off a little bit four billion be seeing this\nJust a little the little\n... natural we were not as important I I hate to say this to people but we're not as important as we might think we are in the larger scheme of things the ultimate you know her ... um we're beginning to realize that the busy place out there and\nThere should be no surprise that the people see others coming here because\nApparently they seem to be all over the place out whether this is a result of\nSpontaneous generation of life everywhere on migration colonization or maybe people are being exiled and all you do you find out is saying but there are throwing some of that they put in incarcerated people\nYou know like yeah like a personal ad boy guy's been brought on earth\nAnd you never know the way they've been treating people ... Sandy you were one of the first if not the first to break the Roswell New Mexico story\nNationwide yet but in ... have you changed your thoughts in views at all about that case over the years were you pretty steadfast that what we've been talking about would you especially is still what it was\nI think it's Italy and visitors and as mine are hungry for expanded the notion of wired tried to tell you a first time I was on that well we think there's one point six planets for stars so like if like huge number of planets and [noise]\nYou know they're probably come in here uh I I'd have been left that\nThere's only a few thousand plants you know if there are life out there and we see it ... you know they would make contact and I have on the White House lawn and all kinds of crazy so\nNow I think it's more like realizing but at North America has more than a few people on the east coast is jammed full of people all over the place\nAnd we but makes us less important than we'd like to think we are and there are still people thinking that the world is only a few thousand years old\nSo what's the big or or still slap\n[laughter] and\nAnd so uh what most of us have learned that it's more complex place for them we thought it was and we hate to admit it but you know what we're not the most advanced\nAnd much shouldn't be surprising again because we know now we measured the age of land and the stars and things like that\nAnd uh hey we're not number oh oh no [laughter] no and so what we\nAnd you can tell from another thing or the military budget on apply to about a trillion dollars this year or so we haven't changed much have we\nKnow that it'll have people don't get the\nGoodies of are on their work uh we take for leaving for because we're stocking up on on ways to kill other people\nAnd it seems I I don't want to say that's human nature a but it appears to be close to what it is and I'm not going to try to explain why or how what are we know enough to say that a\nIs an awful lot of energy available to men universe and you know gone to the sequence of I you know uh how long does it take to get some place how ... the nearest person on almost kind of stuff and\n... you say I'm Sorry I only have to argue with the listener dissent advice I forgot to argue is my first said I'd\nAlso encourage them to get a caller Jews we have one way or the reality t._v.
