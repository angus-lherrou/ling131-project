about coming up\nOn coast to coast am and we'll start with Michael Guillen who is here the end of life as we know it\nOminous news from the frontiers of science is his new book but you might know him better from an ABC News or from the History Channel where he hosts the show or from his other books including a novel the no prophecy he's in LA guy or you are you a dodger's fan Michael\nWell uh you know what I grew up rooting for the Dodgers are but I spend a lotta years in Boston\nAnd Harvard day of my son was born in ... and I don't know I'm kind of caught between a rock and I are [laughter] I understand that that's why I asked at a at a later on a\n... you are obviously you you achieve great heights both in academia and in media and you are\nAmongst I think in the elite group of science reporters\nPeople who actually write nonfiction about science in into very accessible way um I we put you in the same category as Mary Roach are you a fan of hers\n[noise] you know I I I I'll be honest with you I'm not familiar with Mary Roach\nOh you're missing missing terrific come in and you know she's a she's a frequent guest year and but very very entertaining and she writes I'm always about science and so she lives to explore particular subjects and\nSo her book on for example what happens to the body after we die called stiff or ... or packing for Mars and when she talked she tried to learn what it'd be like to go to Mars and all the things that would happen and she is very good at it\nYou know she's grey and you'd really like her and it's just very kind of ... it was reminiscent to me a little bit on how you were getting into the subject because you handle it with a very\nUm [noise] a very non scholastic\nApproach it's the science is there but anybody can follow these stories and everybody probably should if you want to get a glimpse into what the future is all about this what else to be a great gift for\nFor Christmas if you if you have a a young scientist and you're on your list some urban old scientist for that matter but looking ahead you know I ... if you pardon the pun I was just talking about Larry King and he was he was talking about he he believes he's a big believer\nIn cryogenic [noise] yeah\nYeah a lot you know there's also that famous baseball connection with you Ted Williams family in ... and\nBut I mean I what what is the science these days on something like that and how realistic is this would disappear or ... for somebody like Larry King to hope that he will be able to come back again and take his place behind home plate and\nAre [laughter] well first of all thank you for the kind words\nI have spent my entire life communicating science I Try to make it as interesting as I can you know I spent fourteen years at\nA ABC News as you indicated good morning America twenty twenty Nightline and you know you have to you have to make things interesting or they'll give you the hook basically [laughter] uh I've kind of cut my teeth on that\nAs far as cryogenic says concerned you know it's interesting you bring that up and I've covered the cryogenic story over the years\nAh you know they're in the stories that Walt Disney had his head\nA frozen and ah with with the hope one day of uh of being brought back to life the head being the most important part because it carries our memories or thoughts and so forth and so on but you know I got to be honest with you that's like old school um what I ... in the sense that\nNow with what's going on with robotics and so forth ... ... it's more likely that um what Larry King is going to want to do is you know before he kicked the can uh you know he's going to want to upload all his thoughts and memories or\nOnto a supercomputer and then downloaded onto a very realistic robot so that Larry King [laughter] can ah can remain behind home plate you know indefinitely into the future but I'm Serious\nYou know in in my book um the end of life is you know what I deal with these four big topic areas or the first is the worldwide Web the second is an artificial intelligence robots\nThat third it has to do with privacy and surveillance technology and the fourth has to deal with genetic engineering so between genetic engineering and artificial intelligence robots\nMan I'm telling you Larry King is going to be around for a long long\nTime and I was reading some of those sanctions in I thought that was interesting because there really as you said when he was very I think you mentioned like ... once in a book and there's not that big emphasis on it but there is still this hope that people have about\nPreserving their actions and and then that becomes a course a full debate about what we're is the seat of the essence of us you know we used to think the soul was the heart and the head contained all of the you know the the computer works but\nBut you do we how realistic is it ever in any near future that we would be able to upload\nThoughts in dreams like you might expect from Minority Report being able to capture\nThem and then put them into something else\n[noise] I think it's very real or in I mean you know and and and you indicated about the my book being about the future but but the truth of it is it it's really\nAbout what's going on right here and right now even as we speak in ... in labs all over the world or I'd tell for example the story of Ilan ... are being very very involved well you know he's involved in driverless cars he's involved in outer space and going to Mars and so\nThen that's where we go with the next ... the classic study

of physics at Harvard as well as the author and the new book\nIs ah is is just great it's the end of life as we know it and just before we went into the break we were talking about\nThat that space in discussions of what we should didn't want to do which\nMight be better informed by discussions of morality as much as ethics and and you know I think even Michael when you were talking about\nAbout the idea of preserving a physical life on this planet is like the weather that was through uploading a brain and putting it into something you know into a robot or something you know even that it makes me\nSo um the question then becomes do we I mean you know it's exciting it's it's interesting it's it's like science fiction come true but then when you get past all that kind of the bells and whistles that at all you have to ask you know then we really want to do this and there's an even deeper question that I raised\nIn the book and that is with all the genetic engineering were doing and you know the extent these the extinction efforts alright do come under the category of genetic engineering why we're doing in is something that's never been done before\nAnd that is we are elevating recessive trait\nAnd we're drawing a traits in other words we're flying in the face of the very forces that have created these species the evolutionary forces sure we're defining the natural\nFlow were to find the natural order of things and he got to believe that when you take on Mother Nature remember the old commercial you don't don't mess with Mother Nature or something like that\nYeah it's not nice it's nice to mother nature\nYou know that one yet none nice I forget what it was the commercial was margarine I it was very Meyer and it was for a merger and right yeah and we all know margarine is not so great for exactly but\nYou gotta wonder that because we are doing this we now have the ability of elevating recessive traits and suppressing dominant trait were flying in the face of Mother Nature we had to pay a price\nAnd he can't do that you're you're you're fighting against\nYou know a billion a court in the science you know billions of years of\nRight where we need to do that if we take it on or who was going to be the casualty I'm thinking we are\nYeah you know this is the ultimate question and I I mean you know I was reading the de ... thing and I'm not sure that if they brought back to quote unquote a wooly mammoth what we really wouldn't have is just a wooly your elephant\nYou know but much in the same way that we have a sweeter orange right where we have a a a a juicy or beach or something that people do by\nFlipping genetic codes around here there and I'm not\nOh he's doing the debt smart either but but I think I'm more worried about some of this idea about the the ... some of the robotics that you talk about and and what that what that really means ... who's gonna decide\nWhen robots have really gone far enough and are we going to be in a situation as crazy as it sounds words like sky net and it'll be too late the robots will you know there'll be self teaching and we're out\nWell you know again that's a very real possibility I um\nI tell this story about this guy I think his name is Anthony ...\nIs a former Google engineer a big into driverless cars I'm so he he he helped launch way mo which is the driverless car\nA division of of Google right and then went to her and then got involved in this ugly lawsuits are feeling a industrial secrets and focus on but he recently applied to the area and was granted I'm a tax exempt status for what he's calling the church\nOf artificial intelligence\nYou know on the surface it sounds a little bit crazy but when you look into what the thinking his thinking behind doing is he's he's basically saying this look if we continue in the trajectory where now on\nIt it it is inevitable that one day\nA artificial intelligence robot Howard by artificial intelligence will will become so much more intelligent than we\nThat they really reached the level of a deity they they they are in effect God because they know everything they see everything they they control everything if we give them that kind of freedom\nAnd so we may as well to start getting ready to worship it because we want to stay on its good side\nBecause he did that this technology we're creating\nWill run amok and you know you start thinking well okay it's a little crazy this guy but\nYou know it's not that far fetched because the rate at which artificial intelligence is\nIs developing you know I talk about how it beat the pants off of the chess champion and then the checkers champion and now it can beat the champs that say you know Texas hold them poker and the uh the gang go which is generally conceded to be the most complicated game most ancient game around go you\nKnow ... you\nWrite an artificial and tell us now can beat the pants off her you know the the goat champion and so it's printed that writing is on the wall in I mean it it's pretty clear that these computers and not just going to become fans there they're no longer just fancy adding machine there no there is no longer just doing computations\nAh but they're they're becoming more adept at doing things that we both are we once posts about being very good at that well you know like you they're ...\nButton it up I think they're generally like he was still pretty small but you know one day they're general like he was forced seem to be even greater than ours that the day of the singularity that's what the day all singularity him one day we'll have the equivalent IQ of you know ten thousand two hundred and twenty five so\nYeah and I think the interesting these are the two is it that the equation is which you use it a hundred and twenty five and we're using that as like a horizon line for human intelligence right we go with an IQ one twenty five\nBut at the smarter machines get and the more the takeover of our day to day activities\nAnd or the more they do things for us and we allow them to be in the driver's seat of our lives who's just said that that that average IQ isn't going to drop ten points\nSo we we'd like to think that we might stay but the more we get cushy our brains get ... and who knows it might be a lot we might be bringing on our own physical demise faster than\nRight than we would have

I I Can't think of a downside to that other than the military application I guess but we're\nYou would that one no I I agree with you I'm a and I I think that you have that discussion that I have in the book about\nTrans humanism and you know that's it there's actually a movement a called the trans human movement where as you say the ... the idea is to enhance ourselves one way or another using technology and I\nBreak it down into three categories as the usable or trends human augmentation there's so there's usable there wearable and then there's implantable\nAnd I I agree with you I I there this is an area where I see very little downside\nI mean I tell the story of the sky from Dayton, Tennessee who he was the power lines when he touched a a high voltage line that was lying on the ground and he lost both arms to the vet them right off\nNow here's a guy who would have you know live the rest of his life you know of severely crippled\nAnd and now scientists are creating for him what are called neuro prostheses prostheses but see these are artificial arms but not like your grandfather's artificial arms you know that we are mechanical\nThat requires you to wear a harness and you have to ... you know these are these are arms\nThat he can move with his thought so they're they're wired\nTo his mind and I mean isn't fantastic oh yeah and\nAnother story that I tell about the woman who is a quadriplegic and now you know she she's able to have some level of independence and uh because of of some of the trans human augmentation um so I Know I I agree with you and even even in um [noise]\nEven in the military setting I mean if we if we can outfit our soldiers so that\nYou know they're wearing an exoskeleton that I talk about how on day has come up with some stuff there yeah where you know write it just it just it it you know so so for a soldier who's out there and he's carrying you know what I fifty sixty pound backpack\nYou know if if if they if we can give them an extra fella Scott what's on the take some of that load off of their own skeletons I I think that's a\nI think it would be a stretch to find fault in something like that\nOr maybe but neither seen robocop more times than you have I mean I think that\nI mean and I do I'm not I'm not being facetious I think that's the only one I'm here's what it there's always this belief somehow that if we can\nIf we can come up with the technology um that saves our soldiers from from harm inevitably that that gets weaponized into and yeah we can invade without losing any soldiers and therefore there's no political consequence\nYeah from the ... and ... and ... you know back to 'em that idea about I'm\nAbout maybe some of our advancements should not be consequence free is that I think that that's the ... I get worried a little bit and maybe that's the science fiction part of me then I see that politicians would rebel at the thought of not having to be accountable for anybody's death\nBy having super soldiers that can go in and take whatever we want 'em until the embittered enemy that we've created does this one but [laughter] and inevitably it's a new arms race\nNo no you're absolutely right and then I again I talk about that but you know it's interesting as you look ahead\nTo what this technology is pointing to\n[noise] and ah you know we're talking about enhancing sold a human soldiers abilities but I think are equally realistic will be a you know a robot warriors and effect Terminator like warriors that will be our surrogates going into war and so we ...\nCould possibly go wrong there [laughter] yeah [laughter] and you know I quote that sounds like a plan [laughter] yeah I Know\nAnd and now and and the ... group you know I quote him in the book in Russia is\nVery upfront about them doing that they're I mean they're in the process of doing that and they're talking about unveiling some of their stuff soon or using their own that says it's just a fancy way of saying these are robot warriors that have human like brain the question then becomes\nDo you give such warriors the right\nTo make the decision to shoot or not shoot another word to give them complete autonomy and and that is called the Terminator conundrum right now yeah nations are thinking about well gee if we give our robot warriors complete autonomy then\nThat's basically going to make Russians do the same thing and now we're going to be as you said a moment to go in\nWe're going to be now and another escalating arms race\nRight you know ... in some ways you know ... that I often I often think to myself you know\nAll this technology is brand new it's unprecedented\nBut we had our just still the same you know all our faults in our foibles and our weaknesses and are downsides just get magnified by this technology is the technology doesn't eliminate our weaknesses and our foibles and are downsides you you know what I'm saying to you\nYeah I Do and ... and ... and yet I Would propose to you maybe the biggest problem we would face in the law of\nUnintended consequences would dictate\nThe Sarah Connor conundrum\nNot the Terminator conundrum but to Sarah Connor ... which means if you can't win a conventional war because you're over well by the technology of the your opponent you go unconventional and you go gorilla end this creates more terrorism you know\nYou know I mean that's that's how they actually she was able to beat the I don't want to spoil the ending ... Terminator but you know I mean that's how that's how you know she will one is eventually learning to to you know to go to grill her way out of it not to face the enemy but to be the enemy by you know going\nEr and his weaknesses but but positive person 'cause whenever you mentioned Russian scientist I'm reminded of the story about the the scientist that want to put a a a new had an old hand on the new body right\nYeah yeah okay well we had transplants yeah yeah\nOkay so let's let's pick that up [laughter] that's one of those that's one of those Halloween he kind of moments right there were like All right no there is\nThis is this is one of those ... nightmare dream things depending on where you are with that I can understand that somebody had um a body that was decaying but their brain was brilliant and you wanted to put it on a new body but then\nWhere does that end and how far along are they in that pursuit\nYeah well you know what I've been reporting on that story for some years now and um it began with a small number of scientists um\nWho experimented on monkeys and it gets a little grizzly but this being Halloween okay ah where they yeah they severed monkeys head and then they re attached it\nOr just to prove that they could so there's a lot of plumbing involved right I mean you have to sew up the the the the veins in the arteries and the nerves and so forth and so on and they've they've scientists have achieved to a level of success with monkeys and so now embolden\nOr by that they are turning their attention to doing it to humans and there's at least one guy in Russia who's been quoted a frequently or who is a quadriplegic or you know otherwise mentally very alert\nAnd he says yeah come and do it to me man I'm I'm ready I'm I Want to be that guinea pig\nThe numbers and everybody can join in the ministry\nThe end of life as we know it might go Guillen next on coast to coast am in for George ...

I had to cut you off but we're going to the bottom of the hour and it's a heartbreak so I couldn't pass on that [noise]\nOh yeah no I was telling you the story of a a murder that happened to Connecticut and or the husband claimed one story and the least looked into it and his wife was murdered and he claimed one story in the\nWhat the police found with a woman was wearing these woman wearing a fit with one of these little smart watches that keeps track of your heart rate how are you walk and so forth and so they downloaded the data from the ...\nAnd they found out that they they could actually get this calculate how many feet she walk and it didn't square with the story from the hospital\nAnd then and then other things started happening with Facebook in other words what I'm saying is sure that that technology out at the husband he ended up being charged with murder ... this kind of a Internet of things that are fine on every aspect of our life that can tell\nBabies and that was I remember that yeah yeah they they won't have soles God didn't make him they won't have soles there'll be like zombies there'll be like and it was like no they weren't so I mean I think\nSome of it as an education piece in and I think that's where a great science writing in science journalism in a book like this is really helpful 'cause it really makes clear to people who how complicated these issues are but what's the great benefit or not for us in the long run that's the part I'm I'm focused on myself anyway and I think\nIf you're you're you're absolutely right and that is why I wrote the book people can have their own opinions but you have to be well informed in order to have a ... right and you write up after you read this book you'll have you'll be well informed and then God Bless you with your opinion\nRight and and God Bless you in five years this book may be totally irrelevant right because by that\nTime so it's a bad since you're gonna have to write a sequel the end of the world is end of life as we know what let me go to Jason in Portland for Michael Guillen on coast to coast Jason yeah\nThey um playing God is kind of baked into I D I F ... when they say that we are created in the image of God that kind of you know is put into\nOur sense then ... now\nInto my question before I get I if I read the uh your schedule right are you going to be on the on the subject of immortality on Tuesday night\nOh coast may be yeah I Will yeah yeah right well we'll give it a little plug for an up [laughter] I think you can you were\nTalking about immortality and I don't know exactly where it is but in the revelation that talked about in mortality and when the wrath of God is or out of a finance fine\nIt says that they will pray that they would die and they were not able to and they asked for the ... mountains in stone to come down and in and cover them up\nAnd are they talking about this this area that you're talking where we've achieved get more\nOut of this is this is an interesting premise again is whether immortality would be a blessing or a curse I'm you know that uh that is the the portrait of Dorian Gray ... what's your thought on that Michael\nWell it's a it's a I have a couple of thoughts about that and that is number one uh you know obviously as a theoretical physicist and and as a serious minded Christian I'm fascinated by finding a references in the Bible that might give us some glimpse are some hint\nAs to what what's in store for us and how it jibes or doesn't jibe with what's going on in science I just find that just it's fascinating intellectually fascinating er and and so I I I'd love to think more about this reference to revelation\nI I think also my other thought is\nYou know do does does a supercomputer and this is this is a kind of ... of a mental a question or a mental experiment that people talk about a lot ... it will\nReach a point where we create an artificial intelligence being whether it's in the form of a big computer server\nOr it's in the in the body of a among careless or a kind of a role of human like robot but get so complex and soul yawn ... you know hasn't existence that is beyond the human experience that you cannot unplug it\nYou know it's like the sky net running it's\nLike running on on energy that it absorbs from the environment I\nMean that's the horror from saying or from the crush souls of the people in stumps on on you know getting on well you get some coffee yeah I get that I think\nThat happens with some of our technology now right after you haven't you ever been in a situation where you know you're you're like trying everything stop you know that it's a piece of machinery is going great stop stop stop and oh I don't like it and it still goes on you know\nA ... tell me but I spent the last two weeks trying to get a kid more elite dishwasher six so ... ... ... those exactly where I'm living and by the way to is somebody with the I mean I have a masters of divinity degree I Would just say\nIt's really interesting about the Bible in this the the only problem is the Bible is multi vocal on the subject\nOf immortality life after death et cetera so it's really great because it creates more conversations but it doesn't always result them so keep that in mind let me go to a let me go to a ... who is in Arizona on coast to coast am David\nGoing hey my question for a minute or so ago and the ethical and moral conflict created by doing these things artificial intelligence\nA new one would be the result\nYou keep breaking up dude you're killing me because it sounds like a really good question [laughter]\nYeah and then or if they do we just lose him and we just lost [laughter]\nOh no Well James is in the in the Washington loose trying to him well we still have a minute for Michael Steele and before we go to open lines coming up on coast to coast James\nYeah I uh I enjoy your show but uh I've been on any kicking machine going on forty five years yes er here and I was a bank or do generation I'd like to know from your gas to remove pills that these two will\nBe overcome through ... or or a maybe a genetically modified pigs I'll take my answer off the air and\nHang in there James hang in there James we need everyone there you go ahead Michael\nYeah what what what kind of I didn't get what kind of machine as\nHe's on dialysis is on ... and he has macular degeneration\nJust like my friend yeah no I think this is where are the technology really is very hopeful\nUm they they are making enormous strides now or with restoring people's fight with macular degeneration I've actually interviewed a woman who had the operation and you know even though her\nFight if they'll not crystal clear she can she can make out shapes and it's given her an enormous amount of independence but we're\nMaking enormous strides are already working there's this one company in particular in California I talk about that are is already working on a second\nGeneration a that will help actually restore\nSight the people who are born blind not never mind with macular degeneration so I see a lot of hope on that also in the kidney front I don't think we need to create these by merit a there's a lot of great research and I've reported on on for ABC News and elsewhere where they are now able to create using stem cells\nOr ... it might create a artificial Oregon so\nThat are more tailored for the the person yeah yeah I'm In\nTheir brother is you know that that is really where the technology is very helpful\nAnd that's where we left ended

long I I started out listening to art bell and I've tried to call in a couple of hundred times this first time I've gotten through this is such a great privilege it if I can and I would like to share something a ... about the Bible a\nAnd there's a great truth that we need to realize in any discipline uh\nAny discipline that you study whether it be science or whether it be ah the Bible for instance uh you can't just take a sip if you go to the wealth of knowledge you need to take a drink and the and the Bible as something to be studied and pondered over\nThree of the model the aesthetic religions from the middle east began their roots with the Bible and and polluting the ... the Korean has deep roots in the Old Testament and\n... and the Newton is in the New Testament to the current New Testament yeah I mean\nThe the story the story of the prophet Jesus and the Koran is is significant it's a it's a big portion of the current\nThat try and even the story of the floods\nThe story of Jesus in the ... all of that validates not counting the historical values a historical cruise you know that that line up\nWith a so many of the stories in the Bible or many of the many of the critics don't believe that it's even possible for Daniel to be real because\nOf the historical value of the book uh Daniel is so accurate and ah and if it hadn't been found and the dead sea scrolls you know they ... they were you know people would have said well it was impossible for Daniel to know as much of the future as far as he did but\nThat that Cruz when you look at the troops there and you look at a big picture the heart the grace of the Old Testament and the New Testament this has done so much for humanity\nYou know oh I agree I agree we yeah we stray\nAway from that and people and people like to take two or three versus\nAn edge a whole right that's terrible whole book or you know and they'll a skilled in\nAnd you know it's called proved texting and it's yeah it's there's a there's an old saying I've I've said it before I go ... but as soon as the first in St learned in seminary was\nThat some people um some people rely on a on scripture I'm like a drunk leans on a lamp post not so much for the looming nation but for support\nAnd I think it's the illumination part that I always go for another support I like I like it when I find new things that make me think differently and I'll tell you some interesting about the current I don't know if you know it just sounds like you're a learned guy but\nI did a um I I was writing I wrote an article about um about\nThe true crime texts I'm interested in how true crime stories are told and I was interested in how many troops um how many murders stories there are in the Bible and that the basis for true crime as we know it today the ... the popular genre on any platform that the basis for that\nIt starts in the Bible and that these true crime stories really are these murders stories or or had the same effect they're teaching us a lesson which is what these murders stories still do what I found was when I looked at um the ways stories were told in the Koran they actually use the word murder\nWith regard to Jesus they where is the Bible says you know in in the Greek portion of the the ... of the Bible in the New Testament the Greek word says kill\nBut actually the word that's often used uh the Arabic word is the Jesus who was murdered and I find that very a very interesting distinction that that Muslims see that and that's the way they look at it and he was murdered and I don't think murder comes up a lot when we think about him in a Judeo Christian context but I'm just throwing that out\nYet I don't know if they find that interesting or not but I did\nThat that corporate I Want to be careful how I say this do you think that corporate Christianity has a you know or Christianity for higher so to speak where people are wanting to\nBuild a\nLegacies you'd think that that has hurt us and gotten us away or you are from the central message of the\nBible in a whole ah\nYeah I think I think your question answers that you know and I think that what we you know I think anytime there's always been the big difference of shooting a bullet in the name of God or taking a bullet in the name of God and I'm I'm In the taking the bullet camp [laughter]\nI'll take the bullet in protecting somebody else I'm a ... you know people go way far onto their way to create these\nStructures were there shooting people killing other people in the name of God and I uh that's where I

I'm always thinking along spiritual lines and with the decline [noise]\nUm [noise] I I ... I'm interested in a book called the ... yeah\nI'm from the from the turn of the last century right\nYeah yeah I think it was published in ah like you know eight um apparently with what they pay according to the production in the book it was kind of transcribe not written transcribed by Levi Dowling who transcribed it from the classic record\nFor no also known as a book of remember is another way of putting it [laughter] I'm headed with this book because it is her role in many ways for for gospel um and and describing like Jesus and also covered like that so called missing years of his wife\nA highly ... ... years or so [noise] um but it does talk about the different ages and that the full of full title of the book is the current gospel of Jesus karma the price of the highest in age\nAnd somewhere and I'm a I'm not an expert on this book but I'm fascinated with the idea of the return of the Christ that I'm not in a lot of conservative Christian I'm ... I'm more in line with the Quakers\nAnd I'm fascinated with the idea of um the beginning of an age and when they get the current age began if their disagreement about\nThat oh yeah ours is that I'm going to determine oh go ahead I'm Sorry\nNo no no you're you're you're bringing I'm just commenting on your question is you go along ... yes\nI think there's a lot of debate about what age we're in for and this is this comes at the same argument gets made about modernism and post modernism Marxism and ... you know all we can never do is the arise because we can't there's no there's no met a\nData so that we can tap into that explains oh no no you tripped into the age of Aquarius in the year ... so yeah I think all we can do is we ... we I think we ...\nUse that to try to make sense ... of of periods of history and it it just it makes it it gives us a frame for what's something that just otherwise you'll be completely ... the way for us to try to understand\nThe time period in which we live I I spend a lot I mean I can remember this conversation about the aquarium Bible cause I looked it up several times and\nAnd it's very interesting I mean I don't I don't have any argument for or against it just sort of like it it's sort of exists out there especially the part about that period of time the missing so called years I'm big because there's a lot of different books that address that oh well did they all tell the same story though do you\nI don't know I'm not familiar with all the ... the only one I'm familiar with recovery right your dad wanted a wrap it up quickly a lot of could go in about ...

night the uh the book that I think you will love hear the story of the men from the train\nOr as scary as that story is um it's still not as scary in some respects and some of the things that are happening in science and that's why Michael dealing with Clint joined us just a minute a couple of things in crypto news tonight though there is a strange cloud on Mars\nAnd if you go to coast to\nCoast am dot com you can find out more about that story that may come up when we go to open lines in the third and fourth hours of the show also the ah the story about the small town which claims to be the most haunted place\nIn America and uh and when cameras\nCaptured ghosts all of those stories are in the news segment and coast to coast am\nDot com but there's also this other story on the top of the fold right in the carousel on the top of the website it goes to ... am dot com and that's this string of play a little bit of it here give me a heads up on it because I Love to get back to this coming up later on in the show wrote in\nDowntown Oregon City here our parents just like at least in theory behind paranormal activity\nWitness that fine zero trees candidates dispensary behold

later on but you can go see the whole story and coast to coast to him to come and look at the video and then try to explain that coming up later on okay how does that jar move on its own and then the thing with the pencils I I don't know\nYour ... believe me there there's a lot to talk to a and about coming up on coast to\nCoast am and we'll start with Michael Guillen who is here the end of life as we know it\nOminous news from the frontiers of science is his new book but you might know him better from an ABC News or from the History Channel where he hosts the show or from his other books including a novel the no prophecy a he's in LA guy or you are you a dodger's fan Michael\nWell uh you know what I grew up rooting for the Dodgers are but I spent a lotta years in Boston\nHarbor day of my son was born in ... and I don't know I'm kind of caught between a rock and a hard [laughter] I understand that that's why I asked it uh at\nA later on or if you are obviously you you achieve great heights both in academia and in media and you are amongst I think an elite group\nOf science reporters people who actually write nonfiction about science in in a very accessible way or we put you in the same category as Mary Roach are you a fan of hers\n[noise] you know I I I'll be honest with you I'm not familiar with Mary Roach\nOh you're missing missing terrific how man\nBut you know she's a she's a frequent guest year and but very very entertaining and she writes I'm always about science and so she lives to explore particular subjects and so her book on for example what happens to the body after we die called stiff\nOr ... or packing for Mars and when she talked she tried to learn what it'll be like to go to Mars and all the things that would happen and she is just very I Love it\nYou know she's grey and you'd really like her in this kind of ... it was reminiscent to me a little bit on how you were getting into the subject because you handle it with a very\nUm [noise] a very non scholastic approach it's the science is there but um anybody can follow these stories in everybody probably should if you want to get a glimpse into what the future\nIs all about this what else to be a great gift for for Christmas if you if you have a a young scientist and you're on your list some urban old scientist for that matter but looking ahead you know I ... if you pardon the pun I was just talking about Larry King and he was he was talking about he he believes he's a big believer\nIn cryogenic [noise] yeah yeah a lot you know there's also that famous baseball connection with you Ted Williams family and ... and but I mean I what what is the science\nThese days on something like that and how realistic is this would disappear for somebody like Larry King to hope that he would be able to come back again and take his place behind home plate and\nIf you are [laughter] well first of all thank you for the kind words I I have spent my entire life ... eye and say try to make it as interesting as I can you know I spent fourteen years at\nA a thing as a human vacated good morning America twenty twenty Nightline and you know you have to have to make things interesting or they'll give you the hook basically [laughter] uh I kind of cut my teeth on that\nAs far as cryogenic is concerned you know it's interesting you bring that up and I covered the cryogenic story over the years\nAh you know they're in the stories that I Walk with me had his head a frozen and ah with with the hope one day of of being brought back to life the head being the most important part because it carries our memories are and so forth and so on but you know I got to be honest with you that's like old school um\nWhat I ... in a sense that\nNow with what's going on with robotics and so forth ... saw it more likely that um\nWhat Larry King is going to want to do is you know before he kicked the can uh you know he's going to want to upload all his thoughts and memories or onto a super computer and then downloaded onto it very realistic robot so that Larry King [laughter] can ah\nCan remain behind home plate you know indefinitely into the future but I'm Serious\nYou know in in my book um the end of life you know what I deal with the four big topic areas or the first is the worldwide Web the second is artificial intelligence robot\nThat third has to do with privacy and surveillance technology and the fourth has to deal with genetic engineering so between genetic engineering and artificial intelligence robot\nMan I'm telling you Larry King is going to be around for a long long\nAnd I was reading some of those sections and I thought that was interesting because there really as you said when he was very I think you mentioned like ... once the book and there's not a big emphasis on it but there is still this hope that people have about\nPreserving their essence and and then that becomes of course a full debate about what we're is the seat of the essence of us you know we used to think the soul was the heart and the head contained all of the you know the the computer works but\nBut ... ... ... how realistic is it ever in the near future that we would be able to upload\nThoughts in dreams like you might expect from Minority Report being able to capture them and then put them into something else\n[noise] I think it's very real or in I mean you know ... and you indicated about my book being about the future but but the truth of it is it's really about what's going on right here and right now even as we speak and ... and labs all over the world\nI tell for example the story of Iran ... are being very very involved well you know he's involved in Dr ...\nThen that's where we go with the next ... the classic study so much so that the pope wrote fetus at

instructor of physics at Harvard as well as the author and the new book\nIs a is just great it's the end of life as we know it and just before we went into the break we were talking about that that space in discussions of what we should didn't want to do which\nMight be better informed by discussions of\nMorality as much as ethics and and you know I think even Michael when you were talking about\nAbout the idea of preserving physical life uh on this planet is like ... whether that was through uploading a brain putting it into something you know into a robot or something you know even that it makes me\nSo um the question then becomes do we I mean you know it's exciting it's it's interesting it's it's like science fiction come true but then when you get past all that kind of the bells and whistles of it all you have to ask you know we really want to do this and there's an even deeper question that I raised\nIn the book and that is with all the genetic engineering were doing and you know the extent these the extinction efforts alright do come under the category of genetic engineering\nWhy we're doing in is something that's never been done before\nAnd that is we are elevating recessive trait\nAnd we're going to trade in other words we're flying in the face of the very forces that have created these species the evolutionary forces sure we're defining\nThe natural flow were defined the natural order of things and you kind of believe that when you take on Mother Nature remember the old commercial you know don't mess with Mother Nature or something like that\nYeah it's not nice it's nice to mother nature\nThat one yeah it's not nice I forget what it was the commercial was margarine I it was very mired in for a merger and right yeah I mean we all know margarine is not so great for us but\nYou gotta wonder that because we are doing this we now have the ability of elevating recessive traits and suppressing dominant trait were flying in the face of Mother Nature we had to pay a price and he can't do that you're you're\nYou're fighting against you know a ... billion according to science you know billions of years of evolution right where we need to do that if we take it on or who was going to be the casualty I'm thinking we are\nYeah I you know this is the ultimate question and I I mean you know I was reading the DEA extinction thing and I'm not sure that if they brought back to quote unquote a wooly mammoth what we really wouldn't have is just a wooly your elephant\nYou know but much in the same way that we have a sweeter orange right where we have a a a a juicy your beach or something that people do by flipping genetic codes around here there and I'm not saying that that smart either but but I think I'm more worried about\nSome of this idea about the the ... some of the robotics that you talk about and and what that what that really means who's gonna decide\nWhen robots have really gone far enough and are we going to be in a situation as crazy as it sounds words like sky nut and it'll be too late the robots will you know there'll be self teaching and we're out\nWell you know again that's a very real possibility I um\nI tell this story about a this guy I think his name as a Anthony ...\nIs a former Google engineer a big into driverless cars I'm so he he he helped launch way mo which is the driverless car a division of of Google right and then went to her and then got involved in this ugly lawsuit about stealing industrial secrets and so for the phone but\nHe recently applied to the IRS and was granted I'm a tax exempt status for what he's calling the church of artificial intelligence and\nYou know on the surface that sounds a little bit crazy but when you look into what the thinking his thinking behind doing this he's he's basically saying this look if we continue in the trajectory we're now on\nIt it it is inevitable that one day\nA artificial intelligence robots powered by artificial intelligence will will become so much more intelligent than we that they really reached the level of a deity they they they are in effect\nGod because they know everything they see everything they they control everything if we give them that kind of freedom and so we may as well just start getting ready to worship it because\nWe want to stay on its good side because the guy who did that this technology we're creating will run amok\nAnd you know you start thinking well okay it's a little ... crazy this guy but\nYou know it's not that far fetched because the rate at which artificial intelligence is\nIs developing you know I talk about how it beat the pants off of the chess champion and then the checkers champion and now it can beat the champs it to you know Texas hold them poker and the uh the gang go which is generally conceded to be the most complicated game most ancient game around go yeah\nYou know ... you write in artificial intelligence now can beat the pants off her you know the the goat champion and so it's pretty that writing is on the wall in I mean it it's pretty clear that these computers and not just going to become fans there they're no longer just anti adding machine there no there is no longer just doing computations\nAh but they're they're becoming more adept at doing things that we both are we want spoke about being very good at that well you know like you they're ... button that up I think they're generally like he was still pretty small but\nYou know one day they're general IQ is or seem to be even greater than ours that the day of singularity that's for the day and all and ... when they will have the equipment I you you know ten thousand a hundred and twenty five so yeah\nI think the interesting these are the Jewish it ... the equation is which used it a hundred and twenty five and we're using that as like a horizon line for human intelligence right we go with an IQ one twenty five\nBut at the smarter machines get and the more the takeover of our day to day activities\nAnd or the more they do things for us and we allow them to be in the driver's seat of our lives who's just said that that that average you know I used to go to drop ten points\nSo we we'd like to think that we might day but the more we get cushy our brains get ... and who knows it might be a lot we might be bringing on her own physical demise faster than\nRight than we would have possibly imagine\nNo I like that the cushy Murphy app yeah I'm right because you know what the old saying if you don't use it that you lose a yeah no but I talk about I think I caught one guy that said you know it may very well be that we are in the process\nOf creating our own conquer\nNow how ... easy with that the right now I fully believe that completely and I do and let's pick this up coming up after the top of the hour because I'm saying like like marriages like democracy like friendship [noise]\nI think our life as we know it is much more fragile than people would like to

I Know several people who have a ... who have a trouble walking or the law\n... been spinal injuries and\nAnd this to them as dream ... do you just being able to walk across the room because of a of an ... skeleton that carries their body or ... or muscles are stimulates their muscles are all three ... I I Can't think of a downside to that other than the military application I guess\nA but where are you with that one\nNo I I agree with you I'm a and I I think that yeah the the discussion that I have in the book about\nTrans humanism and you know that's it there's actually a movement are called the trans human movement where as you say the uh the ideas to enhance ourselves one way or another using technology and I\nBreak it down into three categories as the usable a trends human augmentation there's so there's usable wearable and then there's implantable\nAnd I I agree with you I I there this is an area where I see very little downside\nI mean I tell the story of the sky from Dayton, Tennessee who he was the power lines when he touched a high voltage line that was lying on the ground and he'd lost both arms to the zap them right off\nNow here's a guy who would have you know live the rest of his life you know of severely crippled\nAnd now scientists are creating for him what are called neuro prostheses prostheses but the these are artificial arms but not like your grandfather's artificial arms you know that we're mechanical\nThat requires you to wear a harness and you have to ... you\nKnow these are these are arms that he can move with his thought so they're they're wired\nTo his mind and I mean isn't fantastic oh yeah and\nAnother story that I'd tell about the woman who is a quadriplegic and now you\nKnow she she's able to have some level of independence and uh because of of some of the trans human augmentation um so I Know I I agree with you and maybe even end um [noise] even\nIn the military setting I mean if we if we can outfit our soldiers so that\nYou know they're wearing an exoskeleton I talk about how on day has come up with some stuff there you know where you know write it just it just it it you know so so or a soldier who's out there and he's carrying you know what I fifty sixty pound backpack\nYou know if if if they if we can give them an extra fell a skeleton to take some of that load off their own skeletons I I think that's a\nI I think it would be a stretch to find fault in something like that\nOr maybe but neither seen robocop more times than you have I mean I think that\nMean and I do I'm not I'm not being facetious I think that's the only one I'm here's why there's always this belief somehow that if we can\nIf we can come up with the technology um that saves our soldiers from from harm inevitably that that gets weaponized into and yeah we can invade without losing any soldiers and therefore there's no political consequence\nYeah from the ... and ... ... and ... you know back to 'em that idea about I'm about maybe some of our advancements should not be consequence free is that I think that that's the ... I get worried a little bit and maybe that's the science fiction part of me then I see\nThat politicians would rebel at the thought of not having to be accountable for anybody's death\nBy having super soldiers that can go in and take whatever we want 'em until the embittered enemy that we've created does this one but then in ... new arms race\nNo no you're absolutely right in and I again I talk about that but you know it's interesting as you look ahead to what this technology is pointing to\n[noise] and ah you know we're talking about enhancing sold a human soldiers abilities but I think are equally realistic will be a you know a robot warriors and effect Terminator like warriors that will be our surrogates going into war and so we ...\nCould possibly go wrong there [laughter] yeah [laughter] and you know I quote that sounds like a plan [laughter] yeah\nI Know and and now and and the ... group you know I caught them in the book in Russia is very upfront about them doing that they're I mean they're in the process of doing that and they're talking about unveiling some of their stuff soon or using their own that says it's just a fancy way of saying these are robot warriors that have human like brain\nThe question then becomes\nDo you give such warriors the right\nTo make the decision to shoot or not should in other words you give them complete autonomy and and that is called the Terminator conundrum right now yeah nations are thinking about well gee if we give our robot warriors complete autonomy then\nThat basically going to make Russians do the same thing and now we're going to be as you said a moment to go in\nWe're going to be now and another escalating arms race\nRight you know ... in some ways you know ... that I often I often think to myself you know\nAll this technology is brand new it's unprecedented\nBut we can are just still the same you know all our faults in our foibles and our weaknesses and are downsides just get magnified by this technology is the technology doesn't eliminate our weaknesses in our foibles and are downsides you you know what I'm saying to you\nYeah I Do and ... and ...\nAnd yet I Would propose to you may be the biggest problem we would face in the law of unintended consequences would dictate\nThe Sarah Connor conundrum\nNot the Terminator conundrum but the Sarah Connor ... which means if you can't win a conventional war\nBecause you're over welcomed by the technology of the your opponent you go unconventional and you go gorilla end this creates more terrorism ... you know I mean\nThat's that's how eventually she was able to beat the I don't want to spoil the ending for some term in there but you know I mean that's how that's how you know she will one is eventually learning to to you know to go to grill her way out of it not to face the enemy but to be the enemy by you know going\nUh and his weaknesses but but positive person because whenever you mentioned Russian scientist I'm reminded of the story\nAbout the the scientists want to put a a a a new head an old had on the new body\nRight yeah yeah okay well had transplants yeah yeah\nOkay so let's let's pick that up [laughter] that's one of those that's one of those\nHalloween he kind of moments right there were like All right now there's this is this is one of those nightmare dream things depending on where you are with that I can understand that somebody had um a body that was decaying but their brain was brilliant and you wanted to put it on a new body but then\nWhere does that end and how far along are they in that pursuit\n[noise] yeah well you know what I've been reporting on that story for some years now and um it began with a small number of scientists um\nWho experimented on monkeys and it gets a little grizzly but this being Halloween okay ah where they yeah they severed monkeys head and then they re attached it\nOr just to prove that they could so there's a lot of plumbing involved right I mean you have to show up they the the the veins in the arteries and the nerves and so forth and so on and they've they've scientists have achieved to a level of success with monkeys and so now embolden\nOr by that they are turning their attention to doing it to human and there's at least one guy in Russia who has been quoted a frequently or who is a quadriplegic or you know otherwise mentally very alert\nI I don't want to give away the story but she was murdered in the police started looking into the the situation and the husband was claiming one thing he said there was an intruder and how they came in\nHe killed he killed his wife in the basement and we started looking at things and they found she was wearing a watch\nHang on to that thought because we need to hear the end of that coming up after this break then we'll give the numbers and everybody can join in the ministry\nThe end of life as we know it might go Guillen next on coast to coast am in for George ...\n[noise]\nMy name is ...

I had to cut you off but we're going to the bottom of the hour and it's a heartbreak so I could pass on that [noise]\nOh yeah no I was just telling you the story of a a murder that happened to Connecticut and or the husband claimed one story and the police looked into it or his wife was murdered and he claimed one story in the\nWhat the police found was that the woman was wearing of the deceased woman wearing a fit with one of these little smart watches that you know keeps track of your heart rate how are you walk and so forth and so they downloaded the data from the fit fit\nAnd they found out that the they could actually get this calculated how many feet she walked and it didn't square with the story from the husband\nAnd then and then other things started happening with Facebook in other words what I'm saying is sure\nAnd that was I remember that yeah yeah they they won't have soles God didn't make them they won't have soles there'll be like zombies there'll be like and it was like no they weren't\nSo I mean I think some of it as an education piece in and I think that's where a great science writing in science journalism in a book like this\nIs really helpful 'cause it really makes clear to people who how complicated these issues are but what's the great benefit or not for us in the long run that's the part I'm I'm focused on myself anyway and I think\nIf you're you're you're absolutely right and that is why I wrote the book people can have their own opinions but you have to be well informed in order to have a sense right and you write up after you read this book you'll have you'll be well informed and then God Bless you with your opinion\nRight and and God Bless you in five years this book maybe totally irrelevant right because by that time [laughter] beds and you're gonna have to write a sequel the end of the world is end of life as we know what let me go to Jason in Portland for Michael Guillen on coast to coast Jason yeah\nThey um playing God is kind of baked into I D I F ... when they say that we are created in the image of God that kind of you know is put into\nOur defense and ... now\nInto my question before I get I if I read the uh your schedule right are you going to be talking about the subject of immortality on Tuesday night\nOh coast may be yeah I Will\nYeah yeah right well we'll give it a little plug for an up [laughter] I think you\nCan you were talking about immortality and I don't know exactly where it is but in the revelation that talk about your mortality\nAnd when the wrath of God is or out of a finance fine it says is that they will pray that they would die and they were not able to and they asked for the ... mountains in stone to come down and in and cover them up\nAnd are they talking about this this period that you're talking where we've achieved immortality\nThis is this is an interesting premise again is whether immortality would be a blessing or a curse I'm you know that uh that is the the portrait of Dorian Gray ... what's your thought on that Michael\nWell it's a it's a I have a couple of thoughts about that and that is number one uh you know obviously as a theoretical physicist and and as a serious minded Christian I'm fascinated by finding a references in the Bible\nThat might give us some glimpse are some hint as to what what's in store for us and how it jibes or doesn't jibe with what's going on in science I just find that just it's fascinating intellectually fascinating er and and so I I I'd love to think more about this reference to revelation\nI I think also my other thought is\nYou know do does does a supercomputer and this is this is a kind of ... of a mental a question or a mental experiment that people talk about a lot ... it will reach a point where we create an artificial intelligence bean whether it's\nIn the form of a big computer server or it's in the in the body of a among careless or a kind of a role of human like robot but get so complex and soul yawn\n... you know hasn't existence that is beyond the human experience that you cannot unplug it\nYou know it's like the guy net running it's like running on on\nEnergy that it absorbs from the environment I\nMean that's the horror from saying or from the crush souls of the people\nIn stumps on on you know getting on well you get some coffee yeah I get that I think\nThat happens with some of our technology now right after you haven't you ever been in a situation where you know you're you're like trying everything stop you know that it's a piece of machinery is going great stop stop stop and oh I don't like it and it still goes on you know\nA ... tell me but I spent the last two weeks trying to get a kid more elite dishwasher six so ... ... ... it was exactly where I'm living and by the way to is somebody with the I mean I have a masters of divinity degree I Would just say\nIt's really interesting about the Bible in this the the only problem is the Bible is multi vocal on the subject of immortality life after death et cetera so it's really great because it creates more conversations\nBut it doesn't always resolve them so keep that in my let me go to a let me go to a ... who is in Arizona and coast to coast am David\nYeah hey my question for a minute or so ago and the ethical and moral conflict created by doing these things artificial intelligence\nA new one would be the result\nYou keep breaking up dude you're killing that gives it sounds like a really good\nQuestion [laughter] yeah and if they do we just lose him and we just lost [laughter]\nOh no All right Well James is in the in the Washington Let's try him while we still have a minute for Michael Steele and before we go to open lines coming up on coast to coast James\nYeah I uh enjoy your show but uh\nI've been on and kicking machine going on forty five years yes er here and I was a bank or do trend ration I'd like to know from your guest or when we feel that they too will be overcome through CRISPR or\nA maybe a genetically modified pigs I'll take my uh and throw up here and\nIm hang in there James we need every one of you go ahead Michael\n... what what what kind of I didn't get what kind of machine of\nThe ... years on dialysis is on kidney machines and ...\nJust like my friend yeah no I think this is where are the technology really is very hopeful\nI'm the they're making enormous strides now uh with restoring people's site with macular degeneration I'd actually interviewed a woman who had the operation and you know even though her\nFight it's still not crystal clear she can she can make out fate than it's given her an enormous amount of independence but we're making enormous strides are already working there's this one company in particular in California I talk about that are already working on a second generation\nA that will help actually restore\nSight to people who are born blind not never mind with macular degeneration so I see a lot of hope on that also in the kidney from I don't think we need to create these by merit a there's a lot of great research and I've reported on for ABC News and elsewhere where they are now able to create using them so\nAh ... it would create a artificial Oregon so\nThat are more tailored for the the person yeah yeah I'm In\nTheir brother is you know that that is really where the technology is very hopeful\nThat is where we left ended with Michael ... book picks up the rest of the thank you so much for your time and for your joyful spirits and looking forward to carrying on a with open

before we go to open lines I just want to play the story I Hope you went to coast to coast am dot com and watched this video of the Oregon pot shops and the moving jar it'd be didn't here's the story on coast to coast am wrote in\nDowntown Oregon City here are here it's just like at least that's the theory\nBehind paranormal activity witness that fine zero treat a can of his dispensary now\nBehold if you dare this surveillance video from August watched the glass tip jar on the counter slowly it starts to move that's Andy ... next to it\nI said what's happening and I felt like somebody was

after that this happened to watch the Penn ... it's completely still and no one's around when suddenly depends begin to move\nAnd if you think the video has been dumped her as a candidate shop that

GM Samantha Davidson says at the turn of the century this building space with\nYou one of ... to ... so yeah so this could have been a pharmacy and maybe there's a real explanation for why there are going there but that video\n... especially ... and the fact that ... what really got me was because it's a kind of a shop law mandates they can't touch the video\nSo what was it I don't know but if you go and look at it you want to jump in an open lines of ... let me go to a Mike in Charlotte North Carolina on coast to coast to get us started Mike\nGood morning hours [laughter] we're good thank you\nYeah Halloween all out of the\nNight the hills run with the blood of our children\n[noise] yes well anyway and right now right now not enough runs in the Los Angeles because it's now going into the are going to be in the Eighteenth aiming for this this World Series game of the question of being whether this show and before that game and where do you want to take off\nOh about your last guest oh dear\nWell\nEverything was fine and the trailer talked about up quoting this month a supercomputer Anglo forever blah blah and one problem\nDownload memory download wash it download mannerism about load actions match by robots now but it all gang because you\nCan't show [laughter] so I'm the feelings and the personality of the uh I I'm with you in spirit I remember the incident on that\nOh the Bible says that there are where nothing because they sleep right uh you know we can try to play God but I I [noise] it's impossible because we are\nGod that's all I\nSay oh it's fair enough I mean I it thanks for calling you know I think the the issue of that sold peace though is a little more complicated so a lot of people would say then\nIt if it's a version if it's forty percent of who you were ... why would need to have a soul if other people out there have you know uh other meant if there are other people who have uh the problems with their mental capacity due to injury or disease\nYou know we don't say it was suddenly they're less human or that they have less of the soul\nI'm so I'm not I'm with you in theory well I'm with you in theology on soul um but I think it is much trickier question than just saying they wouldn't for sure because that used to be the thing that people said about test to babies and I think we're we fortunately moved beyond that\nUh okay let's get to where we got a lot of people standing by which is always fun Aaron is in Richmond, Virginia on coast to coast Aaron\nHi um I and world power guys first of all for not let in for five years I don't want to get too much into it right\nUm after ... ... and I I have a couple of things to say on this whole and mark how are the black for her and I'm a revival manner what had happened the things he ... that were to survive\nI mean wouldn't even know what to do and I said environment now and furthermore\nIn our current situation right now we have there are a lot of people storing up first survival situations and there are a religious groups such as the Mormons who are you know highly compiled surprise for\nFor years to come for for his former rivals\nWith multiple wives with multiple shoulder with multiple multiple and\nUm and we don't really we haven't really touch it whether or not\nThese are usable wrong and we don't know even with training we don't know if the supplies what's known somebody new in a cave\nOr in a whole or in a church or whatever I mean so I Would hurt your on your way to um volunteer myself not to\nA consuming somebody supplies but just chill on my cell and my child\nEven I hesitate to say my child but I Would like to offer a myself to give her trial like for a year on when at the supplies without training without any\nKnowledge of how to use the supplies to just hear somebody heard even his own than cells\nAnd interesting you don't really know even with these like Mormon families if there was a huge disaster you don't know it's going to survive it could be a child it could be a twelve\nYear old called who haven't had any training on how to year the supplies that are stored up will hold or or whatever um\nOkay well I think that's a really interesting proposal and I I ... I I just want to because there's a lot of listeners who are\nA latter day saints and so I just really be a clear for people most LDS do not practice plural marriage really overwhelming number of them do but to her point I was watching on Netflix\nOr there's this series called like the men with three wives zero three wives club or something I don't know but it's about a renegade\nA Mormon sect community and everybody generally in the community has more than one wife and then the following some of these and that's in Utah near Moab\nAnd um and that they they've already talked about saving up than having enough food for these big giant families to last for seven years that's a lot\nI mean and what it even work Kennedy even work I don't know a ... but uh yeah so Aaron's willing to be a volunteer but um I think the only fair if you get to bring your kid\nA John is in a in Kent, Ohio I knew well on coast to coast am done\nRather a I'm happy to have\nA you know I got a kick out of your commercial buffet ghost in the pawn shop and the record that was their name was Andy Gomez remember ... for the monsters yeah\nSure ...
