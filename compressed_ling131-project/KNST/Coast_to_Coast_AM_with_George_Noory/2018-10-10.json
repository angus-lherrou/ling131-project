to experts\nPeople for example in Britain used more anti depressants than almost every other country in the western world but the drugs can cause havoc in the natural world after they pass on to the body the person taking them\n... it's just a disaster gotta be careful\nGoogle Plus I don't use it but Google Plus will be no more but it took more than that being the least impactful social media platform on the Web to killing\nGoogle has announced that it will shut it down and social network after the wall Street Journal reported that the company did not disclose the security vulnerability in the spring and expose private data from hundreds of thousands of Google Plus it counts\nLet's check in with our expert on the Internet luring Weinstein who will of course his disclaimer before we get going go ahead Lawrence\nRight that I did consult the Google several years ago so now what is Google Plus for Google Plus\nIs is a Google a social networking platform it it is the equivalent of Facebook or Twitter is in the Google ... that I've been using it since really became available ... years ago [noise] um it was going to be missed\nWas going to be missed by millions of people you know there's this story for going on for ages oh with a ghost town there's nobody out millions and millions of people use it very happy with it I've been very happy with it [noise] really in a way they were sort of a victim of their own success because when they when they started Google Plus and throughout its entire run\nGoogle decided not to put an ad on it so there was no ... there was no way to buy bonds or post right these are both things that drives people crazy or his\nBook so there was no separate income stream coming from it in the meantime everybody got kind of look or by Facebook into thinking well you got to have the ads you got to have the sponsored post you got to have these things that are manipulating your your time lines and everything and they got a massive number of people\nOnto their platform now of course a lot of people are kind of regret it given what's going on but sizes everything with social media scale is everything and Google just never really got that scale now\nThis brief that occurred well all the right at the top are they currently found out about this for a month ago they should have publicly about that at that time [noise] apparently there is that they really didn't as they found that in a during\nA if I understand that during their own auditing their own security auditing and they didn't have any evidence that it had ever been exploited in other words it with a theoretical bought her ability but apparently nobody knew about it outside of school\nAnd the kinds of information that were that were\nUm theoretically vulnerable where like name and email address no credit card numbers do financial information nothing like that a lot of that stuff that people have with Facebook so they said well why are there things up when there's so much going on right now I mean that's why interpretation and they kind of sat on it\nAnd write and now of course it kinda makes it a convenient I won't say excuse but ... it convenient to kind of a rationale for setting into motion\nTo fund the setting of Google Plus over a period of about a month\nBut they they should have discussed that publicly of the first place you know um and uh it would've been a lot better all around if they had\nIn the meantime all of us who've and using Google Plus all these years of trying to find other places to go we're experimenting with other things\nAnd I'll mention that there the Google commercial version of Google Plus which operates further Gees we the the the business systems where you pay about five bucks a month\nOr per head using it that's going to continue so Google Plus we'll be continuing commercially [noise] uh and and we'll just have to see what happens competing with Facebook probably a ... and facebooks turf with probably not a good idea and the first place\nAt the time at ... at the end at the time that it seems like a logical thing to do you know you don't want to miss out but as we've seen the way Facebook did it to to have that an enormous growth has now trip them up and a lot of serious ways to so there's positives and negatives to all these\nAnd one quick question I hear Snapchat is going broke where did you hear\nA apparently Snapchat having all kinds of all kinds of problems I guess their stock has been a walloped yeah that's a very well uh their their founder has been sending out there you know kind of\nMessages to the troops the kind of try to cheer them up uh it it it appears that some pretty serious mistakes were made along the way when they when they tried to grow\nA that that could happen when you're trying to grow rapidly ...\nYou can live off the ball and you and you can really uh\nFall flat later on whether or not they have shot that that will be able to pull out of this I I

this book did it surprise them\nIt's a great question I'm often asked that I Would say yes they were very surprised to hear that but I think as I told people about the evidence that I was referring to people parked up and we're interested in the fact that I was taking the time to research and write a book on this topic\nNow let's talk a little bit about some of the things you uncovered that you didn't really know about before to lump in the ... cycle ... says you you of course learned a little bit about them but you learn more as you did more be research didn't you\nYears ago during the television days they would hire anchor people lose people are based on a system called the ... skin test\nAnd it was a series of electrical impulses that they would hook up with audience members to and then they chew videotapes of various anchor people and the the ones that showed the most remarkable response\nOr from the audience because of the skin test they're the ones that got hired a they were looking for some kind of reaction from people and the person who just you know didn't register at all on the meter\nOr with the people in the audience they never got hired I I don't know if they still use that or not but it was amazing technology back in the seventies\nWell that's the type of technology that is being used in presents men experiments measuring skin response\nMuseum work no psycho Comey says is the ability to move objects with your brain what did you uncover their\nRight again this is something that doesn't make any sense at all under the materials paradigm consciousness is considered to be at the phenomenon of the brain it comes out of the brain has no effect on the world\nWhat I found in my research is that that might not be true and I think the most compelling studies that had been controlled or once again that show very subtle effects\nAnd they were actually done a primarily at Princeton University which is interesting because I went to Princeton University and I had no idea of these studies were being run\nA Dr Robert Johnson who was the former dean of engineering a rocket scientist ran a lab for nearly Thirty years running these studies and he also looked at remote viewing but he also he looked at psycho can east is which is disability for the mind that matter\nThe classic study uses random number generators these machines that spit out the heroes and once in a totally random fashion so again if we look at probability overtime a random number generator will have fifty present their oath in fifty percent one over time\nWhat the experiment does is ask people to put their mental attention to the machine to make it produce more ones and zeroes for example and the person doesn't even have to be in the same room\nSo they say hey I'm pleased put your mental attention to the machine and make it produce more ones and zeroes again what do we find is that there is a small but highly statistically significant effect where it seems as though the mind is is changing the what used to be random behavior of the machines\nRandom generators picked up a some incredible responses during the tragedy of nine eleven in two thousand one\nThey did not know what the time what was happening what was going to happen but they felt something was going on because these random generators mark just went ballistic and in people people have that ability or yeah\nThat's right George ... those me or perhaps even more remarkable and this is part of the global consciousness project was which was an offshoot of the Princeton study where these machines the random number generators\nWere set up around the world so people weren't even necessarily aware that the machines were they're generating these numbers and what the experimenter have done is look at the behavior of the machines around the world\nAround events that we know are produced heightened emotions and nine eleven as one example of what we know that people had heightened emotion and it happened at a concentrate basically at a at a single moment that we can look at what was happening when everyone was focusing their attention or many people are focusing their attention on the events\nWhat do we find that there was a spike at nine eleven but in the case of nine eleven which is even more fascinating to me is that the spike happened before the planes hit the towers\nBefore the event yeah\nBefore the event which suggests almost a global pre premonition that this was going to happen\nOr a yellow her you know that name of course an incredible ability or you've you believe what he did for ... she had the ability to bend spoons and keys and everything else with his mind now there are some who said knowledge trickery its magic\nBut the new people believe that he had that ability\nYou did some incredible things and a candidate B. taught can cycle can ... be taught\nWell I've heard of of food and bending party which sounds ridiculous but ah I've looked into it and it appears that people train themselves to be able to use their mind in a way to to affect matter beyond just a random number generator where it's actually\nBending metal for example and ... is an example where many credible people have suggested that what he can do is real\nIncluding um Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu who sat in a two thousand Fifteen television interview that he saw Keller but then there are many people who have suggested that this is real I'm a side note on your Keller\nVery interesting I mentioned the CIA documents earlier\nThere's another document that I clued in my book an end to upside down thinking that talks about Ehlers abilities but not in the context of spoons pending it's in the context of remote viewing mhm bellies and what they say and this is a direct quote from a classified document\nWhere he was he was put under very I mean they were watching it closely what the documents that is as a result of Keller success in this experimental period we consider that he has demonstrated his paranormal perceptual ability in a convincing and unambiguous manner\nSo yeah there has been a lot of debate about him but the documents suggest that studied were around and he was able to perform which I think should open up to the possibility that maybe he was able to do things using his mind that sounds totally crazy\nMark would you give out your website and

the heart stopped after a certain amount of time there is no blood flow to the brain and the brain stopped functioning\nSo if there is minimal or no brain functioning we would not expect people to have these experiences that are so\nTo them and as I mentioned earlier sometimes what they report during the near death experience when they're out of their body is verified as being accurate later I'm One example in particular is\nFrom Dr Sam party up in a peer reviewed journal called resuscitation in two thousand fourteen one of the patient in particular had a very vivid out of body experience where he heard something in the room\nIt was later found to be the difficulty later and we know that this happened during the time he had no brain functioning because the times were being stamped and we know when the defendant later went off and it made it very distinctive sound and yet this person came back and describe the sound in the room that happened when his brain was off\nWhere they've been cases as well where somebody is literally gone through this new experience there floating above their body they see the nurse and the doctor and everybody in attendance\nTalking about the person you know well sorry we're losing enemies dying or whatever then they come the person comes back into his body and tells the attending doctor exactly what he heard and it boggles your mind\nAbsolutely it doesn't make sense according to this material is perspective that we need a functional brain in order to have conscious experience and memories\nAre but what I've found is that there are very credible scientists that are looking at this for example the University of Virginia the division of perceptual studies at the med school has looked at this very closely and Dr Bruce Grayson as one person in particular\nWho's looked at these phenomenon and is is finding that something is happening when the brain is not functional and people are able to report things like what you described where they couldn't have known about things through normal means and it seems as though their brain was off and they said something that was accurate which is not by definition if not who's the nation\nMark who you are on six hundred and twenty terrestrial radio stations as we speak and they're all sending out signals in the cities and markets that they are in you can't see those radio signals but they're out there\nIs that a little bit what what this is like consciousness were sending out signals that you can't really see what they're out there\nThat such an important point I think we tend to be biased by what are ordinary a perceptual systems can tell us particularly our eyes and our ears but we know it's not even controversial to say that our eyes show or a small sliver of the electromagnetic spectrum\nAnd what we're dealing with here may be something totally separate from the M spectrum but we know that our eyes only show us a very small sliver of reality so I Do think that maybe there are things beyond what our normal ordinary perceptual systems can show us at our existing but we just don't perceive them\nAll right let's take some calls here for you as they begin to line up and I've still got a whole slew of questions for you mark and by the way for a non scientist you're doing an incredible job on this topic you've learned a lot damage\n[laughter] I have and I hope to summarize it in a way that a general audience can absorb it\nLet's go to bill from West Hartford Connecticut kid in Connecticut billed by the way is an amateur astronomer and an atheist hey bill\nHi George Hi Hi Mark yes I Am a rational atheist than a materialist however I Do think that there is something to near death experiences I Do think ah\nThere is this phenomena going on I just think regarding and the ease and uh where where the mind I Would use the word mine not sold but mind or ... or or or exist temporarily during the ... is not heaven or hell in a religious sense just like there's no God or no devil\nI Would call an energy dimension or an energy universe and I have a new term for it I Would call it may be seeing you ... you know space no time a dimension but my question to you is specifically\nA I liked it sort of question your whole premise by talking about site medications explains psychiatric medications\nMedications for either anxiety\nOr depression whether it's anti anxiety drugs Claude ... antidepressants or major tranquilizers neural ethics fact\nChemical have the brain and therefore they do affect\nChemical you the consciousness meaning the mind so by changing biologically biochemical you the brain to these medications or even aspirin or Tylenol ibuprofen can it can affect the brain is through the headaches going back to psych made it can affect the brain chemically we know that positively\nAnd in the mind that's my first part my second part of the same one question is Alzheimer's disease dementia affects the brain does affect the conscious is the mines dusting that show it here's my question for you it doesn't show that\nIf the mine and the brain are not the same thing at least the brain is connected to the minus connected to the Braves and I'm trying to say\nThank you very much for your question bill and this is something I Do address in the book and I've thought a lot about personally because we do know that there is a strong correlation between what happens in the brain and the type of conscious experience we have whether it's ... medications or\nIf someone gets in a car accident and then has cognitive impairments we know there's a correlation what I argue and and some others argue this as well is\nThat correlation does not always imply causation in other words just because two things are related to one another\nWe can't automatically concluded that one causes the other\nSo here's this simplistic example from Dr Bernardo Castro when when I mentioned in my book imagine you have a fire\nLots of firefighters show up\nYou have a larger fire\nMore firefighters show up\nA very strong correlation between the size of the fire and the number of firefighters that appear at the scene\nWe know however that the firefighters did not cause the fire that's not the nature of the relationship\nBut the firefighters are highly related to the fire so I've used the brain in a bit of a different way with the brain is highly related to consciousness\nDamage the brain you you'd take psych med the brain and consciousness will be affected but the brain I view it more as like a filtering mechanism or like an antenna receiver which similarly which show a strong correlation between what's happening in the brain unconscious experience but it's not the producer of consciousness\nWhen what do you think mark reincarnation\nWell I have a chapter on that in my book and I know about the studies done at the University of Virginia I think there is evidence for it\nWe we've had some incredible stories to people who have talked about their past lives including little children uh and it just does remarkable when they're checked out\nThere's no way that they would know certain things unless they experienced it is it's it's mind boggling isn't it\nGeorge I agree with you it's chapter eleven of my book and I think the most compelling cases in addition to children being able to recall thing that they shouldn't have any way of knowing\nA man or sometimes they're five by medical records by the UVA professors is in some cases the children have birth marks or physical deformities that are very specific that matched the way the child describes dying in the previous life\nYes and in some cases the medical records are found so it's it's something that's beyond genetics beyond environment which are the two factors typically considered to affect the physical something else is going on and the researchers call it a third factor\nOr a person's petrified of water and then somehow a in hypnosis they died in the past life by drowning let's say\nExactly so it's preferences and fears that somehow or transferred to something beyond the body seems to be a transfer from one existence to another ostensibly\nWe

native folks that lived in that country that made that animal look pretty sacred animal\nAbsolutely let's get a quick reaction from you mark is the time was clicking by here no there's no question that if science skin see the things Steven just said we're on our way isn't it\nYeah even raises a number of really good point about the need to study these phenomena much more to understand the nuances of how it all works I don't think we understand some of the mechanisms because it hasn't been studied widely enough and that's largely because it's so taboo particularly an academic institutions even\nAbout these things I've talked to scientists who say that it's a academic suicide effectively to talk about these things before getting tenure so that's another reason I really wanted to write the book and but the evidence in one place for people to hopefully open up the conversation so that it's not such a taboo topic\nWell Steven as a scientist admits that there's something very strange going on you know what it is but he's open to at least say that it's unusual in different than you know something could be happening\nMhm [noise] well we haven't talked much about quantum mechanics here but it's a field\nThat has been around for over a hundred years which is accepted in the physics community as being real but it's totally counter intuitive\nThere's a phenomenon known as entanglement\nAnd the very basic phenomenon is you have to particle two pieces of matter that are physically distant from one another\nAnd when you that one you affect the other simultaneously like an instantaneous effect\nWhich suggests that there's some hidden interconnectedness now ... Albert Einstein did not like this at all he called it spooky action at a distance because he thought the speed of light what the faster than anything the travel and yet here we have an instantaneous connection between ... articles\nThat there are things in the ... the average of reality that are totally counter intuitive but we just don't see them in our everyday lives\nHas this changed your life\nIt absolutely has I think from the standpoint of understanding human potential and what we can do like ugly this it opened me up completely but also it's it's introduced the notion that interconnectedness the idea that we're not actually separate even though it appears that we are\nAnd that takes on that brings a whole new meaning to things like altruism which\nIf we're all connected than helping another is really a version of helping ourselves but\nTo me that it hadn't implications for interpersonal relationships all the way up to world peace\nOr I my friend mark thank you again in one more time do you bought your website and where people can get your book and into upside down thinking\nThank you George my website is mark ... dot com and they are K G.

you're reading that I'm thinking oh my God that was only a few days ago right\n[laughter] tell me about Lori Cabot the official which of sumo\n[noise] you know he's very\nA a wonderful woman when I was at that age Fifteen you know she was someone that was barely renowned in the city and she still is um she's known as you know the high priest is in Salem and he'll often\nWhen I was younger I see her walking around town you know dressed in her her garb and very regal looking very um you know she's a big presence of a person and ... at\nThe time people will come up with open arms you did they go oh my God there's er which\nYeah that's a great question she you know there were many people that welcomed with open arms but\nLet's just say the town in Salem not necessarily [laughter] so it always seemed to be at those days it was a little bit of a battle between the businesses and you know and the town in Salem and those who really believed in the witchcraft and um so basically she did you know she really changed\nThe whole way they look at it now you know obviously it's a big tourism right for the type of season and it's you know go to Salem um so I think that it really worked out well for the town of ... you\nKnow you are a few generations psyche trench medium that means we're talking about ... back to your family you said the civility what year who do the start with\nNo my um\n[noise] it's interesting because growing up my mother just\nNever really wanted to I don't know if she didn't want to scare me she just you know my poor father though he thought just those girls insane um but I Would come to her and talk to her about spirit that I was seeing and I to me it was normal it didn't seem unusual I didn't have anything to judge it by um and my mother would just\nYou know God Bless her she'd say oh here's some holy water you know just to you know she told my father she's normal um but she didn't really\nDiscuss it with me a lot until I was older and I was still\nYou know involved but say in the matter of physical and that spiritual around and one day I mean she was with talking you know in their sixties she finally told me that she is you know what Marlene\nThis has been from my family for many many years like her great grandmother and you know her grandmother used to help people in town and he'll them of their illnesses and keep them stop them from bleeding and do readings for them and she\nSaid you know I hear the spirits but I just turn up the radio so would\nYou see that there was a member of your family that was better than another member\nI never you know never really quite thought of that um I Would say that I had you know my grandmother died when she was twenty eight\nSo I never really knew her um but my great grandmother my grandmother rather I did know and she was the one who really got involved with doing readings for people so I heard that\nYou know she was very trusted in her city or in her town um so it's hard to know I mean I don't know have a lot to really judge by in my family history is who was might have been stronger than another\nDo they ever pass dome stories from one to the other the food you could ...\nYou know the only thing that I Do\nHave was given to me and uh I have this little picture of you know and it was my grandmother actually before she had passed and she was maybe\nMaybe five years before she passed and it's interesting 'cause she you have a picture of her and she looks like a gypsy um and my mother used to joke about it and say that that you know\nThat was her true self she was very unique because that's what she said so that the stories that God will always bits and pieces never never anything that was really concrete that I could say I'm about spirits anyway\nNo you've been with the New England the ghost project Maureen since two thousand and one would use that\nA well rounded do much better than me to tell the story but\nHe's started this story after on a near death experience um and he had to work and do a um you know a special course our class that he took to try to to keep him busy when he was hailing from his illness I'm and basically he started doing a cable um\nYou know he started cable program and during that cable program he had to do it on something so he chose you know doing on go set his workshop and again he'll do much better\nAt explaining that I Would focus on but it's a team of individuals that\nYou know over the years I've learned is you know to me everybody is really you know it's a great team of people you work really hard to get to go out and you look for the things that go bumps in the night you know someone else doesn't really want to see one look into that they're quite\nSatisfied not knowing about the unknown or you have someone that really needs help there's been many calls over the years to run in the team um that were you know businesses um you know families you know you'd have restaurants and they don't really want to\nDo I go out and tell the public all the time this was years ago they don't want to tell the public that something is going on that they can't explain and people were getting a little freaked out and they need help\nSo it's really been a journey of love I think to go out and actually worked because we're not paid you know it's not something that we get a pay to go out and do investigations of people it's really going there to to just help them\nHow many people are just off the wall when you go to their house and then you're just using it\nWell off the wall meaning terrified of spirits you off the wall just crazy\nYou know show [laughter] sure why his records I guess\n[laughter] um you know as as it says we've done more than a hundred investigations um I Would say that you know not a hundred percent would we find something active going on at the time but we are big believers to know that you know it doesn't always happen on command [noise]\nUm so I really believe that\nThere are a lot of supernatural things that are going on um if you're aware and you're open to it you might experience it you know some people say well I've never seen it and I don't believe in that well there's good reason why you don't see it [noise] um so if you say how many people I'd say a good percentage of\nParanormal activity does take place out there and I would bet that if you did a poll and you ask people on the street\nYou'd get a good amount of you know maybe Seventy percent of people have had some odd experience they can't really explain and their lives\nWhat did you conclude about what this may be are we a lot of people have their thoughts about what goes on your what do you think there\n\nWell I think there are varying degrees\nOf what they could be right\nSo our experience in my experience over the years has been you know if I Do a reading for someone for instance um I get more of a loving spirit someone that's passed over that wants to communicate and come back and you know let their love when those are okay or maybe has a message for them that they weren't able to give before they pass\n'em but then you know you're called out to some locations where you know\nThings aren't really going while someone's gotten thrown down the stairs items being tossed around the house\nUm there's different you know events like say a you know people walking by and then you might see a spirit walk by and all these plants just die as they're looking at them um we had one case of a woman who was living by herself with the door\nTo door closed in her apartment and yet she was hit on the back of the head with a a ballot stripped from the stairs on you know all these out she'd have something go on in the oven like she'd go to put potatoes enroll them in soil and should lay down and take a nap while they're cooking and yet\nThey would fire would start in her oven I'm it would wake her up with the alarms going off and she'd get up and look and the potatoes underneath on you know on the flames itself [noise]\nSo what do I think I think again as many different varying degrees\nIs of paranormal activity and not all of it just like you don't have a person

[laughter] tossing him at you\nI'd certainly looked ... so you know but there was just a ...\n... what has for you that you know on the cases that you've been in have you ever felt that your life was in danger\nOr ... or did\nNot by the by the levy yeah\nAnd I first book a ghost chronicles is ... is the second book on the series\nA marine and I did an investigation it was a daytime investigations jumped him and call me up and asked me to check out his house so I get ... up and we went to his house and the places that massively looked like it had been trashed and this guy insisted that there was this spirit of a young girl there\nAnd ah so anyways uh they were pretty big ... uh and uh they kind of got us for a while after we did our thing and uh one of them moved separated me from the other one and the other one talked about rain we later found out that\nThat the guy had just been released from prison for murder or a friend of his and uh so he wanted more rain comeback alone but that didn't turn out so if\nThere was any fear was then [laughter]\nYeah she was telling us that story before I Would imagine it's it's one that's left an impression with us I think so\nWhat kind of equipment run do you bring with you\nOr it varies on on on the particular case uh the you know the the larger the um the case you know as far as locations and the more people but more of a piece of equipment a small case the lesser amount but you always want to um\nYou know tried to bring the proper equipment that you would need for instance if you have reports of a ... and being seen you might bring more video equipment or you know like they're ... or ... whatever\nThat you you believe versus a sound equipment or something like that and it was and vice versa if for instance most of the the ... um reports manifested by\nAudio than you would bring more audio cut me so it it it varies appointing we've gotten to a location\nWhat would you say has been the most incredible visualization that you've come across\nThat I'm Sorry what was the word the visualization of a goal visualization\nUm actually I Believe I've seen a full body operations ... probably four times um but the interesting part about it or judges that they weren't really well I was ... times in but more while I was just doing normal stuff yeah\nWork with a lot of White House history funds for him and we do you know public goes on and that type of stuff and there are two separate occasions or one that I Do these goes to his cause I'm On the board of directors of course on top of a White House so we do these haunted toys and one time we were in this um\nIt's ... uh like an observation tower where it's a square\nBuilding with glass all around you and ... windows all around you can absolutely see you know three hundred and sixty degrees\nAnd it was one daughter in and out of it and there was a group of people there and I began talking to them during my ... and I looked outside and I saw a woman a walking on the outside towards the door\nAnd she got about halfway down the side of the world you know going towards the door and I I stopped because I don't want to repeat myself and she came in and they didn't want her to miss anything so I I ... I saw her continually walk all the way to do it and I waited\nAnd waited and yet nobody came in so finally said is there anybody out there and there was a volunteer sitting on the rock out there and there was another one by the door and she's just notice there's nobody out there but yet I saw her as clear as day so clear that I had stopped my field to wait for her to walk it\nAnd yet there was no one there and oddly enough\nThat the vocation is where the coast guard because it's on the coast guard base a coast guard reports and women walking on the wall in that same location so\nThat was kind of intriguing um perhaps the other one which is going to the opposite scale was on a Sunday Morning after we did a public or goes on ah what Iowa light hosts and benefit pool meal main we're in the White House ah keep U.S House it was under\nUm renovation at that time we were sitting on the table in the in the room off the kitchen I look towards the kitchen and I saw a dog will crush the door or the kitchen and ah but I didn't hear anything you know how it drives you hear their claws on the\nYeah yeah the the the there was no it\nWas er sounded out so I jumped up and meal you're into the kitchen\nAnd they'll do I do the door was closed\nSo I came back and spoke to a woman and she says right would you see that's that's our dog she says the the described as a sure absolutely SARS clear as day and I describe that she just stood there and\nShook her head and smiled at me and she says well you know Ron there was a White House keep it here who had a dog and when it was time for him to be relieved them leave the island or the dog wouldn't go so all the\nLighthouse keepers afterward took care of them till the dog actually died and I don't she says the dog you describe pretty much mattresses because she has a dog\nThat that that dog and I did see a picture of it looked like it but can I say that was like no but so I mean is two things that I'm really not looking for it goes but it's certainly saw it would appear to me at the upper Russia\nWhen it's still hangs around Ron stay with us we're going to bring Maureen back and both of you are old will take phone calls next on

I don't know if you've seen that yet or\nNo I haven't seen that yeah it has it's pretty that's your own is our number ... ... dot\nCom but it's pretty cool sorry about that\nMaybe we can concentrate and bring them down from four to nothing\nSo that would be good [laughter]\nWe've been able to do some of that so when when when you go on your team when your team gets together how much research do you do before you go\nWell Maureen doesn't do anything because half the time she doesn't even know where we're going to use\nYeah she was telling us that you you don't want to ah influence\nI I have to know something about it for instance if you're going especially if you go into a big location you have to know a where to concentrate you're you're investigating for instance if\nI'm there are a lot of noise is coming out of particular area you might want to concentrate your audio recordings here if\nIf the or a A R a visual phenomena are in different locations you certainly want to uh you know put your cameras in there and and so you you kind of you have to have a little bit of it I tried to get too much into the details with tour of the coin is for lack of her bed or\nAre you there to discover the ghost or to cleanse it would what did they ask for\nI Am not I think I'm there for ... strictly investigate\nThat's a popular question because then that was one of the things people will say when they read our first book was like oh you know you know what were they doing you know they're not going they're releasing spirits and you know those are things you hear from people but\nYou know they love the book but the whole point is is as one and I've always talked about you know some of those parents have been there long before we have um and we don't know why they're there right so we don't necessarily know if they want help to move on that's one thing if they're there and they don't want to leave who are we to tell them to that they have to\nDoes the person who brings you when do they want the ghost out of there\nI always ask them you know what you want from us you know basically a you know would you expect from us in\nA in a very the cases on that if they're looking for someone who watch like a house cleanse is something we're not going to do it without you know a a referral to someone else um but if they wanted to investigate this to understand what's going on and try to understand what's going on than will do that type of case\nAll right let's take some calls for both of you let's go to the brandy and granted big California Welcome to the program I brandy\nHuh hey thank you for taking my call ...\n... um [noise] yeah I had a question um I've had a really really rough year here that's probably the worst year of my life and [noise] and I'm Wondering if you are able to tell me the\nYear next coming or being a lot better police things starting to go more my way\nMaureen this would be for you\nKnow that's for sure yes [laughter] yes at what um okay so Brandi I did pull a couple\nOf cards for you on and honestly one of the things that I see is a lot of emotional turmoil right so that you it seems like you're holding onto a lot of hurt that have been happening around you right um and I obviously don't want to get too personal um but\nYou know and the other kind of a poll is now this was last year now and things that have been happening is like a pressure right so because of all these things going around you it feels like your hands are tied and you're not able to move forward on what I wouldn't tell you is that\nFor you to get to a better place you really need to trust you need to let go of some of these things that are you know in your life that\nI hate to say it but even even if there is\nUm like a health issue that is taking place it's a learning lesson right now for you um and it's a time for you to grow and you have to be able to to trust that it's not going to be this way all the time and I know that might sound cliche but I'm pulling these cards around you and it tells me that you know you're really trying um\nBut you're having a hard time you're like okay where do I began to let this go on and you're doing a good job of trying to act the part I feel like you're going through your daily day routines are really trying to put on a mask but you're not feeling\nIs that correct or no [noise] ... right [noise] yeah okay right so\nPut ... think of it this way right so if you know I see that there's a healing hand that you have and I used to me you have to go to person feels like a lot of people are the ones that come to you and they have an issue is that correct\n\nThat you tend to be the ear that people talk to like someone always there\nYeah yeah [laughter] okay so you need to know that you know\nYou have to have patience with yourself and your situation okay um how many is coming so know that you you are coming to a breakthrough it is going to get better but I think a lot of it is knowing it's going to get better you know you have to put yourself in a place that's like a catch twenty two right so you almost have to feel it\nFeel that strength inside of you again which you're kind of like well how do I get that back um and a lot of it is balance right is finding a balancing your life is what you really need to do at this moment\nAlright thanks good luck brandy hope everything works out for you during this time do you do you find Ron Maureen the these investigations are more prevalent during the Halloween season or does it matter\n[laughter] [laughter] it it doesn't matter but you know what even Ron I'm sure would agree is early on I mean a lot of people have that and they think while it's October Halloween season right we need to be out there\nUm and I say over the years that might have started when I joined the group that was more it was busier around that time of year but now it's I think Ron would say is probably isn't constantly\nMaureen what do you think we gee boards\n[laughter] funny you bring that up um you know I think that they're a tool I don't\nThink there's something to be afraid of them I just think it's at the intention that you use when you're using that we'd be bored so if you're you know you're drinking you're using the ... then that's probably not a good idea um because you're not going to\nOpen and you're not protecting yourself and um we had a actually a case of a woman who had some issues by using a weed you board and I believe she lives on\nHaving you know getting high at the time or whatever she was doing 'em and she invited the spirit end and her ... her whole life rather went into chaos her home burnt down a she pretty much lost everything\nAnd we were actually called in an investigation on a different home she lives in that she was now losing that home\nUm so I don't know what do you think about it wrong\nYou know a a a bite parish priest called in and asked me that same question what do you think of what we do boards\nI says I've got a collection of the the games [laughter]\nUh and uh I Do I have a collection of all different ones for use as most good parent how confess the kid is too [laughter] but ah that go on to I always say though if you're not comfortable doing anything don't do it because you don't trust it goes\nRight next something let's go to Matthew in Illinois first time caller he mapped go

your book\nWell it's a sold everywhere Amazon and uh all the major bookstores so\nI go uh towards the matrix that oh I think the people who are spirits and what their experience and I don't take that away from him but I Believe that the eggs the heroes into wars and the Jews to nine or sometime interfere with and we see will we see we feel we're we feel things move they move\nBut this is my question\nMy questions and all the tragedy that don't happen on this planet\nAnd and that's not excluding things haven't happened right here in this country\nIf the protocol the goals would be because you have had tragedies\nOr or in your life that took away your life then there would be more goes on this planet any will be people and just let's just deal with the United states itself I mean I I Am part Cherokee and so I'm just saying\nThe tragedy that happened in them in all other people Jews all over the world what is the protocol to be a goes and if you believe in their\n... if it's not the matrix\nOr could you ever considered this being the matrix and the numbers you just not calculating that these are the way it should be\nThat is my question thank you for your joined or music or their George I love all your news all the way from bluegrass dude sold to everything from the years you've been playing your number one when it comes to that\nAll right my friend more to come so what what what is the definition Ron oh what a ghost becomes why does it become a ghost\nYou know it's the sixty four thousand dollar question Georgian and\nThe honestly we really don't know\nExactly what a ghost is I mean ah when I first started doing this I used to work with a Franciscan monks and we had a cause a religious aspects of it and\nWe came up with the feeling that maybe some of this is the perfect terrific not like it's a punishment but rather it's a place it's a temporal thing versus the and the thing so I mean that's just going on doing their\nTime basically but that's I mean that's

world after they pass on to the body the person taking them\nIt's just a disaster gotta be careful Google Plus I don't use it but Google Plus will be no more but it took more than that being the least impactful social media platform on the Web to killing\nGoogle has announced that it will shut it down on the social network after the wall Street Journal reported that the company did not disclose the security vulnerability in the spring not expose private data from hundreds of thousands of Google Plus it counts\nLet's check in with our expert on the Internet luring Weinstein who will of course his disclaimer before we get going go ahead Lawrence\nRight that I did consult to Google several years ago so now what is Google Plus from silver plus\nIs is a Google of a social networking platform it it is the equivalent of Facebook or Twitter is in the Google ... that I've been using it since really became available ... years ago I'm going to be missed\n... if you're going to be missed by millions of people you know there's this story that's been going on for ages though with a ghost town there's nobody out millions and millions of people use it very happy with it I've been very happy with it [noise] really in a way they were sort of a victim of their own success because when they when they started Google Plus and throughout its entire run\nGoogle decided not to put an ad on it so there was no ... there was no way to buy bonds or posts right these are both things that drives people crazy and his\nBook so there was no separate income stream coming from it\nIn the meantime everybody got kind of look or by Facebook into thinking well you gotta have the ads you got to have the sponsored post you got to have these things that are ... your time lines and everything and they got a massive number of people\nOnto their platform now of course a lot of people were kind of regret it given what's going on but sizes everything with social media scale is everything and Google just never really got that scale now this brief that occurred\n... of the right at the top of they currently found out about this for a month ago\nThey should have publicly about that at that time [noise] apparently there is that they really didn't if they found that in a during a if I understand that during their on auditing their own security auditing and they didn't have any evidence that it had ever been exploited in other words it with a theoretical bought her ability but apparently nobody knew about it outside of school\nAnd the kinds of information that were that were\nUm theoretically vulnerable where like name and email address no credit card numbers do financial information nothing like that law that stuff that people have with Facebook so they said well\nWhy stir things up when there's so much going on right now I mean that's my interpretation and they kind of sat on it and write and now of course it kind of makes it a convenient I won't say excuse but ... it convenient a kind of a rationale for setting into motion to fund the setting of Google Plus over a period of about a month but they they should have\nDiscussed that publicly of the first place you know um and uh it would've been a lot better all around if they had\nIn the meantime all of us who've been using Google Plus all these years or try to find other places to go where experimenting with other things\nAnd I'll mention that there the Google commercial version of Google Plus which operates further Gees we the the the business systems where you pay about five bucks a month\nOr per head using it that's going to continue so Google Plus we'll be continuing commercially uh and and we'll just have to see what happens competing with Facebook probably a ... and facebooks turf with probably not a good idea and the first place\nAnd that's the time at ... at the end at the\nTime that it seems like a logical thing to do you know you don't want to miss out but as we've seen the way Facebook did it

told people about the evidence that I was referring to people perked up and we're interested in the fact that I was taking the time to research and write a book on this topic\nNow let's talk a little bit about some of the things you uncovered that you didn't really know about before until up with the ... cycle ... says you you of course ... learned a little bit about them but you learn more as you did more be research the new\nWhat we find in the study is that there is a very subtle again highly statistically significant effect suggesting that the body is responding in the direction of the picture eventually shown seconds before the picture is shown\nYears ago during the television days they would hire anchor people lose people are based on a system called the ... skin test\nAnd it was a series of electrical impulses that they would hook up with audience members to and then they chew videotapes of various anchor people and the the ones that showed the most remarkable response\nOr from the audience because of the skin test they're the ones that got hired a they were looking for some kind of reaction from people and the person who just you know didn't register at all on the meter\nOr with the people in the audience they never got hired I I don't know if they still use that or not but it was amazing technology back in the seventies\nOr that type of technology that is being used in pre sentiment experiments measuring skin response\nMuseum work no psycho Comey says is the ability to move objects with your brain what did you uncover their\nRights again this is something that doesn't make any sense at all under the material is paradigm consciousness is considered to be at the phenomenon of the brain it comes out of the brain has no effect on the world\nWhat I found in my research is that that might not be true and I think the most compelling studies that have been controlled are once again that show very subtle effects and they were actually done\nA primarily at Princeton University which\nIs interesting because I went to Princeton University and I had no idea of these studies were being run a Dr Robert Johnson who was the former dean of engineering a rocket scientist ran a lab for nearly Thirty years running these studies\nAnd he also look at remote viewing but he also he looked at psycho can east is which is disability for the mind that matter\nThe classic study uses random number generators that these are machines that spit out the heroes and once in a totally random fashion so again if we look at probability overtime a random number generator will have if you present heroes and fifty percent one over time\nWhat the experiment\nDoes it asks people to put their mental attention to the machine to make it produce more ones and zeroes for example and the person doesn't even have to be in the same room\nSo they say hey I'm pleased put your mental attention to the machine and make it produce more ones and zeroes again what do we find is that there is a small but highly statistically significant effect where it seems as though the mind is is changing the what used to be random behavior of\nThe machines random generators picked up a some incredible responses during the tragedy of nine eleven in two thousand one\nThey did not know what the time what was happening what was going to happen what they felt something was going on because these random generators more just went ballistic and and people do people have that ability or a ...\nThat's right George ... those to me or perhaps even more remarkable and this is part of the global consciousness project which which was an offshoot of the Princeton study where these machines the random number generators\nAre set up around the world so people weren't even necessarily aware that the machines were they're generating these numbers and what the experiment yours have done is looked at the behavior of the machines around the world around events that we know\nAre produced heightened emotions and nine eleven is one example of what we know that people had heightened emotion and it happened at a constant ... basically at a time I had a single moment so we can look at what was happening when everyone was focusing their attention or many people are focusing their attention on the events\nWhat do we find that there was a spike at nine eleven but in the case of nine eleven which is even more fascinating to me is that the spike happened before the plane hit the towers\nBefore the event that\nBefore the event which suggests almost a global pre premonition that this was going to happen\nFor a job or you know that name of course had an incredible ability or if you believe what he did for psycho Comey says she had the ability to bend spoons keys and everything else with his mind now there are some who said dollars trickery its magic but the new people\nSteve that he had that ability he did some incredible things and a candidate be taught in cycle ... be talked\nWell I've heard of a boon bending party which sounds ridiculous but ah I've looked into it and it appears that people train themselves to be able to use their mind in a way to to affect matter beyond just a random number generator where it's actually\nBending metal for example\nAnd ... is an example where many credible people have suggested that what he can do is real\nIncluding um Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu who said in a two thousand Fifteen television interview that he saw Keller but then there are many people who have suggested that this is real I'm a side note on your a gal her\nVery interesting I mentioned the CIA documents earlier there's another document that I clued in my book and then to upside down thinking that talks about Ehlers abilities but not in the context of spoons ending\nIt's in the context of remote viewing mhm bellies and what they say and this is a direct quote from a classified document\nWhere he was he was put under very I mean they were watching him closely what the documents that is as a result of Keller success in this experimental period we consider that he has demonstrated his paranormal perceptual ability and they convincing and unambiguous manner\nSo you know there has been a lot of debate about him but these documents suggest that studied were run and he was able to perform which I think should open up to the possibility that maybe he was able to do things using his mind that sounds totally crazy\nMark would you give up your website and where people can get your book\nSure my website

a hundred and forty miles per hour for a generation of several hours\nIt is a difficult call isn't it\nYeah I'm Glad you brought this up short they're really really important one because if\nIf there is some truth in what people are experiencing beyond that was the nation perhaps it gets into a window into a reality that we typically don't eat with our eyes I I think we should explore this one further my perspective on it after having looked at the evidence to me the most compelling evidence are\nThe cardiac arrest studies known at ... cardiac arrest studies so this is where people have are in cardiac arrest ever stop potatoes and the experimenter as talk to them soon after they're able to sit after they've had the experience rather than ... people to remember something that might have happened twenty or Thirty years ago\nThat either cardiologist for Apple Dr ... a party at from Stony Brook is another one that we'll scientists are looking at this and what they're finding is that some percentage of people who are in cardiac arrest\nHim back and describe near death experience and why is that the ... in\nCardiac arrest ear physiological trauma in many cases the person is clinically dead we know that when the heart stopped after a certain amount of time there is no blood flow to the brain and the brain stopped functioning so if there is minimal\nNo brain functioning we would not expect people to have these experiences that are so vivid to them and as I mentioned earlier sometimes what they report during the near death experience when they're out of their body is verified as being accurate later I'm One example in particular is\nFrom doctors and party up in a peer reviewed journal called resuscitation in two thousand fourteen one of the patient in particular had a very vivid out of body experience where he heard something in the room\nIt was later found to be that the federal later and we know that this happened during the time he had no brain functioning because of the times were being stamped and we know when the defendant later went off and it made it very distinct it's down and yet this person came back and describe the sound in the room that happened when his brain was off\nWhere they've been cases as well where somebody is literally gone through this new doesn't experience there floating above their body\nThey see the nurse and the doctor and everybody in attendance talking about the person you know well sorry we're losing enemies dying or whatever then become the person comes back into his body and tells the attending doctor exactly what he heard\nIn it boggles their mind\nAbsolutely it doesn't make sense according to this material is perspective that we need a functional brain in order to have conscious experiencing memories\nOf but what I found is that there are very credible scientists that are looking at this for example the University of Virginia the division of perceptual studies at the med school has looked at this very closely and Dr Bruce Grayson is one person in particular\nWas looked at these phenomenon and is is finding that something is happening when the brain is not functional and people are able to report things like what you describe where they couldn't have known about things through normal means and it seems as though their brain was off and they said something that was accurate which is not by definition if not who's the nation\nMark ... six hundred and twenty terrestrial radio stations as we speak and they're all sending out signals in the cities and markets that they are in\nYou can't see those radio signals but they're out there is that a little bit what what this is like consciousness were sending out signals that you can't really see what they're out there\nThat such an important point I think we tend to be biased by what are ordinary a perceptual systems can tell us particularly our eyes and ears but we know it's not even controversial to say that our eyes show or a small sliver of the electromagnetic spectrum\nAnd what we're dealing with here may be something totally separate from the M spectrum but we know that our eyes only show us a very small sliver of reality so I Do think that maybe there are things beyond what our normal ordinary perceptual systems can show us at our existing but we just don't perceive them\nAll right let's take some calls here for you as they begin to line up and I've still got a whole slew of questions for you mark and by the way for a non scientist you're doing an incredible job on this topic\nYou've learned a lot damage\n[laughter] I have and I hope to summarize it in a way that a general audience can absorb it\nLet's go to bill from West Hartford Connecticut ... Connecticut bill by the way is an amateur astronomer and an atheist hey bill\nHi George Hi Hi Mark yes I Am a rational eighth year than a materialist however I Do think that there is something to near death experiences I Do think ah\nThere is this phenomena going I just think regarding and the ... ah where where the mind I Would use the word mind not sold but mind or ...\nOr or or exist temporarily during the ... is not heaven or hell in a religious sense just like there is no God or no devil I Would call it an energy dimension or an energy universe and I have a new term for it I Would call it may be seeing\nYour lab already know space no time a\nDimension but my question to you is specifically\nA I liked it sort of question your whole premise by talking about site medications explains psychiatric medications medications for either anxiety or depression whether it's anti anxiety drugs Claude ... anti depressants or major tranquilizers ... [laughter]\nBack chemical have the brain and therefore they do affect\nChemical you the consciousness meaning of the mind so by changing biologically biochemical you the brain to these medications or even aspirin or Tylenol ibuprofen can it can affect the brain is through the headaches the going back to ... it can affect the brain chemically we know that positively\nAnd in fact the mind that's my first part my second part of the same one question is Alzheimer's disease dementia affects the brain does affect the conscious is the minds it does seem to show it here's my question for you it doesn't that show that\nIf the mine and the brain are not the same thing at least the brain is connected to the mine is connected to the brains and I'm trying to say\nThank you very much for your question bill and this is something I Do address in the book and I've thought a lot about personally because we do know that there is a strong correlation between what happens in the brain and the type of conscious experience we have whether it's like medications or if someone gets in a car accident and then has cognitive impairments we know there's a correlation\nWhat I argue and and some others argue this as well is that correlation does not always imply causation in other words just because two things are related to one another\nWe can't automatically concluded that one causes the other so here's the simplistic example from Dr Bernardo Castro when when I mentioned in my book [laughter] imagine you have a fire\nLots of firefighters show up\nYou have a larger fire\nMore firefighters show up\nA very strong correlation between the size of the fire and the number of firefighters that appear at the scene\nWe know however that the firefighters did not cause the fire that's not the nature of the relationship\nBut the firefighters are highly related to the fire so I've used the brain in a bit of a different way with a grain of highly related to consciousness\nDamage the brain you you take psych med the brain and consciousness will be affected but the brain I view it more as like a filtering mechanism or like an antenna receiver which similarly which show a strong correlation\nBetween what's happening in the brain unconscious experience but it's not the producer of consciousness what ... what do you think mark reincarnation\nWell I have a chapter on that in my book and I talk about the studies done at the University of Virginia I think there is evidence\nFor it we we've had some incredible stories too of people who have talked about their past lives including little children uh and it just is remarkable when they're checked out\nThere's no way that they would know certain things unless they experienced it is it's it's mind boggling isn't it\nGeorge I agree with you it's chapter eleven of my book and I think the most compelling cases in addition to children being able to recall thing that they shouldn't have any way of knowing\nA man or sometimes they're five by medical records by the UVA professors is in some cases the children have birth marks or physical deformities that are very specific that matched the way the child describes dying in the previous life yes and in some cases the medical records are found so\nIt's it's something that beyond genetics beyond environment which are the two factors typically considered to affect the physical something else was going on and the researchers call it a third factor\nOr a person's petrified of water and then somehow a in hypnosis they died in the past life by drumming let's say\nExactly what's preferences and fears that somehow or transferred to something beyond the body seems to be a transfer from wanting to another offensively\nWe have Monique in Southern California with us I'm Monique go ahead\nHi George ... why I have a ... year gap sure how I thank you for being on the show so I'm back in two thousand and one eye and [noise] oh ... comment

you know again I'm a scientist\nOkay so it's not that that there is this something there that we don't fully understand\nThen can we see that it's the ... the person or is there some other force behind it\nWell let's suppose let's suppose that ah the Dow czar and I've seen that with three different methods brass rods willow sticks and ... over a map mhm okay I'll watch pendulum over a map which\nWas the most strangest one of all [laughter] that somebody could could could find water in yet\nYeah it is up comes to water [laughter] so are is the Dow is there a particularly sensitive to the uh electromagnetic flux than the earth caused by the water moving through various layers of conducting semi conducting insulating properties\nWho knows when she had the scientists we ... we in science cannot ignore this cannot ignore\nThem going all the way back he your your guest mentioned William James\nOkay all that whole period we went all of this a lot of this early early research started\nInto shall we say five to ... and other other sorts of things and I I I I've never seen the U.S I've never seen what I could call a UFO the night sky and I've lived in places where the night sky was glorious\nI saw when I never did before but I saw two yeah\nYeah so I Can't I Can't even put up all this stuff that has to do for instance a desert tortoises will show up at the mud hole the desert tortoise in the southwest will show up at the mud hole prior\nTo when the rain comes within within just now\nMaybe that's something to do with the change in the air pressure and they know that feeling\nYeah they can feel it it's a it's they're reading something but to the to the to to to the native folks that lived in that country that made that animal up pretty sacred animal\nAbsolutely let's get a quick reaction from you mark is the time was clicking by here no there's no question that if science skin see the things Steven just said we're on our way isn't it yeah\nEven raises a number of really good point about\nThe need to study these phenomenon much more to understand the nuances of how it all works\nI don't think we understand some of the mechanisms because it hasn't been studied widely enough and that's largely because it's so taboo particularly an academic institution even talk about these things I've talked to scientists who say that it's\nA academic suicide effectively to talk about these things before getting tenure so that's another reason I really wanted to write the book and the evidence in one place for people to hopefully open up the conversation so that it's not such a taboo topic\nWell Steven as a scientist admits that there's something very strange going on you know what it is but he's open to at least say that it's unusual in different than you know something could be happening\nMhm [noise] well we haven't talked much about quantum mechanics here but it's a field\nThat has been around for over a hundred years which is accepted in the physics community as being real but it's totally counter intuitive\nThere's a phenomenon known as entanglement\nAnd the very basic phenomenon is you have two particles two pieces of matter that are physically distant from one another and when you affect one you affect the other simultaneously like an instantaneous effect which suggests that there's some hidden interconnectedness now Albert Einstein did not like this at all he\nCalled it spooky action at a distance because he thought the speed of light was the fastest anything a travel and yet here we have an instantaneous connection between distant particles that there are things in the ... of reality that are totally counter intuitive but we just don't see them in our everyday lives\nHas this changed your life\n\nIt absolutely has I think from the standpoint of understanding human potential and what we can do like ugly this has opened me up completely but also it's it's introduced the notion of interconnectedness the idea that we're not actually separate even though it appears that we are\nAnd that takes on that brings a whole new meaning to things like altruism which if we're all connected than helping another is really a version of helping ourselves\nTo me that that has implications for interpersonal relationships all the way up to world peace\nOr I my friend mark thank you again in one more time you bought

would more goes chronicles stories from the wrong with the unknown the unexplained the unbelievable let me tell you about marine fifth generation psychic tranche medium for as far back as she can remember\nShe has communicated with the D.C shut the age of Fifteen he was introduced to a person who studied with Maureen Cabot\nWas the official which upset with Massachusetts and she took Maureen under her wing and Guided Tour and ways to not only understand but also control this gift at the age of Fifteen she served as the medium for adult say on says\nShe's practice studied and instructed metaphysical studies for more than twenty five years\nThe more he does but with the New England ghost project since two thousand one and it was a company ... more than one hundred investigations here she is on the coast to coast Maureen welcome\nOh thank you so much for having me we could afford to the wire Fifteen Years old all the shepherd for you\nYes ah I Know as you're reading that I'm thinking oh my God that was only a few days ago right\n[laughter] tell me about Lori Cabot the crucial which of them all\n[noise] you know he's very a a wonderful\nWoman when I was at that age Fifteen you know she was someone that was rarely renowned and the city and she still is um she's known as you know the high priest is of Salem and he'll often when I was\nYounger I see her walking around town you know dressed in her her job and very regal looking very um you know she was a big presence\nOf a person and ... at\nThe time people will come or rude open arms you did they go oh my God there's a which\nYeah that's a great question she you know there are many people that welcomed with open arms but\nLet's just say the town in Salem not necessarily [laughter] so it always seems to be at those days it was a little bit of a battle between the businesses and you know and the town in Salem and those who really believed in the witchcraft and um so basically she did you know she really changed\nThe whole way they look at it now you know obviously it's a big tourism right for the type of season and it's you know go to Sam I'm so I think that it really worked out well for the town of ... you\nKnow you are a few generations psyche trench medium that means we're talking about ... back to your family your sibs ability what year who did this start with\nNo my um [noise] it's\nInteresting because growing up my mother just never really wanted to I don't know if you don't want to scare me she just you know my poor father though he thought just those girls insane [laughter] um but I Would come to her and talk to her about spirits I was seeing and I to me it was normal it didn't seem unusual I didn't have anything to judge it by\nUm and my mother would just you know God Bless her she'd say oh here's some holy water\nYou know just to you know she told my father she is normal um but she didn't really\nDiscuss it with me a lot until I was older and I was still\nYou know involved but say in a matter of physical and that spiritual around and one day I mean she was talking you know in her sixties she finally told me that she is you don't want Maureen\nThis has been from my family for many many years like her great grandmother and you know her grandmother used to help people in town and he'll them of their illnesses and keep them stop them from bleeding and readings for them and she said you know I hear the spirits but I just turn up the radio\nSo\nWould you see that there was a member of your family that was better than another member\nI never you know never really quite thought of that um I Would say that I had you know my grandmother died when she was twenty eight so I never really knew her\nUm but my great grandmother my grandmother rather I did know and she was the one who really got involved with doing readings for people so I heard that\nYou know she was very trusted in her city or in her town um so it's hard to know I mean I don't know have a lot to really judge by and my family history of who was might have been stronger than another\nDid they ever passed dome stories from one to the others that you could to reach ...\nYou know the\nOnly thing that I Do have was given to me and ah I have this little picture of you know and it was my grandmother actually before she had passed and uh she was maybe\nMaybe five years before she passed and it's interesting 'cause she you have a picture of her and she looks like a gypsy um and my mother used to joke about it and say that that you know ...\nThat was her true self she was very unique about what you said so that the stories that God will always bits and pieces never never anything that was really concrete that I could say I'm about spirits anyway\nNo you've been with the New England the ghost project Maureen since two thousand one would use that\nA well rounded doing much better than me to tell the story but he started this story\nAfter on a near death experience um and he had to work and do a um you know a special court for class that he took to try to to keep him busy when he was hailing from his illness I'm and basically he started doing a cable um\nYou know he started cable program and during that cable program he had to do it on something so he chose you know doing it and go set his workshop and again he'll do much better at explaining that I Would focus on but it's a team of individuals that\nYou know over the years I've learned is you know to me everybody is really you know it's a great team of people you work really hard to get to go out and you look for the things that go bumps in the night you know someone else doesn't really want to\nTo want to look into that they're quite satisfied not knowing about the unknown or you have someone that really needs help there's been many calls over the years to run and the team um that were you know businesses um you know families you know you'd have restaurants and they don't really want to\nDo I go out and tell the public all the time this was years ago they don't want to tell the public that something is going on that they can't explain and um people were getting a little freaked out and they need help\nSo it's really been a journey of love I think to go out and actually work because we're not paid you know it's not something that we get paid to go out and do investigation so people it's really going there to to just help them\nHow many people are just so off the wall when you go to their house and then you're just using it\nWell off the wall meaning terrified of spirits you off the wall just crazy\nYou know show [laughter] sure why his birds I guess\nUm you know as as it says\nWe've done more than a hundred and investigations um I Would say that you know not a hundred percent would we find something active going on at the time but we're big believers to know that you know it doesn't always happen on command [noise] um so I really believe that\nThere are a lot of supernatural things that are going on um if you're aware and you're open to it you might experience it you know some people say well I've never seen it and I don't believe in that well there's a good reason why you don't see it\n[noise] um so if you say how many people I'd say a good percentage of paranormal activity does take place out there and I would bet that if you did a poll and you ask people on the street you'd get a good amount of you know maybe Seventy percent of people have had some odd experience that they can't really explain and their lives\nWhat have you conclude about what this may be a lot of people have their thoughts about what ... what do you think they are\nWell I think\nAre varying degrees of what they could be\nRight so our experience and my experience over the years has been you know if I Do a reading for someone for instance um I get more of a loving spirit someone that's passed over that wants to communicate and come back and you know let their love when those are okay or maybe has a message for them that they weren't able to get before they pass\n'em but then you know you're called out to some locations where you know\nThings aren't really going while someone's gotten thrown down the stairs items being tossed around the house um there's different you know events like say a\nYou know people walking by and then you might see a spirit walk by and all these plants just die as they're looking at them um we had one case of a woman who was living by herself with the door\nTo door closed in her apartment and yet she was hit on the back of the head with a a ballot stripped from the stairs or you know all these out she'd have something go on in the oven she'd go to put potatoes enroll them in soil and she'd lay down and take a nap while they're cooking and yet\nThey would fire would start in her oven I'm it would wake her up with you\nGoing off and she'd get up and look in the potatoes underneath on you know on the plane itself\nSo what do I think I think again as many different varying degrees of paranormal activity and not all of it just like you don't have a person that's a hundred percent nice mhm um doesn't mean that you're going to have a spirit that's a hundred percent you know wonderful and nice\nReally really have had it this year is radio for thinking people here radio show is
