I mean I've done five books now on on these phenomena foreign them at in black and one on the women and black and\nI have to say that the vast majority of all the reports I get don't send anything like you know they stepped out of the Pentagon the CIA all the FBI on and say\nI'm a you know nothing like the the concept in the movies they typically are described as looking ... you know go on and skins live ... white white\nUm and people talk about how they seem to have the ability to mind control the personal hypnotized them\nPay for the even talks about when they're in close proximity to them that they fall and sick afterwards almost like a like a soup and actually infection or something along those lines\nAnd um there are cases when the men in black and the women in black of turned up in homes right after paper they using wage of bullets which puts another angle to its\nUm but there's no doubt in my mind again um that's you know this is a real phenomenon but it's not like it's portrayed in the movies it's more sort of like a\nYou know like a gothic horror story mixed in with the X files you know you put those two issues together that's that's how I Would sort of describe this the ... street it's fall be on you know just guys in black suits walk\nAnd I guess I'm you know I'm asking it into context sort of like with cattle mutilation is I think you know there's there's a lot of evidence that the use animal relations are carried out by something other than just um\nUm humans and helicopters that some of them are truly inexplicable and then you have a whole other wave of them that\nSurely seem like they are humans that are carrying out the same kind of thing for whatever reasons um this is sort of leading us to where we are going in the next hour to talk about your other book on the alien abduction wells but we're in human agencies and that doesn't mean government agencies but humans\nUh pretend to be something paranormal get away with something that's really weird and they they do it in a way that so that there isn't a lot of serious scrutiny by people like you were people like me or rather investigators\n[noise] well yeah I mean I think you know when you talk about the ... you know you've got a really weird lungs and exploit couple and then some which are easier perhaps to explain the recent powerless demanding black where there's no doubt that in some cases I think the\nGovernment agencies are responsible for their mind they but I think it's a very small cats are great but says they the January unexplained ones and the way it was what I think is happening on a few occasions and there is some evidence to support this\nIs the over the years agencies may actually it employed the legends of the men in black as a means to cover their tracks in other words the maybe paper within governments who know that many black all too real but\nI don't know what they are but he doesn't prevent them\nFrom using the ... the most chafe resumes too to threaten and quiet people who move I may not want to have them talking about cases so the government may actually not know who the men in black really are and I don't think they do fully\nThat sort of leads us into where we're heading in the next hour we're going to talk about top secret alien abduction ... with the government doesn't want you to know that ...\nLatest book or whether or not you believe the abductions are real the\nFiles one alien abductions are real when I tell ya what might be going on there based on some of the ... documents that nicotine squeezed out of the U.S in the

we're talking with the red burn a you know there's an old joke about paranoia paranoia ... but something along the lines of just because you're paranoid that doesn't mean somewhat isn't really following you around it's sort of the the the inspiration for this new book or yours top secret alien abduction piles\nYou talk about the world in which we live where mass surveillance\nIs sort of a given now right\n[noise] well unfortunately yeah and of course you know\nSubsequent generations\nDo growing world wherever I've never known any different you know I'm\nRight paper the night before the Internet age will remember\nThat was not that sort of worldwide surveillance that we have now and um you know I think that's what I Am fortunate things for future generations it's going to be helping normal thing for them and probably accept it as well\nOr you know you mentioned in in in the book about the idea the fear that people used to have that maybe the government's going to\nTalk us into getting a computer chip stuck under our skin and then they can follow us and it'll be for all the good reasons you know for our health and wellbeing and\nAll kinds of ways but in fact they would be able to monitor everything we do everything about us we already have a a surveillance devices like that we all carry them or their cell phones yeah\nUm but the idea that our government the u._k. government other governments around the world would what time and resources into not only investigation of these phenomena UFOs things so that's the word alien abductions but would monitor intimidate\nFollow a alien abductees whether or not the government understands what ... alien abductions are all about that that idea which seemed preposterous are too many but you make the case in this book that it's real and ongoing right\nYeah I mean the reason why I wrote the book which actually official publication guy to first of November ... people can already got it\nBut I'm the reason I wrote\nTop secret abduction falls is because over the years I collected a number of official documents on abductions which are painted classified for the fame Information Act in the ...\nUm the U.S some primary I was in a position where I could actually sort of put the book together you know provide the raid with yes it's another book and I started going just overall ground you know\nWhy not present paper with the guy just showing falls or be put together now\nOh the book actually with the contact a movement of the Nineteen fifties which preceded the abduction phenomena by just about ten years or so and the reason I did that was to demonstrate to people from the would\nGo so to speak but um\nGovernment agencies do ah put together falls on paper to claim to have had\nA man and Kansas for example just about all of the ... of the Nineteen fifties like Georgia ... George finds hassle true and bathroom or feel Angelou chi all of them had FBI falls open on them one of the main reason Spain was because they claimed when\nI'm interviewed by the FBI that yes they ... they are and see Israel eons but they told the FBI that they the Iranians had a government or government is very different two hours and bordering on\nCommunism and I'm so that really opened the eyes\nOf the FBI to the extent that for example George finds hassles FBI file um he's extremely expensive it's like about an inch thick um Georgia ... is about a hundred and fifty pages\nI'm over ... she was about four to and so on so you know we have a precedent for the abduction phenomenon\nWith the contact tape people now\nIn the fifties excuse me in the early sixties things really kicked off I'm with the Iranian abduction phenomenon in September sixty one I'm with the bacteria and Bonnie hill case which is I guess the defining moments you follow gee when\nIt wasn't the first abduction case on record but he was certainly the one that really opened people's eyes when\nJohn full of wrote a book on the case they interrupted journey now in the story of basketball and hail that coming back from a a vacation in Canada they say the strange lights in the sky and then things kind of get waited a they don't fail writes\nThe you know everything seems a bit surreal and strange\nAnd they get back home and then they start having these weird dreams and nightmares of being taken on board the strange craft would they be strange creatures\nAnd being subjected to a stranger and intrusive experiments now what's particularly intriguing is that I found a file in the British\nNational archive and it revolved around among Ronald wild man\nWho was a delivering a vehicle in the south of England and he was like the early hours of the morning to I Am\nAn essay was driving the vehicle to the location\nThey the lights on the call when I was on the call started in time to a halt\nAnd they should they should become known as the the vehicle interference phenomena within you follow gee what's intriguing is that they\nThey uh British police force actually handed over the investigation\nBecause they report to the to the police found it over to a group within the British will laugh or schools told they have\nPromised in security services are sort of like the the James Bond they feel like of the of the royal Airforce they sort of get involved and espionage and counter intelligence things like that what's interesting is that in the file it talks about how the\nThey ... they promised and security services interviewed Ronald wild man by the same time too with the with the ... to a halt and the UFOs in front of him\nAnd the most telling an intriguing aspect is that he told the police and this is a direct quote but he was modeled by the time\nWhich is an interesting thing because that's sort of sounds just like you know the whole missing time angle of abduction little in today's world that Ronald ... in the fall actually refers to him saying that yes he sold his UFO come down lights went out of his vehicle\nAnd then he kind of fell to ... strange checked his watch and there was something about it it's actually you know portrayed completely and the file but he says he was ... at the time which I think you know you put all those aspects together that has the potential for being a significant abduction case\nI think about the contact these and I remember reading about them when I first got into this subject and thinking sort of bemused meant well there were there were a interesting colorful harmless sort of weirdos um but the more you read about um the more interesting they become a course people like a dam ski\nThen you realize that these guys showing these crazy stories some some of them would say you know they they met these women and went to Venus and things like that and you you you have a hard time taking them literally but when you realize that the government is really does followed them around and takes it seriously for whatever reason\nI ... it makes me think of like the Roberts men or that the CIA scientist studied UFO topic and they include the UFOs themselves are not a threat to national security but reporting UFOs might be because maybe the Russians could somehow manipulate\nA public opinion is that a justification for going around people like a dam ski bathroom those folks\nOh yeah because I mean George ... ah first book flying saucers a blended published in the early fifties that\nThat sold him huge figures are gigantic numbers of books for sold 'em and a ... he went on to like just a it's a little around the country\nAnd he was talking about how the aisle and supposedly had this sort of a call me and this type of governments on the communism was the way of the future\nAnd the FBI open that file honor dams skate um predominantly because he was someone you're talking about a controversial subject namely UFOs and contact with ... bucks\nThe FBI was more concerned as to how painful reading these books and go into his lectures might be influenced by the\nWe can we live out here do you\nReally really and

the total dollar amount of\nLosses or a livestock losses for ranchers and farmers could be but it's a pretty substantial\nAnd when you look at how the government has responded the FBI\nHad some ... agents who looked at it a very cursory examination investigation that really didn't get to the bottom of it and then nothing so what do you make of that and in combined with the the black helicopter phenomena that you're discussing this book\nWell I think you know the the black woman clearly a real one\nThey just seem to be tied to both the abduction phenomena what they know and I think there's probably some true today\nLying these helicopters potentially I think is part of an organization that operates outside of government you know it may actually it may sort of do research and work for the government\nBut it's not you know the CIA or anybody like that ... I don't think I think it is sort of um you know almost like a like a black budget ... kind of program designed to do the work and\nAnyway she took 'em there and she never could turn out to the parents or anything like that\nSo she took them in and raised in Missouri on and uh they uh when they got in their teens\nI noticed that they didn't have any hair on their head on anything but it wasn't a Bon Jovi where they had moved out the ... and ... she took them then they went to school and we were fourteen years old they are stuck out of school because they were extremely intelligent\nAs a matter of fact it ... a built a Kevin ... there's no strong raped by late summer and um they um you know like you say very intelligent boys both with twins\nWhether any of that um when I when he was about sixteen Seventeen years old got a very bad a cut on his own detour farming action that\nWell they couldn't do local hospital and they ah it felt like they will have to lead transfer you can cook it lost so much blood but when they took his my tight they couldn't find any type of matched ... anyway and they check to a place and then they checked his twin brother and he had the same lead type\nSo any of that they had to use his blood transfusion lean re they went back to the phone and nothing happened and they went into the army they drafted in young the Nineteen forties to\nWhen they came back from the army they went out in the swamp and a um ... ... let's say that there and they link town maybe once a month for supplies and so forth but then they had set up a ...

out like that and he couldn't figure them out any advance are they missing and they they never heard anything from even want to\nThank you for sharing that story I'm going to get ... take on that Thanks John appreciate your calling Nick have you heard that one before anything like\nThat story but what I have heard all kinds of similar situations where you know ... in within the family was known but um\nYou know what the grandmother you know back in the thirties or forties long before you know the whole model to review college he took off that that were abduction like experiences ... fan in other words it's not just something that began with a bacterium bony heel case\nIt's just it's just a case of trying to find the earlier ones and very often that does come through you know what a family member decides to\nTo contact someone like me you know and and share a story that goes back to you know the Chinese or the fifties lie about one so I'm you know I think we can push they the

activity and despite all the research on the top of several books have been written on the subject there's no\nSort of one hundred percent consensus on on what actually happened it's it remains you know ... but there are a lot of\nWeight aspects to this story which I guess unfortunately you know we'll never really know\nThe answer I think it it's going to remain a mystery unfortunately\nNick I don't know how when you sleep but you are you're a as a prolific an author as I Know in the world or any one I Want to talk about anything else you got coming up we got about a minute left\nUm well as I say well you know that's the new books a top secret abduction falls that's the one I'm sort of a you know promoting narrow I'm I'm not as I said the reason I wanted to ride it was because he has to

in religious studies from Harvard University where he studied religion and culture he's interested in religion and science spirituality at ... church religion new religious movements electronic media and popular culture and there's currently a professor of religion at Vassar College his new book other worlds\nSpirituality and the search for invisible dimensions is a spectacular and mind bending a Christopher welcome to the program\nMorning George thanks for having me on the show\nThanks for staying up so late or ... I was wondering the first thing I was wondering when I finished this book was how do you get away with this issue you are a seemingly respectable guy teaching at a grade school and I wonder if you're if you're gonna catch grief for doing it\n[laughter] give me um [noise] no it's um yeah how do I get away get away with it it's um you know a lot of people and cultural studies or people who are interested in the study of religion or\nYou know we do we do get a path to study really cool fantastic things right um people um unusual experiences and unusual states of consciousness religious experiences\nExperiences what whatever you want to call them so yeah it is kind of the privilege to be to be a professor and and get a chance to just kind of how my interest and that's really ... how the book came along um\nIt came out of an earlier book I was working on that look that sort of the science of religious experience and spirituality um but as you know this on the move here in New directions by thinking about\nScience and physics and cosmology and how are these sort of fantastic scientific ideas have led a um a lot too and at least a new vocabulary that people are you now to talk about your death experiences and and the parents and and even after life experiences and so on\nYou mentioned in the in the beginning uh and of course as a as somebody who studies religious studies and religion and how it interacts with the world and popular culture you mentioned in the beginning how a belief in church or a formal religion organized religion is sort of\n... around the western world but interesting spiritual and spirituality topics or has has remains strong or you may increase that that's a that's kind of a challenge for somebody in your line of work to figure out why that's happening\nYeah I think it is I think it is and um you know that's why a lot of us are trying to study these new forms of spirituality I mean that that was really as you say that was really how I began the book with the puzzle you know the problem which is you know people still in America seem to have a lot of\nI guess we'll be called spiritual beliefs they are pretty high numbers in America um believe in and goes for believing spirits or believe in God I'm and yet on the other hand as you say a participation and traditional religious congregations are affiliation and traditional relate with traditional religious congregations those things seem to be going down\nUm how how can we think about that how can we talk about this you know how how is it the case that people seem to have a very real sense of relief and other world um and spirituality and the abdomen are really in the absence of participation in traditional congregation so if I tried to think about and\nTrying to think well where where people getting that these ideas you know where where people getting their beliefs their ideas about other world and\nI'm kind of a big science documentary person and I'm I'm real you know I'm kind of like a science nerd and in a sense and interested in pop science pop science book and I think there is there's a lot of sort of fantastic scientific concepts that circulate now in our culture and I think uh you know concepts like\nDark matter dark energy or even thinking about\nInfinity a or thinking about the the multi verse was thinking about higher dimension I think all of these fantastic scientific concepts which I think scientists themselves embrace with ... with a sense of odd mystery and and wonder I\nThink those concepts are sort of uh the seed bed for for new spiritual infections and I and that's um and that's what I Try to look at it in the book\nWell you know we we I don't imagine you listen to the program all that often but on this program we talk about some pretty wild stuff and I think that scientists will die hard times too late ignore me\nGeorge it's too late [laughter]\nYeah I was pretty wild stuff that I think mainstream scientists generally have a tough time getting their head around a near death experiences out of body experiences encounters with other realities um you know time slips things of that sort of that you you'd sort of reached out look and look for a way to maybe\nMake a bridge between science and those kinds of subjects with this understanding of\nParallel realities other dimensions higher dimensions we talk about that those kinds of concepts on the program all the time and as if it's a given day or a given but we don't really I don't think many of us know I Can't get my head around other dimensions and\nUm it's it hurts even think about it but you take a deep dive into a sort of why those kind of concepts are so commonly held so um\nThat one that was important not only to reach out to people like us to discuss these crazy things but also to science right\nYeah I think so yeah I think so I mean one thing I Try to do in the book is um I Try to try to demystify a little bit the discussion about other dimensions in the in the first couple of chapters the book I I you know I asked the question of what it what is an extra dimension um and I talk a bit about uh I talk a bit about\nThat and maybe I can just say worried about that for them for the listeners tonight yes you know I'm going to have a\nAnother ... the idea of another dimension is not that I'm not that after ... after all I mean we have we know we have we have three directions or dimension three spatial dimensions that we live in and that's linked with and height\nAnd those are are are three directions or or dimensions there's there's an additional dimension that we sometimes talk about is the fourth dimension um since Feinstein in that time so we live in a a four dimensional space time a world and on science I spoke about this but\nSome of the people I talk about in my book talks about an additional spatial dimensions [noise] a a direction and space or a dimension in space that's different from the other three so you know we could think of like we could we could draw a line on a piece of paper or a line of one dimensional objects that has length\nIf you then draw flat square on that same piece of paper and has two directions or dimensions has links and wet\nAnd then you could you could draw cube I'm On the paper or you could hold a Rubik's Cube in your hand and that would be a three dimensional object has three spatial dimensions are linked with and hide and then the then the question becomes is okay what about a fourth direction um or a fourth dimension\nAnd this would be you know this would be an object that has links with height and something else [laughter] and that there's something else as the tricky part something else is the\nIs the direction that we cannot perceive so if there is such a direction to reality or dimensions reality it's it's evidently not something that we can we can see 'em or perceive I'm so this this is the possibility raised by math mathematician and and actually others some philosophers I'm In a\nWay back to the Eighteenth century but really in the nineteenth century mathematicians raised the possibility raised seems like kind of a strange thing to think about what ... how could there be another direction or dimension to reality\nUm you know and why would there be one well mathematicians in the nineteenth century start to use this idea within the context of their mathematical equations and\nThe reason they do is they want to want to make the mathematics of of the universe of its forces in laws more simple and more elegant 'em and they find that they find that it works um [noise] they find that they find corporate in an extra spatial dimensions\nA fourth visual dimension that uh the mathematics of the universe is a law enforcers look better on the equations cleaner they seem simpler and more elegant\nUm um and so on so and in fact just to skip forward to today today you still have mathematicians doing the same thing um you still have mathematicians incorporating within the context of their um\nAnd I'm so happy I wrote the book just to kind of encourage people to [noise]\nYou know think about the possibility that above our free spaces are three spatial dimensions there might be others um\nThat we don't see we go through our life um you know thinking that our world is the only world\nBut you know maybe maybe there's something beyond\nWell it's a it's fun to to talk about it on to imagine but when you combine higher dimensions and the ...\nIt gets pretty complicated [laughter] um [laughter] I tell you what we're gonna we'll take we won't jump into that will take a break first and we'll come back and get into that the inspiration I some of the stories that you tell about people who are inspired by this idea\nAre very sad I mean people who embrace it and uh they they go through\nTrials in turmoil in trying to get their head around it as as I have a ... but we'll we'll get

in that song there are men have got to feel at home in the universe again and I I Believe a great deal of the despair of our time is due to the fact that men meeting people of a false picture of the universe and our destiny having lost religion and gained nothing in his place\nToo many people have come to believe that life doesn't amount to much there are several people who are profiled in the

about the book is is how you\nTell the story about other worlds and our our modern perception of other worlds and how it developed a through by personalizing it you tell the story of people who've struggled with getting their own heads around the world Charles hitting as one of those who\nI I guess a brilliant mathematician who went into a deep depression when his scientific use came into conflict with his religious and spiritual views tell his story\nYeah yeah yeah yeah he and his wife is is quite a story um but you're right they're they're ... and there's many others in the book who sort of struggle with the um you know sort of like out of it being raised religious in a scientific time and feeling that they can no longer an or maybe not sure that they can any longer and brave\nThe religion of their childhood and still feeling spiritual for sure and and having a spiritual and tuition and his ... am\nAnd wanting to find wanting to seek out other ways of of being religious and many of them turned to these you know fantastic scientific concepts like higher dimension that has a new as a new more scientific way of thinking about\nUm you know the existence of other spiritual low level or worlds to reality I Am headed into an interesting story as you say he he grows up he goes Oxford he\nHe falls into this kind of depression he's not sure about anything anymore and then he\nHe makes he makes a move that I think not a lot of people would make the right and the situation is he he embraces map addict and geometry as a kind of a\nHe kind of hang on to that as the only sure thing that there's a way in which the map provide certainty onto him but I think is his story a little bit unusual in that sense but then he develop\nOther than the book he developed the whole way of thinking about higher spatial dimensions and he is very interested in the end the mathematics of higher dimensions which I mentioned earlier in our conversation\nThe book is from Nineteen twenty seven it becomes a kind of a best seller and a lot of people\nA lot of people in Europe and America read the book and get interested in thinking about their dreams as somehow predicting the future and you know sometimes give talks about this and different places and I always have audience members come up to me I always have people emailing me saying oh I'd had dreams like that [noise]\nUm so you know it seems to be a fairly common experience actually that people in dreams seem to get one of things that can happen or does that happen in real life\nAnd then you have experiences where people are not sleeping there not dreaming and they happened in a while they're awake at time slips or day job blue or were they seem to be\nIn some other reality and then they come back and this one outside audio ... what's the how do you how does that fit into the framework that you explore in this book\nYeah yeah exactly I talk about some other experiences as well also in that chapter six I'm\nNot a little bit in the chapter on here Lewis I'm as well and then I have a chapter on Madeleine L'Engle right who's a famous writer a wrinkle in time\nJust recently a movie made a fact of that book but she talks about time flipped from and and time travel um and so on and some of her books [noise] so yeah how do they make sense of that um\nWhat time is not linear right my like my president could be somebody else's future\nYeah well for sure I mean I think one thing that one thing that done picks up on as as you say that Einstein has a new way of talking about what time is which is really\nCounter intuitive and weird right I mean before Einstein people thought about time as just linear or something that just flowed out of uniform rate right we we have a sense of prime flowing we have this kind of intuitive sense that prime flows forward\nUm in fact so you know I find that a number of counter intuitive things to say but one of them was that\nOf the ways that we experience time is probably just an illusion and the product of the limitations of our own consciousness that Einstein's equations for for the universe really lay out something that looks a little bit different but they really lay out a universe\nThat could be called up a block universe\nUniverse that already exist\nSo um you know all locations in the universe and all times in the universe I'm already exist and they're all laid out in this big block\nWe are we are kind of a passing through [laughter] passing through that that block prior we occupy little portion of that block but every moment in our past and in our in our president and in our future and in the earth's future and in our son's future\nAnd and all of our defending future's all those moments are already laid out in the block at least according to the\nThe laws of physics um and and this is actually discussions Scott defending wants to look at it just got to my book but you can also look at Brian Greene book he's a professor of physics at Columbia He wrote a new book called the fabric of the cosmos where he talks about this kind of block universe so I'm\nDone and I was only laid out what does that say about destiny and free will and yeah that's the kind of questions that you as a professor religious studies tackle all the time\nYeah you're right you're right it it lays out these big philosophical issues right like um faith in destiny and human free will and how we are we to make choices on and so on [noise]\nUm so and we can definitely talk about those issues I mean one thing that done did um and some of the other people in my book did as they thought through these problems was they said you know I'm I think what ... what's happening is that\nYou know the fact that these future moments are already laid out somehow in the block universe makes it more plausible or makes it more possible that you know maybe the dreaming self could somehow lifted itself up above our\nThree dimensional world or I should start ... world right because we have three spatial dimensions and one temporal dimension\nDreaming felt he said and lift up out of that block universe and peek into future moment and Don believe that um you know using a bit of Einstein here and a bit of you know him than and higher space last or is there um that's what he believed to happen in some other dreaming consciousness had an additional\nA degree of freedom an additional direction that it could move in\n'em and and if we could talk about that as a as additional facial dimension or we could talk about that is now maybe consciousness somehow can move with an additional degree of freedom but that's what he thought and have you thought everybody everybody's sleeping so had this degree of freedom and he also believe that everyone if they ... kept a journal by their bed\nOf their dreams and and they follow you had a couple of recommendations for how to how to do a dream journal\nHe believe that if everyone did it they would be able to see that all of the all of our dreams contain bits and pieces of future events and confidence I'm sort of mixed up together well\nI guess the central question for me about higher dimensions is are there people there and can they interact with us or is it us that's over there we're going to get into that uh those topics as well as near death experiences want to talk about say onto a showman remote viewers\nHow some of those ideas that we've discussed on this program before might fit into our discussion of other world so the book spirituality and the search for visible dimensions by Christopher white or we're going to take a break and be back in a moment David Gray sail away takes us into the break you\nKnow you can show up dates with other ... fans would you joined

of flat land where this uh summer hire dimension being reaches down and grabbed somebody from to the world pulled them up\nUm could someone from sixty or Seventy or Seventy reached down and grab us and pull it up so we can understand the true nature of reality what do you think\nOh sure I mean I think that you know it depends on how you think about those dimensions and what's in them but I mean you certainly have had\nYou know religious and spiritual people over the last hundred years say things just like that right I mean in fact you've had\nPeople um even even cs Lewis talk about you know God in Christ as higher dimensional um and as beans that calmed down and insert themselves into our lower dimensional world just like the sphere did that and and the and habits book a flat land so\nYeah people have definitely thought about um\nWhat we say thought about visitors from from higher rounds or ... or spiritual beings are angels or whatever I'm as higher dimensional um and as as kind of the higher dimensional objects that than themselves into our world\nThat sounds perilously close to saying that science and religion could coexist that uh you know that the paranormal bleeps good coexist with a scientific yeah that is scientifically acceptable version of reality\nYeah yeah I think so I mean in my book I Try to put you know a number of different people in the story so I have people who have let's\nSay these kinds of moments of inspiration or who experienced like a near death experience um and then I have them talking about their experience and then I also have scientists in the book as well and some skeptics I have different voices in the book I'm\nTalking about what the meaning of\nThese events are ... and you know there's not just one story in the book there's a lot of different voices they're trying to interpret\nWhat's happening but you definitely have you know the the through line in the book is is are these people who have these kinds of uncanny experiences are remarkable experiences moments of insider intuition or near death experiences are out of body experiences and so on\nAnd and that they are ... than using scientific concept to to understand what what could be happening and I think that you know figures in my book like\nLike all of us today I mean I think that\nWe all want to use science you know I think we I think science is for the authoritative\nI'm set of discourse is that we used to talk about talk about reality so I think I think that's what they're doing I think you know just like jaded up you've done right to have these dreams that seem to predict the future where did he go you know he didn't he didn't actually go to the Bible at that point to figure it out he went to Einstein you know he went through\nAnd he went to sort of like popular science book um\nAnd I think that you know that's one point I tried to making the books I think a lot of us are sort of inspired by\nA man interested and fantastic scientific concept um\nAh well I mean humans humans have been trying to reach a other higher dimensions rather realities for a long time prayer would be an example reaching out to some invisible world there I'm\nAbsolutely yeah I Know a remote viewing\nYeah\nYeah yeah there's there's all kinds of things that would fit into that you're right and people have been trying to to reach the transcendent uh ever since there have been humans on earth right on ... reaching for something else reaching beyond our own subjectivity um\nAnd we talked about dreams earlier I think a through dreams and you know in the sixties and other times you know Americans used psychedelic drugs to open up a what they believe it was like a doorway of consciousness into\nAnother realm and in other cultures you might use other plants or substances are losing the chance to to reach a transcendent but prayer meditation absolutely there are all different all different different methods\nAh so I'm Wondering if the example of remote viewing where people project your consciousness over space and time seemingly independent of space and time to access information that they shouldn't be able to get that isn't that make sense because of the idea of other worlds higher dimensions\nWell\nUm let's see I think I think people have certainly talked about remote viewing and other uh parents came on an\n... ads higher dimensional because uh you know maybe we can go back to Abbott's book flat land for a minute because [noise]\nYou know flat line what happens is you know you can imagine a two dimensional world of characters of very flat right sliding around the surface of your desk they don't they know a length and wet but they don't know that third direction or dimension which is\nWhich is um up or down so when you're if you're a figure in and flat land let's say you're just a flat square and you're sliding around on the surface of your flat world and let's say you look out um you know you look around and\nAnd what do you see well if you're a flat square fighting around on a flat world you you actually\nDon't see her whole world you just see a line right let's say a friend comes toward you and he's a triangle and he's fighting towards your what do you see what you just see a line on every everyone and flat land and just see a one dimensional line but what happens when the flat square gets pulled\nOff of the two dimensional world\nUp into a higher space a three dimensional space in the story is suddenly he can see the full dimension analogy of his flat world so he looks\nHe looks and he sees flat land before him all laid out and he can suddenly\nA he suddenly has powers of vision that he never had right he can look down\nAt flat land he can see for the first time not just lines that he can see A People's homes he can see into their homes right 'cause he's looking down on the whole flat world so you can see he can see all of his friends whether they're triangles or squares or lines\nHe can see all of their dimensions he can see even inside right say let's say he has a friend who's a triangle 'em all he saw before was their line coming towards them but now he can see the whole triangle he could even see inside the trial like in the inside homes\nSo I raise this as an example because\nPeople have used to say a ha you know um well if we were raised somehow in consciousness up into a higher spatial dimensions maybe we could look back on our three dimensional world and have amazing power the vision\nSo um you know maybe we are just like the square right when raised to hire dimension we look back on our world and what we see we would see all sides of everything at once you could look down on your home for instance and see all the rooms laid out\nYou know you could see the insides of everyone's bodies you could see the outside of one's body you could see the top of the house and the bottom of the house um\nSo you would have a kind of a higher dimensional vision um and so people do indeed use these ideas to talk about things like remote viewing right um or or they use these ideas actually to talk about\nWhen you go on a vacation or any

that sounds similar to the kind of practice you're talking about\nWell Marsha I just wrote that down I'm going to give that a try next year the suggestion that dollar [laughter] from the idea right east of the Rockies Michael in Connecticut I'm Michael\nI'm also I'm prayer will open the dimensions a live show in a two king six is sort of them was frightened by the Syrian Army that's surrounded both him\nAnd I shall pray to God to open the eyes of is serving his sermons eyes were opened in other words he was able to look into another dimension the\nMoms were full of horses in chariots of fire and you couldn't call to serve in much more than that\nUh as far as other worlds if you go into he bruised won it talks about that God created the world's and that's the plural formed also occurs in chapter eleven so there are dimensions out there uh the Bible talks about them as being the unseen\nAnd also there's other worlds populated with intelligent life so I mean now also um if you know you're talking a little bit about we gee boards and um the Bible tells us specifically in um ... ethics minded dead known nothing and we're not to get involved in Nick romance seat\nA San says any of that it didn't work out too well with um\nKing saw when he approached the which should end or the next day he and his boat\nSt John do you have a question for Chris\nOh well I'm just saying that you know you want to practice prayer is a very good form of meditation and uh we're promised an axe to Seventeen that job will open up our ice and real prophesied despair will move on\nAll ... all religions All right but thank you I appreciate the call appreciate it we're going east of the Rockies a dog in New Jersey I doubt\nThat morning how are you know whether this evening good what's on your mind\nOr is it was very is there a newly hit a practitioner maybe there's something you do before you go to sleep to help you um uh out who are prepared to uh uh be able to remember these dreams or how to ah make them more loose it\nI don't know that's a little Christmas is a Christmas tried that has any expertise but we'll ask him\nThere I mean gun in his book I'm On dreams doesn't really talk about uh preparing yourself at night although I think there are other\nFolks out there who've written books about how to remember your dreams who do actually you know say things like you know\nTalk to yourself at night before you sleep and tell yourself you're going to remember your dreams on so I think some people would say there are ways to prepare yourself but done done system is pretty simple just keep a journal under your pillow or on your night stand and right when you wake up\nWhenever it is right down on as many details as you can about the dream and he feels that by doing that um as a daily practice\nYou'll get better and better actually at remembering Adrian Adrian sort of evaporate pretty quickly after we wake up right we remember them right away then we forget them but his his journal and technique he said\nUm you know help people remember more and more details as you go through the process so that that is pretty simple technique but there there are there are others out there who talk about um dream and dream interpretation\nThanks dug up going to take a call from a this was a first for me from volcano California the caller is Brendan good good morning Brennan\nMorning what's on your mind on about is a street paralysis so I keep having episodes where I'm\nI'm I'm I'm just a little bit I'm suffer from insomnia so when I get on these worldwide all sleep\nConsecutive days very well it seems like after about five or six days of this but\nI get on this trip where I'm falling asleep on my body is falling asleep when my my mind's away I guess they caused the process but\nIt's almost like I go into a different universe and there's all we've seen that I see and usually are trying to get me\nAnd pull me out of my body and not only that I hear them they talk to me so I'm I'm curious on what your thoughts are on is this just ... you know might just listen to any like\n... Internet or ... was there the doctors will say or is this an actual dimension that\nDuring the state of my body is and I'm able to actually I don't wanna say teleport but you know something along that lines into that and it's very scary yeah\nYeah yeah right at all I think I can recall\nYou rented let's let's let's Christopher respond thanks Bernard for the call so does sleep deprivation lead to other realities I Wonder\nYeah yeah um well he mentioned the word sleep paralysis and he also seemed to I thought I heard him say consulting doctors are with computer there there is a category of sleep per hour from there are\nThere are things that happened when people are falling asleep or waking up in the sleep proud has thing as Gary ... is a very common\nYou know people wake up and they can't move um [noise] you know and it can I think I Believe it can be accompanied by\nSeeing things and and hearing things and so on so [noise]\nYou know uh get the question is is is merely a a physiological biological um\nIssue or a problem or is it somehow opening the spiritual world I guess my answer is I don't know I think that if you if you do look on line or consult the doctor they will they will tell you what I said which is you know these kinds of things happen and sometimes when people are awake there in a kind of an in between state of consciousness I'm\nYou know they'll talk in terms of psychology and neurology\nBut um it it could also be um an opening to\nOther realities of the spiritual reality or maybe I don't know you know in some cultures um in some cultures you know people have visions um [noise]\nUh that that can be traced to you know brain chemistry or some sort of a from ... from ... aspect of their of their biology or the brain chemistry but I don't think that rules out the possibility that you know their particular use your brain chemistry as it off or\nYou know and it was white thank you very much appreciate it I enjoyed the book it's called other worlds I Hope people will check it out thanks also to him earlier guest Nick Redfern and we've got his the links are\nPosted on the coast to coast website and thanks to my colleagues there at coast a Michael co CEO and Donna Walker ...

logical community\nYour turn their heads away from these kind of phenomena so um you know that can be problematic but um I always tell people I mean if you look back in history [noise] um you know he told me being a couple of centuries 'em\nBefore a lot of recognized animals where was found to exist in the first place so I think it's important to remember that it's um you know there are surprised

back when those stories were unfolding and seemed like every couple of days or be a new citing or a a new angle on it\nAnd it was kind of fun it was like an oddity almost like a circus ... kind of a a story or um something that couldn't somebody in a costume or\nA as an oddity like that as opposed to something that really raised the goose bumps such as story you tell in this book about something called the winged man it's a story from staffordshire England in two thousand nine you remember the details\n[noise] oh yeah I run a plea um that was in a place called the kind of chasing central England only about five miles from where I grew up as a kid\nSo I Know the area very well and it's a it's a large area of a woodland let far Iceland\nAnd I'm like certain places around the world that seem to be to the hot spots for power normal phenomena the kind of ... just the same you know they become known as window areas where it seems every fit in each brother comes through you know at various times\nAnd this was a particularly weird case but what was intriguing about it was it was taken very seriously by the local newspaper the chase post and somebody had seen this um\nWhat looked like a humanoid figure sort of literally flying or a soaring would be a better term to use over the woods I'm at a high speed um you know kind of a like a flying mine I'm not unlike I guess the you know the stories coming out of ...\nIn the sixties or with a ... something you know kind of power outage in that respect and there were there were a number of independent witnesses who came forward and spoke to the press one of them even spoke to the local police older [laughter] I don't really know what the police could have done about it it's um [noise]\nBut it was intriguing that you know you have this spate of weird activity in this area which he's already notorious for sightings of things interesting enough light the dog mine and ah the find some black dogs and also the large black cats as well\nYou know ... that's the I think that's the responsible way to do is to sort of look at the day to and and share rates and that's what I Do I put the diatribe for people to say and if I got out and says I tell people if I don't have an says I'll tell them you know they said that\nShe's a ... or ... or or possibility\nUm [noise] you know I'm not going to tell people that big forty some strange creature that come from the far side of the moon\nWhich [laughter] I don't believe that date by the way [laughter] but um\nYou know for someone to specifically states something along those lines is is not the way to go you know\nYeah there's a story in the monster book about something you go that's called bats watch and you share that with this\nWell yeah the the the ... is he really strange one and again it's sort of falls into one of the cats agrees that more than anything else is something that's\nSort of pops up is not seen again I'm just kind of I'm just sort of baffles paper that there are a lot of cases like that where um you know something pops up and people are like what was the fact\nAnd then he's never seen again but this particular case is an interesting one um it ... and I pulled Nineteen sixty four in Buckley, Washington and I'm actually quite close to my room there on the witness in mind I'm young man named Brian Khan\nFailed um he saw these strange ... he was driving along the road and it was sort of\nHumanoid with this huge wings\nBut it was kind of ... as well [noise] scares me and how the shining a yellow eyes but they sort of the ... the hair angle\nCombined with the large wings um you know the the the hat everybody in the wings kind of people said oh it's not you know it's not sasquatch because he's got wings but he caught it looks a bit like\n... and I'm I'm from loyal in Nineteen Ninety four it was actually quite big using that area and then like a lot of other these you know there's other cases he just sort of became part of the local legend them you know the areas folklore and so\nYou've got a lot of men in black stories women in black story you and I have talked about that before a that might be a ... year than the men in black and and then some of those cases you know they seem otherworldly just out of place\nUh you you know we we've been accustomed because of the movies or do you think that maybe there are some secret government agents but have you ever had any indications that maybe some of them are\nSort of very human government type operatives who are operating under the umbrella of something like a men in black trying to emulate the the real mystery and figuring they can get away with it that no one will believe the witnesses who see them\nYeah well I'm going to be honest with you in Georgia I'm doing five books now on on these phenomena foreign demanding black and one on the women and black and I have to say that the vast majority of all the reports I get don't send anything like you know they stepped out of the Pentagon the CIA all the FBI on and say\nI'm a you know nothing like the the concept in the movies they typically are described as looking\n... you know go on and the skins why why why um [noise] um people talk about how vaccines have the ability to mind control the personal hypnotized them\nBefore they even talked about when they're in close proximity to them that they fall and sick afterwards almost like a like a soup and actually infection or something along those lines\nAnd um there are cases when the men in black and the women and black of turned up in homes right after paper being using wage bullets which puts another angle to its\nUm but there's no doubt in my mind again um that's you know this is a real phenomenon but it's not like it's portrayed in the movies it's more sort of like a\nYou know like a gothic horror story mixed in with the X files you know you put those two issues together that's that's how I Would sort of describe they ... the ... street it's fall be on you know just guys in black suits walk\nAnd I only got ... you know\nI'm asking it into context ... with cattle mutilation is I think you know there's there's a lot of evidence that the use animal relations are carried out by something other than just um um humans and helicopters that some of them are truly inexplicable and then you have a whole other wave of them that\nSurely seem like they aren't humans that are carrying out the same kind of thing for whatever reasons um this is sort of leading us to where we are going in the next hour to talk about your other book on the alien abduction wells but we're in human agencies and that doesn't mean government agencies but humans\nUh pretend to be something paranormal get away with something that's really weird and they they do it in a way that so that there isn't a lot of serious scrutiny by people like you were people like me or rather investigators\nWell yeah I mean I think you know when you talk about the ... you know you've got a really weird ones and exploit couple and then some which are easier perhaps to explain the recent powerless demanding black where there's no doubt that in some cases I think the\nGovernment agencies are responsible for that might be but I think it's a very small cats are great but says they the January unexplained ones and the way the ones\nI think we're going to have occasions and there is some evidence to support\nIt over the years agencies may actually unemployed elections demanding black as a means to cover their tracks in other words it might be able to think of them and know that many black radio but I don't know what they are but it doesn't event\nFrom using the legend a moat hey\nAs a main too quiet April or may not want to have him talking about that is so the government actually not know how many black really are and I don't like to fully\nBut that sort of lead us into where we're heading in the next hour we're going to talk about top secret alien abduction files what the government doesn't want you to know that ... latest book\nUh whether or not you believe alien abductions are real the files on alien abductions are real

that doesn't mean somewhat isn't really following you around it's sort of the the the inspiration for this new book or yours top secret alien abduction files\nYou talk about the world in which we live where mass surveillance\nIs sort of a given now right\n[noise] well unfortunately in of course you know\nSubsequent generations\nDo growing world wherever I've never known any different you know I'm\nRight for the night before the Internet age will remember it was not a sort of worldwide surveillance that we have now and you know I think that's what I mean I'm fortunate things for future generations it's going to be helping normal thing for\nProbably accept it as well\nOr you know you mentioned in in in the book about the idea of the fear that people used to have that maybe the government's going to talk us into getting a computer chip stuck under our skin and then they can follow us and they'd all be for all the good reasons you know for our health and wellbeing and\nAll kinds of ways but in fact they would be able to monitor everything we do everything about us we already have a a surveillance devices like that we all carry them or their cell phones yeah\nUm but the idea that our government the u._k. government other governments around the world would put time and resources into not only investigation of these phenomena UFOs things so that's the word alien abductions but would monitor intimidate\nFollow a alien abductees whether\nOr not the government understands what ... alien abductions are all about that that idea which seemed preposterous but too many but you make the case in this book that it's real and ongoing right\n[noise] yeah I mean the reason why I wrote the book which actually facial oh vacation guy first to November people can already got it but um\nThe the reason I wrote top secret I mean abduction falls is because over the years I collected a number of official documents on abductions which will be declassified for the feed me from ... in the u._k.\nUm the u._s. and finally I was in a position where I could actually sort of put the book together\nAnd you know provide the ready to leave us it's another book on Eileen abductions bus instead of going just overall ground you know\nWhy not present paper with the guy just showing how falls or be put together now I start the book actually with the contact a movement\nOf the Nineteen fifties which preceded they abduction phenomena by just about ten years or so and the reason I did that was to demonstrate to people from the would go so to speak but um government agencies\nDo ah put together falls on paper to claim to have had I been unconscious for example just about all of the ... of the Nineteen fifties like Georgia ... George finds hassle true and bathroom\n... all of them had FBI falls open on them one of the main reason Spain was because they claimed when\nI'm interviewed by the FBI that yes they ... they are and sees would I aliens but they told the FBI that they the Iranians had a government or government is very different two hours and bordering on\nCommunism and I'm so that really opened the eyes\nOf the FBI to the extent that for example George finds hassles FBI file um he's extremely expensive it's like about an inch thick um Georgia ... is about a hundred and fifty pages\nI'm over ... she was about four to and so on so you know we have a precedent for the abduction phenomenon\nWith the contact tape people now\nIn the fifties excuse me in the early sixties things really kicked off I'm with the Iranian abduction phenomenon in September sixty one I'm with the bacteria and Bonnie hill case which is I guess the defining moments you follow gee when\nIt wasn't the first abduction case on record but he was certainly the one that really opened people's eyes when\nJohn full of wrote a book on the case they interrupted journey now in the story of basketball and hail that coming back from a a vacation in Canada they say the strange lights in the sky and then things kind of get waited a they don't fail writes\nThe you know everything seems a bit surreal and strange\nAnd they get back home and then they start having these weird dreams and nightmares of being taken on board\nThe strange craft would they be strange creatures and being subjected to a stranger and intrusive experiments now what's particularly intriguing is that I found a file in the British\nNational archive and it revolved around among Ronald wild man\nWho was a delivering a vehicle in the south of England and he was like the early hours of the morning to I Am\nAn essay was driving the vehicle to the location\nThey the lights on the call when I was on the call started in time to a halt\nAnd they should they should become known as the the vehicle interference phenomena within you follow gee what's intriguing is that they\nThey uh British police force actually handed over the investigation\nBecause they report to the to the police found it over to a group within the British royal Airforce caused coal they\nPromised in security services are sort of like the the James Bond they feel like of the of the royal Airforce they sort of get involved and espionage and counter intelligence things like that what's interesting is that in the file it talks about how the\nThey the they promised and security services interviewed Ronald wild man by the same time to with the with the ... to a halt and the UFOs in front of him\nAnd the most telling an intriguing aspect is that he told the police and this is a direct quotes that he was modeled by the time\nWhich is an interesting thing that goes that sort of sounds just like you know the whole missing time angle of abduction law in today's world but Ronald while in the fall actually refers to him saying that yes he sold his UFO come down lights went out of his vehicle\nAnd then he kind of felt a bit strange checked his watch and there was something about ... it's actually you know portrayed completely and the file but he says he was much older by the time which I think you know you put all those aspects together that has the potential for being a significant abduction case\nI think about the contact D's and I remember reading about them when I first got into this subject and thinking\nSort of amused meant well there were there were a interesting colorful harmless sort of weirdos um but the more you read about um the more interesting they become a course people like a dam ski\nThen you realize that these guys showing these crazy stories some some of them would say you know they they met these women and winter Venus and things like that you you you have a hard time taking the literally but when you realize that the government use really does followed them around it takes it seriously for whatever reason\nI ... it makes me think of like the Roberts men or that the CIA scientist studied UFO topic and they include the UFOs themselves are not a threat to national security but reporting you up those might be because maybe the Russians could somehow manipulate a public opinion\nIs that a justification for going around people like a dam ski bathroom those books\nOh yeah because I mean George ... is a first book flying saucers of land they published in the early fifties that\nThat sold him huge figures\nGigantic numbers of books were sold 'em and a a dump ski went on the lecture circuits are all around the country and he was talking about how the aisle and supposedly have this sort of a communist type of governments um that communism was the way of the future\nAnd the FBI open that file on a damn skate um predominantly because he was someone you're talking about a controversial subject namely UFOs and contact with a million bucks\nThe FBI was more concerned as to how painful reading these books and go into his lectures might be influenced by the communist angle and I'm a number of the the contact chase I'd sort of similar approaches for example to get him the K\nNineties you know sort of pre Internet here um all of the lectures that I wrote to each other back and forth were opened and sailed back down with type and I'm\nNow they can clearly be done you know a family without making it looked like the ... I was taught open race failed it was almost as if\nWhoever was doing base wants to Greg and call it ... know that someone was opening their mail in other words he was sort of like an intimidation hey you know we're watching it\nAnd that went on you know for for quite a period\nOf Greg is working tonight at our Web master by the way so uh yeah I I saw his name was going to mention that in the book and ask you about it\nI mean there are a lot of people in the you up all the old who you know I'm not as credible is Greg who are sure that the government's watching him I'm and I'm not sure I Believe all of them I Believe him though he says it and you\nKnow I think sometimes you know that there's no doubt that if you have a traumatic experience like an alien abduction then I think sometimes people can become sort of paranoid of every little thing in their life you know\nAnd which is a dangerous road to go down um but in saying that I mean another example is the whole issue of black helicopters which I think many papers so Shiite that we've ...\nI'll tell you what were let's wait a second we'll get into that on the other side are saved some time so people can ask you a couple of questions that we got some other ground to cover before then we're going to go into the break with a deep purple demons I like Seventy one\nDuring the ... the bones have been ... ... ... ... ...

Redfern tonight a in a moment we continue our conversation about his new book a top secret alien abduction piles the very real X. files about abductees and weird incidents such as capital mutilation and black helicopters\nAll that conspiracy stuff has is grounded in fact and we'll get into that a just a moment and save some time or a couple of your calls and questions and comments as well be right back [noise]\n\nMethod you ... if you're considering going back to school I felt so following questions do you need the flexibility to take classes and your schedule you have college credit to

cattle and horses and\nDeer and uh other ... other kinds of creatures but a cattle or the the ones we know best that have been publicized most I Can't imagine what the total dollar amount of losses for livestock losses for ranchers and farmers could be but it's a pretty substantial\nAnd when you look at how the government has responded the FBI\nHad some ... agents who looked at it a very cursory examination investigation that really didn't get to the bottom of it and then nothing so what do you make of that and in combined with the black helicopter phenomena that you're discussing this book\nWell I think you know the the black helicopter phenomena and I'm clearly a real one um they just seem to be tied to both capital mutilation and um the abduction phenomena and\nOne of the things as being no taste and I think there's probably some truth to this is the idea that phase\nWhere ever flying these helicopters potentially I think is part of an organized fashion that up right outside of government you know my actually my sort of do research and work for the government\nAnyway she took a man she never could turn out to the parents want or anything like that\nSo she took 'em in and

running out of time here with ... on the payroll\nThey um they said the swamp and or some people are at the same because they hadn't seen in town any of that they were missing they couldn't get anywhere in the only thing they could find was rocket cherish carry with some ... some rock\nAnd they called date for college women very you came out like that and he couldn't figure out any advance are they missing and they they never heard anything from even want to\nThank you for sharing that story I'm going to get ... take on that Thanks John appreciate your calling Nick have you heard that one before anything like\nThat story but what I have heard all kinds of similar situations where you know ... in within the family was known that um you know what you have a grandmother you know back in the thirties or forties long before you know the whole ... narrow view ... took off\nThat that were abduction like experience he's ... fan in other words it's not just something that began with a bacterium bony heel case\nIt's just it's just a case of trying to find the earlier ones and very often that does come through you know what a family member decides to\nTo contact someone like me you know and and share a story that goes back to you know the twenties all the parties like that one so I'm you know I think we can push they the barriers back significantly you know when it comes to when this whole phenomenon actually kicked off\nTrying to get one more call in the first time caller Josh in Toronto hey Joshua ... read from\nYour evening gentlemen how you doing All right thank you and your mind\nYeah basically had something on my mind it was in Nineteen fifty nine case if nine Russian student hikers who went missing will not missing but it looked like they were attacked and according to many people are rushing a yeti I don't know if your guest has any conclusion to that story was a\nLog house yet I outlook yeah\nYeah the ... or ... stories and interesting one you know it was um [noise]\nYou know a bunch of Russian papal um you know where it together with friends and um\nDied under very all circumstances and I'm\nA ... to ... to this day I mean there's everything from\nLike violent big foot type creatures attacked and killed them or you have sort of Russian military experiments UFO activity and despite all the research on the top of several books are being written on the subject there's no\nSort of one hundred percent consensus on what actually happened it's it remains you know ... but there are a lot of\nWeight aspects to the story which I guess unfortunately you know we'll never really know\nThe answer I think it's going to remain a mystery unfortunately\nNick I don't know how when you sleep but you are you're a as a prolific an author as I Know in the world or any one I Want to talk about anything else you got coming up we got about a minute left\n'em well either so but you know that's what the new books a top secret abduction falls that's what I'm sort of a you know promoting narrow I'm I'm not as I said the reason I wanted to ride it was because you have to pay a lot of books about abductions but a book that sort of actually addresses\nFate of any information files on everything from abductions to missing time to black helicopters you know it it presents a new angle on the abduction issue if you like\nThank you Nick it's always great to be here when a urge people to take a look at the new book and also the monster book it's a great one to have your library if you're interested in these kind of subjects always good to have year thank you Nick\n... thanks electrode and coming up something that uh that uh might put a different perspective on that kind of subjects we talk about on their show it's a whole other world

in religion and science spirituality and on church religion new religious movements electronic media and popular culture and is currently a professor of religion at Vassar College his new book other worlds\nSpirituality and the search for invisible dimensions is a spectacular and mind bending a Christopher welcome to the program\nMorning George thanks for having me on the show\nThanks for staying up so late or ... I was wondering the first thing I was wondering when I finished this book was how do you get away with this issue you are a seemingly respectable guy teaching at a grade school and I wonder if you're if you're gonna catch Greece for doing it\n[laughter] um no it's um yeah how do I get away get away with it it's um you know a lot of people and cultural studies or people who are interested in the study of religion or\nYou know we do we do get a pass to study really cool fantastic things right um people's um unusual experiences and unusual states of consciousness religious experiences\nExperiences what whatever you want to call them so\nYeah it is kind of the privilege to be to be a professor and and get a chance to just kind of follow my interest and that's really ... how the book came along um\nIt came out of an earlier book I was working on that looked at sort of the science of religious experience and spirituality but as you know this on the move or a new direction by thinking about\nScience and physics and cosmology and how are these sort of fantastic scientific ideas have led to um have led to it and at least a new vocabulary that people are using now to talk about your death experiences and and the parents and and even after life experiences and so on\nYou mentioned in the in the beginning uh and of course as a as somebody who studies religious studies and religion and how it interacts with the world and popular culture you mentioned in the beginning how a belief in church or a formal religion organized religion is sort of\nLimiting a around the western world but interest in spiritual and spirituality topics or has has remains strong or you may increase that that uh that's kind of a challenge for somebody in your line of work to figure out why that's happening\nYeah I think it is I think it is and um you know that's why a lot of us are trying to study these these new forms of spirituality I mean that that was really as you say that was really how I began the book with this puzzle you know the problem which is you know people still an America seem to have a lot of\nI guess we'll be called spiritual beliefs they ... him pretty high numbers in America\nI'm believing and goes for believing spirits or believe in God I'm and yet on the other hand as you say a participation and traditional religious congregations are affiliation in traditional really with traditional religious congregation so things seem to be going down\nUm how how can we think about that how can we talk about this you know how how is it the case that people seem to have a very real sense of relief and other world um and spirituality and the abdomen are really in the absence of\nParticipation and traditional congregation so that's what I tried to think about and try to think well where where people getting that these ideas you know where where people getting their beliefs their ideas about other world and\nI'm kind of a big science documentary person and I'm I'm real you know I'm kind of like a science nerd and in a sense and interested in ... book and I think there is there's a lot of sort of fantastic scientific concepts that circulate now in our culture and I think uh you know concepts like\nDark matter dark energy or even thinking about\nInfinity a or thinking about the the multiverse or thinking about higher dimension I think all of these fantastic scientific concepts which I think scientists themselves and the Braves with ... with offensive on mystery and and wonder\nI think those concepts just sort of uh the the bed for for new spiritual infections and I and I um and that's what I Try to look out of the book\nWell you know we we I don't imagine you listen to the program all that often but on this program we talk about some pretty wild stuff and I think that scientists will die hard time relating normally charges\nToo late [laughter] [laughter] yeah I was pretty wild stuff that I think mainstream scientists generally have a tough time getting their head around a near death experiences out of body experiences encounters with other realities um you know time slips things of that sort\nOf that you you'd sort of reached out look and look for a way to maybe\nMake a bridge between science and those kinds of subjects with this understanding of\nParallel realities other dimensions higher dimensions we talk about that those kinds of concepts on the program all the time and as if it's a given a they're a given but we don't really I don't think many of us know I Can't get my head around other dimensions and\nUm it it's it hurts even think about it but you take a deep dive into a sort of why those kind of concepts are so commonly held so um\nThat that was important not only to reach out to people like us to discuss these crazy things but also to science right\nYeah I think so yeah I think so I mean one thing I Try to do in the book is\nUm I Try to try to demystify a little bit the discussion about other dimensions and the and the first couple of chapters the book I I can I ask the question of what it what is an extra dimension um and I talk a bit about a talk a bit about that and maybe I can just say worried about that for for the listeners tonight yes yeah I'm ...\nAnd the ... the idea of another dimension is not that I'm not that after ... after all I mean we have we know we have we have three directions or mentioned three facial\nMentions that we live in and that's linked with and height\nAnd those are are are three directions or or dimensions there's there's an additional dimension that we sometimes talk about is the fourth dimension um since Einstein in that time so we live in a a four dimensional space time a world an on science I spoke about this but\nSome of the people I talk about in my book talked about an additional spatial dimension [noise] a a direction and space or a dimension in space that's different from the other three so you know we could think of like we could we could draw the line on a piece of paper or a line as one dimensional object has length\nIf you then draw flask where on that same piece of paper and has two directions or dimensions has links and wet\nAnd then you could you could draw cube I'm On the paper or you could hold a Rubik's Cube in your hand and that would be a three dimensional object has three spatial dimensions are linked with and height and then the then the question becomes is okay what about a fourth direction um or a fourth dimension\nAnd this would be you know this would be an object that has links with height and something else [laughter] and the the something else as the tricky part something else is the\nIs the direction that we cannot perceive so if there is such a direction to reality or dimension to reality it's it's evidently not something that we can we can see 'em or perceive I'm so this this is the possibility raised by math mathematician and and actually others some philosophers I'm In the\nGoing back to the Eighteenth century but really in the nineteenth century mathematicians raised the possibility raised seems like kind of a strange thing to think about what how could there be another direction or dimension to reality\nUm you know and why would there be one well mathematicians in the nineteenth century start to use this idea within the context of their mathematical equations and the reason they do is they want to want to make the mathematics of of the universe of its forces in laws more simple and more elegant 'em and they find that\nThey find that it works um [noise] they find that they find corporate in an extra spatial dimensions\nA fourth visual dimension that the the mathematics of the universe is a law enforcers look better on the equations cleaner they seem simpler more elegant\nUm um and so on so and in fact just skip forward to today today you still have mathematicians doing the same thing um you still have mathematicians incorporating within the context of their um [noise]\nUh within the context of their mathematical equations higher spatial dimensions not not just for the spatial dimensions but even fifth sixth seventh even more and these are string theorist I don't know um if you are your members of the\nEver wrote the book just the kind of encourage people to\nYou know think about the possibility that above our three faces are three spatial dimensions there might be others um\nThat we don't see we go through our life I'm thinking that our world is the only world\nYou know may maybe there's something beyond\nWell it's a it's fun to to talk about it on to imagine but when you combine higher dimensions and the ...\nIt gets pretty complicated [laughter] um [laughter] I tell you what we're gonna we'll take we won't jump into that will take a break first and we'll come back and get into that the inspiration or some of the stories that you tell about people who are inspired by this idea\nAre very sad I mean people who embrace it and they they go through\nTrials in turmoil so in trying to get their head around it as as I have a ... but we'll we'll get into that in a moment are

white other worlds spirituality and the search for invisible dimensions there's a character who's a explain named Jay be Priestley\nI wanted to share a quote with you because it's sort of flows from what the Robbie with singing about and that song there are men have got to feel at home in the universe again and I I Believe a great deal of the despair of our time is due to the fact that men meeting people of a false picture of the universe and our destiny having lost religion and gained nothing in its place\nToo many people have come to believe that light doesn't amount to much there are
