Gilligan with his hat you know\nAnd we were watching a move my dad and I I think what a lot of these movies the bonding thing you know fathers son\nKind of on the same way I was going to talk about that and I I Will but you're exactly right\nAnd and I think it kind of a rite of passage you know and and I think originally I was watching these movies to kind of be with my dad and I he would be in the recliner watching creature features and I'd be next to him or hiding behind the recliner some time\nThink I think women spend the money so I think that a lot of horror film but I think one has kind of been made and even with this new car or a with this new Halloween movie Jamie Lee Curtis is the hero she's she's going to kill a Michael Meyers when she gets a hold of them she ... she was praying for him to escape that is being asylum so she could blow it brings out\nAnd I think that having heroic women in these movies that evening star wars you know and now a doctor who was a woman I think that you know if a if it's a these are women are still spending their money on media physical media on movies\nAnd they're they're controlling that dollar and I think we're going to see a lot of wind five five films with strong female will\nThrow throw out some percentages I'm going to give you some age brackets here among those who are Fifteen Years old to Twenty one percent of them do you think go to movies\n[noise] probably none [laughter] not really [laughter]\nTwenty\nFifteen to Twenty years old yeah I I I Would\nI Would say forty ... about\n... twenty to thirty\nTwenty to thirty I Would say uh I Would maybe I maybe I you that a little higher maybe maybe fifty percent\nThirty to forty percent usually\n[noise] thirty to forty I Would say I would say larger I Would I Would guess maybe sixty five\nReally okay now I think it starts coming down forty to fifty years old\nForty to fifty years old I think it yeah I think it would really come down I Would think the baby baby at twenty percent fifty to sixty\nAnd I would have probably even less and I don't know maybe the fifth year old might be hanging in there but I think maybe the six year olds and ... and beyond are probably a much much more likely to enjoy a film in their home and the trouble with going to a theater\nOne of the things we'll do just for fun next hour when we take calls for you is we'll ask the callers if they want to share their age it's up to them\nAnd bone only well whether they go to movies or not I can't remember the last movie I went to I mean I\nI look at a lot at home on video I ... when you know they come out as a news new release or something I'll watch it but I I Can't remember the last time I was in an actual really I\nDo enjoy I Do enjoy seeing a film in the theater with an audience by a lot of\nTimes and that's your business your ... your business so I I'm\nI'm by it because I'm watching the audience both I\nThat's what you do so that's one of the things will do for them to take calls next hour in addition to your question your horror story of your favorite film if you want to give us she'd give time your age when you call in and uh let's ask you if you will when the last time you went to a movie\nOr you know what's interesting too about movies\nHow they have changed over the years I mean in the thirties and forties you had these grand musicals and these incredible songs\nAnd people were dancing on them in the movies man those those days are gone\nMaybe they'll come at you never know maybe they'll come back you know maybe George you know maybe you should dust off your tap shoes\n[laughter] you and I could\nMake up all singing all dancing supernatural for\nA dime a single George never was a tap dancer [laughter] to me I just saw a clip on YouTube\nFrank Sinatra and Gene Kelly dancing or to take me out to the ball game they sang it has to do what and they were magnificent together I didn't know Sinatra could dance like that no no I was surprising has\nAlways seen has and using the cartoons that rail thin swaying next to a microphone I don't really think of him dancing\nNo it's truly remarkable now are they still coming up with good horror films these days\nI kind of do you know you had mentioned the conjuring a movies\nI was five years ago it was good that was two thousand Thirteen was in it I\nGuess that's true but they're still making them yeah you're on the I don't know third or fourth conjuring spin off by now I think\nYou know what I think ... the ... movie\nYeah yeah they're rebooting that they've got a brand new no way and they're they're they've got their starting over with a fresh Dolly O. would look pretty beat up\nAnd they'll ...\nThey'll sell but all of the ... the only thing that I think is what is it still does it look like a toy elite looks to bike or ...\nYou know they should have looked at all like um you know they sort of look at like cabbage patch it the stuff from the eighties and and try and make them look more at this ... this new one I'm Talking about try try to make them look more like a like that you made of plastic I think to eat over the ... to\nOther than Amazon dot com now the

they would buy the theater out you know they would they would show up in town with a film under their arm a scary movie\nAnd they they they would rent the theater out a after hours and they would show these uh shows mainly for teenagers are usually teenagers who wanted his neck or an sometimes rowdy ah rowdy teenagers too\nAnd sometimes they did have matinees for kids to 'em but then they would

show remember without\nA job so literally absolutely I think that that didn't have an audience participation aspect to it you know when when they have the toast everyone throws a piece of toast at the screen\nOf people have call and response where they're yelling things up at the screen a you know there's rice prone during the wedding and I think it's an immersive experience but I also think because of the sexuality of the film you\nKnow people who are sixteen Seventeen years old and they're kind of emerging into their adult life\nKind of an ... thing that they can go and do with their friends and you know they might uh\nAccidentally see a little skin or something [laughter] so I think that all that factored in and and you have a you know people who who met them met each other is sixteen year old a Rocky Horror and ended up getting married as adults\nAs I've I've seen that that I've seen the shadow cast in the states or a performance that goes along with the movie performing very you're very different markets all over the country\nAnd over and over again I flew people who have met at that show and gotten married so I don't know what it is about that but you definitely

types of behaviors\nBut if you can bolster their sense of um personal worth their their value in the world and you you enhanced their self esteem\nYou'll see that when you trigger them they actually become more optimistic they care about other people so I think if we can approach this idea of death and the great mystery of it with an open heart and that kind of skepticism that is productive\nI I think can become a great exploration and a wonderful adventure for people\nProbably could win no did you did you know it would gr Mitchell before he passed on\nYeah very well regarded worked with him for years wonderful person Edgar said in the interview I did\nWith him for death makes life possible that you know I mean I was really interested in his story because he was a person who had been fighting in Korea he had been a test pilot and he talked about you know being on those aircraft carriers where\nWhen they would go off on a mission and then they had to come back and find the aircraft carrier in the middle of the ocean it was like a needle in a haystack\nAnd so for him that was a scary moment when he got in the Apollo capsule and went to the moon he said you know there was plenty of space on the moon and it was hard to find [laughter]\nUm but you know his thing that he said that I thought was so wise is that he felt that was much more important\nTo live a good life and to be a good citizen I'm to be loving inclined toward other people than it was to spend a lot of time worrying about what's going to happen next and I just thought that you know it's a powerful notion and he was a great man\n... where do you have evidence to prove that there's life after\nDeath if you were like quarter law and she knew this was challenged ducts which challenged could you prove that there's life after\n[noise] so this would make a great reality show and I love Ina courtroom let's do it [laughter]\nSo you have a judge and a jury and you have people representing different points of view on controversial topics so take this one you know life after death and you have these people arguing their various position\nWith witnesses that come and go\nExactly giving their own um personal testimony based on their experiences\nWe ... put it right there\nAnd then you get into this question of what would shift\nTo people's mind about that question and is it that data is it the fact that in Stevenson collected these you know nearly a thousand cases and\nShowed that thirty five percent of them correlated with the birth mark is that what's going to persuade people or is it the personal experiences that somebody's reporting you know I had a conversation with my departed dad and he told me to go to this closet and find something\nYou know that's really persuasive for people much more than accumulating a lot of data I think\nI think so too Dr Merrill Lynch which were those were going to take phone calls next hour\nAbove life after death which talked a little bit Marilyn and the time we have remaining here about consciousness and how important it please which rule but it plays with ... what would you first of all say consciousness is\nWell I think again we can have many definitions for me it's been about our awareness and also our lack of awareness of what we're not aware of so by that I mean when I first talked about Thomas ... book on paradigm shifts\nWe live in a paradigm or a world of you and the interesting thing to me about world views is that we don't even know that we have them\nAnd yet they're the most important thing that shapes her experience so it's like we're walking through life with these colored glasses on and it\nIt Shapes Our experiences and so we can't see those things that lie outside of our expectation\nAnd I think part of the process of becoming aware\nIs becoming aware that we're not aware\nAnd that we have what's called an attentional blindness for example we are primed to perceive those parts of the world that we expect to see and if we don't expect to see them we simply don't see them\nAnd I think that that is a remarkable\nUh aspect of what our consciousness is all about it's a lot of a functioning on auto pilot at the unconscious level and to the extent we can\nYou know turn the light on what those experiences are and what Shapes Our awareness where are we placing our attention that then offers that's the point of liberation into expanding what we understand to be true\nDo you believe that the consciousness Lou ... outside of the brain\nI Do I think consciousness is something that has intelligence it is self correcting\nIs reflective and so you can go into a rain forest and see that as consciousness manifest in the forest because every ... is filled with life and with that intention\nTo manifest life and so I I Do believe that consciousness is something ...\nIt's bigger than our individual brain I don't think it's an apathy famine out of the brain and at the same time I think the brain is kind of like you\nKnow the radio that is ... now and so if you destroy the brain you made to try and the radio it doesn't mean you just write the conscious\nOr the signal or the technology that it keeps coming ... exactly will will science ever meet\nThe spiritual side of all of this you know I mean I think we're getting closer and closer\nAll the time I spent time with the the ah the Android that robot\nYeah I've heard about her yeah it'd be great for you to interview 'em and see if they would do it in a way that doesn't mean they may want or is a talk show host if she's in a good ... nobody better than

most people believe there's something there I think people in had experiences that\nGiven a sense that I think that there are a lot of experiences that people report you know\nBeyond that survival of consciousness or identity you know people rip reporting of like pre cognition knowledge of the future\nUh people you know doing what you did about looking into your mind for information about a geographical location hormone viewing paradigm or you know they're all kinds of experiences that people have had that they report regularly and that\nThe majority of our population and including people with\nHigher levels of education report so this isn't just something that people experience and they have no education and you know the critics would say you know they just don't know any better uh in fact what it is it's something that people have very direct personal experiences about and which can change their life\n[noise] and you have Britain in the book how some people's lives have been changed dramatically through this change\n[noise] yeah I wrote a book called living deeply the art and science of transformation and we were very interested in trying to understand how people\nCan gain a perspective on life that is a richer and fuller and less filled with stress and anxiety and how can we do that and we know that a lot of people can become very rigid and fixed in their perspective and opinions but it's also possible that people\nYou know begin to shift their perspective and these kinds of experiences can lead to the sense that the world is more expansive and more complex than more\nMysterious than we had previously understood so we started to interview people about it we talked to the mystic than we talked to the great spiritual leaders and people representing different kinds of\nYou know traditional a ritual practice type of orientation and and now in that we really create a kind of a change model that said to us that there are ways in which we can\nBegin to bring our awareness and our intention to creating our life in ways that are are positive are um imbued with meaning and purpose and that ultimately lead to happier healthier experience it\nHotter than younger people react to these things now what do you think\nWell I think we have seen a generation of people grow up with the media with video games that expand their sense of what they're capable of\nAh there's certainly a lot of fascination with I you know or movies I think you were talking about that last program\nBack at this week in history this week an Eighteen

enchanted world view in order to feel happy that he approaches his life with a great deal of purpose with a sense of marvel all wonder\nUh and at the same time he you know he has developed this line of where he is willing to move and and part of it I also think happens when people get overly identified with a particular position\nYou know so you are in that role of the ... the skeptic or you're in the role of the proponents and it doesn't leave a lot of space for that interplay of curiosity and just you know questioning\nIt's almost five o'clock in the morning in New Jersey Doug's with us

of these people who had this experience\nBecause they believe in God and that if it changed your opinion are swayed it one way or the other I Would be under the impression that if most people have felt that they had ah been reincarnated or that they had a um a near death experience\nBut it it would I Would definitely justified with them without a doubt that yes there is a higher power being ... dog chooses whatever the person's religion may be or or\nTo to to come up with the thought that\nWe're continuing on and on for a reason or another that yet we care about other stand but yet if that is a plan there is somebody in a grand plan makers who had this all worked out ahead of time it it's just not like like you say there's no such thing as coincidence\nThat's exactly right what do you think of that Maryland\nI Do think that people who have these kinds of experiences begin to reflect on a world view that is more imbued with meaning and ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDay I thought oh my God I agree with Lindsey Graham is truly frightening [laughter] but you know he basically said he turned to the Democrats and they said you you better not get power because he can't handle it\nSo you know it's pretty scary and I I Will say this I think both sides have increasingly done it and the population and increasingly allowed themselves to be weaponized so you know the reality is is you know these people are not metaphors they're individuals and you have to judge them according to the evidence and according to the law\nAnd I'm now where does this come out I think the capital is going to be confirmed\nAnd it if he isn't confirmed as some of the moderates hold on it because if you you know if you do a deep dive into his record what it says he's he's a little bit more loyal to the establishment and the constitution\nSo I think he's apt to bend the law to help the ... the establishment of the government go where they want to go and that's what's going to get some of the moderate you know problems and so that might get she's going to be confirmed probably this weekend and what's interesting about this is the impact that will have on the election\nUm and I think one of the things that's done is it's really galvanized the Republican base because they're\nUh you know two weeks ago they were concerned about Trump's personality now you know and it tweeting now they're not they're concerned about what would happen if the um you know if the Democrats had the leadership position\nDo we do we all lose as people because of all of this\nAny any time any one of the things talk at the port the violation of due process um we we put our whole culture and our whole system in jeopardy and the whole our whole financial markets in jeopardy\nSo you know I think this is we each have a responsibility under the constitution of the law to to protect the law and I'll tell you something you know I went through an eleven year highly lawless process where I was targets\nIt and and you know efforts by government people to frame me mhm and when I\nWould have me George was that I literally you know I went to the process and said\nAnd what happened was there were so many people inside the FBI or the department of justice or the different agencies involved or my attorneys for the general population who really believed in the law\nAnd it was their belief in the law that ultimately saved me so we need to believe in it it's every one of us and um\nYou know I think I think that a lot of people uh you know who is allowed themselves to be weaponized oh oh ah\nOh an apology to everybody involved or everybody had to give testimony and I certainly think the leadership that the Congress as American apology\nAnd we shall see how this all unfold gatherings website so Larry SOL A.

I think it was maybe I don't know if it was the crawling hand or just the hand but they had this very convincing hand to crawl this embodied hand crawling by itself\nAnd I think that having heroic women in these movies that you don't Star Wars you know and now the doctor who was a woman I think that you know if a if it's a these are women are still spending their money on media physical media on movies\nAnd they're they're controlling that dollar and I think we're going to see a lot of ... films with strong female will\nThrow throw out some percentages I'm going to give you some age brackets here among those who are Fifteen Years old to Twenty one percent of them do you think\nGo to movies\n[noise] probably none [laughter] none really [laughter] Fifteen to twenty\nFifteen to Twenty years old now I I thought I Would I Would say forty percent about ... twenty to thirty\nTwenty to thirty I Would say uh I Would maybe I maybe I knew that a little higher maybe maybe fifty percent thirty to forty percent usually [noise] thirty to forty I Would say I would say larger I Would I Would guess maybe sixty five\nReally okay now I think it starts coming down forty to fifty years old\nForty to fifty years old I thank you yeah I think it would really come down I Would think that maybe maybe twenty percent fifty to sixty\nAnd I would have probably even less and I don't know maybe the fifth year old might be hanging in there but I think maybe the six year olds and and beyond are probably a much much more likely to um enjoy a film in their home and the trouble with going to a theater\nOne of the things we'll do just for fun next hour when we take calls for you is we'll ask the callers if they want to share their age it's up to them and\nBone on well and whether they go to movies or not I can't remember the last movie I went to\nI mean I I look at a lot at home on video I ... when you know they come out as a news new release or something I'll watch it but I I Can't remember the last time I was in and actually I\nDo enjoy I Do enjoy seeing a film in the theater with an audience but a lot of\nTime on that you ... and that's your ... your business\nSo I I I'm I'm biased because I'm watching the audience vote I\nThat's what you do so that's one of the things we'll do folks who'd take calls next hour in addition to your question your horror story of your favorite film if you want to give us she'd give time your age when you call in and uh let's ask you if you win the last time you went to a movie\nOr you know what's interesting too about movies how they have changed over the years I mean in the thirties and forties you had these grand musicals and\nThese incredible songs and people were dancing on them in the movies man Dorsey those days are gone\nMaybe they'll come in never know maybe they'll come back you know maybe George you know maybe you should dust off your tap shoes [laughter] you and I could make up all singing all dancing supernatural for\nA dime a single George never was a tap dancer [laughter] to me I just saw a clip on YouTube a Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly dancing\nOr to take me out to the ball game they sang it has to do what and they were magnificent together I didn't know Sinatra could dance like that no no I always surprising how\nI always see in ... years in the cartoons that rail thin swaying next to a microphone I don't really think of him dance you\nKnow it's truly remarkable now are they still coming up with good horror films these days\nI kind of do you know you had mentioned the conjuring a movies\nI was five years ago it was good that was two thousand Thirteen was in it I\nGuess that's true but they're still making them yeah you're on the I don't know third or fourth conjuring spin off by now I think\nYou know what I think ... the ... movie\nYeah yeah they're rebooting that they've got a brand new no way and they're they're they've got their starting over with a fresh Dolly O. would look pretty beat up\nAnd they'll sell the ... as a dog won't they\nThey'll sell that to all of the ... the only thing that I feel like it is it still does it look like a toy elite look to bike or ... you know they should have looked at all like um you know they sort of look at like cabbage patch it and stuff from the eighties and and try and make them look\nMore at this ... this new one I'm Talking about ... tried to make them look more like a like that you made of plastic I think to eat over the ... to\nOther than Amazon dot com now the toys R Us is closed for the people buy toys for their kids\nYou know I think conventions I think people I think uh you know fans by toys that conventions and online and and it's too bad that there are you know a really great I I ...

California who simply says\nI'm older than George [laughter] I Can't for taking my thanks to um do you go to movies anymore\nI'm older than a cloth so I made it a and you know it oh last time I was in a movie theater was Thirty years ago and\nThat's when you saw John Wilkes booth to jump from the theater\nYeah there you go I exactly I and I'm a lady that I was dating when they want to see a movie on the spur of the moment at at a multiplex but it was so\nAnd out and so um we asked what other movies were available and um we went to see\nJohn carpenter's they laugh while we sat through that movie twice that night and um the lady I was dating was scared out of her mind month [laughter] I was just I mean my jaw drop\nDid she at least holds your hand in Griffith\nYeah yeah absolutely she\nJust was I called that intelligent horror and this is the question I wanted to bring to Mr logo\nYes they're drawing earners they live excellent so by the way big big fan of that movie in Nineteen eighty eight and there's the or the special Hofmann lenses that allow you to see the strings that are being pulled behind a what we think is real life\nOh yeah and the acting Keith ... and John rotting pop per ... per was a\nI mean they just throw in the sun glasses I Want to make you eat that garbage can\nYeah yeah yeah you know what I really wanted to ask you about Mr ... was um there's another director of intelligent horror and that's ... director David ... burg\nAnd Tom scanners I'm One of my favorites was video Jerome with James Woods he's done other movies naked launch existence a high [noise] and it's our video Jerome it's a good example of a movie that's\nYou know virtual reality gone hey wire type of thing and the whole loosened a gigantic but I'm Conan Bert creeps up on me you know as you watch a movie by him and I was wondering if you want to comment on me and it just seems like all ...\nAll of his you know I've heard the term body or a associated with his film and a lot of them all kind of have to do there's a physicality to everything where\nWhere it's getting inside of a certain part of sorts in our body and I think that they're they're they're I think that's the ultimate intrusion you know I think that's the ultimate ah a violation you know and I think that he really uses that even in the fly I mean we just falling apart in the fly\nOr the Jeff Goldblum fly from the ADA I'm also from eighty or like a like they live but um you know I mean it's it's a really um you know he and he and his attention to detail is amazing\nAlways great makeup of sex and uh you know David ... is one of a I I Would agree with you one of the most intelligent directors where uh you almost have John right to themself his his movies are kind of all go together and and they have the same theme coming back again and again\nLet's go to Frank and Hollywood Marilyn welcome to the program have Frank how are you\nHow to enjoy that to be back with you know you're you're out your ... your won by people who make this a coast to coast the exercise next door which it is I'm\nSorry oh west you why would you say such wise but thank you\nI'm Seventy years old and I would ask your question a lot of it which you're limited to was the one of the scariest movie that I still look I look at it from my fingers\nYeah hours scared he is what I call laughing at it they were used to always up some help it then I'll pick a benefactor used to give us the movie I'm Bad at the same time it came out if you ate it\nYeah wow that's nice that's when I get a question about uh Vincent Price Israel are we in between I was on the hill and didn't do all the tell tale heart\nChurch job place that really out six months or so why did he do in between those two films what did he do in between um the uh uh when did you come out and get idea about it\nUh well let me think here will how house on ... hill\nNineteen fifty nine\nFifty nine he probably did the Tingler probably right after right or right around the roads you George you have the same color on the [laughter] that'd be good sign other William Castle and I think that was maybe right out here I Am\nI wrong about that thing where I don't know ... and I would put the tanker\nIn there and then he did a lot of these uh ... films with Roger Corman or with the the Edgar Allan Poe films um and you know he did a mascot or read that and uh he's a ... a lot of ground post ... films for Roger Corman\nTaylor was on the St Louis in fifty nine also Mr mobile\nOkay okay so ... so I guess those are some things that may have happened before but the team was a great one um you know it it it is another one where the where the movie house gimmick like house on a hill house on ... he'll have the skeleton when across a the audience\nThe um the Tingler have the buzzer is in the seat that was supposed to represent the ... the creature getting loose and and you had the screen so it wouldn't to grab onto your spine and get you\nSo there's NO PLAN going in\nA ... which I think allows for him to the ... you know again ... there was no formula so I think that I think that that's why his books are so surprising but I think at the same time you know a good director can kind of oil back down\nTo it asked him you know he hated the film the shining and the film is shining I think stands as one of the best pieces of art you know the twentieth century so I you know I don't know\nWhat about TV shows that are dealing with ... like the walking dead and things like that\nOr you know it's interesting because you know I mean the walking dead I definitely I feel like oh there every night of the living yes and you know now it's kind of come down to\nThe mainstream I'm Down to the front line you know you go into the wall Mart and you see that [laughter] you know or the rubber ears that you're hanging around your neck or the you know the whatever getting by the signs\nAnd you know it it's all um it's a very commercial\nUm you know I think that uh you know like a soap opera um and I think it's kind of cowboys and Indians too I think that um you know modern zombie movies you know I Know ... years the enemy that you can shoot and not feel so out of out and we don't\n... you know we're we're in the world of you know we're very politically correct world there there are there aren't many\nA screen villains

[noise] well it\nStarted when I was a rebellious kid in Detroit and feeling like I wanted to change the world but had no way to do that and uh I had a couple of experiences started with\nUh being somewhere I shouldn't have been with somebody I shouldn't have been with a closing time at the bar on the back of a motorcycle and we got hit by a drunk driver all through my body off the\nMotorcycle and um I had a real physical tangible out of body experience and watched my body tumbling through the air landing on the concrete and I think there was something in that moment that suggests that any way that consciousness is more than just our physical ...\nAnd then I went home to heal and they had talked about possibly amputated my leg and\nI laid there and I used my imagination to visualize my immune system healing me and I was you know really aware of the tangles up my leg\nYou know now I have to start the legs and I think that consciousness is something powerful\nAnd we're going to talk about you your first experience new dumped experience you were just a year and a half year old weren't you\nKnow that's true I was wandering around my family's house in my ... and being a good in pure assist which means you investigate everything\nWould you have those little feet pajamas\nI think so I don't really remember them on on it but\nI've heard tales and ah anyway my father had inadvertently left a can of lighter fluid sitting on a kitchen table and you know I did what good Eighteen month old kids do and I put it in my mouth and I ended up in and out of intense\nDrink juice\nI drank it and it causes massive pneumonia and almost didn't make it so I think that there were some seeds planted then too that got me on this path of wanting to understand\nConsciousness somebody once you were wrong I guess that's a nice way to think about\nYou do know I was born in Detroit and raised there and left there when I was twenty eight years old\nI think I knew that but I didn't remember until now so tell me where was\nThat I was born in the city and then we ended up moving to Dearborn Heights\nA war we spent most of my childhood and then uh my first places I was until you were Michigan Farmington Hills\nAnd then worked in all three television stations in Detroit to four and seven and then in Nineteen Seventy nine I moved to Nineteen Seventy eight I moved to Minneapolis Nineteen Seventy nine I moved to St Louis knowing back and forth between St Louis in Los Angeles how about you know\nWell I was right in Detroit right near city airport and ah it was about the time I figured out I could leave that I left and you know I still have a lot of nostalgia for Detroit and a lot of admiration for the people that are trying to make a difference there\nFamily still there I have some family um they moved out to Harrison township where I had my motive motorcycle accident\nUh-huh you're born ... really yeah well you\nTold me where cars you must remember the the the street\nOh I don't I don't know who\nWas ... was it a busy street\nYeah it was a busy street but it was late and I think the trauma kind of over\nAre we going to I'm gonna I'm gonna close my eyes in yes you'll remote feeling now that you were on telegraph road\nMm that sounds that sounds about right\nNear Michigan viewing skill near Michigan avenue\nYeah that sounds about right\nI Can't remember exactly to say for sure but I'm sure there's records of its\nRoots in your backyard my gosh\nYeah well thank you my friend I preach\nShe'll do this all ... really steer you in the direction where you are no I mean you've got a PHD and social anthropology you've just been elected vice president of the tourist psychological shows you usually get into that but is this would lead the foundation for you\nWell I think I really started when I got to Wayne State University in downtown Detroit which you'll remember\nI Do and the one time or to the Detroit\nUh-huh good one oh really so that is right downtown you know um [noise] well I discovered to books when I got into college in the first one was Thomas Kuhn book\nCalled the structure of scientific revolutions and that book said that we live in a paradigm or a world view a kind of social construction of reality and that that world view has changed periodically through history and that was a big empowerment\nFor me because I felt like well maybe what we're experiencing in Detroit this you know kind of civil war that was going on the race war and class war and gender war and ultimately a worldview conflict I think that um maybe it wasn't permanent and maybe wasn't defined\nBy ultimate reality so that was liberating and then that led me to the second book which was psychic exploration by Edgar Mitchell the Apollo fourteen out and then I read and I didn't apply for the job at no attic sciences but it was about\n... Fifteen Years later that they invited me to come and be there director of research and worked my way up the ladder from their\nNon Europe ... university no\nThat's right we're looking at ... personal experiences and from a psychological and\nNow what is the trench personal psychology what is the\nStuff you're interested in George it's all that kind of notion that there are aspects of our experience that transcend the physical\nThat people can have these kind of altered states or near death or out of body type of experiences and it doesn't mean it's pathological it means that may be a catalyst for some big breakthrough to understanding more about who we are and what the nature of reality might be\nMore with Dr Merrill Lynch ... just like\nThe beer right it is any\nRelief family\nWell it's you know it comes from an old brewery village in Germany ... but uh actually ... brewery what she'll remember I remember the Troy lists\nAnd so the beer that made Milwaukee famous actually is now a Detroit beer at least last time I checked\nThey do they do they still college which we're you know I don't know I haven't really uh gobbled up it's been a yes or no Hampshire\nRight although micro breweries have taken over\nWhat would it be you know what have you learned about\nNear death experiences above the other side what to do what can you conclude at this point\nWell I Know that culture takes a big role in defining what we experience so if we're told our entire life through our educational system and our families are work environment\nThat the only real valid reality is the physical you know that which we can measure and manipulate and touch and pays a thin that's usually what we see\nAnd if we are brought up in a world the or a culture that except extended realms of possibility then we're more likely to perceive those realms of possibility and some of it may be a cultural construction but I also believe\nVery definitely that there are\nMore aspects of our human experience than just our physical embody met\nAnd if people can tap into this and use it in their living life I think they can do some remarkable things with that don't you\nI really do I think that if we\nTo own the power of our intention you know the fact that the intention is very important principle so from the morning when we get out of bed and we intend to ... you know make up a path or a plan going forward that's an expression\nOf intention uh and then what about those big intentions where we want to achieve something you know beyond our normal capacity\nThat becomes a tremendous empowerment and so to the extent we can begin to cultivate these abilities I think the more we'll be able to accomplish those dreams that many of us have\nHave you come across Germany during the ...\n[laughter] every day more and more [laughter] I think there's just so many mysteries and again you think about what these different cultures expect from the world and\nYou know being in the Amazon for example I spent some time with the ... in Ecuador\nAnd his colleagues came down so hard on him that he retracted any kind of open mindedness and went back to his kind of entrenched position of skepticism\nWell what's important to as a skeptic is not a non believer a skeptic wants proof\n[noise] right I mean it comes from the ancient Greek where it went the dogma tests where the people who really understood anew and the skeptics were the ones who are questioning whether like they deny the existence of these things but they wanted to raise questions and I think that's different than uh the bunker\nI think so too and it's a ... I also think it's healthy to be skeptical until you get the proof\nI Do too I think open minded skepticism is the healthiest perspective we can have we're in agreement on that it must be our Detroit impulse\nYou got it Marilyn stay with us we're going to take a quick break we're going to come back and talk more about your work\nIn our final our next hour we'll take phone calls about this but I also want you when we come back to talk about the\nStory of reincarnation about a little child that was born with reports march and we'll talk about that it's an amazing story so many more Dr Marilyn ... with us website is her name and we've got it linked up for U.S Coast to coast am dot com that makes it\nReally easy [noise]\n... ... email newsletters out six days a week and it was a great way to keep up on all things coast\nWe detailed program recaps the French leading today in St Louis upcoming info and weekly free audio clips it must have caused them for the re sign up on the coast to coast am dot com oh great [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\nDrug abuse is on the rise with their use\nAnd the consequences can be deadly\nLearn how to keep your kids\nIt rains ... seven\nThree is seven three\nOr drug snow dot com dawn talk\nYou're shot down dollars now\nIf you look\nFor your money during this man [noise]\n\n\n[noise] [laughter]\n\n\n[noise]\n\nYou are listening to coast to coast which you can join the hundred and Seventy five people to do and we hit Seventy nine\nThousand the paranormal day dot com my goal of course is eighty thousand people\nThat we've got a couple a get married or something for you to meet people who understand you ever go to dinner with somebody and start talking about ghosts they might get up and leave so you want to talk to someone who understands you go to ... dot com it's free to sign up paranormal date\nDodge car\nScience is doing some incredible things these days to make people look even younger\nAging could make a wish for younger day but since we can't go back in time we turned to products to give us a more youthful look now there is instantly ageless with immediate results on bags into your eyes spores roast beef fine line and wrinkle know needle no pay just a simple cream applied lately it's\nGreat for men and women and can easily be applied before makeup doctors agree instantly ageless works like this clip from the doctors\nBut I Want you want to imagine a cream that can certainly remove your under I bags were going to put it to the test with our good friend Dr ... by ...\nProducts we're going to see if it works it's called instantly H last and the idea that it was very quickly and he just said a very small\nIn now and then you pay for you might feel a little bit I had just looked at what's in the product ... and one of them is something called ... which is kind of a darling and tell her tell her the right now at the top tighter than it actually relaxing also called talk of Flint relax from work like\nThat and I can literally paying at the I think reading is still a cat which almost like a clay minerals and they're making the skin tight area actually increasing tension on the skin to push that tiny and it had\nInstantly ageless today go to our exclusive website H.
