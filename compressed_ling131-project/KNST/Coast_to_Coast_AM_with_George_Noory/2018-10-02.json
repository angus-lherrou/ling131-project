Seventeen of Seventeen Ninety two and so\nNot yet but in the o five years\nOr Iran and spends about seven years in a sign that planet which is a planet of\nSort of happy go lucky enthusiastic energy it's certainly good for anyone whose uh son ... in general the next year or so or by the way when you estimate the retrograde\nVenus goes retrograde this Friday I just mentioned that you know which could be the day of the vote up or down and Venus is and ... and it's a ... I wanted to tell people it's affecting anyone who's born around November second or third\nOf any year so those people are going to get an extra dose of Venus over the next several weeks which is focus on love relationship creative artistry social activities money money management and things like that\nMark why does it feel like this year has gone by so darn sure\nIt does feel that way um well you know part of it\nMight be well one of the things\nThat is happening this is definitely you know how the media is always there ... there may is because of what's happening with with the president with the tweeting and all the information\nAnd so from the political realm it when people like yourself or myself people who are you know tuning into news reports a need to do it for work\nOne of the things that's so weird there's so many events are happening much more so that they are being reported like Lincoln split hour after hour and I think that you know people are tired of it and they're exhausted and then we've had like this whole thing about social networking\nWe're you know millions of people like their their passwords here and there and so it's kind of like a revolution every single day somewhere and I think that that's making time go a little faster or maybe we want to make make it go faster to get away from some of the ... the weird problem\nCan you chart out astrological you know you were with me back in July and you're always popping in on New Year's day with us right can you check out you know charge to rush to the year for someone in the beginning of the year\n[noise] yeah well it's an interesting thing New Years in particular is very powerful I mean you could even do today's October one and you could in general I mean these things are not usually done you could take a look at the whole month of November by looking at midnight\nIn in the nation's capital here or wherever the capital is of a particular country and do a truck for that moment now the big one is New Year's at midnight all around the world because\nAll be on the air with everybody\nYeah and what's interesting is at midnight everywhere around the world\nLever is always rising and the son is in Capricorn at the bottom of the charge because it's midnight and so there you have to feed and all the other plants like for instance midnight\nNew Year's coming up on two thousand Nineteen the sun and Saturn are coming into a conjunction and Mars is going to enter its home sign of areas which doesn't actually look all that wonderful for the planet\nBecause Mars the traditional planet of war will go into its own sign actually laid on December thirty one and then the son of Saturn are together now there can be positive things like maybe for sports with with Mars and um exercise and engineering and different kinds of projects\nMore martial but some would Saturn at the beginning of the year is often you know too many frustrations law to block coming in but I guess it's going to be a testing year two thousand Nineteen for the world\nWhy does it work mark why does astrology war\nOkay because here's what's happening it isn't that the planets were throwing down raise this was what the old idea exactly what and why scientists would say you believe in that foolishness pseudo science mumbo jumbo\nIt inside of us okay so in other words ... everything depends on\nSomething being born at a moment of time like with the person baby it's when you take your first breath it's not coming out of the womb if the inability of course still tight it's when that's why you know we've got to make the baby cry to make sure we know that it's free then taking in the first spread like the declaration of independence is usually use for the\nAmerica's Choice because it was our first breath we're we're saying he gets wedding when we're independent of you were being born\nOkay this is our beginning now not every astrologer works with that choice but most of them do\nSo the reason it works is that wherever the sun is the moon and the various planet it's not that they're making things happen from outer space it's that whatever is born a person a president take an oath of office you buy a new car you get a new job you do if you have the time\nUh that that happens you put everything into the horoscope and then you can attempt to interpret what does that saying about the potential of my work at this job being the president of the United states or baby being born\nOr with mark Lerner the astrologers website the new one great barrier enterprises dot com we've got linked up for U.S Coast to coast stadium dotcom when we come back in ... we will take your phone calls and he'll do some personal astrological readings for you what do you need from people mark when they call you\nWill fundamentally month day in your birth if they know the time we can try and put that in and or wherever they were born\nDoes the time make it more accurate you are you\nWell look\nI could if somebody said to me I Know when I'm bored ... you know what I don't have the time I Know the town or city\nActually month and year I could do anything for that person not as exactly ... do\nIt because timing allows us all kinds of things is a sunrise birds is is it near noon is a ton said is it a midnight\nWe're or the planets falling at that point 'cause I'm twenty four hours most of the pilots are gonna be in the ... they're going to be in the same lines but the moon can change a lot and twenty four hours it can go half of the time\nAnd so the moon has a lot to do with our instincts or mood even reincarnation and looking back who we may have been ordered the qualities were bringing in this lifetime moon has what to do it personality\nThe sun is more of a character and kind of a life force and a connection a little bit more just spirituality but so polarizing find which was signed rising the ease\nThat is the window to the world kind of on the highest level of or spirituality\nIn and tell me this march since you've been doing this we have thirty seconds before the break your what has been the most satisfying thing you don't\nEver you know in this field well

asked me about psychic was as if I could hear his voice\nIn my head because we were born at the time with with a plan of Merck rate which is very powerful and often underrated was in the same spot but anyways\nI took it for a whole year and then I started doing some consultation work in New York City and but the point is people need quite a number of years to get really good and they've really got to study much more than\nJust an astrology charts they ... they have to learn what's called transits of progression with a plan to keep moving on different levels and be able to do that for their clients\nSince since you've been doing this and what was it that got you interested in it and then something happened\nUm I started going medical uh to Columbia University my dad had been doctor he got sick at one point I didn't know what it was going to do I could have studied medicine in college at Michigan State I didn't do it I was into ah all kinds of things like social science and he got ill and I thought well maybe I'll take chemistry\nPhysics I'll take all the prerequisites I went to Columbia University [noise]\nUh this is part of the psychic weird thing that you asked me about so it's the first date or the first day of chemistry class I'm living in the borough of queens where Donald Trump was born I go home\nAnd just before getting home ice stopping a bookstore and I find my first astrology book which I mentioned to before astrology the space age science and it's all about people like\nIsaac Newton Galileo ... all of these great physicist and all these people had studied a more of astronomy telescopes ballet or and so on they were all\n... but when the biographers would write about the is fantastic people they'd say oh by the way they had one fault they were all went to the phony thing of astrology because the the biographers just thought it was foolish and wasteful and they couldn't understand why why was the greatest scientists before noon sir Isaac Newton studying astrology\nYou know how could that possibly be what what's wrong with the guy\n... what they didn't realize is who was a science was taught in the universe is if Europe a thousand years ago and it goes way back to all these great ... nations Persia Egypt Rome greet you know all over the world the ancient world and it was even taught in the universe is if you're up\nI'm going to make your work this hour mark so let's go to the calls we will pick it up by going to Bob in New Jersey hears Bob's birth the December twenty nine Nineteen fifty seven well twenty nine Nineteen fifty seven okay born at one forty two in the afternoon\nIn Jersey City now do you when you you want to know the city they were born in or do you want to know exactly the place they were born\nWell that helps I mean just what you just said you know what I'm doing is just for people out there are not putting on my head I'm actually type it into a computer [noise] and believe it or not I'm able to sort of get that information pretty quick\nIn and you want them to ask you a question\nUm if they want I mean ah if they can say to you and say I'm interested in this era of my life and then I'll just see what I can\nTell them and we're going to Bob in New Jersey Hi, Bob\nJared show are you\nGood welcome to the program turn your radio down a little bit okay yeah I it thank you okay great you you're on with mark learner I've given mark your birth date you know your time go ahead mark\nOkay well if he's if he's not asking a particular question what I can say ah of course\nThis individual is born with a Capricorn son and an areas moon and tourists rising and he's born very close to a first quarter moon I'm a ... as I said earlier on the other side of the hour people don't often study there isn't enough because the moon has a lot to do with who we are instinctual a so with an areas moon\nComing from other lives and like instinctively\nThis individual had a lot of assertiveness and forceful illness and kind of an aggressive\nPersonality and that's important for him to sort of live his life on a on a deep level where he he has leadership qualities developed and other allies particularly in the last life and now with the sun and Capricorn is kind of to refine that not to be brash but the sort of do things more um\nGrounded more practically in order to sort of rise up to the heights and the planet Saturn which rules Capricorn is in the process of Criss crossing over this individual son so it's an extra kind of a this year and the and coming into the fall of\nDiscipline responsibility being focused and he should be make sure\nHe's strengthens his immune system and stays healthy that um he doesn't\nBecome pessimistic about things um but he's also heading for um if he wants to develop this an another career cycle of the next several years as long as he stays healthy and focused and a has a good attitude about things\nWhy do you have a question to\nUh yeah what what if I'm not healthy now [laughter] well if you're not held on now again you want to kind of like um well\nMy feeling is that people should study things like use your intuition if need be go to a used bookstore you're you're on the show tonight there's a reason why you got on another people didn't good on um go to our website see some of the you know read about\nMy life the books the philosophies and so on and get into something like that philosophy metaphysics astrology the power of numbers numerology is connected to astrology as well and find something that you can kind of\nA deep yourself in for a while and that can make you accept inwardly excited and then maybe your health we'll get better\nThanks Bob good luck to you and everything you do would you believe in reincarnation mark\nAbsolutely and I've studied that longer than this and that's part of the whole psychic thing\nWe're all psychic world intuitive and we all live many lives now people are different levels so to speak I guess uh how it would work out of why we would see like an Einstein or gundy are different people and mother Theresa [noise]\nYou know how many times people have been around and when you study spiritual things and there was a whole field of esoteric astrology there's a whole other kind of idea like in the Casey Casey predictions I Know you've got a lot of people I've talked about the\nNose ... trains and Edgar Casey\nThere's a whole sort of spiritual science about humanity being part of the solar system like we're not just on earth I mean we live in the solar system we live in the galaxy we just don't live there physically\nBut spiritually when we're asleep psychic lead people who ... who can meditate and sort of leave their bodies you know Asheville traveling that kind of thing looser dreaming where are we were somewhere else\nSo that's all part of things indefinitely that there are multiple lifetimes than I Do believe very strongly that we're all spirits and sold and or incarnations like in the chart we're looking at\nThe like I said the spiritual kind of genetic code of what our game plan to hire destiny is as a spirit or sold to accomplish something with the sun ... and the planets in the configuration that we have\n... ... reincarnation astrological you speaking yeah we're the born the let's let's say the reincarnated person and the person before that will were they born during the same time period\nOh no no no ... ... there's a whole question about that kind of thing\nYou know people might in the old days I mean a lot of people thought\nPeople would reincarnate slowly like maybe once every century or once every couple of centuries or whatever it is according to the spiritual material I ever had my life\nCertain souls or spirits who are doing work\nLike the work that you do okay light worker kind of work at this stage in twenty first century might come back more quickly now everything depends on getting a body from fellow man and a woman being able to come into the world ... time to take advantage of astrological vibration they're\nTo me absolutely in other words the sold the spirit comes in and choose\nThat his parents and family based on family karma Dharma that kind of thing and then you're actually choosing when to be born because there are spiritual forces angels teachers masters whoever you want to call it\nI Know you have a lot of people talk about that stuff hoard guiding and bringing in that entity and then you have your own guardian angel with you throughout your whole life I'm a firm\nBeliever and all of those things\nExcellent let's go on to Cleveland Donna's with us welcome to the program and that's my buddy Geraldo Rivera is in Cleveland now Hi Donna\nHi I was born in Cleveland, Ohio okay\nPhil Donahue

M. I thought it was him this was at the Emory I'm Carla can yeah\nOh sorry well that's an okay no hair bear with me Carla finally you got something wrong [laughter] to me yeah I didn't hear one and then ah that's okay but Capricorn you know this is\nI Know so many people born with Capricorn so um my mother was a January eleventh baby so uh [noise]\nAnyone born around ... eleven January twelve you know I said no a lot about that that vibration\nSo one of the things\nFor Capricorn again a Saturn is there okay I Do know anything much about astrology yourself missed wherever that yes okay so ... I've been seeing a lot to to everybody\nDo a lot of deep study you are definitely in in that camp because then you're going to have a once in a lifetime Pluto a movement\nTowards your son and the next like\nOr two and Saturn which rules Capricorn is heading is already in that sign and Saturn will then contact your son and then between two thousand Nineteen two thousand twenty Jupiter will be there so you're going to have three enormously important influences\nIn the Capricorn part of your chart which is your son sign your character your life for us kind of the link to hire spirits what the universe is saying is\nDo some big time study psychology philosophy authors or ... it doesn't have to be a study like that I mean it could be art it could be music anything up a hobby a craft an activity though that is deep in significant\nSo that you don't get down on yourself are worried or stressed out and so on then you do have a wonderful moon in Virgo in on the line called the trying which is flowing to your son so being an organizer this is what you you've done in the past\nEfficiency organization service to other people like possibly other lifetimes where you've been nurse or doctor were poor students\nOr you know a libraries or things like that learning languages from the past so there are some skill sets that you have that are very strong from otherwise but the big things next couple of years so it kind of deep seeded study\nAnd a trading into some kind of mysteries or involvements that like you stay really focused and that you learn a whole lot over the next couple of years\nOkay good luck to your Carlos next one may fourth Nineteen sixty nine may fourth Nineteen sixty nine were going out to California so who is with us welcome to the program for good\nYeah I think you are my question is about Korea money and should I moved to a different they are on the when I was born in a city court\nThey know where you are okay ... what's the city ... city OK in Kuwait a scholarship and he's a well I'm just\nPutting six AM here unless you give me another time I'll put around sunrise ... do you know your time birth or know annoyed okay no problem [noise] okay you said money is where what state to live in which they deliver you Jim Kelly right now okay well\nFirst of all there is\nAn even on my website it's called global hotspots ... where I Do part of mundane astrology but it's also individuals'\nWe've there's been a science for forty plus years in astrology it was originally called astro Qatar graffiti by a fellow named Jim Lewis who many years ago passed away and it's a it's a wonderful tool but you got to know your time of birth and then we can move around\nFrom like where you're born from Kuwait City to California or New York or somewhere in the planet's understand what's good and what isn't a California is and this is another big thing that people don't realize and astrology every state of the union as a chart like September nine Eighteen fifty California and to the union as a son signed Virgo state\nWith a with a Scorpio moon\nSo you as a tourist son signed tourists that's an earth fine and you match pretty well with with California\nOkay so that is a match where you're fine and California's earth fine or good okay you also have a good money aspect in your chart I'm not sure what you should use it for but you if mercury with Vesta\nWhich is one of the four main asteroids vet says what to do with investment\nSo it's not surprising that you would ask that question about what to you know something with money investment so there is something that you're supposed to do with all that\nAnd you just have to figure that out the other thing is you have a a moon trying to Venus which is another potential money making energy but the big but here is Venus which goes stationery in retrograde on friday\nIn Scorpio is making kind of an unusual Lima to NATO Venus therefore don't act precipitously\nOkay in in the near future um and because you're ... and it's home signed a Gemini you want to avoid those mercury retrograde times they can be good for review and reflection but you want to learn more about mercury a threat to upgrade the power of Venus which is your son find ruler and that will really help you\nMark if there's a planet X out there in the solar system somewhere will that affect things\nYeah in fact uh see I have a whole thing about here is which has a five hundred sixty six year cycle which is on said no when President Trump took office that's an article on earth Aquarius news\nIt was very strong at his inauguration and has a whole lot to do with what's been happening over the last year and a half\nAnd therefore outer planets even beyond Pluto have are now being used a whole lot just as there are a lot of asteroids and little plants like higher on the truck it's overpopulated that's part of the the complication but you want to use them judiciously are not overwhelmed the chart with a whole lot of them but sometimes they were very significant\nTroop and mark keep in touch with us we'll probably talk with you on a New Year's eve or New Year's day to get predictions for two thousand

events that affect all of us Marc let's talk with one start with what happened today the stock market jumped up big time how does it look you\nWell we're hitting October and October has had a rash month\nYeah of course like the night the October twenty fourth and twenty ninth of Nineteen twenty nine the big ones um and then October Nineteen Nineteen eighty seven the one day crash I'm not anticipating anything like that at least I'm\nNot at the moment I'm the one thing that is interesting though um is that\nThe the people call this planet\nOr in this era of your ear and his depending on their pronunciation but that plan at the first of the auto plant of um which is so powerful when America was born because when a Seventeen eighty one when the American revolution was one of the same year that Iran is was cited by sir William Herschel and ironically and bath England\nUm but at the rate that planet has just gone into Taurus okay and tourists as the main sign of money and the New York stock exchange which is a chart that is used by a lot of astrologers goes back to ... Seventeen of Seventeen Ninety two and so\nNot yet but in oh five years\nOr Iran spends about seven years and a sign that planet which is a planet of extreme change revolution the unconventional sort of things coming out of left field shock some surprises Iran us will\nA goal oriented creative sign although some of its characteristics about religion and philosophy over the centuries are not all that great but Jupiter will go into its home sign for the first time in twelve years it's the morning of November the eighth and that's going to last for almost Thirteen months that is a sort of happy go lucky\nEnthusiastic energy it's certainly good for anyone whose uh son ... in general the next year or so uh by the way when you estimate the retrograde\nVenus goes retrograde this Friday I just mentioned that you know which could be the day of the vote up or down and Venus is and ... and it's a ... I wanted to tell people it's affecting anyone who's born around November second or third\nOf any year so those people are going to get an extra dose of Venus over the next several weeks which is\nFocus on love relationship creative artistry social activities money money management and things like that\nMark why does it feel like this year has gone by so darn sure that\nIt does feel that way um well you know part of it might be as well as one of the things\nThat is happening this is definitely you know how the media is always there ... there may is because of what's happening with with the president with the tweeting and all the information\nAnd so from the political realm it when people like yourself or myself people who are tuning into news reports a need to do it for work\nOne of the things that's so weird there's so many events are happening much more so that they are being reported like Lincoln split hour after hour and I think that you know people are tired of it and they're exhausted and then we've had like this whole thing about social networking\nWe're you know millions of people like their their passwords here and there and so it's kind of like a revolution every single day somewhere\nAnd I think that that's making time go a little faster or maybe we want to make make it go faster to get away from some of the ... the weird problem\nAnd you chart out asking logically I Know you were with me back in July and you're always popping out on New Year's day with us right can you check out you know charge the rush to the year for someone in the beginning of the year\n[noise] [noise] yeah well it's an interesting thing New Years in particular is very powerful I mean you could even do\nToday it's October one and you could in general I mean these things are not usually done you can take a look at the whole month of November by looking at the same midnight\nIn in the nation's capital here or wherever the capital is of a particular country and do a truck for that moment now the big one is New Year's at midnight all around the world because\nAll be on the air with everybody\nYeah and what's interesting is at midnight everywhere around the world lever is always rising and the son is in Capricorn\nAt the bottom of the chart because it's midnight and so there you have to feed in ...\nThe other planets like for instance midnight New Year's coming up on two thousand Nineteen the sun and Saturn are coming into a conjunction and Mars is going to enter it home sign of areas which doesn't actually look all that wonderful for the planet\nBecause Mars the traditional part of the war will go into its own fine actually late on December thirty one and then the son of Saturn are together now there can be positive things like maybe for sports with with Mars and um exercise and\nEngineering and different kinds of projects that are more martial but son with Saturn at the beginning of the year is often you know too many frustrations law to block coming in but I guess it's going to be a testing year two thousand Nineteen for the world\nWhy does it work mark why does astrology war\nOkay because here's what's happening it isn't that the planets were throwing down raise this was what the old idea\nExactly what and why scientists would say you believe in that foolishness pseudo science mumbo jumbo\nIt inside of us okay so in other words if everything depends on\nSomething being born at a moment of time like with the person baby it's when you take your first breath it's not coming out of the womb if the ability of course still tight it's when that's why you know we've got to make the baby cry to make sure we know that three of them\nTaking in the first spread like the declaration of independence is usually used for the America's Choice because it was a first breath we're we're saying he gets what England were independent of you were being born okay this is our beginning\nNow not every astrologer works with that choice but most of them do\nThe the reason it works is that wherever the sun is the moon the various planet it's not that they're making things happen from outer space it's that whatever is born a person a president take an oath of office you buy a new car you get a new job you do if you have the time\nUh that that happens you put everything into the horoscope and then you can attempt to interpret what does that saying about the potential of my work at this job being the president of the United states or baby being born\nOr with mark Lerner the astrologers website the new one great bear enterprises dot com we've got linked up for U.S Coast to coast am dot com when we come back in the moment we will take your phone calls and he'll do some personal astrological readings for you what do you need from people mark when they call you\nWill fundamentally month day in your birth if they know the time we can try and put that in and or wherever they were born\nDoes the time make it more accurate you are you\nWell\nLook I could if somebody said to me I Know and unborn ... you know what I don't have the time I Know the town or city actually month and year I could do anything for that person not as exactly ...\nDo it because timing allows us all kinds of things is the sunrise birth is is it near noon his son said is it a midnight we're or the planets falling at that point because in twenty four hours most of the planet are going to be in the ... they're going to be in the same science but the moon can change a lot and twenty four hours it can go\nHalf of the time and so the moon has a lot to do with our instincts or mood even reincarnation and looking back at who we may have been with the qualities were bringing in this lifetime moon has what to do with personality\nThe sun is more of a character and kind of the life force and a connection a little bit more just spirituality but the so polarizing signed which was sunrise in the East that is the window to the world kind of on the highest level of or spirituality\nIn uh in telling me this march since you've been doing this we have thirty seconds before the break your what has been the most satisfying thing you've done\nEver yeah in this field\nWell unfortunately I well there's two things I'm studying the chart for when President Kennedy died okay 'cause I learned so much about astrology and I was there well I wasn't there I was there to what had happened twenty\nTwo when I got into the other is on the nuclear at Atomic Energy area\nLet's talk more about that and take phone calls in

Alice Bailey teachings and so on 'em and I found\nMy mentor Dana ... who are who was one of the great\nAstrologers of twenty century and he had studied not just the strategy but philosophy and psychology and metaphysics and so on so I read all of his books and kind of memorized everything and the reason which if their students out there of the planet mercury which rules mind thinking communication\nAt the time of his birth and Pisces was exactly at the same spot where mine was and I knew what his chart was and\nWhen I started reading this book that you asked me about psychic was as if I could hear his voice\nIn my head because we were born at the time with with the planet mercury which is very powerful and often underrated was in the same spot but any rate\nI took it for a whole year and then I started doing some consultation work in New York City and but that was the point is people need quite a number of years to get really good and they've really got to study much more than\nJust an astrology charts they ... they have to learn what's called transits and progression with a plan to keep moving on different levels and be able to do that for their clients\nSince since you've been doing this and what was it that got you interested in it in a bench something happened\nUm I started going to medical uh to Columbia University my dad had been doctor he got sick at one point I didn't know what it was going to do I could have studied medicine in college at Michigan State\nI didn't do it I was into ah all kinds of things like social science and he got ill and I thought well maybe I'll take chemistry physics I'll take all the prerequisites I went to Columbia University [noise]\nUh this is part of a psychic weird thing that you asked me about so it's the first date first day of chemistry class I'm living in the borough of queens where Donald Trump was born I go home\nAnd just before getting home ice stopping a bookstore and I find my first astrology book which I mentioned TV for astrology the space age science and it's all about people like\nIsaac Newton Galileo ... all of these great physicist and all these people had studied a more of astronomy telescope scale layer and so on they were all\nAstrologers but when the biographers would write about the is fantastic people they'd say oh by the way they had one fault the world went to that phony thing of astrology because the the biographers just thought it was foolish and wasteful and they couldn't understand why why was the greatest scientist before noon sir Isaac Newton studying astrology\nYou know how could that possibly be what what's wrong with a guy\nWell what they didn't realize is who was the science was taught in the University of Europe a thousand years ago and it goes way back to all these great ... nations Persia Egypt Rome great you know all over the world the ancient world and it was even taught in the universe is if you're up\nI'm going to make your work this hour mark so let's go to the calls we will pick it up by going to Bob in New Jersey hears Bob's burned the December twenty nine Nineteen fifty seven twelve twenty nine Nineteen fifty seven okay

is born with a Capricorn son and an areas moon and sing and he's born\nVery close to a first quarter moon I'm a ... as I said earlier on the other side of the hour people don't often study their moon enough because the moon has a lot to do with who we are instinctively so with an areas moon\nComing from other lives in like instinctively\nThis individual had a lot of assertiveness and forceful illness and kind of an aggressive\nPersonality and that's important for him to sort of live his life on a on a deep level where he he has leadership qualities developed in other allies particularly in the last life and now with the sun and Capricorn it's kind of to refine that not to be brash but the sort of do things more um\nGrounded more practically in order to sort of rise of the heights and the planet Saturn which rules Capricorn is in the process of Criss crossing over this individual son so it's an extra kind of a this year and the and coming into the fall of\nDiscipline responsibility being focused and he should be make sure\nHe's strengthens his immune system and stays healthy that um he doesn't\nBecome pessimistic about things um but he's also heading for um if he wants to develop this an another career cycle of the next several years as long as he stays healthy and focused and a has a good attitude about things\nLike you have a question to\nUh yeah what what if I'm not healthy now [laughter] well if you're not held on now again you want to kind of like um well\nMy feeling is that people should study things like use your intuition if need be go to a used bookstore you're you're on the show tonight there's a reason why you got on and other people didn't good on um go to our website see some of the you know read about\nMy life the books the philosophies and so on and get into something like that philosophy metaphysics astrology the power of numbers numerology is connected to astrology as well and find something that you can kind of\nA steep yourself in for a while and that can make you accept inwardly excited and then maybe your health we'll get better\nThanks Bob good luck to you and everything you do would you believe in reincarnation mark\nAbsolutely and I've studied that longer than this and that's part of the whole psychic thing\nWe're all psychic world intuitive and we all live many lives now people are different levels so to speak I guess uh how it would work out of why we would see like an Einstein or gundy are different people and mother Theresa [noise]\nYou know how many times people have been around and when you study spiritual things and there was a whole field of esoteric astrology there was a whole other kind of idea like in the Casey Casey predictions I Know you've got a lot of people on we'll talk about the\n... trains and Edgar Casey there's a whole sort of spiritual science about humanity being part of the solar system like we're not just on earth I mean we live in the solar system we live in the galaxy we just don't live there physically\nBut spiritually when we're asleep psychic lead people who who can meditate and sort of leave their bodies you know Asheville traveling that kind of thing looser dreaming where are we were somewhere else\nSo that's all part of things indefinitely that there are multiple lifetimes than I Do believe very strongly that we're all spirits and souls and our incarnations like in the chart we're looking at\nThe like I said the spiritual kind of genetic code of what our game plan of higher destiny is as a spirit or sold to accomplish something with the sun moon and the planets and the configuration that we have\n... reincarnation astrological you speaking you were the born the let's let's say the reincarnated person and the person before that\nWell were they born during the same time period\nThere's a whole question about that kind of thing you know people might in the old days I mean a lot of people thought\nPeople would reincarnate slowly like maybe once every century or once every couple of centuries or whatever it is according to the spiritual material I ever had my life [noise]\nCertain souls or spirits who are doing work like the work that you do okay light work are kind of work at this\nStage and twenty first century might come back more quickly now everything depends on getting a body from fellow man and a woman that really being able to come into the world ... time to take advantage of astrological vibrations they're to me absolutely in other words the\nSold the spirit comes in and chooses\nParents have family based on family karma Dharma that kind of a thing and then you're actually choosing when to be born because there are spiritual forces angels teachers masters whoever you want to call it\nI Know you have a lot of people talk about that stuff hoard guiding and bring in that entity and then you have your own guardian angel with you throughout your whole life I'm a firm believer and all of those things\nExcellent let's go out to

I've been saying a lot to to everybody do a lot of deep study you are definitely in that camp because then you're going to have a once in a lifetime Pluto\nA movement toward your son and the next like year or two and Saturn\nWhich rules Capricorn is heading is already in that signed them Saturn will then contact your son and then between two thousand nine hundred thousand twenty Jupiter will be there so you're going to have three enormously important influences\nIn the Capricorn part of your chart which is your son sign your character your life force kind of the link to hire spirits so what the universe is saying is\nDo some big time study psychology philosophy author\nThis was ... it doesn't have to be a study like that I mean it could be art it could be music anything or a hobby a craft an activity though that has deep and significant\nSo that you don't get down on yourself are worried or stressed out and so on that you do have a wonderful moon in Virgo and on the line called the trying which is flowing to your son to be an organizer this is what you you've done in the past\nEfficiency organization service to other people like possibly other lifetimes where you've been nurse or a doctor or or a student or you know a libraries or things like that learning\nLanguages from the past so there are some skill sets that you have that are very strong from other allies but the big things next couple of years so it kind of deep seated study\nPenetrating into some kind of mystery is or involvements that like you stay really focused and that you learn a whole lot over the next couple of years\nOkay good luck to your car load next one may fourth Nineteen sixty nine may fourth Nineteen sixty nine were going out to California so who is with us welcome to the program for food\nYeah Hi thank you a question about Korea money and should I moved to a different state um uh when I was born in ... city court\nNo where are you okay ... what's the city how do you spell it or wait city oh okay in a way of course in he's a well I'm just\nPutting six AM here unless you give me another time I'll put around sunrise ... you know your time birth or know annoyed oh okay no problem okay you said money and where what state to live in which they deliver you Jim Kelly right now okay well\nFirst of all there is an even in my Web site it's called global hotspots ... where I Do part of Monday and astrology but it's also individuals [noise]\nWe've there's been a science for forty plus years and astrology it was originally called astro Qatar graffiti by a fellow named Jim Lewis who many years ago passed away and it's a it's a wonderful tool but you got to know your time of birth and then we can move around\nFrom like where you were born from Kuwait City to California or New York or somewhere in the planet's understand what's good and what isn't a California is and this is another big thing that people don't realize and astrology\nEvery state of the union as a chart like September nine Eighteen fifty California and to the union as a son signed Virgo state with a with a Scorpio moon\nSo you as a tourist son find tourists that's an earth fine and you match pretty well with with California\nOkay so that is a match where your earth fine in California's earth fine or good okay you also have a good money aspect in your chart I'm not sure what you should use it for but you have mercury with Vesta\nWhich is one of the four main asteroids that says a lot to do with investment\nSo it's not surprising that you would ask that question about what to you know something with money investment so there is something that you're supposed to do with all that\nAnd you just have to figure that out the other thing is you have a moon trying to Venus which is another potential money making energy but the big but here is Venus which goes stationary in retrograde on friday\nIn Scorpio is making kind of an unusual Lyman to NATO Venus therefore don't act precipitously\nOkay in in the near future um and because of Mercury's in its home signed a Gemini you want to avoid those mercury retrograde times they can be good for review and reflection but you want to learn more about mercury its retrograde the power of Venus which is your son find ruler and that will really help you\nMark if there's a planet X out there in the solar system somewhere will that affect things\nYeah in fact uh the I have a whole thing about ear if which has a five hundred sixty six year cycle which is on said no when President Trump took office it's an article on earth Aquarius news it was very strong at his inauguration it has a whole lot to do with what's been happening over the last year and a half\nAnd therefore outer planets even beyond Pluto have are now being used a whole lot just as there are a lot of asteroids and little plants like higher on the chart gets over populated that's part of the the complication but you want to use them judiciously not overwhelmed the chart with a whole lot of them but sometimes they were very significant\n... mark keep in touch with us we'll probably talk with you on a New Year's eve and New Year's day to get
