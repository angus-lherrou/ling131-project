a about eleven thirty five pm he's driving north and his home town of West ranch\nWent to his great amazement he saw a huge fireball come straight down out of the northern sky descending vertically estimates are that was about the size of a full moon and the night sky pretty sizable\nAnd the interesting thing about this there's several things about it it had no tail and no ... no fragments from it\nAnd it had a bluish green glow coming from the bottom of it a very interesting report\nJust a few minutes ago I checked the American media society to see if they had recorded a meteor site in there and I cannot find one for the same time and date location so this must have been a very interesting site in as nice as my suspicion\nThree and a half hours later in Winston Salem North Carolina gentleman walked out on his balcony to have a smoke\nAnd he became aware of the fact that something was directly above his head he looked up and he estimates not more than fifty or a hundred feet above him there was a triangular craft\nWith orange and red lights on the trail a an edge of it and they flashing he could see later on in the site in a flashing bright red light\nOn the a dorsal surface of the object very interesting sighting after the first object Esau moved to the east towards Winston Salem reports\nHe realized that there was a second one above it headed a different direction added to the north instead of east\nAnd the second or two later you realize there was a third similar looking object in the night sky or make them in the morning and Scott this was six o five am on Tuesday of this week the twenty third of October\nVery interesting report and he's provided for a very nice illustrations that are posted to our website\nThe third report comes from

point that the past and the president and the future all exists in the infinite realm\nOur human senses only perceive a small slice of what exists in the infinite world so I don't view that I'm a good judge of what exists outside of what I can see with my eyes or ears you know the the basic human senses\nAnd so I generally try to start with that and I asked someone well how do you know you are seeing everything that is how do you know that\nWould question the question and often that stop someone\nBecause one can take a book with a pattern on it and move it in such a way in front of your

the end of January twenty sixteen I reported at ... dot com and Mike ... to ... AM radio broadcasts then that a mere Knight planet or planet X.\nY. indirectly discovered at the far edge of our solar system where the hyper belt in New York cloud meet the hyper belt is a shape residue of rock Dustin ice left over from our solar system of creation\nAnd then from the orbit of Neptune out far beyond Pluto too about\nThe astronomical unit from our son and the crowd of mostly ice and us go\nMuch further starting where the hype rebelled and and ... and for\nThree point to light years from earth and theoretical shape that surround our entire solar system including the hyper belt and I have a beautiful graphic of the at ... dot com report for people to see what our solar system really looks like now\nI say planet nine when indirectly found in twenty sixteen because\nIt eight no human on earth has yet seen this hypothesize massive object but Michael Brown\nPHD professor of planetary astronomy at caltech in Pasadena here now back in twenty sixteen that he was confident there was a huge object ten to twenty times the mass of earth moving in a big looping orbit all the way to the word cloud\nForgot they're brown simply called the planet nine because he's the driver they got quite a knock down to a dwarf planet after it had been the historic ninth planet of our solar system for decades it was\nTwenty three and protect their brown that year discovered it another dwarf planet he called error out in the type rebelled and it was more massive than Pluto\nSo it was professor brown who argued that put our shipping downgraded from the ninth planet in our solar system what dwarf planet in the hyper belt that surrounds our solar system and he even write a book and twenty ten that was called how I Killed Pluto and why it had it coming\nWhen I first interviewed professor brown about the massive but still unseen planet nine\nOh me back then quote it is like chasing I'd go whatever is out there it's math is so great that it's gravitational field pushes\nHalf a dozen other hyper belt object to collect their together on the opposite side of the planet nine huge looping orbit or at least where they think it orbits\nClose quote now that is why so far it is an indirect discovery it's now late twenty eight team after several tries at the hacking ... observatories in Hawaii to find planet nine and visible light and or infrared professor brown\nSays that it is quote till like chasing I'd go after more refined computer calculations he had three decades math of this unseen planet because he only\nSeven times more massive than the earth and just a couple of weeks ago I checked in with him for an update on his search for this ... the planet nine or planted act that he uh is\nStill trying to mine\nAnd he told me that he is planning another trip\nTo Hawaii November first just in a week and this time he thinks there is a chance that he'll\nFinally be able to actually get to the big bang theory math because they've been working on computer refinement and for example he told me in a recent interview that calculation place on the same body\nAbout five hundred times further than the distance from the earth to the sun so that is putting it in a spot that is something like twenty times further than Neptune\nA good way out there but they had a narrow down the focus so yeah there were only going\nOn November first started another surge because the new calculation predict that planet nine is close to a constellation\nThat can only be seen by American I in the winter here now from the California Institute of technology planetary science department in Pasadena, California\nIs astronomy professor Michael Brown\nOr predictions are that the planet is in the region of the sky close to the constellation Orion which is one that everybody knows the constellation of Orion is a winter constellation that's when it's up in the sky that's when you can observe it most so we have to wait until the constellations up until the winter\nBefore we can start looking to where we think it is\nAnd in November what date will you start to remember first\nThat's not very far away what frequencies will you be looking in\nThe best way to search for this is actually just a visible wavelengths just like your eyes because so far as the brightest part that we think it's going to have is just the sunlight reflected off of its upper atmosphere and so we're just going to look right at what you would see just taking pictures with ... what about him for rent\nInfrared is actually is not going to be a very good one for searching simply because\nWe don't have any telescopes with really massive infrared detectors that can look at big areas of the sky at once once we find planet nine looking at it in the in for a study of will be very important but it's not probably the best way to look for it\nIsn't it amazing that all of this impact on the solar system perturbations and even just in the plane of the solar system six degrees to the sun that he would be caused by an object out in the ... cloud that we can't even yet\nYeah I think it's pretty fun to think about it we just don't know where to look it it'll be easy to see\nOnce we know exactly where to look I suspect and then once we see it then we will study it in detail with probably you know every large telescope on the earth will suddenly swing in that direction so it would be quite exciting when it's finally found\nThis new planet nine is hypothesized to be five thousand times more massive than Pluto that you've got knocked down to a dwarf planet\nYeah so it's a good reminder of the difference between\nThings that are not real planets like Pluto and real planets sometimes people say oh this new planet nine it's just a little bit bigger than Pluto right like no no no it's five thousand times more massive this is what we mean when we say a planet in the outer part of the choices\nWhen we last talked I think you had two categories where my does have come from why is this massive object all the way out to the edge of the type rebel going into the or cloud\nAnd you talked about possibly being captured rogue planet or any ... inside of our solar system where Neptune and urine is our but then he got knocked out my Saturn or Jupiter what do you think today\nI still favor the explanation that it came from inside our solar system and got knocked out by Jupiter Saturn but into we find it and know exactly what its orbit isn't exactly what the composition of\nAll of this was just speculation you can probably come up with many different ideas to explain how I got there but once you find it I Hope will really start to learn why it's there and what it's made out of\nYou been living with just now for three years do you have any sort of intuitive sense of what you could look like\nMy best guess is that it will look sort of like that too we think it's a ... tune like planets just a little bit less massive than Neptune and so it'll be a gaseous atmosphere\nIt probably won't have clones it's probably too cold to have any clouds up in the atmosphere so in fact it might be quite bland\nA mostly just kind of grayish white atmosphere with no features of it but it's easy to speculate that we're almost always surprised when we find real objects and so the one thing that I Know for sure is that there will be things about it that we never even thought about that are completely pros and\nExactly how far from earth to where you think this object is\nWe think is about five hundred times further distance than the distance from the earth to the sun so that puts it at something like twenty times further than Neptune for example so it's a good ways out there\nAnd he is that a quarter of a light year\nOh no it's not even close to a quarter Liberia it's about two and a half light days\nTwo and a half light days from earth is that the border between the ... rebels and the or clout\nWell that's actually really good question to which we now don't know the answer before we realize that there's a planet out there we thought we knew about the border but now that there is a planet where that border we thought was now we're less sure because we don't know what is beyond that planet and we don't quite yet know how that planet is affecting what this border is\nYou never close we will have a fair and overall I

coast to coast George knowing what you were back with Linda molten how whose story next we'll deal with climate change window\nSo what was something like a one hundred events can become as often as every other year and so these really extreme floods extreme heat they become much more on them in the future and can have devastating consequences\nRight now what are computer models showing to those of you who worked on the DCCC report\nAbout what we can expect say in North America in just the next decade because we've already reached another half degree warmer and it's projected that we may go up to two\nIt could be substantially worse than even those the stuffed with\nBut the politics of the planet don't seem to be supporting dramatic reduction in the greenhouse gases in fact it seems that some of the larger nations the United states included\nMy adding coal now to an industry that we thought had ended\nThat we are going to be contributing ourselves to increasing amounts of greenhouse gases and accelerating the amount of warming so that we would be ourselves pushing the needle on the computer models in which there is even more rapid warming\nUnfortunately you put your finger on it my guess is that the politicians assumed that the problems will only become more severe once they're out of office\nAnd so if they are thinking of the next two to four to six years which is where most of the political offices\nThan they are assuming that they can cope with that short a period of time and it will be somebody else's problem address or two decades from now\nMeanwhile we're facing the fact that there will probably be be eat a lot of people who are going to be forced out of homes and houses and what is the United states in the world going to do with what has to be future migrations away from coastline\nCertainly there will be in fact already are places that are having to be abandoned votes on the east coast around the Alaska\nDue to rising sea levels and that will only continue to get worse we will have an increasing number of domestic migrants but it's really the developing countries where their farm or people susceptible where there are likely to be enormous numbers affected by the level Roger I'm forced to migrate as their\nCities become habitable and that's really one of the things that the report highlights where you get ... votes which migrants at one point five degrees\nBut you had many tens of additional climate refugees as you grow up to two degrees\nAnd that will be a problem for all the wealthy countries because naturally want to go somewhere where there are better prospects and so I think we could expect North America and Europe and parts of Asia to see lots of migrants coming from low latitudes\nAnd in fact I think we've already been seeing that in Europe that's part of the reasons for the Syrian civil war and ... all of the migrants that were coming up to Europe after that which led to a lot of the crises\nSo doesn't that mean that there could be a tremendous amount of civil strife and wars over at the migration of people away from post\nBut at least has been something that has been identified by loss of American officials in the defense department and in the Central Intelligence agency\nDuring the Obama administration's climate change was considered a major threat multiplier and driver of probable future conflicts\nAnd again there's kind of a head and the same mentality has taken root now in Washington which seems to pretend that this doesn't exist\nBut this was widely acknowledged in the defense community as we should have those for years ago\nSo global climate change and increasing more could definitely bring more wars\nYes there you go ... well it it's a terrible future if we can get this under control\nAnd one of the big headline the summer of twenty Eighteen million Florida home may see sea level rise flooding over the next rest of the century and in fact it is so bad that all the forty

we're not going to let anybody know that we have flooding in the streets of Miami is nonsense\nThey've got to take the bull by the horns and deal with it\nAnd as you look at the map uh knowing that the Arctic had melted two to three times faster than the computer projection well George when you look at the map of what is expected to happen to Florida\nOver the Next Fifty years and know that what happened with the Arctic was two to three times faster\nIf Florida had water flooding let's say three times faster than the current computer that projection that didn't mean that most of the southern

I Do not know\nThis is extremely a translucent\nAnd uh when I started reading the letters\nI began to see how heart felt\nThat there were people who were telling me they had never mentioned any of this parent to loved ones to children to parent none they but but I started receiving these emails and one\nCame from a a he had been a retired airline ticket agent and his name he gave me permission to use is Charles hazard\nAnd he uh let me say he said you can use my name and that I'm now from Sun City center Florida but what you're going to hear took place in Arkansas in two thousand and eight thinking about all of this\nIf provoked by two episodes of a strange smoky fog in my office when I was working in live stream and that's what provoked him and hear now is Charles hazard\nOr talking about what happened to him in two thousand and eight from his now Sun City center Florida home\nThis was in the spring of two thousand in age\nAnd I was preparing that morning for a group to come in the next day I was mowing the lawn string the camp area on a riding mower and cleaning up the facility and things of that nature\nSo at the end of the day after dinner I was ready to go to bed as soon as the sun went down a very tired\nSo after shower and I got into bed it was dark by that time I Can't remember about what time it was maybe eight thirty in the evening\nI got into bed with the poverty level my show and just lay there and looked outside the leaves on the trees were not fully out yet so I had a very good view of the night sky with a new stars that I can see\nAnd then suddenly I just I was getting ready to close my eyes and suddenly I opened them again\nAnd through the window I can see the misty grade I'm drifting in through the window and I was just mesmerized but the thing about it was it\nIn this dark bedroom was luminous and I could see the light within it and it was three dimensional was swirling in slowly kept coming towards me it looked like it was coming right for my head\nAnd I was just raising the fascination I didn't know what to think and then as it reached my forehead I could see in my mind by three dimensional lighted hiring lift passing by my field of vision\nI was mesmerized by these hiring lives and the feeling that\nI was getting was a feeling of euphoria and won this with this living thing that was surrounding made\nAnd then at the same moment everything was happening at the same time at the same time I was getting all this information that was almost like answers to questions that haven't been asked out millennia\nAnd they were all be answered at the same time like all of these answers were coming I wasn't asking the questions they were just coming to me and be answered simultaneously\nAnd I don't know why this was happening I was just going with it I don't even know how long this lasted it could have been just a moment but it seemed to go on forever and I didn't want it to end because of the feeling was so loving\nCan you describe the shape of the ... that you remember vividly and tried to give us an impression of what kind of information was coming to you and was it like a word voice in your head ... possibly\nKnow there were no words there was no sound the hiring glitz we're almost like God was looking straight ahead and they were coming towards me and then going past the side of my head\nAnd I could see peripherally these hiring glass but they had the same texture as the fog good would shadow in life\nBut they were living minutes at the same time and they would just float by me but kind of move\nAt the same time like they were walking back and forth as they were passing by my head\nAnd as far as the information I was getting it was just almost like a download information that was so quick that I was not able to grasp anything that was being given to me it was just a feeling that I was getting\nIt was almost like I knew every answer to every question like I was this super human genius or something that had all the answers to everything in the universe was indescribable it's really difficult to explain it felt like to me it wasn't for now\nAt that moment it was for something that was being given to me but I wouldn't remember any of it afterwards but it was for some time in the future that I was supposed to recall this information because it was like it would be given to me but I couldn't decipher it\nDo you have though any sub text in your mind or your soul about who would be doing this and why for the future\nNo the only thing I couldn't think of was that it may be cousin my past experience with ever since I was a child I'd had psychic dreams\nDreams of having relationships with an entity that was giving the instructions I can describe the entity to you as a very thin\nOr something that is going to now it's like what Charles hazard when he was saying I feel like it has to do with the rotation of the earth that they're going to be like a shift or a jolt and that it would cause your nominees and tremendous amounts of flooding\nAnd I have had now several emails I'm going to be doing stories on them\nAbout exactly this kind of thing and raising the question could there be a natural strange cycle\nInteracting with planets in our solar system that could relate and know what that is written about in genesis\nAnd that is how woven and a complex all seem to be going that every single question is leading to answer that people are raising more issues and scientists are also coming forward and saying that they have information about this\nAnd so

listening to you on coast to coast while writing this my father was very involved with World War two Pearl Harbor Hawaii survivors during his life\nHe passed away on December seventh two thousand and nine and was buried on December seventh before his burial I was sorting things out in his home office with his caregiver\nHe lived in this home for almost six years which I currently still owns that you do not live there while sorting out his items I was looking through the open door\nInto the laundry area hallway adjacent back door I saw a very fast thin moving horizontal Smokey grey fog go straight through the back door without it being opened up\nIt went through the door I did mention this to my wife son daughter in some close friends I Am an open minded conscious oriented person\nBut immediate feeling was my dad showed me his spirit was leaving the home for good I Would have never expected to see the gray color I would've normally thought it would have been associated with something negative\nBut he was a very positive person I have come to the conclusion that whatever part or level of his body consciousness soul left the house\nMay have been more like the gross more earthly matter in its purest form I had never heard the words smoky fog until you offered them one night and this is what it's been in my own office and I have wondered if it relates to a ...

back to ... ages four or five and six and you read these extraordinary emails coming from people who say in their opening sentences I have never told a single human being in my life\nAnd I am now provoked from listening to your asking the question on your YouTube channel have any of you at age four to six do you remember an out of body because that is significant\nWhere was the learning there

doing it because they expect the price to go\nDown the hall I guess not but consumer reach higher than a hundred dollars announced\nA few adjusted for inflation George Silver would have to be about a hundred and thirty dollars announce to reach its all time high so we think are one hundred dollars is well within reach\nOne could that happen over the next seven to ten years but we believe most of

AM radio broadcast then that a mere Knight planet or planet X.\nY. indirectly discovered at the far edge of our solar system where the hyper belt and the art cloud me\nLike hyper belt in shape residue of rock guy than ice left over from our solar system creation and then from the orbit of Neptune out far beyond Pluto\nToo about the astronomical unit from our son\nAnd the crowd of mostly ice into go\nMuch further starting where the hype rebelled in ethnic and\nThree point to light years from earth and Eric or shape that surround our entire solar system including the ... and I have a youthful graphic of ... at ... dot com report for people that are going to really look like now\nI say planet nine ... indirectly found in twenty six team because\nToday no human on earth has yet team to hypothesize massive object but Michael Brown\n... P H A professor of planetary astronomy at caltech in Pasadena and now back in twenty sixteen that he was confident that was a huge object and to twenty times the mass of earth moving in a big looping orbit all the way to the word cloud\nPreventive brown simply called the planet nine because he's the driver that got quite a knock down to a dwarf planet after it had been the historic ninth planet of our solar system for decades it with twenty out three\nAnd protect their brown that year discovered another dwarf planet he called ... out in the hype rebels and\nIt was more massive than Pluto\nSo it was professor brown who argued that put our shipping downgraded from the ninth planet in our solar system to adore planted in the hyper belt that surrounds our solar system and he even wrote a book in twenty ten that was called how I Killed Pluto and why it had it coming\nWhen I first interviewed professor brown about the massive but still unseen planet nine he told me back then quote it is like chasing I'd go whatever is out there it's math is so great that it's gravitational field pushes\nHalf a dozen other hyper belt object to cluster together on the opposite side of the planet nine huge looping orbit or at least where they think it orbits\nClose quote now that is why so far it is an indirect discovery it's now late twenty eight team after several tries at the ... and ... observatories in Hawaii to find planet nine invisible light and or infrared perhaps they're brown\nSays that it is quote\nTail like chasing I'd go after more refined computer calculations he has reduced the expected math of this unseen planet can be only seven\nTimes more massive than earth and just a couple of weeks ago I checked in with him for an update on his search for this ... save planet nine or planted act that he uh is\nStill trying to mine\nAnd he told me that he is planning another trip\nTo Hawaii November first just in a week and this time he thinks there is a chance that he'll\nFinally be able to actually get to this big mysterious math because they've been working on computer refinement and for example he told me in a recent interview that calculation place this unseen body\nAbout five hundred times further than the distance from the earth to the sun so that is putting it in a spot that is something like twenty times further than map June a good way out there but they had ... narrow down the focus so\nThat there were only going\nOn November first to start another surge because the new calculation predict that planet nine is close to a constellation\nThat can only be seen by American eyes in the winter here now from the California Institute of technology's planetary sciences department in Pasadena, California is astronomy professor Michael Brown\nOr predictions are that the planet is in the region of the sky close to the constellation Orion which is one that everybody knows the constellation of Orion is a winter constellation that's when it's up in the sky that's when you can observe it most to we have to wait until the constellations up until the winter\nBefore we can start looking to where we think it is\nAnd in November what date will you start to remember first\nThat's not very far away what frequencies will you be looking in\nThe best way to search for this is actually just a visible wavelengths just like your eyes because so far as the brightest part that we think it's going to have is just the sunlight reflected off of its upper atmosphere and so we're just going to look right at what you would see just taking pictures with ... what about him for rent\nInfrared is actually is not going to be a very good one for searching simply because\nWe don't have any telescopes with really massive infrared detectors that can look at big areas of the sky at once once we find planet nine looking at it in the in for a study of will be very important but it's not probably the best way to look for\nYou isn't it amazing that on this impact on the solar system perturbations and even just in the plane of the solar system six degrees to the sun that he would be caused by an object out in the ... cloud that we can't even yet\nI think it's pretty fun to think about it we just don't know where to look it\nBe easy to see once we know exactly where to look I suspect and then once we see it then we will study it in detail with probably you know every large telescope on the earth will suddenly swing in that direction so it would be quite exciting when it's finally found\nThis new planet nine is hypothesized to be five thousand times more massive than Pluto that you've got knocked down to a dwarf planet\nYeah so it's a good reminder of the difference between\nThings that are not real planets like Pluto and real planets sometimes people say oh this new planet nine it's just a little bit bigger than Pluto right like no no no it's five thousand times more massive [laughter] this is what we mean when we say a planet in the outer part of the solar system\nWhen we last talked I think you had two categories where might does have come from why is this massive object all the way out to the edge of the type rebel going into the or cloud\nAnd you talked about possibly being captured rogue planet or any ... inside of our solar system where Neptune and urine is our but then he got knocked out my Saturn or Jupiter what do you think today\nI still favor the explanation that it came from inside our solar system and got knocked out by Jupiter Saturn but into we find it and know exactly what its orbit isn't exactly what its composition has\nAll of this is just speculation you can probably come up with so many different ideas to explain how I got there but once you find it I Hope will really start to learn why it's there and what it's made out of\nYou been living with just now for three years you have any sort of intuitive sense of what you could look like\nMy best guess is that it will look sort of like Neptune we think it's a Neptune like planets just a little bit less massive than up tuned into it will be a gaseous atmosphere\nIt probably won't have clones it's probably too cold have any clouds up in the atmosphere so in fact it might be quite bland\nA mostly just kind of grayish white atmosphere with no features of it but it's easy to speculate that we're almost always surprised when we find real objects and so the one thing that I Know for sure is that there will be sings about it that we never even thought about that are completely surprising\nExactly how far from earth to where you think this object is\nWe think is about five hundred times further distance than the distance from the earth to the sun so that puts it it's something like twenty times further than Neptune for example so it's a good way out there\nAnd he is that a quarter of a light year\nOh no it's not even close to a quarter like ... it's about two and a half light days\nTwo and a half light days from er is is that the border between the kinds of rebels and the ... cloud\nWell that's actually really good question to which we now don't know the answer before we realized that there is a planet out there we thought we knew about the border but now that there is a planet where that border we thought was now we're less sure because we don't know what is beyond the planet and we don't quite yet know how that planet is affecting what this border is\n\n... twenty four hours may contain diverging opinion\nBy a hundred percent for what you say I'm Sorry I only have to argue if you listen or dissension advice

much more common in the future and can have devastating consequences\nRight now what are computer models showing to do is have you worked on the eye BCC report\nAbout what we can expect say in North America in just the next decade because we've already reached another half degree warmer and it's projected that we may go up to two\nIt could be substantially worse than even those best estimates\nBut the politics of the planet don't seem to be supporting dramatic reduction in the greenhouse gases in fact it seems that some of the larger nation the United states included\nMy adding poll now to an industry that we thought had ended\nThat we are going to be contributing ourselves to increasing amounts of greenhouse gases and accelerating the amount of warming so that we would be ourselves pushing the needle on the computer models in which there is even more rapid warming\nBut unfortunately you put your finger on it my guess is that the politicians assumed that the problems will only become more severe once they're out of office\nAnd so if they are thinking of the next two to four to six years which just or most of the political offices\nThan they are assuming that they can cope with that shorter period of time and it will be somebody else's problem a decade or two decades from now\nMeanwhile we're facing the fact that there will probably be be eat a lot of people who are going to be forced out of homes in houses and what is the United states in the world going to do with what has to be future migrations away from coastline\nCertainly there will be young and in fact already are places that are having to be abandoned both on the east coast right on the Alaska due to rising sea levels and that will only continue to get worse we will have an increasing number of domestic migrants\nBut it's really the developing countries where their farm or people susceptible where they're likely to be enormous numbers affected by two level Roger I'm forced to migrate as their\nCities become um inhabitable and that's really one of the things that the report highlights were you guess ... of such migrants at one point five degrees\nBut you had many tens of additional climate refugees as you grow up to two degrees\nAnd that will be a problem for all the wealthy countries because naturally you want to go somewhere where there are better prospects and so I think we could expect North America and Europe and parts of Asia to see lots of migrants coming from low latitudes\nAnd in fact I think we've already been seeing that in Europe that part of the reasons for the Syrian civil war and in ... all of the migrants that were coming up to Europe after that which led to a lot of the crises\nSo doesn't that mean that there could be a tremendous amount of civil strife and wars over at the migration of people away from coast\nBut this has been something that has been identified\nBy loss of American officials in the defense department and the Central Intelligence

sensitive white sands missile range in Holland an Airforce base a that down below the solar observatories nine thousand two hundred foot peak and then the third update\nHad evolved from my asking my earth ... YouTube channel audience\nOn September twelfth if anyone had young childhood memories of floating out of body\nSpecifically I was asking for ages four to six approximately\nAnd I had received a huge number of emails and\nA lot of people were saying they never told anyone this before and this is what I was talking about\nWhen the next morning on October fourth floor a Moriarty who manages my are filed social media emailed me that a fan saw something weird happened in the video of the a stream the live stream\nSo I saw a video that Laurie sat me it was slowed down it was weird\nOr I sent the puzzle to a photo shop at video analysts I've worked with for years\nAt first I thought maybe it was an insect was over on a ... like something coming through the window up to the top of a book show\nAnd he did a video loop that you can see right now all of this at\nA ... report what are the smoky fog sometimes link to afterlife returns you can see the whole story and you can see the little videos which are really strange and the reply that I got back from the photo shop analyst was\nThat he thinks this is truly anonymous and uh then I asked\nA that second week I asked my earth files YouTube channel audience\nIf anyone had ever seen smoky fog like what was in my office and believe it or not\nA second I'm One of these whatever they are\nCame between my hands and up to my right shoulder on October seventeenth adding to the mystery of what is coming in and out of my office and uh people began writing me\nEmails about their own experiences with the smoky fog is it like ... than I Do not know\nThis is extremely a translucent and uh when I started reading the letters\nI began to see how heart felt\nThat there were people who were telling me they had never mention any of this parrot to loved ones to children to parent none they but but I started receiving these emails and one\nCame from a a he had been a retired airline ticket agent and his name he gave me permission to use is Charles hazard\nAnd he uh let me say he said you can use my name and that I'm now from Sun City center Florida but what you're going to hear took place in Arkansas in two thousand and eight thinking about all of this\nIf provoked by two episodes of a strange smoky fog in my office when I was working in live stream and that's what provoked him and hear now is Charles hazard\nAh talking about what happened to him in two thousand and eight from his now Sun City center Florida home\nThis was in the spring of two thousand in age\nAnd I was preparing that morning for a group to come in the next day I was mowing the lawn screw the camp area on a riding mower and cleaning up the facility things of that nature\nSo at the end of the day after dinner I was ready to go to bed as soon as the sun went down I was very tired so after shower and\nI got into bed it was dark by that time I Can't remember about what time it was maybe eight thirty in the evening\nI got into bed with the poverty level myself and just lay there and looked outside the leaves on the trees were not fully out yet so I had a very good view of the night sky with stars that I can see\nAnd then suddenly I just I was getting ready to close my eyes and suddenly I open them again\nAnd through the window I can see this misty\nGrade ball drifting in through the window and I was just mesmerized but the thing about it was\nThat in this dark bedroom it was luminous and I could see the light within it and it was three dimensional was swirling\nSlowly kept coming towards me it looked like it was coming right for my head and I was just frozen\nWith fascination of I didn't know what to think then as it reached my forehead I could see in my mind by three dimensional lighted hieroglyphics passing by my field of vision\nI was mesmerized by these hiring lives and the feeling that I was getting was a feeling of euphoria and one is with the living thing that was surrounding made\nAnd then at the same moment everything was happening at the same time at the same time I was getting all this information that was almost like answers to questions that haven't been asked out millennia\nAnd they were all be answered at the same time like all of these answers was coming I wasn't asking the questions they were just coming to me and be answered simultaneously\nAnd I don't know why this was happening I was just going with it I don't even know how long this lasted it could have been just a moment but it seemed to go on forever and I didn't want it to end because of the feeling was so loving\nCan you describe the shape of the ... that you remember vividly and try to give us an impression of what kind of information was coming to you and was it like a word voice in your head ... possibly\nKnow there were no word there was no sound the hired glitz we're almost like God was looking straight ahead and they were coming towards me and then going past the side of my head\nAnd I could see ... but they had the same texture and the fog good would shadow in life\nBut they were living minutes at the same time and they would just float by me but kind of move\nAt the same time like they were walking back and forth as they were passing by my head\nAnd as far as the information I was getting it was just almost like a downloaded information that was so quick that I was not able to grasp anything that was being given to me it was just a feeling that I was getting\nIt was almost like I knew every answer to every question like I was the super human genius or something that had all the answers to everything in the universe was indescribable it's really difficult to explain it felt like to me it wasn't for now\nAt that moment it was for something that was being given to me but I wouldn't remember any of it afterwards but it was for some time in the future\nThat I was supposed to recall this information because it was like it would be given to me but I couldn't decipher it\nDo you have do any sub text in your mind or your soul about who we'd be doing this and why for the future\nNo the only thing I couldn't think of was that it may be cousin my past experience with ever since I was a child I'd had psychic dreams\nDreams of having relationships with an entity that was giving the instructions I can describe the entity to you as a very thin\nUh we'll call it ... smokers smoky fog than period in my office twice\nThat led to my asking for a whether people had had these kinds of foggy white stuff\nAnd that led to Charles hazard and other even mailers who are saying that they're not the only person last night on my YouTube channel I had a dialogue with my audience\nAbout has anybody whether they're in a duck tape and experience or meditate or had they had any insight about water\nA lot of water affecting the planet between now and twenty twenty six [noise]\nAnd that was a year that had been presented to me by a real whistle blower science with that that\nAh he had worked on a project having to do with this exact time period between twenty Eighteen and twenty twenty six in which there could be some either a natural cycle\nOr something that is going to now it's like what Charles hazard when he was saying I feel like it has to do with the rotation of the earth that they're going to be like a shift or a jolt and that it would cause soon armies and tremendous amounts of flooding\nAnd I have had now several emails I'm going to be doing stories on them about exactly this kind of thing and raising the question could there be a natural strange cycle\nInteracting with planets in our solar system that could relate to know is flood that is written about in genesis\nAnd that is how woven and a complex all seem to be going that every single question is leading to answer that people are raising more issues and scientists are also coming forward and saying that they have information about this\nAnd so tonight if there's anybody listening on coast\nIf you are in the military government whistle blower category or human abducted category and you have any information about a huge water\nThat could end up affecting our planet\nWhere they
