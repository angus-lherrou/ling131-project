C. P. international limited\nIn Alexandria, Virginia based company where his primary duties include working on multinational programs for the department of army and since October of two thousand and two colonel McGinnis has been a member of security Donald Rumsfeld military analysts\nGroup and his brand new book is called ... and the alliance of evil Russia China the United states in a new Cold War\nHas the mystery of the end times finally arrived Bob McGinnis welcome back to coast to coast how are you\nI'm doing well Richard thank you for having me to feeding\nMy pleasure let me throw a couple of items that you very quickly and one is that we are we are hearing that us national security\nAdviser John Bolton is reportedly uh pushing the president to withdraw from a treaty designed to prevent a nuclear arms race between us and Russia that would be called the INS for the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty which has been in place since Nineteen eighty seven your thoughts\nOf course the Russians are suspected and I think I'm a lot of people would agree in violation of the Nineteen eighty seven ins treaty because they have\nA not only build but practice the use of ballistic can cruise missiles that have a range of five hundred to ... fifty five hundred kilometers in violation of that that we've tractor cruise missile we called nine and seven to nine\nOr that has um you know not met the um the criteria is violated the criteria now of course John Bolton is on his way this coming week over to Moscow to talk about that but they're also Richard going to talk about\nThe possible renewal of twenty ten new start and you know President Trump said um you know weeks ago that perhaps\nWe aren't going to renew it and that should be a a a really a a shot across the bow of Moscow because it's a concern to solve it you know that is cutting back dramatically a nuclear weapons and\nTo Fifteen hundred and fifty are deployed strategic warheads and about seven hundred vehicle so you know this is important in a world that I Believe has really cross the line to a new Cold War because the old Cold War is all about nuclear\nHolocaust and the threats posed by the Soviets in the U.S\nWe're entering a new era right now\nI Want to also dial back to September when Russia began his largest ever military exercise with three hundred thousand just think of that three hundred thousand soldiers or this was a a drill with China as a rehearsal for some sort of large scale conflict it was called the Vostok\nTwenty Eighteen drills just this kind of really illustrates how China and Russia are aligning themselves perhaps against the United states\nWell it does and in fact\nA really yesterday you had the two defense ministers from Russia and China met\nAnd they're getting ready to uh jointly headed commission on military technology\nUm that is of course being shared a a significantly between the two we just sanction the Chinese for buying a fighter jets from the Russians and also the S. four hundred\nA surface to air missile system and the Vostok a chain exercises you indicate you know I had three hundred thousand\nA soldier's thirty six thousand\nA armored vehicles or at least a thousand bombers some of those strategic bombers um in fact through off the east coast of Russia\nStraight at the United states you know practicing what I Would consider bombing runs against showed me a clear air force base and Fort Greely Fort Greely is where we have\nThe mid range nuclear anti missile capability and we have and we're growing that mostly because of the\nNorth Korean threat but of course the Chinese have a rising capability and the Russians has never gone away\nI Want to ask you whether there was an opportunity last after the fall of the iron curtain the end of the Cold War\nWhen\nPresident Reagan had essentially vanquished or what he called the the evil empire the Soviet Union\nA and then later assurances were given to the Soviets or the Russian Federation that NATO would not encroach one centimeter towards Moscow and of course that was violated some might suggest that the United states was poking the\nBear and given their\n... for for ... for a nationalism in in the former Russian Federation\nUm coupled with the ascension to power of some who might some many who we would suggest is perhaps the greatest Russian leaders since the great\nThat that this was an opportunity last that that that the United states provoked the Russians and they could have been allies but now here we are what are your thoughts\nYou know I think you're correct Richard huh we did poke 'em and of course we've continued to do that they considered a Ukraine or the breadbasket of Russia\nAnd of course they're continuing to fuel the anti key of a civil war which I call in the eastern part of the country and that's after having seized Crimea and of course two provinces in two thousand and eight from\nThe republic of Georgia and they're pushing back against the Baltics against Poland Hungary Romania or the entire a former Soviet satellite\nRegimes ah that's something that I Know when Mr Yeltsin or the new president after Gorbachev stepped down came to this country met with Bush Camp David\nWe had the opportunity to do more than just give them a few crumbs we could have brought them into the fold and I think that that really is you indicate ... you know fuel the rise of Vladimir ...\nAnd you know put and of course has captured the imagination of the Russian people and as a direct result as you know really fueled\nEven started to you know hit at perhaps we ought to amend our constitution much like the Chinese did this past year and allow potent in this case to serve the on twenty twenty four because he was just elected of course uh\nUh this past march you know they're beginning to see that we need longevity and we need to have capability to\nAh keep the momentum going in and they feel confident that food is doing that much as the Chinese are feeling confident and president Xi is well\nYou're not exactly painting potent as an evil adversary and yet the the title of the book is alliances evil so why why should we aside from the fact that the Russians have a vast nuclear arsenal\nWhy should we be fearing ... and an alliance with China\nWell what they're doing is they're weaponize everything against us you know if you look at political coercion predatory economics strategic extortion information warfare\nUm covert action you know I I could go through every one of those Richard and\nThere was a long history and in fact an alliance of evil I go through sixteen indicators in which those things just come out alive and they they like blinking red light and they suggest very strongly that yes they're representing their interests\nIn fact Russia and China are collaborating just like the Russian prime ministers have been Russian Chinese leaders have been meeting here recently in their defense ministers just met you know for taking time over the top\nSorry for the interruption I gotta jump in here will pick this up on the other side alliance of evil lieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis errors Jimi Hendrix taking us

Chinese have an anti satellite capability they're shooting literally for the moon and they're building a capability to\nYou know put a space station up very shortly now they're doing the types of things that maybe twenty Thirty years ago we as the United states we're\nWe're talking about I'm beginning to do well there are rapidly catching up and you know this is caught our attention that's why you know the president and the Pentagon and wrote a national defense strategy that focus like a laser on Russia and China as a true\nCompetitors are near peer competitors across the board and it's not not just the military it's economic it's diplomatic ah it's\nAll these other areas that show national capability and national power and we're finding that our adversaries are are doing quite well thank you\nHow concerned should we be with the fact that Google arguably one of the most powerful companies in the world and you monopoly on the distribution of dissemination of information\nOr appears to be in bed with the government of the People's Republic of China and is helping them\nCensor information in that country\nAnd they're manipulating algorithms so that they can monitor their own population\nAnd of course they won't negotiate any longer with the Pentagon on you know those types of things on the use of the cloud et cetera\nUm that that's disturbing um you know they are a U.S company and you would think that uh they would have some allegiance to this country and and not become a pawn in the hands of the communist leadership in Beijing and yet a that's exactly what they're\nDoing I supposed to a certain degree because they see a rising Chinese economic power and they want to be part of a the success of that\nA country you know they will you know by a lot of estimates or be the world's leading economic powerhouse by twenty thirty five you know somewhere around there um and\nUnless something dramatically happens in a very different way or they're going to achieve that they're going to have\nA leverage using what I outlined earlier the belt and road initiative which is pouring hundreds of billions you know maybe a trillion and a half\nAcross the world and arguably at least sixty eight countries where they're buying infrastructure and thereby markets and they're controlling information flow you know you I ... to the Internet and what can be used and what can be so yeah there are strategically doing some very bright very smart things\nUh but when you look at their autocratic regimes yeah and their president for life under President Xi and the amendment of their constitution and you're seeing something similar\nUnder putting with the possibility of ruling for a long period of time in the collaboration across all these fronts\nSharing of technologies and kind of they kind of have to love one another because ah the rest of the world doesn't seem to like them except they're holding to them because they're being bought up to a certain degree by the Chinese\nI Want to ask you um about\nSaudi Arabia and how important it is the United states or to maintain this alliance with a bad actor in a bad neighborhood or given of course the show he um the brutal slaying of of a ...\nUm and how that might\nI mean there is there or dominoes at play here obviously and I'm Wondering what your thoughts are on how we should proceed or how the United states where the Trump Administration should proceed\nAh with with Saudi Arabia and how that plays into all of this a sort of his do Cold War scenario\nYou know it's never simple as that and

lieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis days with is the book is a lines of evil Russia China the United states\nAnd a new Cold War has the mystery of the end times finally arrived there had been\nA ... obviously some older patients with the Russians are particularly um ah well I wouldn't call them rushing regular troops these are more like mercenaries in Syria the United states has certainly encountered were had heated battles with them\nA there have been some near collisions in the south China Sea was Chinese vessels\nHow do you see this or what is the the danger of this breaking out into all out war and perhaps as you point out morphing into the unfathomable uh the end and then time scenario\nWell certainly the confrontations or on the uptick Richard you know we had one here recently\nWith the U.S have done Decatur\nDestroyer or in the grave and reefs in the south China Sea or the Chinese warship came only a few meters away from it and just in the last day we've had a couple of B. fifty twos flew over um you know the\nContested area and the south China Sea people need to understand that um these islets uh thirty four hundred acres that the Chinese have militarized with cruise missiles and\nAir defense weapons and you know created not only harbors for their warships but also for their jet fighters and their bombers that they practice from that these are claimed 'em by the Vietnamese Taiwanese as well\nAs the Filipinos and there are six hundred and sixty miles or in that range south of China so this is not just\nYou know next door to them it's really in the middle of that to see but these confrontations are on the increase uh we've had a lot in the south China Sea East China sea\nOr the Russians are being very provocative I'm at the end in the air as I indicated and of course uh they have their neighbors to the west are terrified to the point that the\nUh polish a prime minister is called for a given to us two billion dollars to forward station armored brigades are so that they can be prepared and case uh the Russians do what they did\nA in Ukraine or Crimea or of the republic of Georgia which is a concern and you mentioned the mercenaries yes\nBack in February of this year we killed a couple of hundred and it's interesting we have a a hotline with the Russian military in Syria and we call them and said or they use your troops and they said no and so we've\nKilled them um and that's the nature of mercenaries but they were there to represent a the Assad regime a and of course uh the Russians wife their hands or even though we know where they came from and what they did\nWell Syria uh obviously that looms large in any end times scenario uh is is is that the most likely flash point as far as you're concerned\nAt this point it certainly is a flash point I Would argue that ah you know if you've got into phase ... thirty eight that we're really talking\nA ... a and that mad dog could be the country of say turkey I Know it's interesting a friend of mine spoke with a\nA general now president of the sea of Egypt who told him less than a year ago that he thought the\nAir the one who is the current president\nOf turkey is really a fix to be the collie and to establish a cow of fat and his statements have been very very um conducive to that interpretation not only within the region but\nYou know the release of the American pastor Brunson here recently\nAh was after great pressure we put on him a air do on a to cooperate with us but yet we find that he's traveling all over the world he was just two weeks ago in of all places current cologne Germany what was he doing there\nYeah he was doing a state visit but he was also dedicating a mosque now that's\nA very typical of presidents of countries going across the world doing that\nSort of thing but this guy has a and he consistently has had over the years a very ambitious\nThoughts about uh the re emergence of the Ottoman Empire he isn't Neal Ottoman and I don't think anyone that follows him closely would dispute that so\nThat these are issues Syria is\nYou know clearly something that everyone is watching he's collaborating with Russians who of course uh even though there is some friction there that they are working together uh and of course they're working against the likes of Riyadh but they're collaborating as well with Iran who has a\nLot of forces especially crude forces there near Damascus and operating even drones threatening northern Israel so when you kind of put the pitcher to gather\nYou see the Iranians are certainly the Turks are sort of our lives the Russians and the Chinese and the Chinese Yasser ... beginning to show up and even Syria\nHoping to kind of lick their chops and and put together that country once a declaration of peace can be found and they can find a political solution so a lot of players here not confused battlefield uh but I clearly see Syria as part of this\nA long term agenda\nMentioned her to one and I wanted to ask you about turkey did they belong in NATO even at this point\nYou know it's a fair question I don't think so my concern would be one you know if you go back to O. three we tried to put our fourth division through turkey into northern Iraq through ... to attack\nSaddam you know a good ally would've allowed that to happen of course had or want her to won didn't want that to happen they blocked us and we ended up having to\nTake all those troops to who was up to the Gulf into Kuwait um air to one is not being a cooperating of course they're purchased the U.S for hundreds a surface to air missiles from the Russians\nAre they're being pretty cozy with the Russians of late or the even purchased a long term nuclear power plant on the med\nFrom the Russians and of course as we've seen elsewhere as soon as you have a operational power plant much like they have a in downtown to run\nA and on the coastline there then you can begin to make a plutonium and that puts you on a glide path to having a nuclear capability and I think that's what I heard one once alternately\nWell the it's just too rich so the the the turkey is buying um air defense systems that would be at least under the umbrella of NATO a sensibly used to protect NATO from Russian missile yes\nAnd that yeah because we will not connect our a patriots and other like that to a Russian as four hundred a that's why there's a\nIt's a non ... we just won't do it uh and that is a major bone of contention and of course that there are others even though we've tried to maintain good relations with the

that you find that they're not involved with the Hutus are not involved with Assad ah they're less involved with Russia accept because of economic interests\nAnd perhaps even to a certain degree with

Bush draw Iraq Iran\nNorth Korea or act as a legal now your book is very equal but we are in the long perpetrate evil around the world where these weapons of destruction everywhere even theory or\nOr or ... did not do one you're going to turn to give people you're with your line during that he did the work through or wrong or\n[noise] you know well I certainly had a question in their\nRichard ... it is it is perspective um you know I think that the the history of the Russian\nA Soviet Union certainly where they killed millions are under mouth and China where they kill millions a and their foreign policy where they provoked all sorts of proxy wars um the types of values that they support\nAh yeah we do sell weapons are defense security cooperation agency has done a robot\nA ... year this year double what we did last year\nWe we made mistakes with some of our alliances and the like\nUh we've helped topple governments perhaps in the past and and and did it for our own national interest so I think what you said moments ago Richard is absolutely correct and that is\nA we don't have any friends we just have interest and those interests are going to shift from time to time given what\nThe United states needs to secure itself and to prosper\nUm sometimes uh in the eyes of the beholder is is evil or certainly in my perspective when I you know label Russia and China as an alliance of evil I looked at their history and look what they want today and it's certainly not what my country wants\nAnd I do believe a United States is not perfect but it's doing you know some pretty good things around the world and I I tend to want to respect and care for our interests over there's\nParticularly because you know people talk about democracy or an and how that is really what protects a freedom but it's not really democracy it's it's the rule of law and we have the rule of law in North America thank God in western civilization which you look around at Seventy eighty percent of the rest of the world\nThey don't have rule of law it is the wild west and there are no protections afforded the individual you can be literally swept up the street in the middle of the night and executed uh for for no reason in most places in the world\nA and to me that's evil\nYou know you're you know there are a million Muslims that are incarcerated in West\nAnd a western China today and that's a un report or somebody look it up here\nIn the last week or so why are they doing that because they they say that there are extremist well you know we don't do that the United states now yes we have a history of incarcerated in Japanese under FDR a that was wrong or we've acknowledge that\nWe do bad things but the rest of the world you know I have\nI've gone through I think five passports have been all over the world I've seen some pretty bad places um and yet you know it's always wonderful to come back home to the United states are where we enjoy\nThe rule of law we aren't afraid as Richard pointed out being arrested pulled out of bed and shot him had 'em for families being carted away and yet unfortunately we're seeing that elsewhere in the world and\nThe likes of the Chinese are doing some of that to their own people and so they're all\nGot to jump in here and thank you so much for spending two hours with this\nAlliance of evil Russia China the United states in a

reincarnation I suppose I I don't happen to believe it that's just me but here's one of the things that sort of bothers me about that situation and that is if we in fact we choose our circumstances\nWhy would someone choose for example a to reincarnate into a life that leads ultimately to physical abuse doesn't that almost place the the the burden on the victim in that case you were you chose that life\nOkay there are certain experiences that we learn from and yes I I understand where you're going in and I and I really do feel for the people that do choose a life like that it is a way of learning certain things and these men but we do have free will and\nThere are times when people will uh advice us in the in the physical to get out of those relationship\nThose relationships if it's a pattern that a person has to learn from [noise]\nThen they may have to go through it but there's always the chance that they can leave those relationships or we leave 'em I I I understand that when when the child is young but there's no place they can run into\nA because it's if it's parents siblings and there's a ... and there are circumstances where they live on the most horrendous ... a\nCircumstance is yes it is a tragedy to begin with ... yet what we're learning what we're overcoming and that's the whole key here\nIs to overcome those abuses and also for the parents if it's apparent abuse or other types of abuse they have the opportunity to overcome that as well and usually if it's a long term relationship they might have agreed to do that both of them that this is the role\nThat they will take and it's up to those two people that come to some kind of resolution of their behavior that they have to rise above that particular pattern so we can see the negative of it but there are cases where people rise above themselves\nAnd they become a hero and their own life because of the person that they may have abuse of they've been abusing\nThey may educate them somehow so there's always hope here and yes we do have ... that do help us it is up that we is up to the individual to draw upon that help we need to call on that help our angels in

War\nHas the mystery of the end times finally arrived Bob McGinnis welcome back to coast to coast how are you\nI'm doing well Richard thank you for having me this evening\nMy pleasure let me throw a couple of items that you very quickly and one is that we are we are hearing that us national security adviser John Bolton is reportedly\nUp pushing the president to withdraw from a treaty designed to prevent a nuclear arms race between us and Russia that would be called the INS for the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty which has been in place since Nineteen eighty seven your thoughts\nWell of course the Russians are suspected and I think I'm a lot of people would agree in violation of the Nineteen eighty seven ins treaty because they have\nA not only build the practice the use of ballistic can cruise missiles that have a range of five hundred to ... fifty five hundred kilometers in violation of that that we've tractor cruise missile we called nine and seven to nine\nOr that has um you know not met the um the criteria is violated the criteria and of course John Bolton is on his way this coming week over to Moscow to talk about that but they're also Richard going to talk about\nA possible renewal of the twenty ten new start and you know President Trump said um you know weeks ago that perhaps we aren't going to renew it and that should be a a a really a a shot across the bow of Moscow because of the ... concern to solve it\nYou know that has cut back dramatically a nuclear weapons and\nTo Fifteen hundred and fifty a deployed strategic warheads and about seven hundred vehicle so you know this is important in a world that I Believe has\nReally cross the line to a new Cold War because the old Cold War is all about nuclear Holocaust and the threats posed by the Soviets in the U.S\nWe're entering a new era right now\nI Want it also dial back to September when Russia began its largest ever military exercise with three hundred thousand just think of that three hundred thousand soldiers or this was a a drill with China as a rehearsal for some sort of large scale conflict it was called the Vostok\nTwenty Eighteen drills just this kind of really illustrates how China and Russia are aligning themselves perhaps against the United states\nWell it does and in fact\nA really yesterday you had the two defense ministers from Russia and China met\nAnd they're getting ready to uh jointly head a commission on military technology\nThat is of course being shared a significantly between the two we just sanction the Chinese for buying a fighter jets from the Russians and also the S. four hundred\nA surface to air missile system and the Vostok Eighteen exercises you indicate you know I had three hundred thousand\nA soldier's thirty six thousand\nA armored vehicles or at least a thousand bombers some of those strategic bombers um in fact flew off the east coast of Russia\nStraight at the United states you know practicing what I Would consider bombing runs against show me a clear air force base and Fort Greely Fort Greely is where we have\nThe mid range nuclear anti missile capability and we have and we're growing that mostly because of the\nNorth Korean threat but of course the Chinese have a rising capability and the Russians has never gone away\nI Want to ask you whether there was an opportunity last after the fall of the iron curtain the end of the Cold War\nWhen\nPresident Reagan had essentially vanquished\nOr when he called the the evil empire the Soviet Union a and then later assurances were given to the Soviets or the Russian Federation that NATO would not encroach one centimeter towards Moscow and of course that was violated some might suggest that the United states was poking the bear\nAnd given their\nTheir passion for for for a nationalism in in the former Russian Federation\nUm coupled with the ascension to power of some who might some many who we would suggest is perhaps the greatest Russian leaders since Peter the great\nThat that this was an opportunity last that that ... that the United states provoked the Russians and they could have been our lives but now here we are what are your thoughts\nKnow I think you're correct Richard we did poke 'em and of course we've continued to do that they considered a Ukraine or the breadbasket of Russia\nAnd of course they're continuing to fuel the anti key of a civil war which I call in the eastern part of the country and that's a after having seized Crimea and of course two provinces in two thousand and eight from the republic of Georgia\nAnd they're pushing back against the Baltics against Poland Hungary Romania or the entire a former Soviet satellite\nRegimes ah that's something that I Know and Mr Yeltsin or the new president after Gorbachev stepped down came to this country met with Bush Camp David\nWe had the opportunity to do more than just give them a few crumbs we could have\nBrought them into the fold and I think that that really is you indicate ... you know fuel the rise of Vladimir putting and you know ... of course have captured the imagination of the Russian people and as a direct result\nHas really fueled\nA nationalism and patriotism in a way that a ... they're somewhat um I Would argue blind to perhaps what the West is looking at because\nRussia and China are collaborating just like the Russian prime ministers have been rushing Chinese leaders have been meeting here recently and their parents ministers just met you know for his time over\nThe top side for the interruption I gotta

jeopardize our dominance in space our satellites of course the Chinese have an anti satellite capability they're shooting literally for the moon and they're building a capability to you know put a space station up very shortly\nNow they're doing the types of things that maybe twenty Thirty years ago we as the United states we're\nWe're talking about I'm beginning to do well there are rapidly catching up and\nYou know this is caught our attention that's why you know the president and the Pentagon and wrote a national defense strategy that focus like a laser on Russia and China as\nA true competitors are near peer competitors across the board and it's not not just the military it's economic it's diplomatic\nAh it's all these other areas that show national capability and national power and we're finding that our adversaries are are doing quite well thank you\nHow concerned should we be with the fact that Google arguably one of the most powerful companies in the world\nAnd you ... on the distribution of dissemination of information\nOr appears to be in bed with the government of the People's Republic of China and is helping them\nCensor information in that country\nAnd they're manipulating algorithms so that they can monitor your own population\nAnd of course they won't negotiate any longer with the Pentagon on\nYou know those types of things um uses the cloud et cetera\nUm that that's disturbing um you know they are a U.S company and you would think that they would have some allegiance to this country and and not become a part in the hands of the communist leadership in Beijing and yet that's exactly what they're\nDoing I suppose to a certain degree because they see a rising Chinese economic power and they want to be part of the success of that\nA country you know they will you know by a lot of estimates or be the world's leading economic powerhouse by twenty thirty five you know somewhere around there\nUm and unless something dramatically happens in a very different way or they're going to achieve that they're going to have a leverage using what I outlined earlier the belt and road initiative which is pouring hundreds and billions of you know maybe a trillion and a half\nAcross the world and arguably at least sixty eight countries where they're buying infrastructure and thereby markets and they're controlling information flow you know I see the the Internet and what can be used and what can be so yeah there are strategically doing some very bright very smart things\nUh but when you look at their autocratic regimes yeah and their president for life under President Xi and the amendment of the constitution and you're seeing something similar\nUnder putting with the possibility of ruling for a long period of time and the collaboration across all these friends\nSharing of technologies and kind of they kind of have to love one another because ah the rest of the world doesn't seem to like them except they're holding to them because they're being bought up to a certain degree by the Chinese\nI Want to ask you um about\nSaudi Arabia and how important it is the United states or to maintain this alliance with a bad actor in a bad neighborhood or given of course the show he um the brutal slaying of of a cause Shelby\nUm and how that might\nI mean there is there are dominoes at play here obviously and I'm Wondering what your thoughts are on how we should proceed or how the United states where the Trump Administration should proceed\nAh with with Saudi Arabia and how that plays into all of this a sort of this do Cold War scenario\nYou know it's never simple as that ah their cars so sugary situation is is tragic\nUh but if you've been watching Mohammed bin psalm psalm and you know the crown prince uh you know he's probably you know it's been cut down a few notches here recently especially with [noise]\nYou know the so called Davos and the the desert which uh he was expecting all these ah donors in a investors to come over and pat him on the back and giving more money so we can develop a true economy that's not based solely upon petroleum\nUm we have a lot invested in the ... the Saudis we have a lot of Americans over there are a lot of technology you they're totally dependent upon our arms of course now they could go to the Chinese or Russian but they don't want to because ours typically are much better I think the big question and that part of the world one is oil\nAnd and how are they going to use dollars in the future but also Iran Iran is not to be a ... with then of course their their their major adversary against the Saudis\nAnd the Russians in Chinese are all lined up with Iran and were lined up with a Riyadh a regime um\nWell how are they they've got a you know a way of doing things uh\nThat uh certainly in the west we're not all excited about oh but the reality is that um you know a friend of mine you know my friend ... what the expression Richard a friend of my enemy is

lieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis stays with is the book is a lines of evil Russia China the United states\nAnd a new Cold War has the mystery of the end times finally arrived there had been\nA oh obviously some older patients with the Russians are particularly um a while I wouldn't call them Russian regular troops these are more like mercenaries in Syria the United states has certainly encountered were had heated battles with them\nA there have been some near collisions and the south China Sea was Chinese vessels\nHow do you see this\nOr what is the the danger of this breaking out into all out war and perhaps as you point out morphing into\nThe unfathomable uh the end times scenario\nWell certainly the confrontations or on the uptick Richard and we had one here recently with the USS a done Decatur a destroyer\nA in the grieving reefs in the south China Sea um the Chinese warship came only a few meters away from it and just in the last day we've had a couple of B. fifty twos that flew over um you know the\nContested area in the south China Sea people need to understand that um these islets uh thirty four hundred acres that the Chinese have militarized with cruise missiles and here to fence weapons and\nYou know created not only harbors for their warships but also for their jet fighters and their bombers that they practice from and that these are claimed 'em by the Vietnamese a Taiwanese as well\nAs the Filipinos and there are six hundred and sixty miles or in that range south of China so this is not just you know next door to them it's really in the middle of that to see but these confrontations are on the increase we've had a lot in the south China Sea East China sea\nOr the Russians are being very provocative I'm at sea and in the air is that indicated and of course they have their neighbors to the west are terrified to the point that the\nUh polish a prime minister is called for a given to us two billion dollars to forward station armored brigades so that they can be prepared and case though the Russians do what they did\nA in Ukraine or Crimea or as the republic of Georgia which is a concern and you mentioned the mercenaries yes\nBack in February of this year we kill a couple of hundred and it's interesting we have a a hotline with the Russian military in Syria and we called him and said are these your troops and they said no and so we've\nKilled them um and that's the nature of mercenaries but they were there to represent the Assad regime [noise] uh and of course uh the Russians white their hands of that even though we know where they came from and what they did\nWell Syria uh obviously that looms large in any time scenario uh in in in that the most likely flash point as far as you're concerned\nAt this point it certainly is a flash point I Would argue that ah you know if you've got into phase ... thirty eight that we're really talking uh the the Gaga mad dog a and that mad dog could be the country of say turkey I Know it's\nInteresting a friend of mine spoke with a\nA general now president oh el Sisi of Egypt who told him less than a year ago that he thought that\nAir to one who is the current president\nOf turkey is really a seeks to be the collie and to establish a Calif out and his statements have been very very um conducive to that interpretation not only within the region but\nYou know the release of uh the American pastor Brunson here recently ah was after great pressure we put on him a air do on\nA to cooperate with us but yet we find that he's traveling all over the world he was just two weeks ago in of all places Kern cologne Germany what was he doing there yeah he was doing a state visit but he was also dedicating a mosque\nNow that's not very typical of presidents of countries going across the world doing that\nSort of thing but this guy has a any consistently has had over the years a\nVery ambitious thoughts about uh the re emergence of the Ottoman Empire he isn't Neal Ottoman and I don't think anyone that follows him closely would dispute that some\nOf these are issues Syria is you know clearly something that everyone is watching he's collaborating with Russians who of course uh even though there are some friction there that they are working together\nAnd of course they're working against the likes of Riyadh but they're collaborating as well with Iran who has a\nLot of forces especially crude forces there near Damascus and operating even drones threatening northern Israel so when you kind of put the pitcher to gather you see the Iranians\nAre certainly the Turks are sort of our lives the Russians and the Chinese and the Chinese Yasser ... beginning to show up and even Syria\nHoping to kind of look their chops and and put together that country once a declaration of peace can be found and they can find a political solution so a lot of players here not confused battlefield uh but I clearly see Syria as part of this\nA long term agenda\nYou mentioned her to one and I wanted to ask you about turkey did they belong in NATO even at this point\nYou know that's a fair question I don't think so my concern would be one you know if you go back to O. three we tried to put our fourth division through turkey into northern Iraq through mobile to attack\nSaddam you know a good ally would've allowed that to happen of course had her want her to won didn't want that to happen they blocked us and we ended up having to\nTake all those troops to who was up to the Gulf into Kuwait um air to one is not being a cooperating of course they're purchased the F for hundreds a surface to air missiles and the Russians\nAre they're being pretty cozy with the Russians of late or even purchased a long term nuclear power plant on the med from the Russians and of course as we've seen elsewhere as soon as you have a operational power plant much like they have a in downtown to run\nAnd on the coastline there then you can begin to make a\nPlutonium and that puts you on a glide path to having a nuclear capability and I think that's what I heard one wants to alternately\n... it's just too rich so the the the the turkey is buying um air defense system that would be at least under the umbrella of NATO sensibly used to protect NATO from Russian missile yes\nAnd that you know because we will not connect our patriots and other fads to a Russian as four hundred a that's why there's a\nIt's a non ... we just won't do it uh and that is a major bone of contention and of course that there are others even though we've tried to maintain good relations with the Turks\nAnd up until now you know subsequent to the Nineteen thirties when Ataturk tried to secular rise that nation a air to one is doing just the opposite trying to radicalize it within Islamic viewpoint and trying to return to the granddaughter of the Ottoman Empire\nIn our if it wasn't for big brothers big sisters my big sister showed nearly on that I could do

S. has not proud of but every nation has involved than involved and covert activities\nUm ... things that I Know I don't talk about 'em and you know but\nYou know we we need national leaders that\nClearly understand the sobering reality of the powers that the exercise and they need to do it uh with the eyes wide open now with our national interest it's involved and and do it in a way as\nHumanely as possible um you know arguably you know what we did in the in the wake of nine eleven\nAnd which you know a allegedly a use these words that we took captive certain individuals uh that were threatening the United states and of course we've incarcerated some\nIn Guantanamo been there a and elsewhere perhaps blacks sites around the world um those are covert activities um were they in the national interest of the Bush administration thought so others disagreed but nations do these sorts of things and they have to to protect themselves\nIs it fair to say that countries have no friends they only have interests\nAbsolutely [noise]\nAll right Susan thank you for that let's say Hi to ah Wayne is in Chicago in the wild card line Wayne good morning welcome to coast to coast am\nThank you for rent [noise] you're always ... ... the most with that well thank you or did you come and then I have a ...\nYear and um we promise board joke that we would not advance he I'm no way no how\nDoes all we've been doing over there or the country as we mentioned earlier like old in Romania Hungary Balkan history which is corn represents who ... through those countries Ruben or you know always so we're trying to around ... on all sides are\nAnd what we're prepared to respond to be there were were when we are around ... all star um the thing about runs through they did not take crime here to Crimea people will agree\nNinety One percent of them agreed to join run your leader want anything to do with the Ukrainian government of factors go rent the quarterback the United states um\nIran uh most of the day Ninety degree of president we got rid of him because you're you're all that would be willing to lose all his own people so we are the ones who are\nThe ... on the structure will certainly Weprin around the world trying to be the world's policeman and you know is just a bad situation where do you think well my actually my question here a\nWhile to recall all these other currently the will\nRonald Reagan the evil empire rub your your W. Bush draw Iraq Iran ... back the legal now you're going to be very well but we are the ones perpetrating around the world where these weapons of destruction everywhere even inferior\nOr ... or ... did not do one you're going to give people you're with your line than that he did the work through are wrong there [noise]\nYeah well I sort of question in their\nRichard it it is it is perspective um you know I think that the the history of the Russian\nA Soviet Union certainly where they killed millions a hundred mile in China where they killed millions a and their foreign policy where they provoked all sorts of proxy wars um the the types of values that they support\nUh yeah we do sell weapons are defense security cooperation agency you know has done a robust year this year double what we did last year\nWe we made mistakes with some of our alliances and the like\nUh we've helped topple governments perhaps in the past and and and did it for our own national interest so I think what you said moments ago Richard is absolutely correct and that is\nA we don't have any friends we just have interest and those interests are going to shift from time to time given what\nThe United states needs to secure itself and to prosper\nUm sometimes uh in the eyes of the beholder it is is evil or certainly in my perspective when I've you know label Russia and China as an alliance of evil I look at their history and look what they want today and it's certainly not what my country wants\nAnd I do believe a United States is not perfect but it's doing you know some pretty good things around the world and I I tend to want to respect and care for our interests over there's\nParticularly because you know people talk about democracy and and how that is really what protects a freedom but it's not really democracy it's it's the rule of law and we have the rule of law in North America thank God in western civilization and you look around at Seventy eighty percent of the rest of the world\nThey don't have a rule of law it is the wild west and there are no protections afforded to the individual you can be literally swept up the street in the middle of the night and executed or for for no reason in most places in the world are and to me that's evil\nYou know you're you know there are a million Muslims that are incarcerated in West\nAnd a western China today and that's a un report or somebody look it up here\nIn the last week or so why are they doing that because they they say that there are extremist well you know we don't do that the United states now yes we have a history of incarcerated in Japanese under FDR a that was wrong we've acknowledge that\nWe do bad things but the rest of the world you know I I have\nI've gone through I think five passports have been all over the world I've seen some pretty bad places um and yet you know it's always wonderful to come back home to the United states where we enjoy\nThe rule of law we aren't um phrases Richard points out of being arrested pulled out of bed and shot him they had 'em or families being carted away and yet\nAh unfortunately we're seeing that elsewhere in the world and the likes of the Chinese are doing some of that to their own people and so they're all\nGot to jump in here and thank you so much for spending two hours with this alliance an evil Russia China the United states in a new Cold War thank you
