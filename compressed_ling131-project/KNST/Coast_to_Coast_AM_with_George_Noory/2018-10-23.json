O. two which is a greenhouse gas\nAnd that would warm the planet even more so much so that the frozen water those those glaciers that we're talking about they start to melt they'd start to flow and this is much ... fresh water in most places there is a north of\nMel oceans will I bet\nWell planet why there is in those particular glaciers probably as much as to the American Great Lakes [noise] um and the the um\nBut yes the waters on Mars it's frozen and all kinds of places would start to melt the dry rivers on Mars would start to flow the lakes and seas would start to fill up and they would also be rain\nAnd once you have that kind of planet with a thick C. O. two atmosphere liquid water rain man you can start spreading plants around now\nWe were using that kind of plants we have on earth now which are only about one percent efficient in capturing sunlight and I'm doing photosynthesis or it would take a thousand years for them to make enough oxygen for Mars to be read the Bible but\nIf we're talking a hundred years from now it's really not too far out to assume that we can do genetic engineering of plants to make them instead of one percent efficient five percent efficient and in which case\nThis thing could happen much much faster and um so I think Mars is going to be terrified and within two hundred years and my guess is it'll probably be done by ways that are more efficient than what I just described to you because they're going to be doing this with technologies we don't know about\nAnd who's going to do a thorough what country\nBut the Martians\nAre they're going to do with them so you\nKnow when we talk about competition I don't see Russia as really pushing it space program which I mean they ... to ... are you are and they bring us back\nA while we'll show the tragedy a few weeks ago with a couple of ... or ... an astronaut that had to abort but I see China and India is coming along strong how about you\n[noise] well uh here's the thing I'm the revolution in space flight is really going to put the question to these people I'm a I think India's gonna rise to the challenge but now China and Russia both facing a real question\nWhich is are they going to allow private space launched companies my guess Chinese though because they've seen the benefit of a of privatization in terms of their very rapid progress they\nThat you can search and south sounds socialize without cursing and I think you're probably let her get out just sounds he now for credit card again usually identity to stay safe secure that sound them my ... and get one free\n[noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\nWell go back to Costa goals Robert Zubrin with us we'll get to calls in the seconds Robert we're talking about the other countries that are out there blind to do things in space or how far advanced is China right now\n[noise] well [noise] I'd say China right now I'm\nIs about where the U.S was around Nineteen sixty seven and a I mean in terms of manned space flight or you know they've been to earth orbit they've I mean there are a bit beyond that I mean they haven't gone to the moon of course on the other hand they did launch a small space station which we did not have\nDo they have the rockets and the capability to do that\n[noise] to go to the moon mhm um they can have it pretty soon a I mean but the thing is this okay it's once again um\nThere's a new paradigm now and ... these are ... space companies which have shown they can do things\nThat a state run space companies can't too and they can do the things that those companies can to you in one third of the time at one tenth the cost\nAnd if uh other countries took on it uh keep up with the United states right now they're going to have to have their own space access national space programs are not going to be able to match them and um and that means that for example Russia is going to have to come to terms\nWith understanding that they're going to need to have a rule of law there that they cannot have a government that simply steals whole industries for people because I'm no one's going to make it if someone else can take it\nAnd uh so if ... once Russia to remain a ... I'm a strong in space which by the way is a a military necessity\nOr if you're going to be a first class power but it's right or you have to be first class in space um Russia's gonna have to change and it's interesting I mean\nYou know a a a reason is ... ... in a certain I mean ... ... ... the reason why the um the Russian government or promoted mass literacy was and the twentieth century illiterate armies can no longer cut it well\nThey're also going to have to go beyond that they're going to have to enter the modern world and other ways\nAnd um so that's another good thing that that Iran must has done for the world\nThat's pretty dramatic I think the fact that the privatization as doing what it's doing do you ever see the day Robert The privatization could backfire and all of a sudden some of these companies could go rogue doing all kinds of things\nGo rogue I don't know about and all like a James Bond movie where all of a sudden they tried to launch a weapon or something like that\n[noise] well um I I I Know I I I don't think they're going to launch weapons or the um [noise] you know I'm\nAll us where you hire them to do that well yeah well the ... states that one\nWeapons okay I mean because what after all is a state but it is a a military force that exists well a presumably to protect its people but also it controls its people by having a monopoly or a near monopoly on force\nAnd um the you know um\nBut no I I don't think that I mean it's such a different objection people sometimes have is that uh you know if if space becomes totally privatized then gee it'll just the uh the rich they get to go to Mars well\nUm [noise] it's frankly easier to get rich than to become an astronaut or right and um and also I think that um\nYou know if they open the path to the moon and Mars it will get cheaper it will become something that I'm increasingly not just the super rich but then the rich and the middle class and ultimately the working ... to go\nAnd um you know once upon a time you really had to to to be in the high income level in order to fly on airplanes you know into a and now everybody does it\nWhat about propulsion we're we're going to do better than the kind of proportions rocketry propulsion we have today\nWell sure well I'm now ... there's two different issues here one is earth orbit and the other is in space propulsion now earth orbit is is it pretty hard thing to do right now the only thing we know how to do is with rockets but\nUm if we could create air breathing propulsion that can operate at those seeds are they launch vehicles can become much more efficient because most of the propellant you know in the rocket is the oxygen it's not feel if you could get the oxygen from the air the way a jet does it become much cheaper to fly to orbit [noise]\nUm that's going to require some um technological advances but you know who knows uh [noise]\nYou know the next new kid on the block who may ah ah you know knocking on Moscow office a perch by saying well I'm going to do something that you've never done I'm going to create air breathing propulsion to or but\nI'm so take that Mr mosque um and ah because you know there's always something new and then in terms of space travel [noise] um [noise]\nWell um\nWe could I mean the the ultimate would be in my view fusion rockets I'm finished using fusion power to create very high temperature very high velocity\nExhausts a would allow us to travel around the solar system at much higher speeds and even attempt interstellar travel\nLet's take some calls here for you Robert bleary in Los Angeles to get us started Hi Larry go ahead\nAnd George great show as always thank you sorry Thumper lawyers to talk about the office after I listen to your show like anyhow\nI'm enjoying the show the ... and the idea of the question though in a moral issue as far as Mars I'm Wondering when we get there if we find someone and tell us your life do we really have the right to invade like the American deal like uh Europe did on the American Indian or\n\nOK well there uh-huh yeah yeah a lot I can hear you sir go ahead or a okay\nAll right well here's the thing um\n[noise] there there isn't intelligent life on Mars now okay there may be microbial life\nAnd for people to say a for us to land on a planet and take it over when there's already microbial life there is really a gone off the deep end okay because uh what we did to the American Indians was wrong because they were people\nRight and\nYou can even make an argument that what we did to the American to nature wild nature on America was wrong because he had these magnificent herds of buffalo in redwood forest and all this\nAnd and and we destroyed most of that in order to create what we have here now now I actually believe that while we did destroy some things that were\nWorthwhile we created much more and I would not\nUndo the settlement of America but on Mars\nThere are new Indians there are no\nBuys in herds there are no red woods there's just a desert with maybe some microbes in it and and I submit to you that if there but nothing here when Christopher Columbus landed but a desert with some microbes under the rocks or nobody be picketing Columbus Day parades today\nRobert de ... we were talking about the course things that could happen you know how far out in the future ten years going to Mars can we get the ...\nYeah I I I Do I I think that at the rate that space sex is currently proceeding or having the first people on Mars before the end of the twenty twenties is a very realistic prospect\nWhat do you think of these Japanese plans to mine asteroids I don't know how they're going to do that\n[noise] well um I\nI think that's a little um futuristic at this point uh I think though that if we have laws that allow people to state mining claims on asteroids say in return for surveying them to a certain degree of of detail or that we could get privately funding asteroid prospecting missions\nAre being launched a ... in in the very near future that is because the mining claim even if you can't mine it today if if you think you're going to be able to mine at Thirty years from now or fifty years from now or it has some value\nAnd uh and and and the exchange for\nThose claims and people could get a exploration missions finance mind the asteroids is something though for the future there are many asteroids that are extremely rich in rare earth metals in platinum group metals things like this that are extremely valuable\nAll right let me take the questions one time or the first question it be hot and space if you're close to the sun um if you are a far away from the sun it's called\nUh and uh if you're in earth orbit time it depends on whether you're in the sun right now or not\n[noise] um but um\nYou know we do have a kind of I mean you can't you can ... the reason why spacesuits white is because they they can overheat from sunlight and they want to reflect\nMost as much as you can\nWrite a on the other hand things that are in shadow even in earth orbit can get cold so you kinda have to watch that uh but space itself\nDoesn't really have a temperature but certainly the the power of the sun is much more when you're close to it you get hotter much faster I'm now second question\nProfiles people well okay\nHold on for a second the Robert we're going to hit the brake already school by fast with you Robert ... with us we'll be back will let them finish up Joe's questions there and the interesting what kind of a personality would

I I I Believe we should uh I Believe\nThat it's going to be much better future if we do I believe that if we do we don't just get another planet we proved to ourselves that we don't need to be fighting over this one because there's an infinite number of world out there for us if we work together\nGood point Arnie in Roseville, California go ahead Arnie\nYeah Hi I'm ... I'm ... and I just have a question I thought it'd be leaning towards privatization but are you in Anchorage privatization on the colonization of the ... of the Mars or the planet I mean are you looking at the\n... be a free for all whoever land grabs whatever they can or are you are you predict the government should be more involved in\nThe ... how opposition no real poverty as it was would be more than we ever got a point where travel was easy [noise]\nAll right go ahead Robert minute left her\nOkay well I'd like to see a lot of new governments on Mars I'd like to see people go to Mars and set up city states on Mars with lots of different forms of government so we could see which kind of government works the best because that's how we make progress\nOn earth you know America was a noble experiment we proved the value of democracy and human rights and\nPeople all over the world came here because this was better and other countries around the world eventually copied us because it was better well if if it if you have people go to Mars and they're not forced to be under the U.S government to the Russian government or the Chinese government that they formed their own governments\nThey'll go there with their own ideas of how government should be and some will be good ideas from would be bad ideas and the ones with bad ideas that are not workable those counties will fail but the ones with good ideas immigrants will walk there those places will grow and they'll become an example to the rest of humanity\nRobert thank you again my friend always great talking to you Robert ...

and our guest Brandon to Marcello with us Brandon is a political therapist author Paris psychologist residing in the northeastern section about while\nHe has a graduate degree in political constantly from the University of Toledo psychological research methods from the University of Edinburgh in Scotland was research at the University of Pittsburgh centered on yeah maps environmental\nTypically go sleep donors Brandon is been fascinated by the ... for years Syria's with his work all the studies Brandon I'm looking forward to this won't come to the show\nIt's great to be here George I'm excited to\nMy guy shot in the clinical therapist get involved in those studies\n[laughter] um well actually I was interested in a ghosts in Paris psychology before I was actually a clinical therapist uh-huh yeah so I actually I actually\nGot a day job and then I studied the Paris psychology and goes part of thing\nWell that something then you went to the University of Toledo which is not too far from my hometown of Detroit\nOh okay yeah yeah I spent a lot of time at the casino in Detroit but we won't get into that [laughter] how'd you do by the way it's not very well [laughter]\nThat's good well let's see they didn't have casinos there when I left I left in Seventy eight when apple was the time it was just a booming city but what we do have is the Detroit Lions and that's the great thing there\nYeah yeah good good teams up their sports wise\nShe'll tell us a little bit about your work and then we're going to die just store shelves in the Gulf studies for what he was an overview of what you've been doing\nWell um you know I uh\nI have a degree in Paris psychology or when I was in University of Edinburgh I studied uh um basically it's the environmental sensitivity and ghostly encounters um and then when I got back here to the states I got back into the clinical part a thing\nAnd then that's what kinda got me going and and I'm interested in in writing a book and that's when I came out with it goes studies\nAnd you know I'm sure the listeners to your show no it's it's um no mystery that science is sort of dropped the ball when it comes to explaining ghostly encounters\nA oftentimes mainstream macadamia will explain these things away as a loose the nation interpretations are overactive imaginations which you know it's not really true in my eyes\nSo individuals who have these terrifying encounters kind of struggled to find the answers and they're kind of left with reality television shows to provide insight into these life altering experiences\nSo you know there's millions of people out there including myself who were looking for things are books with more than just go stories tales of locations are outdated views\nUm and that's when I wrote the book and I just thought you know I combine real life goes encounters with the satisfaction of some new perspective and insights in the cause of these\nThrowing encounters um it the book comes up with concise and competing theories and what's great about it is it's based on data rather than faith or belief or even experience and you know and you know these goats I been taking our interests for millions of years\nAnd it's and I think we're at the point where there is becoming new perspective on these things and that's what the book really goes over you know there are several firsthand accounts of ghostly encounters\nUm you know I spent years just getting first hand account of going to anyone he would talk to me about goes normal conventions everywhere\nAnd then I started noticing similarities and that's when I came up with some of these new theories are and that's what I came out with the book so you know I really combined a little bit of my\nI took elements from psychological research clinical interviews eyewitness accounts and I sort of piece them together and come up with this uh these new theories and thoughts and I also review the right the the greatest or the latest research in a ghost encounters above\nWell then you bring a dose of real science to the picture you know I think that's important\nYeah yeah and I think so too I mean the great thing is it's out there you just\nGotta look a little bit harder um the journal articles a pair of psychological journal articles and even some degrees you know I'm narrow psychology of fitness a physics they're starting to kind of go into that realm of consciousness and\nI'm entanglement non locality and\nHow electricity affects us and I'm ... and what it does outside the body so there's a lot of that research out there it's just you know I think a lot of people maybe don't know how to find it or when they do find it and read a research article a kind of like oh this is boring and I don't know what's going on\nBut I'm a lot of great research is out there it's just a matter of finding it\nWould have you concluded today brand new about what the ... experience might be for some real big into their imagination what do you think so\nI actually think\nA majority of the ghost they encountered that that are out there I Believe are there is some paranormal phenomenon happening\nI'm you know I think that when it comes to ghostly encounters it's such a complex process\nAnd there's so many variables going on um you know there's\nEnvironmental stuff there's um a internal ... electrical stuff going on\nUm but you know for the most part these these experiences are genuine and um you know obviously there's some fraud and there's some misinterpreting stimuli or whatever but I think the majority of these experiences are actually like I said genuine experiences\nAnd what do you think causes the\nWhat the hell\nI think there's I'm In my in my view I take them more by side based view on goes\nSo that's a inside is basically um pull up at the extra sensory perceptions those types of things\nI I really think that a lot of goes lane counters that happen out there um the base of it has to do with um ... or I'm sort of 'em are coming and being real sensitive to the environment and picking up something that's in the environment and other people on\nMy main theories in the book go over um what I call a uh tell a path distress signals and sort of how they play a role and goes way encounters\nA so I really think that um people's ... the ah is a real or it was a real important part of it goes way encounter\nHow important then is the person as opposed to something like this\n[noise] um I I think that it's um\nIt's kind of a fifty fifty thing and I know that's kind of a weird answer to say there but uh I think there's so many people out there I think there's a lot of people out there there are more prone to go slowly encounters but I also think that the event is sort of a catalyst to everything that's happening so when I say that\nYou know I I think if we look at a lot of the ghostly encounters that are out there the catalyst is usually a crisis of some kind right I'm a death\nOr\nLife threatening events or some sort of trauma or something like that is the catalyst to these ghostly encounters or so the event is an important part of it it's what happens after that event um and I think when you have the events when you have this trauma I think it it it sort of\nThere's a lot of things that happen after that and one of those things is um you know emotional distress so you have an event you have an emotional distress from a life threatening you're gonna have all these emotions that are associated with it and then that leads to sort of these by energetic shift that happen inside us I mean we're all electricity\nAnd when that happens I think that it actually triggers\nSort of our innate ability to\nSend a distress signal to somebody else\nAnd and the great classic example of this is like the crisis aberration All right so we probably heard of these\nThis is when I'm sitting in my room on a random Tuesday night and I look to the left and there was a an aberration of my aunt and she says you know um I Love you could buy and then I get a call the next day saying you know my aunt passed away right on\nTime that I had that right and I and I and I think that that\nYou can sort of see there was a trauma life threatening event with my aunt she was dying and somehow she sent 'em a tele Patrick distressing they'll thing ah to me and I picked up on it and it showed up as an aberration of some kind\nOf as you say some people do get these experiences why not\nWell I I think it actually comes down to something I'm pretty mundane [laughter] I there's a lot of research out there in something called environmental sensitivity All right and um\nWhat environmental sensitivity as it's not like psychics sensitivity it's not like I'm chip coffee and Sylvia brown and and those types of psychic sensitivity where your mediums and\nUm you have psychic abilities but something as simple and concrete as sort of our ability to taste touch and smell and that's what environmental sensitivity is\nI'm so those who are are vying mentally sensitive are simply picking up on the environment to a higher degree than the normal population so if you think about this as humans man you we both experienced the world differently we're both affected by and react to the environment in different ways\nBut the physical environment affects certain people more than others and this leads to all kinds of conditions and dysfunctions\nGet Daily Show up dates right to your inbox for free with the coastal zone newsletter sign up today at ... am dot com\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n\nHi I'm

and I'm going to follow through with this\nSo I open the door the dog and may went outside in the backyard and she's sniffing around and I'm like I still got this feeling and then I looked over at the pond and I saw something like in the pond floating and I started walking and then I started running and it was a neighborhood cat had gotten into the pond and somehow\nUm you know drowned in there by\nYou know dove into the ... you know all that stuff [laughter] but I found myself this is it's not so much scary looking back on and it's a little scary but\nSomething drew me out there you know I I go to work every day you know it's the same thing\nAnd I never got that feeling or that desire to go outside but something happened and I kept asking myself\nWhat what happened what made that day different and was there is some sort of like distress signal sense to me with the cat and distress and it's kind of linked with me and the dog and then I you know so that's it's not scary in a sense but looking back on it it's kind of like this so many cool things happen there it's really amazing experience\nHow many people are normal experiences recruit Brendan because the person who died comes back never had some ... business had they had to tell somebody wanted to get something done\nI\nYou know I don't know a percentage on that um I I Would say that you know a lot of the a lot of the cases out there\nOf ghostly encounters have to do with easing are coping with a psychological injury like the staffs of a father or something\nYou know I'm\n... you know you're sort of struggling with the death ah there's all these emotions happening um so you know the body sort of\nThe the electricity or the emotion signify a psychological injury and that sort of sets in motion of planned this ... this\nPsychological wound through with other whatever means possible so maybe if you're not able to cope through normal means you might use unconventional means\nYou know and if if collective unconscious and there are collective consciousness exist and memories\nOf personalities and experiences of all of our humans are store to store it in the atmosphere um you might be able to tap into this field um and and get some sort of resolution like or your father showing up and saying don't be sad I'm at a better place\nYou know and and I think these things I did the research out there really says that I think it's up to eighty percent of elderly people experience these um bereavement operations associated with their debts spouse one month after their death um so that's a pretty high number eighty percent\nOf the huge no yeah yeah and and\nThese bereavement operations er visits from the deceased shortly\nAfter death are are kind of more important to our individual and perhaps ... could be sort of a way\nThe process of emotions and ensure that our cycle like psychological well being of the survivor you know final goodbye from the disease could help us move on through crisis or grief\nOr maybe if we didn't have that when the person died it might be a good way to sort of move towards the revolution and ... and when I talk to the these people that have these encounters they often report feeling more at ease or accepting of a loved one death after these aberration\nAnd I think on TV usually go negative negative negative negative negative but there's a lot of positive I'm going to come out of it goes way to counter you know this idea of wait a minute there is something more to life where there is\nUm something to look forward to it's not all negative and demons and things like a brand\nAnd what have you concluded above the people who are more receptive to these kinds of preparations and encounters ... what's so special about though\n[noise]\nThat that's a great question I Wish I had a definite answer for that um I think\n[noise] you know something narrow biological is different about them when they put them there there are some tests out there is a big way with people who claim to be really sensitive to electricity and things like\nOh like human magnets or something or\nYeah yeah exactly you know the research is kind of\nSometimes fifty fifty if you want to think about that thing this phenomenon exist and and it doesn't exist but there's some\nReally unique experimental design um you know where they're actually doing that from our FM our eyes jeeze and what they're finding is their their brain is actually and their bodies are reacting to this electricity and very low level\nSo there's some sort of\nObjective evidence that they can detect things that are more than ... other people and the general population can you know so and this is true for what we all we all experienced pain differently right and they've shown that throughout all rise as well so you you know you know I might get hooked with\nA pen and to me it's a horrible painful event for you it's not really that\nDoesn't hurt at all say with those brand and we're going to

set up a specific program that allows people do hold crypto currencies inside their IRAs well\nAre you suggesting people have a bitcoin ... gold or silver IRA\nNot at all we give investors the option don't both in their IRA now explain that force well when I first heard about bit pointed treated for pennies in fact there's an incredible story about how one guy by two pizzas with ten thousand bitcoins\nThat were worth about twenty dollars at the time but here's the shocker today those ten thousand bitcoins are worth more than sixty million dollars\nAnd with stories like that more people are interested in owning it\nWhile I'm not going to pizza [laughter] and that's where you come in\nRight bitcoin is a little tricky to buy and holding an IRA so we make it easy we do all the work\nKevin is good coined or currency\nIt can be used as a currency but right now we see it being used as an asset like gold and silver but in digital form\nHow much is bitcoin right now\nJust over sixty five hundred dollars but at one point Georgia was worth over twenty thousand that's why people want to own it\nYou say you make it easy to own bitcoin in your IRA talk about that\nGeorge we do all the work we buy it for you holding insecure account and sell it for you any proceed you accumulate will be retained tax deferred until you take a distribution\nKevin for our listeners want to learn more about the bitcoin are re what can they do\nThey can call for a free book at one eight hundred five seven nine sixty sixty or visit black man IRA dot com that one eight hundred five seven nine sixty sixty or visit black man IRA dot com\nThanks again Kevin and once again you can call for a free market one eight hundred five seven nine sixty sixty one eight hundred and five seven nine sixty sixty or visit blocked men are a dot com\nAnd I think that's really a one of the most fascinating things that I go over in the book because a lot of people have these experiences and then people kind of go well no one guy there that did that so you must be mistaken or maybe somebody was traveling through or this or that\nSo I Hope that helps them sort of get a better idea of what could be happening in that situation\nLet's go to Chris in Columbus ohio Hi Chris go ahead\nHi Georgia since you're a gift there has been a in Ohio northeastern part yeah I've got to ask I Believe he did a show from there the man's school reform matory yeah we sure did and every time I go there and there's something it's electricity\nAnd if I could I'd like to share a love story with you sure\nOkay my mother in full blooded Cherokee of call been quite a few times a follower ... but anyway uh my father died and three months later my mom she's really depressed didn't know how things were going to work out you know to put two kids\nAnd just before daylight woke up my father was there\nHe came in her bedroom sit down on the bed mom stood up her daughter just er and said honey everything's gonna be All right but it's beautiful in the strongest power of everything is love and I was going\nTo share that with a sweet mhm\nThese sometimes these stories are just emotional issue will they Brandon\nYeah yeah you know I mentioned a little bit before it's these aren't negative experiences for the most part in in my in the real and that accounts that I go over with these people that have people I've met over the years\nYou know sixty sixty seven percent I think are more positive than they are negative\nAnd it's this idea of someone coming back saying goodbye saying you know it's okay um\nYou know these are positive experiences in their life changing and they reaffirm the connectedness that you had with this love one and and these are important things in life we talked about before it could heal some sort of psychological wounds and help you move through the grief process\nSo this phenomenon could be used as a coping skill and there's a lot of research out there that says is that sometimes paranormal experiences are used as coping skills um so you know I always shutter when it's always negative negative negative negative goes goes go scary scary it's\nNot like that in real life it's going to join the Bronx side Joe ... go ahead\n... George how are you Joe good I'm\nYeah I wanted to ask you a question then maybe related story about a full up or religion I've seen um [noise] ... um the question is\nDo you think that there is a supplemental undo channel of communication going on\nBetween the go see a permission and the recipient of that goes to experience um maybe perhaps subconsciously there's this supplemental um communication to weigh communication going going\nThat precipitate the a closely permission appearing and I had a full after recent experience uh after my brother passed away\nUm I'm a singer songwriter and I was having writer's block on his song not related this story before on coast to coast um my brother comes into the room [noise]\nUm [noise] he looks the way he did when he passed away in the hospital I'm sure they have 'em and uh it's it's during the day or at the foot of my bed he walks by\nAnd he speaks to me and says just get it done and then disappears into the wall um can you\nMaybe elaborate on what\nCould have precipitated this\nDoes your does your brother passed away he was he this was the best way how long ago that he passed away or the ... before you maybe maybe maybe maybe uh fourteen years okay All right\nI'm while answer your second question and we'll get back to the first question will quit so I I think it's kind of similar to the what we talked about earlier you know with the husband thing his wife and then the wife kind of said hey check behind the workbench he finds a pumpkin there\nThis is an idea where you sort of gather information from the environment um possibly connecting are resonating with his consciousness and a communication is happening\nIn other words he's saying get on with the complete your song those types of things he's giving you the motivation because I don't think you need at that point it's like that guy needed to find that pumpkin you needed some motivation to resonate with the consciousness of your brother\nAnd when you resonate with something not just information visual stuff as well\nUm and the idea you talked about before as far as that hum unconscious communication between people there's a lot of cases out there like that there's one case in my book that I go over where a I'm a guy wakes up in the middle of the night\nAnd he had this feeling like his dog is in trouble and he has this visual operation of a dog and in the water injured\nAnd you can't communicate with a dog but he could somehow feel like the dog is trying to communicate with him and they're kind of reading each other's emotions and then you know wakes up cars finds a dog\nThat type of thing so you know why there isn't physical communication or words there is some sort of like I'm understanding or whether you're reading a mind thing\nWhere do we get the book to go study sprinted\nOr the good studies is available at Barnes and noble a it's an Amazon dot com if you like listening to books on radio um in your car you can get it at audible as well so basically anywhere you can find a book she can pick up\n...

Trump that great a stump speech but it's not going to happen is the one that allocate the money and they're not going to cut the money to these governments because George what they know is\nIf you create more mash poverty over there you're going to get even greater more immigrants coming to the United states but the fact is that we need these people essentially to give the unskilled labor that nobody is willing to do because the industry is actually in this country right now\nThat they there's no way that they can fill those conditions were just the normal US population\nSo are you just saying let the seven thousand illegals just walk right into the United states\nOf course not but what I'm saying is that they when they pay the ... you\nKnow to bring him across through tunnels or whatever the brake isn't the fences they go on that thousands of miles of border\nThat that's going to continue going on and there's nothing in Washington that can stop it there's no immigration reform package\nUp by any kind of bipartisan package that's going to stop the flow of illegal immigration it's purely a function of the states and Central America and the fact that we have an economy

you what kind of a guy is\nWell um [noise] [noise] [noise] what can I say he's an unusual guy um do you like him he ah yeah\nAlthough we can be a difficult at times ah [noise] I mean he has a sense of humor it's kind of dry and uh he he is\nUm [noise] uh okay look um\nThe thing to know about Iran is is this okay on the one side he well he he's his very driven he's very hardworking\nA A N T is a driven to want to do\nSomething great for the human future he wants to be a person for the ages he likes money he likes cool things you can buy with money but that's not what he's about\nUh now he\nBut you know um that's like going to a foreign country and finding no buildings there just a couple of other people wandering around\nAnd you said hey did you just get off this plane um and they say no we've been here forever and you say well where's your houses on they said well uh I don't know I'm ... than you might suspect that they're they're pulling one on you and they also since since the ... the same time you did [noise]\nBut you see what I'm saying so so this scientific argument against going to Mars is absurd and ... and and this idea that we'll know more about Mars by not going is just crazy uh because I mean what planet we know the most about\nWhatever happened to the plan's your plans to tour for Mars and to try to develop an atmosphere\n[noise] well uh terra forming Mars is something that is is going to have to be done in the future it it it's not something that a frankly our generation is going to do it\nAnd it could take what are you are a hundred years to complete\nNo it'll take longer than that although I'm basically here's how it\nGoes first we're in our time we can send human explores tomorrow we can set up the first base on Mars and I'm hoping to be alive when the first child was born on Mars okay that's what I'd like to see the first\nHuh what a birth certificate that would be\nYeah there you go right okay so the first child born on Mars that is when we're really they're okay but\nAfter that we're gonna have to grow on you know settlements towns cities on Mars create industry is on Mars once that it's done which might be\nA hundred years from now [noise] um once you have a strong industrial civilization on Mars they can actually address the question of trying to change the climate of Mars and change the environment\nBecause first thing you got to do with Mars is you want to warm it up and we know how to warn planted some ... proven that right now on earth and if we wanted to do it on purpose we could do it a whole lot more effectively\nAnd uh the way to do it is to produce greenhouse gases um that is that ... the sun's heat a they're a seal too of course is a greenhouse gas but we know how to make gases that are much more powerful greenhouse gases CEO too\nAnd if we produce them on Mars in the so called a a floor carpet and gases or we sometimes manufacture them on earth for use in refrigerators and air conditioning ... um the the uh but we didn't put them in such machines and said we just released into the atmosphere\nAnd we were producing them at the same rate we're producing them on earth right now\nIn fifty years we'd warm bars by ten centigrade that's a lot okay that's an awful lot that's ten times as much as anybody is talking about global warming happening on earth\nAnd the the uh\nAnd if you warmed Mars that much that warming itself would force carbon dioxide to come out of the up soil because it's been sponge to and it would out gas and it was thick in the atmosphere a lot with C. O. two which is a greenhouse gas\nAnd that would warm the planet even more so much so that the frozen water those those glaciers that we're talking about\nThey start to melt they start to flow and this was much ... fresh water in those glaciers is there is a north of Mel\nOceans fall I bet\nWell ... planet why there is in those particular glaciers probably as much as to the American Great Lakes [noise] um and the the um but yes\nThe waters on Mars it's frozen and all kinds of places would start to melt the dry rivers on Mars would start to flow the lakes and seas would start to fill up and they would also be rain\nAnd once you have that kind of planet with a thick steel to atmosphere liquid water rain and then you can start spreading plants around\nNow if we were using that kind of plants we have on earth now which are only about one percent efficient in capturing sunlight and I'm doing photosynthesis or it would take a thousand years for them to make enough oxygen for Mars to be breed the bull but\nIf we're talking a hundred years from now it's really not too far out to assume that we can do genetic\nEngineering of plants to make them instead of one percent efficient five percent efficient\nAnd in which case this thing could happen much much faster and um so I think Mars is going to be tariffs formed within two hundred years and my guess is it'll probably be done by ways that are more efficient than what I just described to you because they're going to be doing this with technology is we don't know about\nAnd who's going to do it the wrong what country but\nThe Martians\nOh they're going to do with themselves you\nKnow when we talk about competition I don't see Russia as really pushing it space program which I mean they watch us to the ... are you assess and they bring us back\nA well will shed a tragedy a few weeks ago with a couple of cosmonauts an astronaut that had to abort but I see China and India is coming along strong how about you\n[noise] well uh here's the thing I'm the revolution in space flight is really going to put the question to these people um I think India's gonna rise to the challenge but now China and Russia both facing a real question\nWhich is are they going to allow private space launch company is my guest Chinese though because they see the benefit of a of privatization in terms of their very rapid ... they\nMoved away from command economy um but Russia [noise] the the issue there is not allowing a a private space launch companies but allowing space launch companies to believe that if they got started they wouldn't get stolen by the government [noise]\nUm and because you know the Russian government is it's basically a organized crime I mean\nYou know Russia is not a country with an organized crime problem it's an organized crime family with a country [noise]\nAnd uh the the ... and so if it if if they are going to have their own space and then when I Need to have them if they're going to be competitive that's the thing um\nHold on Broadway we're at the top of the hour we'll come back we'll talk more about this and will open up the phone lines with Robert Zubrin next on coast to coast they sign up now for\n... or ... ... email newsletter today it goes to goes to um dot com [noise] Mm\n\n\nMostly not hamper twenty four or five years I'm prefer that one of my camera accounting calling\nFor her

year free [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nWell go back to coast to coast Robert ... with us we'll get to calls in the seconds Robert we're talking about the other countries that are out there are vying to do things in space or how far advanced is China right now\n[noise] [noise] well [noise] I say China right now I'm is about where the U.S was around Nineteen sixty seven ... uh I mean in terms of manned space flight or you know they've been to earth orbit they I mean there are a bit\nBeyond that I mean they haven't gone to the moon of course on the other hand they could launch a small space station which we did not have do\nThey have the rockets and the capability to do that\n[noise] to go to the moon ...\nUm they can have it pretty soon a I mean but the thing is this okay it's once again um\nThere's a new paradigm now and that these are ... space companies which have shown they can do things\nThat a state run space companies can't too and they can do the things that those companies can to you in one there at the time at one tenth the cost and if uh other countries took on it uh keep up with the United states right now they're going to have to have their own space access\nNational space programs are not going to be able to match them and um and that means that for example Russia is going to have to come to terms\nWith understanding that they're going to need to have rule of law there that they cannot have a government it's simply steals whole industries for people because I'm no one's going to make it if someone else can take it\nAnd uh so ... who wants Russia to remain a I'm a strong in space which by the way is a military necessity or if you're going to be\nA first class power of choice or\nHave to be first class in space um Russia's going to have to change and it's interesting I mean\nYou know a a reason is a stick in a certain I mean the reason why the um the Russian government or promoted past literacy and the twentieth century illiterate armies can no longer cut it well\nThey're also going to have to go beyond that they're going to have to enter the model\nWorld in other ways and um so that's another good thing that that Iran must have done for the world\nThat's pretty dramatic I think the fact of the privatization as doing what it's doing do you ever see the day Robert The privatization could backfire and all of a sudden some of these companies could go rogue doing all kinds of things\nGo rogue I don't know about it in a like a James Bond movie where all of a sudden they try to launch a weapon or something like that\n[noise] well um I I I Know I I I don't think they're going to launch weapons or\nThe um [noise] you know I'm\nHomeless we hire them to do that well yeah well it's it states that want weapons okay I mean 'cause what after all is a state but it is\nA a military force that exists well a presumably to protect its people but also it controls its people by having a monopoly or a near monopoly on force\nAnd um the you know um\nBut no I I don't think ... a different objection people sometimes have is that uh you know if if space becomes totally privatized then gee it'll just the uh the rich they get to go to Mars well\nUm [noise] it's frankly easier to get rich than to become an astronaut or right and um and also I think that um you know if they open the path to the moon and Mars it will get cheaper it will become something that I'm\nIncreasingly not just the super rich but then the rich and the middle class and ultimately the working stiffs we'll all get to go\nAnd um you know once upon a time you really had to to to be in the high income level in order to fly on airplanes you know into a and now everybody does it\nWhat about propulsion we're we're going to do better than the kind of propulsion rocketry propulsion we have today\nWell sure well I'm now ... there's two different issues here one is earth orbit and the other is in space propulsion\nNow earth orbit is is a pretty hard thing to do right now the only thing we know how to do is with rockets but um if we could create air breathing propulsion that can operate at those speeds\nA fake launch vehicles could become much more efficient because most of the propellant you know in the rocket is the oxygen and it's not feel if you could get the oxygen from the air with only a jet does it become much cheaper to fly to orbit [noise]\nUm that's going to require some um technological advances but you know who knows uh\nThat you know the next new kid on the block who may ah ah you know knocking on mosque office a perch by saying well I'm going to do something that you've never done I'm going to create air breathing propulsion to orbit\nI'm so take that Mr mosque um and ah because you know there's always something new and then in terms of space travel [noise] um [noise]\nWell um\nWe could I mean the the ultimate would be in my view fusion rockets\nI'm finished using fusion power to create very high temperature very high velocity exhausts a would allow us to travel around the solar system at much higher speeds and even attempt interstellar travel\nLet's take some calls here for you Robert bleary in Los Angeles to get us started Hi Larry go ahead\nAnd George great show as always thank you sorry Thumper lawyer with all the talk about the office after I listen\nTo your show [laughter] like\nAnyhow hey I'm I'm enjoying the show the ... and the idea of the question though in a moral issue as far as Mars I'm Wondering will inflate yet there if we find someone and tell us your life do we really have the right to invade like the American dilemma Europe did on the American Indian or\n\nOkay so there are yeah yeah a lot I can hear you sir go ahead or a okay All right well here's the thing um\n[noise] there there isn't intelligent life on Mars now okay there may be microbial life\nAnd for people to say a for us to land on a planet and take it over when there's already microbial life there is really a gone off the deep end okay because uh what we did to the American Indians was wrong because they were people\nRight and\nYou can even make an argument that what we did to the American to nature wild nature on America was wrong because you have these magnificent herds of buffalo in redwood forest and all this and and and we destroyed most of that in order to create what we have here now now I actually believe\nThat while we did destroy some things that were\nWorthwhile we created much more and I would not undo the settlement of America but\nOn Mars there are new Indians there are no\nBuys in hurts there are no red woods there's just a desert with maybe some microbes in it and and I submit to you that if there have been nothing here when Christopher Columbus landed but a desert with some microbes under the rocks or nobody be picketing Columbus Day parades today\nRobert de ... we were talking about of course things that could happen you know how far out in the future ten years going to Mars can we get to ...\n[noise] yeah I I I Do I I think that at the rate that space sex is currently proceeding or having the first people on Mars before the end of the twenty twenties is a very realistic prospect\nWhat do you think of these Japanese plans the mine asteroids I don't know how they're going to do that\n[noise] well um I I think that's a little um futuristic at this point uh\nI think though that if we have laws that allow people to state mining claims on asteroids say in return for surveying them to a certain degree of of detail or that we could get privately funding asteroid prospecting missions\nAre being launched a ... in the very near future or that is because the mining claim even if you can't mine it today if if you think you're going to be able to mine at Thirty years from now or fifty years from now or it has some value\nAnd uh and and and\nThe exchange for those claims and people could get a exploration missions finance mind the asteroids is something though for the future there are many asteroids that are extremely rich in rare earth metals in platinum group metals things like this that are extremely valuable\nYou don't even know what kind of going into some people never shut up [laughter] and\nThat's just the way we like it came down and have this conversation continues twenty four seven\nIs just so much to say and not enough time to\nGet a nasty I Am seven nice [noise]\n[noise]\nAnd now the heart radio weekends for a time capsule\nHey so sports fans of Danny west that I'm here to take you on a journey

Braun and some of those incredible mine's\nWell they had some pretty good wants to uh they had Cora live a who was a great rocket engineer\nSo is German technology that help the Soviets to write\nWell they they captured some the twos but uh as did we but I I got to tell you well I mean you know I mean there's no question that von Braun and his team were top notch and and we actually got the real rocket engineers Soviets captured a lot of the two rockets but\nThey they mostly caught the second tier kind of people we we got\nWe got the cream of the crop as they say\nYeah we did um but um you know by the sixties we had developed our own rocket engineers although the German team continued or to play a role through about the early seventies um I met a few of them\nWhat's amazing to see people who are born in the eighties for example Robert or even the nineties\nNever had a chance to experience what a lot of us went through a lot of people who are listening to the program right now during those critical time periods I mean the moon landing spot neck all that stuff was just so historical ah we really lived and we have lived through some incredible time several we\nYes but I I like to see America once again to become a country whose Creigh Deeds are to be found in newspapers and not in museums\nJust a you know and so you know like the Apollo Thirteen movie or just now the moody last man effort not last man\nFirst fan first million well maybe they'll ask them now\nHere well I think it's a pretty good movie by the way I just saw it um\nWhat'd you think about the lack of the American flag being in that movie\nWell no they do show the American flag on mark on the moon they just don't show them planting it\nOh okay\nOkay that this movie some people found it a bit slow because there was a lot in there about you know Neil Armstrong chelation shift with his kids and his wife and so forth but I thought it was pretty strong especially you know the scenes with the ex Fifteen and the Gemini and Gino flight\nAnd uh the actual moon landing itself I thought were absolutely riveting and they really gave you a sense of of the risks that were taken the courage that was needed and just the and the spectacular nature of of of this thing and this this this\nAnd the daring of America at that time and um but anyway I mean that's that's that's who we are that's who we have to be we can't be these people who you know say well we don't know how to go to the moon I'm you know I mean that'd be like them in the sixties saying we don't know how to fly airplanes so\nLet's go to David the Salem mass say David go ahead sir\nI didn't mean to you both and thanks for taking my call George ... thing um okay so um it's interesting to me how what you what you're talking about a few minutes ago was really played into my question we you know we've talked about you know how life could be sustained and things on Mars and already might sustain life what do we have any plans are there any theories on\nAustin which can lead in an atmosphere where stimulating are life sustaining environment um I mean really holes that were released trapped gases or you can be the atmosphere with anything we have or is there any areas her plans\nFor that what\nWe discuss that earlier in the show but yes terra forming Mars the idea would be if you warm the planet with greenhouse gases she could form a lot of the costs a lot of atmosphere to help us out of the soil I've got a book called the case for Mars\nWhich um you can get on Amazon and it talks about how we can send people to Mars how we can settle Mars and how we can terra forming Mars that transform it in the way that you are a suggesting because marshals wants a warm and wet planet which means by the way it had a thick atmosphere and um it could be made so again\nAnd you believe we must go to Mars don't you\n[noise] well [laughter] I\nMust I um I I Believe we should uh I Believe\nThat it's going to be much better future if we do I believe that if we do we don't just get another planet we proved to ourselves that we don't need to be fighting over this one because there is an infinite number of world out there for us if we work together\nTo point Arnie in Roseville, California go ahead Arnie\nYeah Hi I'm ... I'm ... and ah I just have a question on your thought to be leaning towards privatization\nBut are you aiming guards privatization on the colonization of the ... of the Mars\nOr the planet I mean are you looking at this alone and be a free for all whoever land grabs whatever they can or are you are you ... the government should be more involved in the hating how\nOpposition no real poverty as it was would be more than we ever got the point where travel was easy\nRight go ahead Robert minute left so\nOkay well I'd like to see a lot of new governments on Mars I'd like to see people go to Mars and set up city states on Mars with lots of different forms of government so we could see which kind of government works the best because that's how we make progress\nOn earth you know America was a noble experiment we proved the value of democracy and human rights and\nPeople all over the world came here because this was better and other countries around the world eventually copied us because it was better well if if it if you have people go to Mars and they're not forced to be under the U.S government to the Russian government or the Chinese government that they formed their own governments\nThey'll go there with their own ideas of how government should be in some will be good ideas and some of the bad ideas and the ones with bad ideas that are not workable those counties will fail but the ones with good ideas immigrants will flock there those places will grow and they'll become an example to the rest of humanity Robert\nThank you again my front always great talking to you Robert ...

looking forward to this welcome to the show\nIt's great to be here George I'm excited to\nMy gunshot in a clinical therapist get involved in those studies\n[laughter] um well actually I was interested in a goat in Paris psychology before I was actually a clinical therapist uh-huh yeah so it actually I actually got a day job and then I study the Paris psychology and goes part of thing\nWell that's something then you went to the University of Toledo which is not too far from my hometown of Detroit\nOh okay yeah yeah I spent a lot of time at the casino in Detroit but we won't get into that [laughter] how'd you do by the way not very well [laughter]\nThat's good well let's see they they didn't have casinos there when I left I left in Seventy eight when apple was ... at that time it was just the booming city but what we do have is the Detroit Lions and that's the great thing there\nYeah yeah good good teams up their sports wise\nSo tell us a little bit about your work and then we're going to digest ourselves into the Gulf studies born with the give us an overview of what you've been doing brand\n[noise] well um [noise] you know I ah I have a degree in Paris psychology or when I was at University of Edinburgh I studied uh I'm basically it the environmental sensitivity and goats encounter um and then when I got back here to this day I got back into the political part a thing\nAnd then that's what kind of got me going and and I'm interested in and writing a book and that's when I came out with a goat studies and you know I'm sure the listeners to your show no it's um no mystery that scientists sort of dropped the ball when it comes to explaining goes by encounters\nA oftentimes mainstream macadamia will explain these things away as aloof and Asian nations are overactive imagination which you know it's not really true in my eyes\nSo individuals who have these terrifying and counter kind of struggled to find the answers and they're kind of left with reality television shows to provide insight into these life altering experience is\nSo you know there's millions of people out there including myself who are looking for things are books with more than jets ghost stories\nTales of locations are outdated views um and that's when I wrote the book and I just thought you know I combine real life goes the encounters with the satisfaction of some new perspective and insights and the cause of these\nThrowing encounters um it the book comes up with concise and competing theories and what's great about it is it's based on data rather than faith or belief\nOr even experience and you know ... you know these goats I been taking our interest for millions of years\nAnd if and I think we're at the point where there's becoming new perspective on these things and that's what the book really goes over you know there are several first hand account of goes to encounter\nUm you know I spent years just getting first hand account of going to anyone he would talk to me about goes yeah normal conventions everywhere and then I started noticing similarities\nAnd that but I came up with some of these new theories are and that's where I came out with the book so you know I really combined a little bit of my\nI took elements from psychological research to clinical interviews I witnessed a cow and I sort of piece them together and come up with this uh these new theories and thought they also review the right the greatest or the latest research in a ghost encounters above\nWell then you bring a dose of real science to the picture your brand and then I think that's important\nYeah yeah and I think so too I mean the great thing is is out there you just got to look a little bit harder um the journal articles a pair of psychological journal articles and even some great you know I'm narrow psychology of fitness a physics\nThey're starting to kind of go into that realm of consciousness and\nI'm In tangle man and non locality\nOut or electricity affects us and um ... what it does outside the body so there's a lot of that research out there it's just\nYou know I think a lot of people maybe don't know how to find it or when they do find a narrator research article a kind of like oh this is boring and I don't know what's going on but I'm a lot of great research is out there it's just a matter of finding it\nWould it be concluded today brand new about what the ... experience might be for someone real big into their imagination what do you think's happening\nI actually think a majority of it goes they encountered that that are out there I Believe are there's some paranormal phenomenon happening\nI'm you know I think that when it comes to go on or if it's such a complex process\nAnd there's so many variables going on um you know there's environmental stuff there's um a internal bio electrical stuff going on\nUm but you know for the most part these these experiences are genuine and um you know obviously there's some fraud and there's some misinterpreting stimuli or whatever but I think the majority of these experiences are actually like I said genuine experiences\nAnd what do you think causes them right why did they help\nI think there is I'm In my in my view I take them more about five days view on goes so that I'm In size basically um\nBut the extra sensory perceptions those types of things\nI I really think that a lot of goes link counters that happen out there\nUm the base of it has to do with um ... or I'm sort of 'em are coming in being real sensitive to the environment and picking up something that's in the environment and other people on\nMy main theories in the book go over um what I call a uh tell a path that distress signals and sort of how they play a role and goes way encounters\nA so I really think that um people's ... the ... is a real or it was a real important part of a ghostly encounter\nHow important then is the person as opposed to the show like this\n[noise] um I I think that it's um\nIt's kind of a fifty fifty thing and I know that's kind of a weird answer to say there but uh I think there's so many people out there I think there's a lot of people out there there are more prone to go slowly encounters but I also think that the event is sort of a catalyst to everything that's happening so when I say that\nYou know I I think if we look at a lot of the ghostly encounters that are out there the catalyst is usually a crisis of some kind right I'm\nA death or\nLife threatening events or some sort of trauma or something like that is the catalyst to these ghostly encounters or so the event is an important part of it it's what happens after that event um and I think when you have the events when you have this trauma I think it it it sort of\nThere's a lot of things that happen after that and one of those things is um you know emotional distress so you have an event you have an emotional distress from a life threatening you're gonna have all these emotions that are associated with it\nAnd then that leads to sort of these bio energetic shift that happen inside us I mean we're all electricity and when that happens I think that it actually triggers\nSort of our innate ability to send a distress signal to somebody else\nAnd and the great classic example of this is that the crisis aberration All right so we probably heard of these\nThis is when I'm sitting in my room on a random Tuesday night and I look to the left and there's a an aberration of my aunt and she says you know um I Love you goodbye and then I get a call the next day saying\nYou know my aunt passed away right on time that I had that right and I and I and I think that that\nYou can sort of see there was a trauma life threatening event with my aunt she was dying and somehow she sent 'em a tele Patrick distressing though things are to me and\nI picked up on it and they showed up as an aberration of some kind\nOf as you say some people do get these experiences why not\nWell I think it actually comes down to something I'm\nPretty mundane [laughter] I there's a lot of research out there in something called environmental sensitivity All right and um\nWhat environmental sensitivity as it's not like psychics sensitivity it's not like I'm chip coffee and Sylvia brown and and those types of psychic sensitivity where your mediums and\nUm you have psychic abilities but something as simple and concrete as sort of our ability to taste touch and smell and that's where the environmental sensitivity is\nI'm so those who are are environmentally sensitive are simply picking up on the environment to a higher degree than the normal population\nSo if you think about this as humans man you we both experienced the world differently we're both affected by and react to the environment in different ways\nBut the physical environment affect certain people more than others and this leads to all kinds of conditions and dysfunctions\nAnd Twitter as well we got those
