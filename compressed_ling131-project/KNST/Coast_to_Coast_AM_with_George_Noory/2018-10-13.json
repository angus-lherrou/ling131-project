glad you're back I'm just talking to Steve off the air is fascinating you they're really really really a fascinating he's one of those guys too is you know really walk through the fire for his principles um and uh I I that's something I really respect\nI really like what he says about Donald Trump Donald Trump solve the problem is he's a reflection of\nOf us and he's reflecting that part of us that says get him when he's really he's really done his homework on on Donald Trump and and and how bright he is on reflecting the people and it really when you look at how Donald Trump is reflecting a ... if you will\nIt really shows how wrong the Democrats that the Democratic leadership really is they're just they're\nOff the deep end I think I mentioned I don't know if I mentioned is off the air but then there's a story in the ...\nFour times to visit the headline in the New York times Michelle Obama wanted Democrats to go high now they aren't so sure and it goes through the Eric\nHolder a quote or when they go low we kick the Michael ... when they go a low I say hit back harder um Hillary Clinton a you cannot be civil with a political party that want to destroy what you stand for 'em when we when that's when civility can start again\nUm there was another a Joe Biden if I were in high school I take them behind the gym and beat the hell out of him\nI mean this is as they sit there and the new democratic what's the difference between that and Donald Trump saying when they hit me I hit him back twice as hard\nWell I mean I I you know that's ... ... ... what they're saying they are trying to oppose as Donald Trump yes right I mean I you know they're not they're not certainly not selling themselves at the new Donald Trump's mhm they're saying that Donald Trump is so bad we must act this way\nUm so I mean I you know I don't like it from anybody so I mean I I've been clear about that over the years but still I don't think that that it's it's an amazing thing I think because you look at Michelle Obama who who was the only one that I saw out of all of the Democrats who came out and said holder comments were bad\nThat's her phrase that was being criticized right and but she was she was saying like no that's not the right way now to me that is complete lip service the Obama administration played lip service to civility paid lip service to bipartisanship they paid lip service to a lot of times\nWhat made them almost unbeatable was for the average person right\nThey they won twice based on that mhm and even though they were just as hard nosed as any other Democrat just as hard nose they at least tried to hide it\nThis switch is now overt we are harassed Maxine Waters were harassing people in restaurants harassed them go after them several Democrats have said this now it is the new policy seemingly of the Democratic movement as defined by Eric Holder who said this is the new democratic\nPart and it's amazing how they all claim to be the new civil rights leaders\nBecause they're all emulating Malcolm X. they are not emulating Martin Luther king yeah that was really the the ... that was his Vail mhm I mean that's what that's what won the civil rights I contend if ... if if Martin Luther king would have swung back\nAnd it ... that they would have followed Malcolm X\nThings might have been worse for ... for ah for blacks for a while\nYou back very rarely does that does that tactic work right I mean people want\nThey don't want to think of themselves as no as you know animals harassing innocent people in the restaurant and that's not something that anyone wants to ... you want to associate yourself with those people ... right and you know you see that occasionally on the right with certain groups who who go down these roads\nYou know the alt right for example if you will you'll hear from conservatives about the alt right generally speaking\nIs either they're horrible horrible and the people in a totally wrong and all these issues or they don't exist\nRight like there's very few people are like you know what the alt right pretty darn great I mean Breitbart famously a you know and I don't know not to you know but Steve Bannon was the one who said that that Breitbart was the platform for the alt right but really\nOutside of Steve Bannon you've seen almost no embrace of these groups are largely because no one wants to be associated with them right right like who wants to I don't want to I don't want anyone to think I'm friends with that guy right\nIt's just a normal human instinct and that's not even Nazis that's all right really nobody even knows what All right is I mean the average person\nThey just see them as people who are going out in the streets and you know a beating people up or torturing people or or marching you know against you know Jews in blacks and everything else and you're like I don't want to be part of that I just don't want to write a ugly I don't want\nThat I'll be ...

author is not caused by demonic spirits and negative spirits are but certainly there are there to amplify and right now everybody's got a target on their back\nEverybody\nHow did they possess how did they take over somebody's body\nThey work on them for on people for a while you can leave these things happen over a period of time people who are depressed people who move into a home a and there's a\nLot of negative emotional energy drugs or something I practice something called modern actresses and and that is that came out of the idea when I started going into people's homes I I found out many years ago that\n... homes because people have lived in there that generate both positive and negative emotional energies which are unseen but we feel them\nAnd they accumulate is in the environment and demonic spirits actually feel stronger and become stronger and these kinds of environments and soda negative\nSpirits and so they are uh attack people and homes we don't take care of our homes we clean them you wash the windows when you move into a new place the carpet paint everything but we don't clean the atmospheres and so essentially were living in other people's emotional energies\nAnd so demonic spirit's just play on that and they come into the our environments\nAnd generate huge amounts of energy that is negative and the air thickens with emotional energy especially negative energy at thickens and so it's easier to transmit negative emotional energy hatred\nThose kinds of negative thoughts and emotional feelings when the air is thick with emotional energy and so I get calls all the time from people who you know say hey I just moved into this new home apartment whatever it doesn't feel right\nI don't know why but you know the kids are crying the dogs are barking in a certain area or we're just getting into more arguments why is this happening and so modern exercises and deals with the idea of that first the negative emotional energy has\nTo be removed by\nSomebody like me from the atmosphere of the home that makes the spirit weaker than I deal with a negative spirit or that's the second thing that I Do that's modern exercises different from traditional actresses and in that I don't always go after the spirit first\nSometimes I cleared the atmosphere to make them weaker and then I attack the negative spirits\nAnd you're not you're not ... you're not a priest does that affect what you do\nI Would not say that I'm not a priest I Would say that I'm an independent police say Sean and freeze exercises\nI don't belong to any particular religion because I work with people from all different religions or no religious at all people call me who\nAre agnostic atheist\nCalls me and that's the thing you know you don't have to belong to a particular church to call me and a half of your home cleared\nAnd these days I Do it by distance as well because when I was going through homes and doing strictly in person and work for the Internet ever came about\nUm I wasn't touching anything anyways personal clarion wasn't touching anybody anyways it's really it's not necessary there's no such thing as as a\nDistance on a non physical level doesn't matter as long as you have focused each one of us is a complete individual and so anybody can be cleared from anywhere if you know how to do it\nAnd it it's it has to be done you know we we move into apartments like I said and there's lots of emotional energy from\nMaybe people living there for Twenty years forty years a hundred years depending on where people are from around the world it builds up it accumulates and spirits need to be\nDealt with you know sometimes there are already in the home sometimes they come into the home the sense of family that's having a problem because of emotional energy in our living environment and they're ripe for attack\nAnd so it's it's best to call maybe a professional to have a clear at all at once and I then I teach people how to\nMaintain the clarity of their bodies the energy fields\nOr and also how to maintain the clarity of their living environment's so it's kind of like having a carpet cleaner come in first and then you can simply clean your own carpet once that's done\nSo it really is something we all can do to a certain extent in something I think we all should do I'm not going to be around forever and certainly there are great exorcist and every religion and not the only one\nOr that are qualified extra assistant just about every religion\nBut the ... but they don't work for people and other religions I get that all the time you know that I that people call up and say well I I called you know local parish even though I'm not you know I don't belong that religion I'm not Catholic and they won't come over and help me\nI help everybody so I that's why I don't belong to any religion but I remember doing this kind of working past lives um I had deep contacts with higher spirits\nAre also this universe is filled with stars and around those stars are planets and there are this universe I said before on on one of my appearances this universe is teeming with life you'd asked me that question you\nKnow do you go into these exercises with a crucifix at all\nNo you don't do that\nNo but when I'm working a with Christians which calling me all the time I'm even evangelical Christians have you know it it they need help to everybody\nKnew everybody needs help hold on for the rest of the ah we're coming up to the top of the hour we're going to come back we'll talk more Jeffries website starkly dot com his book is

back for human once we get to calls as well as we talk about demons demonic possession what has been for you Jeffrey the scariest or even maybe the most dangerous situation you've been in one sense\nOr both or just a few years ago um I Do the three nights a standard essential yet a legitimate haunted mansions and it's very famous I won't mention the name but um\nIt's something I was against for years and years and years for use all invitations I finally they talked me into it and said fine actually stayed over in one of the rooms just they're beautiful you know and ah so ah it was essentially set up for ... to\nGo in and uh with real quick and then in and take a look around and everybody everybody found something that people who didn't believe in ghost had you know one couple said their hair dryer when flying across one of the rooms and I was staying in most haunted room of all they gave me it was actually the nicest room too but\nAh the first thing that happened was I went up there one night to get some business cards from people on it and uh I was in there you know by myself\nAnd it was very heavy gold sheet over the bottom of the bed I forgot what that's called the bachelor but very heavy gold she was called the gold room and it went up to get my business cards and this she started moving up and down maybe a foot really fast right in front of me just\nWould not stop I just said you know oh\nI just you know forget it I went to get my cards and paid no attention I said you know this place is really haunted and third night I was there um I was sleeping and uh I'd given speeches every night or to the coast hunters warning meant to be very careful about saying don't pinch\nMe don't bite the bullet people home negative spirit's just they will get\nChanel to get your later so it was sleeping I woke up about five o'clock in the morning and I'm\nOut four feet above me was the misshapen spirit just terrible looking now I'm used to know spirits can assume many shape they want I don't react to the ... you know the say the ugliness or the appearance of something like that deliberately or what this thing was doing was it was singing\nAnd ... song that I'd never heard\nReally is I Can't it's strange possible to describe it was not any\nKind of it sounded like some kind of evil law by\nAnd it was right above me and the spirit was essentially you know head to head I was laying in bed woke up and the spirit was was singing ... and I could hear a loud and clear this horrific song slowly and I just I you know\n... shot up immediately got up out of my bed at ... kind of went right back into the wall immediately 'cause I was going to attack right away first thing I knew what it was I'd I'd have no idea how long it had been there a you know essentially putting some kind of\nIncantation are spelled immediately on me you know I had to change me a from being very happy and sleeping very well to suddenly being very um self conscious and and frightened I actually felt really sick I sat up\nImmediately went to the chair sat in my room and he said I Am not going back to sleep in this house now I was not working at this time I was just you know sleeping after hard night uh giving speeches and talking about all these things and I said I'm not going to sleep again in this mansion\nAnd actually went down into the basement which used to be a speak easy and sat down and they're not out of fear I just wanted to get out of the room you\nKnow you you just have to learn\nAn extra shift is not safe I don't go into homes and uh in in to entertain people or just to give speeches if they're negative spirits and somebody's home or negative energy I get rid of it\nHow do you know you've gotten rid of\nPeople say so I I go completely on the client I give a report on what I see and what I did and suggestions I have but I go completely on the clients\nWhen did they get back to Egypt for you I mean how many days after you were there do they call you back and say I think you got rid of this thing\nOh it's usually right away a you know sometimes you know a week or so later but on the calls come pretty quickly you know in times immediately you know it's like you know we feel better right away especially when I Do a personal clear I mean I Do these things by Skype\nI work with people all around the world I don't have to travel everywhere sky telephone or you know whatever and so people say hey I feel better right away because I work on a lot of individuals that just working negative environments and they need a clearing\nAnd and I teach people how to protect themselves and and so I Do a lot of this and so they feel better right away I get that right away and they call up and say hey our family is no longer fighting\nI feel better at work and better able to go into business meetings and no longer coming out feeling drained because I'm not getting hit with negative energy for my coworkers we all generate negative energy\nAnd we don't always know what it's subconscious and so people don't know they're getting hit they don't know they're sending out negative energy you don't know something like a demonic spirit is around them or a negative spirit and so\nYou know people call me families call me and sometimes it takes a while and sometimes it's a media but I always get a caller an email thanks a lot Jeffrey really really helps you know\nVery very seldom out of the thousands of clients that I've helped or the last almost three decades now\nHave not said that you know it's it's not a matter of ego were bragging it's just what happens you know I'm very good at what I Do and I make sure that the client isn't the best shape possible so personal clearing might be forty five minutes I Do thirty five different things in forty five\nMinute already find different things so remarkable and it's almost like a checklist\nEvery clearing as different George depending on what is going on with the client it may just be negative energy a nurse works in a hospital or psychiatric ward or around ... people that is coming in for their six month clearing they're calling me up you know buy Skype or something or is most common\nUh you know and I don't have to look at them for forty five minutes how I was I always work with\nMy eyes closed unless I'm walking around really on the\nBusiness or a house and so you know or they feel better you know and and you know the fight stop because the idea of a negative spirit or even just negative emotional energy that's accumulated over a period of time in a home has no effect upon the family more arguments\nAnd they can turn violent this attracts negative spirits this attracts demonic spirits\nAnd so negative emotional energy attracts negative spirits demonic spirit is also happens in the workplace far more than people think\nAnd are these are the complaints that I get and so my job is to remove the negative emotional energy from a person's energy fields both deep meaning that the from the very first day that were born we generate emotional energy\nAnd also things we pick up today yesterday last week as well and also the homes we move into apartments were lived in by maybe a hundred different people generating emotional energy schools\nPeople go to the school I went to this this is the same school both\nElementary and high school that my parents went to its old great youthful\nBut I mean think of the moon she didn't hurt me late it and so people will be calling uncomfortable they don't know why\nAnd the body picks up emotional energy regenerated you don't know how to release it I teach people how to do that you know and and so sometimes it's a teaching session and sometimes it's\nClearing session it all depends I Do both and you know a clearing session a forty five minutes for a standard adult you know maybe you know thirty minutes for a child and maybe Fifteen twenty minutes for pets\nThat's a good little extra costs just for you know\nMost all energy more than people do\nNext stop let us go to the J in Minnesota Welcome to the program I DJ\nGood evening gentlemen I appreciate your time thank you thanks for

other side sometimes\nYou know and and sometimes not and and negative spirits attack people least able to defend themselves which unfortunately is a great portion of the population and so they will attack people who have mental issues\nPhysical brain problems a depression anger issues unhappiness or overconfidence all sorts of things that are going on and so it does happen\nAnd and we have to watch out for that and and so ah ah demonic spirits\nAre experts at reaching across that\nDividing line and being able to reach into the physical realm and affect people when the wind is right usually meaning that there is emotional energy and the atmosphere or a person is feeling weak they're not protecting themselves properly\nAnd they can reach across and damage a person physically and they can cause even something like that usually what happens is is not so much of an immediate dug but actually working on them for a long time\nAnd they can cause physical injuries even happened to me once you know I I woke up one morning I was getting dressed in my office my girlfriend was asleep at the time and I was getting up and ready to work out doing what I Do here and all of a sudden\nDemonic spirit appeared behind me I knew it I could feel its power suddenly a light shot out from it hit me right in the back\nAnd it caused me to have a centrally a pulled muscle I actually had to go you know get in my car and tried to the hospital and you know have looked at in a you know get some light medication for it is it the demonic Stewart had pulled the muscle so it can happen to me and I'm good at protecting myself\nSo all of the people out there who are not protecting themselves which is you know most of the population of our planet are very susceptible to attack\nAnd it can be physical because demonic spirits study how to do these things the non physical universe heaven the other side whatever you want to call it which is a wonderful place but they also have dark realm was that are negative\nVery negative what we might call help and and especially that is very connected to the physical realm maybe the physical realm as something like the crust of the bread and heaven and the other side being the inside the bread itself which is much larger\nLet's go next to the gym in Portland, Oregon while we have some time here Jim go ahead\n... on my question is is it possible

Jeffrey as long as you're doing extra citizens and teaching people how to protect themselves why don't you help the spirits and I said what I say no I Am not a spirit psychologist uh it's\nKind of like if somebody calls and your window and wants to steal your stereo or worse you don't\nSit them down on the couch and say look we need to talk about while you steal things it's not my job you don't have time for spirits\nOut there that actually are very good at trying to help negative spirits\nDemonic spirits are hopeless but the idea of negative spirit's just negative people who are dead and doing negative things and trying to get them to look at themselves and see what they're doing but it's not my job and people who hire me I work for them\nMy job is to get those things out of their home get negative energy out of their home out of their bodies energy fields I don't have time to do it and they're not going to listen to me anyway\nThey're they don't have to there's going to go someplace\nOh they're just not going to do that anymore to a physical criminals going to sit there on the couch is that he or she is going to get up and walk out the door back out the window\nI I just don't have the time I have to immediately focus on getting rid of the emotional energy in the person who's energy field of the average person\nNot everybody's everybody's disaster anything they just have negative energy issues and also getting if there is some kind of negative spirit attack but not necessarily living in the house they could just be going from house to house every night or apartment to apartment or condo condo or ... whatever and getting them out of their fast\nAnd making it work so the family or the individual that hey this is my main concern not dealing with a negative spirit's there are\nMillions and millions of spirits out there you don't just sit on clouds or walk the streets of gold actually do things and one of the things they do is work for higher spirits and help other spirits look at themselves and stop doing what they're doing if they don't there are other measures that we can take\nJeffrey are you glad you have this ability disability to see demons to maybe even get removed them George\nI Am I was born with it and at first it was really scary because when I reported it the teachers you know I'm seeing these spirits and you know I'm\nA mom for that get you know you know tell her when my grandmother my grandmother was going to call and you know two days and all this kind of stuff at first it was real scary but actually I I started as I went along in my life I started and and I'm fifty nine now I started to remember doing these kinds of things in past life helping people\nThat to me is the greatest gift um I could ever be given is the ability to help people it's dangerous work but the idea is that once I teach people how to protect themselves they can go off and and not be so susceptible they can go to work and not come home so dream\nAnd I bet they really appreciate you while they love it\nYou know and it it's just great to hear them say hey thanks Jeffrey but you know the real the real reward is feeling better that's what

I didn't I didn't know when I was dreaming that it was a dream and the voice of elusive tree but afterwards I woke up right after and so sure enough that was only a dream but what I'm curious about is\nSomebody like Dr Ford in the area of psychology and whatnot I Would would not\nBe surprised at all but she has been consuming these drugs\nWe don't we don't know that\nI don't know but but what I'm saying is that it could very well\nBe that she instead of what this young man had with a with a well he can dream sure she hers was more like Roseanne\nBarr that you can read on 'em\nNo you're you're absolutely right but that's that's something that nobody asked either one of them\nIf they were on the mood altering drugs I don't believe everything I ... I've seen in in that case\nThat never came up but ah I'm sure that's a possibility or even though we don't know for sure what it probably happened key thank you for that but we've got open line calls let's go next to Jason in Bowling Green Kentucky west of the Rockies Hi Jason\nYou know and you're okay where you\nAre I'm engaged in ... um I had a um the thing that I couldn't believe it I saw before I had a I had done a little ... engage them and I had gotten to read the Bible a little bit you know and um and I was in a boon in my life where I didn't really know\nIf God was real or if the devils real all this you know and I started reading the Bible and then I'm\nGoing back to the point when I was out of jail or whatever and uh uh as God and I was like ... ... you know your real angels and everything Israel you know show me was I Would like to know I Would like to believe I so I\nIt's probably ... ... at first nothing really happened except until about a week later\nThen what happens when I started seeing these little things like with people like um Beagle like these little spirits and stuff\nAnd I'm a well I I think this one guy had\nThree of them right ... it seemed like everybody he had freeing the everything he did he touch with no I mean you have a one my ... and you know what I'm saying in and then I think it's monkey you didn't have none okay now these kids that you know\nOh it's a glass of water without knocking over something breaking it up and told me that\nHe was going to get and they do but he didn't have a limited time I'm leaving it was kind of be just to show me that you know how it works whatever you know and then so [laughter] so I go to church you know\nI tell my uncle about it and he told me you know when you go to church in playing stuff\nNo and I'm so we go to church but why would they church I won't eat them and I started the ... will will be angels like\nIn the early on in the church all over the place\nAll the way you around it you know a new like there was a state of behind the ...

cost you a little\nBit that's the way to do with Tim we'll talk to you next week psychological simple dollar editor in coast to coast am dot com he works with the Sean and lax and so many other great

supply of super beats in free shipping with your first purchase\nNot I think would be Fifteen twenty percent would be my guest George but important thing to remember is that there are there and they certainly believe that we exist\nAnd so the ... the old game is is that they don't want us to know that they're they're they want us to think that this is our own feelings our own thoughts and some of it is all of the violence author is not caused by demonic spirits and negative spirits\nAre but certainly there are there to amplify and right now everybody's got a target on their back everybody\nHow do they ... how did they take over somebody's body\nAnd work on them for on people for a while you can leave these things happen over a period of time people who are depressed people who move into a home a and there's a lot of negative emotional energy drugs actually something\nI practice something called modern actresses and and that is that came out of the idea when I started going into people's homes I I found out many years ago that ... homes because people have lived in there to generate both positive and negative emotional energies which are unseen but we feel ...\nAnd ... it accumulates in the environment and demonic spirits actually feel stronger and become stronger and these kinds of environments and so to negative\nSpirits and so they are attacked people and homes we don't take care of our homes we\nClean them wash windows when you move into a new place the carpet paint everything but we don't clean the atmospheres and so essentially were living in other people's emotional energies and so demonic spirit's just play on that and they come into the our environments\nAnd generate huge amounts of energy that is negative and the air thickens with emotional energy especially negative energy at thickens and so it's easier to transmit negative emotional energy hatred\nBoth kinds of negative thoughts and emotional feelings when the air is thick with emotional energy and so I get calls all the time from people who you know say hey I just moved into this new home apartment whatever it doesn't feel right\nI don't know why but you know the kids are crying the dogs are barking in a certain area or we're just getting into more arguments why is this happening and so modern extra citizen deals with the idea that first negative emotional energy has to be removed by\nSomebody like me from the atmosphere of the home that makes the spirit weaker than I deal with a negative spirit or that's the second thing that I Do that's modern exercise is different from traditional actresses and in that I don't always go after the spirit first\nSometimes I cleared the atmosphere to make them weaker and then I attack the negative spirits\nAnd you're not you're not ... you're not a priest does that affect what you do\nI Would not say that I'm not a priest I Would say that I'm an independent police say shot and then freeze exercises\nI don't belong to any particular religion because I work with people from all different religions or no religious at all people call me who are agnostic atheist\nEverybody calls me and that's the thing you know you don't have to belong to a particular church to call me and a half of your home cleared\nAnd these days I Do it by distance as well because when I was going through homes and doing strictly in person and work for the Internet ever came about um I wasn't touching anything anyways personal clarion so I wasn't touching anybody anyway is really\nIt's not necessary there's no such thing as as a distance on a non\nPhysical level doesn't matter as long as you have focused each one of us is a complete individual and so anybody can be cleared from anywhere if you know how to do it\nAnd it it it has to be done you know we we move into apartments like I said and there's lots of emotional energy from maybe people living there\nFor Twenty years forty years a hundred years depending on where people are from around the world it builds up it accumulates and spirits need to be\nDealt with you know the times that are already in the home sometimes they come into the home the sense of family that's having a problem because of emotional energy in our living environment and they're ripe for attack and so it's it's best to call maybe a professional to have a clear it out once\nAnd I then I teach people how to maintain the clarity of\nTheir bodies are energy fields or and also how to maintain the clarity of their living environment's so it's kind of like having your carpet cleaner come in first and then you can simply\nQueen her own carpet once that's done so it really is something we all can do to a certain extent in something I think we all should do I'm not going to be around forever and certainly there are great exorcist and every religion not the only one\nUh that are qualified extra assistant just about every religion\nBut the ... but they don't work for people and other religions I get that all the time you know that I get people call up and say well I I called you know local parish even though I'm not you know I don't belong that religion not Catholic and they won't come over and help me\nI help everybody so I that's why I don't belong to any religion but I remember doing this kind of working past lives\nUm I have deep contacts with higher spirits\nAre also this universe is filled with stars and around those stars are planets and there are this universe I said before on on one of my appearances the universe is teeming with life you asked me that question\nTo know do you go into these exercises with a crucifix at all\nNo you don't do that\nNo but when I'm working a with Christians which told me all the time I'm even evangelical Christians have you know it they need help to everybody\nKnew everybody needs help hold on for the rest of the ah we're coming up to the top of the hour we're going to come back we'll talk more Jeffries website ... clear dot coms

hundred sixty three forty five forty six eight hundred six eight three forty five forty six\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\nAnd we'll come back Jeffrey Schumann once we get to calls as well as we talk about demons demonic possession what has been for you Jeffrey the scariest or even maybe the most dangerous situation you've been in with this\nOr both or just a few years ago um I did a three nights a\nStand essentially at a legitimate haunted mansions very famous I won't mention the name but um it's something I was against for years and years and years for use all the invitation I finally uh they talked me into and I said fine actually stayed\nOver in one of the rooms just beautiful you know and uh so uh it was essentially set up for ...\nTo go in and uh with real quitting and and take a look around and everybody everybody found something people who didn't believe in ghost had you know on a couple of ... their hair dryer went flying across one of the rooms and I was staying in most haunted room of all they gave me it was actually the nicest room too but\nAh the first thing that happened was I went up there one night to get some business cars are people on it and uh I was in there you know by myself and it was very heavy gold sheet over the bottom of the bed I forgot what that's called them\nThe bachelor but very heavy gold she was called the golden rule and it went up to get my business cards and this sheet started moving up and down maybe a foot really fast right in front of me just\nWould not stop I just said you know oh I just you know forget it I went to get my card paid no attention I said you know\nThere's places really haunted and third night I was there um I was sleeping and uh I'd given speeches every night or to the coast hunters warning meant to be very careful about saying don't pinch me don't bite me\nY'all do follow people home negative spirit's just they will get you know they get\nYou later so it was sleeping I woke up about five o'clock in the morning and out four feet above me was the misshapen spirit just terrible looking now I'm used to know spirits can assuming the shape they want I don't react to this you know the\nSay the ugliness or the appearance of something like that deliberately\nOr what this thing was doing was it was singing\nAnd ... song that I'd never heard\nReally is I Can't it's strange possible\nTo describe it was not any kind of it sounded like some kind of evil law by\nAnd it was right above me and the spirit was essentially you know head to head I was laying in ... in the bed woke up and the spirit was was singing hello Patrick week and I could hear it loud and clear this horrific song slowly and I just I you know\n... shot up immediately got up out of my bed it's kind of went right back into the wall immediately 'cause I was going to attack right away first thing I knew what it was I did I have no idea how long it had been there a you know essentially putting some kind of\nIncantation are spelled immediately on me you know I had to change me a from being very happy and we've been very well to suddenly being very um self conscious and and frightened I actually felt really sick I sat up\nImmediately went to the chair sat in my room and said I Am not going back to sleep in this house and now I was not working at this time I was just you know sleeping after hard night of giving speeches and talking about all these things and\nI said I'm not going to sleep again in this mansion and actually went down into the basement which used to be a speak easy and sat down and they're not out of fear I just wanted to get out of the room you\nKnow you you just sell to lose\nAn extra shift is not safe I don't go into homes and uh and and to entertain people or just to give speeches if they're negative spirits and somebody's home or negative energy I get rid of it\nHow do you know you've gotten rid of\nPeople face so I I go completely on the client I give a report on what I see and what I did and suggestions I have but I go completely under clients\nWhen did they get back to Egypt for you I mean how many days after you were there do they call you back and say I think you've got rid of this thing\nOh it's usually right away or you know sometimes you know a week or so later but on the calls come pretty quickly you know times immediately you know it's like you know we feel better right away especially when I Do a personal clearly not do these things by Skype I work with people all around the world I don't have to travel everywhere sky telephone\nUh you know whatever and so people say hey I feel better right away because I work on a lot of individuals are just working negative environments and they need a clearing\nAnd and I teach people how to protect themselves and and so I Do a lot of this and so they feel better right away I get that right away and they call up and say hey our family is no longer fighting I feel better at work and better able I go into business meetings and I'm no longer coming out feeling drain\nBecause I'm not getting hit with negative energy for my coworkers we all generate negative energy\nAnd we don't always noted subconscious\nAnd so people don't know that are getting hit they don't know they're sending out negative energy they don't know something like a demonic spirit is around them are on\nNegative spirit and felt you know people call me family is calling me and sometimes it takes a while and sometimes it's the media but I always get a caller and email thanks a lot Jeffrey you're really really hard you know very very seldom out of the thousands of clients\nThat I've helped or the last three decades now\nHave not said that you know it's it's not a matter of ego or bragging it's just what happens you know I'm very good at what I Do and I make sure that the client isn't the best shape possible so personal clearing might be forty five minutes I Do thirty five different things and forty five\nMinute already by different things so remarkable it's almost like a checklist\nEvery clearing has different George depending on what is going on with the client and may just be negative energy a nurse works in a hospital or psychiatric ward or around ... people that is coming in from the six month clearing they're calling me up you know buy Skype or something or is most common\nUh you know and I don't have to look at them for forty five minutes how I was I always work with\nMy eyes closed unless I'm walking around really on the business\nOr a house and so you know or they feel better you know and and you know the fight stop because the idea of a negative spirit or even just negative emotional energy that's accumulated over a period of time in a home has no effect upon the family more arguments\nAnd they can turn violent this attracts negative spirits this attracts demonic spirits\nAnd so negative emotional energy attracts negative spirits and demonic spirit is also happens in the workplace far more than people think\nAnd are these are the complaints that I get and so my job is to remove the negative emotional energy from a person's energy field both deep meaning that the from the very first day that were born we generate emotional energy\nAnd also things we pick up today yesterday last week as well and also the homes we move into apartments were lived in by maybe a hundred different people generating emotional energy schools\nPeople go to school I went to this this is the same school both elementary and high school that my parents went to its old very beautiful\nBut I mean think of the moon energy dinner elated\nAnd so people will be calling uncomfortable they don't know why and the body picks up emotional energy generated we don't know how to release that I teach people how to do that you know and and so\nSometimes it's a teaching session and sometimes it's a clearing session it all depends I Do both and you know a clearing session a forty five minutes first\nStandard adult you know maybe you know thirty minutes for a child and maybe Fifteen twenty minutes for pets\nNot so good at all costs just for you know\nMost all energy more than people do\nNext stop let us go to the J in Minnesota Welcome to the program I DJ\nGood evening gentlemen I appreciate your time\nThank you thanks for calling\nUm George it's always a pleasure I've I've called you a couple of times about ... and everything else but Jeffrey you treat me extremely are great late at night and I have some questions I have some issues\nI didn't catch the beginning of the program and I'm not sure where you're from but I Am up in Minnesota and\nI have had a problem I created when I was back in the marine corps\nA prior to the war um after I went through that\nWhat happened often ... board followed me as it said it would and I've lost two families or Twenty years worth of family and so I I'm a dedicated man\nAnd so I you know I think what you're doing this marvelous you know I I think that it's just that there's a misinterpretation and needless argument between these two a theory that are both correct\nAnd let's go back to a jury for the other question go ahead Teri\nAh yeah what I was gonna say is you're talking about religion religion teaches that repeats that God go to church give your money do this don't do that that's not from guy\nThe problem is is that we have many ministers out there that teach\nUh this type of stop and basically do they make money off the guy the problem is with the with the whole scenario as it turns people off like you Jeffrey and and I understand that I I really do understand that and I feel sorry for people that don't know that\nBut you got to understand that the only Christianity is not a religion it's it it it's a relationship between you and God now why is that\nWell to be an arbitrator you have to be God man Jesus title is Jean\n... Lord Jesus Christ lord needs dia de Jesus means humanity and cry needs anointed why [noise] okay so what happens is because we don't do this in order to be because none of us are perfect on the third in fact\nIn fact Peter said that I'm a I I that God is no respect or a person but we're all in the same boat you no matter how much knowledge we know where all the same boat with God\nBecause we habits did nature because we're we're born and stand because of Adam's then because we carry out and then ah our entire white we we are and have you been all that is that that none of us are the glory of God we were all in the same boat\nBut those demons seemed to be every where we're going to come back and take final calls in a moment on the coast to coast am\nGhost insiders the new version of the coast to coast am map is now available for I'm going to end now enjoyed for ... listen live we're on demand anywhere anytime good coast to coast am dot com and downloaded today [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\nOne of the most important midterm elections in recent memory was so much has\nElections do have consequences and whether it's a red wing Republican\nDemocrats have a shot take that back\nWe trust the demographics of the midterm election anything we need to get out there in\nTalking about it I just don't trust the last\nStimulating talk\nThe commercial airline industry is booming\nWith this level of demand the industry needs more aircraft technician we are the aviation Institute a maintenance and we trained tomorrow's technician the bureau of Labor Statistics reports the average aircraft technician in the DC area makes over sixty six thousand dollars a year\nVisit trained to mile dot com or call eight eight eight\n[noise]\n\nOr [noise]\nOr students I tell my\nLuck\nLoving\nSchool\nOne you run to see\nA only knew\nWasn't on\nWill show\nYou Jeff my\nLove so young\nNo\nTo talk to George ... called the wild card lined at eight one eight five zero one for one zero nine the first time caller lined is the one eight\nFive zero one for seven to one to talk to free from east of the Rockies called eight hundred eight to five vibes zero three three from west of the Rockies to recall eight hundred six one eight\nEight to ... to reach George\n... use they named George nine seven three one tree [noise] send Georgia Tech misogyny at eight one eight to nine eight seven six five to one is coast to coast am with George Nouri\nOpen lines next dollar here on coast to coast am and when we come back with Jeffrey she talked about demons we'll take your phone calls on coast to coast am\nBeyond belief that's our television program\nAnd you can watch it with the link we've got set up to our free free episode just go down to coast to coast am dot com at the bottom of the home page you'll see a little ... we're banner there for beyond belief dot com click that and have some fun watch that episode that I Hope you watch all of them we've been doing it for five years\nBeyond belief dot com stem cell technology doing wonders for the people's face\nTrips to the dermatologist can be expensive with that in mind Dr Nathan Newman designed to products from his vast knowledge of steps\nA research that is available without a doctor's prescription luminous uses stem cell technology not actual themselves placed into a serum for application to problem areas on the face and neck like fine lines wrinkles and bags under the eyes here's Dr Neumann to explain\nThe beginning we were using adult ... for burns and ... and wound healing these treatments we found the skin was getting much better in the laboratory we went and looked at how these cells tried to heal we found that they're using chemical language to get together and the chemical language\nIs once we've taken and put into lumina and products that we have purely the chemical language without the cells themselves\nLuminous is not available in stores but it is available from healthy looking dot com find genuine luminous products and especially the lumina serum with the highest concentration of Dr Neumann a P.

not and and negative spirits attack people least able to defend themselves which unfortunately is a great portion of the population and so they will attack people who have mental issues\nPhysical brain problems a depression anger issues unhappiness a overconfidence all sorts of things that are going on and so\nIt does happen and and we have to watch out for that and and so ah ah demonic spirits\nAre experts at reaching across that dividing line\nAnd being able to reach into the physical realm and affect people when the wind is right usually meaning that there is emotional energy in the atmosphere or a person is feeling weak they're not protecting themselves properly\nAnd they can reach across and damage a person physically and they can cause even something like that usually what happens is it's not so much of an immediate dug but actually\nWorking on them for a long time and they can cause physical injuries even happened to me once you know I I woke up\nOne morning I was getting dressed in my office\nMy girlfriend was asleep at the time\nAnd I was getting up and ready to work\nOut doing what I Do here and all of a sudden demonic spirit appeared behind me I knew it I could feel its power suddenly late shot out from it hit me right in the back and it caused me to have a centrally\nA pulled muscle I actually had to go you know get in my car and tried to the hospital and you know have looked at in a you know get some light medication for it because it the demonic spirit had pulled the muscle so it can happen to me and I'm good at protecting myself\nSo all the people out there who are not protecting themselves which is the you know most of the population of our planet are very susceptible to attack\nAnd it can be physical because demonic spirits study how to do these things the non physical universe haven't the other side whatever you want to call it which is a wonderful place but they also have dark romas that are negative\nVery negative what we might call help and and essentially that is very connected to the physical realm maybe the physical realm as something like the crust of the bread and heaven and the other side being the inside the bread itself which is much larger\nLet's go next to the gym in Portland, Oregon while we have some time here Jim go ahead\n... on my question is\nIt possible for one of these evil spirits to quit being evil or you know the\nTrip pan turtle I gotta go to the other side gets off\nDrugs so many psychics back in the Nineteen nineties asked me and said hey Jeffrey as long as you're doing extra citizens in teaching people how to protect themselves why don't you help the spirits and I said what I say no I Am not a spirit psychologist\nUh it's kind of like if somebody calls and your window and wants to see her still your stereo or worse you don't sit them down on the couch and say look we need to talk about while you steal things it's not my job you don't have time for spirits out\nThat actually are very good at trying to help negative spirits the monitor spirits are hopeless but the idea of negative spirit's just negative people who are dead and do it\nNegative things and trying to get them to look at themselves and see what they're doing but\nIt's not my job and people who hire me I work for them my job is to get those things out of their home get negative energy out of their home out of their bodies energy field I don't have time to do it and if they're not going to listen to me anyway\nThey're they don't have to there's going to go someplace else they're just not going to do that any more than a physical criminals going to sit there on the couch is good that he or she is going to get up and walk out the door back out the window I I just don't have the time\nI have to immediately focus on getting rid of the emotional energy and the person who's energy field of the average person\nNot everybody's everybody's disaster anything they just have negative energy issues and also getting if there is some kind of negative spirit attack but not necessarily living in the house they could just be going from house to house every night or apartment to apartment or ... or ... whatever and getting them out of their fast\nAnd making it work so the family or the individual to save this is my main concern not dealing with a negative spirit's there are\nMillions and millions of spirits out there you don't just sit on clouds or walk the streets of gold actually do things and one of the things they do is work for higher spirits and\nHelp other spirits look at themselves and stop doing what they're doing if they don't there are other measures that we can take\nJeffrey are you glad you have this ability disability to see demons to maybe even get removed them\nGeorge I am I was born with it and at first it was really scary 'cause when I reported it the teachers you know I'm seeing these spirits and you know I'm\nA mom for that get you know you know tell her when my grandmother my grandmother was going to call and you know two days and all this kind of stop at first it was real scary but actually I I started as I went along in my life I started and and I'm fifty nine now I started to remember doing these kind of things in past life helping people\nThat to me is the greatest gift um I could ever be given is the ability to help people it's dangerous work but the idea is that once I teach people how to protect themselves they can go off and and not be so susceptible they can go to work and not come home so dream\nAnd I bet they really appreciate you while they love it\nYou know and it it's just great to hear them say hey thanks Jeffrey but you know the real the real reward is feeling better that's what it's all about me\nSure is
