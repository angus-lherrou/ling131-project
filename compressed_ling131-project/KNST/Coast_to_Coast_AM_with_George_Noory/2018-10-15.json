{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KNST", "content": "Like on my news website over a coast to coast am on the street there there are a lose two papers on the right hand side\nThe current neighbor is the one that is on the town now with your uh analysis here minute it gets a little complicated a little technical\nBut the idea behind it is actually quite simple in an allegation which is is that some of the layers have a different sickness in stone and take us through bad\nYeah um when when you when you're standing in front of the pyramid and you look up the walls are you when you stand close you don't notice there's so much but when you go\nFurther away let's say you're in your hotel and you have a pyramid view you start noticing that there is a strict texture to the pyramid and I'm a review or a who was it was very well known a sharp drop your who don't we were my paper\nOr he calls the waves um and I call it sort of a federal effect\nUm and so when you look at the details of that which was published by plane as petri a hundred and fifty years ago who actually measured each individual course as a function of total height\nYou then you actually see the numbers and so there is these are you know you you start with really thick courses and as you get to the top of the courses get dinner but\nEvery once in a while there is a jump so you have a much thicker course and then the thickness tapers off and then it resumes the overall trend which is a thinning trend\nAnd then you have another sudden jump in sickness and just keeps on going and going for twenty three times as far as I'm as far as I see there's twenty three people like that\nUm and ah and then before each one of these jobs petri noted that uh if you calculate the surface area of course and you divide that surface area by the surface area at the base\nSome of these peaks how around fraction of twenty fifth so you know one twenty fifth to twenty two or three favorite so he found that there are round fractions of twenty fifth associated with some of these ... courses and that was it uh it was not for the interpreted what does it mean\nA it was just noted but uh it just sat there until I took a look at it again\nNow how many layers total and ... and the forty two story great government how many rows\nYeah two hundred three left and probably two hundred and\nAh originally\nTwo hundred and ten originally is there and I have\nTo have to immediately say there are some researchers who said the pyramid was not completed that was that they say that was there was a virtual top so it was actually ... at the top\nAnd the rest was a maybe a as fear and you know the one of the most prominent researchers proposes is Robert ... father John ... and the papers on I think it's on a Robert Duvall ths\nAcademia a page and it's also in cosmic womb uh his brother vote to upend the season the back of the book where he explains\nThis theory so there are some people that I think the pyramid was not coming to a peek a and of course other people say it was ... and so theoretically at least you can say two hundred ten courses\nNow we have is there a consistency to the uh repeating of that Ficre layers\nUm\nDoes it every ten steps is it every twelve is there some kind of ...\nNo I that's a great question I I that was the first thing also I was looking for it but unfortunately unfortunately no it's not that easy it's it's kind of what you know to me it's kind of haphazard has to be honest with you I I'm I was just struck me when I first saw that I was just struck why did they do this\nOr because you know you would you just you know simple in mind that I thought each step they were just a applied the ah the pyramid and go you know in Egyptian ... designed the appearance with something called they called they sit at which is the pyramid and go\nAnd it's a you know when you walk up a staircase basically for each amount that you go up you go a certain amount forward\nAnd that's how they conceptualize a pyramid and go so I thought you know each course it should be the same amount like you're going up a staircase each step is the same and and it's not and and uh and all of a sudden you know the steps gets much thicker\nAnd to your question again there's no regularity even to fat thickness so when you know it's it's completely off hazardous but of course now I think I Know the answer it has to do with the interior architecture it has to do with spaces inside\nAnd we'll get to that or after the break but what is most amazing to me about this is bad with the different layers of which there are\nA couple of dozen that earth decker\nYeah that the orientation for the pyramid that it still ended up at the right angle on all four sides yeah a to complete the pyramid correctly without any errors but that's an engineering feat that is just beyond comprehension yeah\nWhich which Jimmy I wanted to correct something I said in the shape to block interview I I think I said that a bill ... to ... um shot a shop to ... and ... published that al ... was disappearing or during\nThe twenty seventh century so I I wanted to correct that it was an arcade in a big dip her\nIt was a star Iraq\nSo it was starting to disappear in the southern part of the country and because of that because that constellation big tipper was so important to Egypt shows that the authors proposed that therefore they began to oriented oriented monuments to another part of the of\nThe big tipper and we are we why the pyramids ended up in that in the north south uh orientation\nI gotta jump in right there the coast to coast and we got to take a break my new is ... church we'll be right back stay with us\n[noise]\nGet Daily Show updates your inbox free will soon

[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n\n[noise] well\nCome back to the coast to coast am I going to church or get some money to save Saturday and we're talking about his paper that was published last week\nAnd again I Want everybody to go over and get the reference at my news website it is a chi opt pyramid dot com\nThe links are at coast to coast am and go to the right side scroll down there's a list of published papers right there we're talking about the top one now my new I Want to jump ahead and let everybody know in that PDF\nIf they scroll down to page three twenty six she has tried three hundred ... a a scrawled on page three twenty six where you have an illustration there\nOf the layers and with a kind of way showing the grand gallery and of course the kings chamber and the queens chamber the descending passage way\nAnd the ascending passage way up to the grand gallery and so working from the bottom the first layer up a which we're talking about a road number eight Seventeen Twenty one and of course thirty for\nThese must have been for you and I want you to take the audience through this but these are game changing moments when you see these alignment these layers weren't they\nThat was a game changing mole and you're right I'm I'm I'm listing all the peaks you know the total number of peaks was twenty three some of these peaks a or specifically noted by peach tree\nTo have surfaced a ratios that were around a number of fractions of twenty fifth so you know six twenty five twenty fifth\nAnd I'm a and those are also this that and it turns out that those courses that are associated with these round fractures tend to run\nA over feelings in a in that of course we don't have a lot of feelings but the few that we have there seems to be a coronation and thirty four is the most striking one it goes right across the queen a chamber\nAnd based on this ... this observation that it seems to be a correlation between round fraction twenty or you know courses that have a surface area that is around a number of facts of twenty fifth\nI Am proposing that the top part of the pyramid where we don't know of any spaces and work but where we nevertheless also see these type of round fractions of twenty fifth that there must be basis just to say there and I'm saying at least six if not then\nNow we're going to get to that exactly that's on page three twenty eight yeah but staying on page three twenty six with this cut away yet you need to have if you are going to propose these extra chambers above the kings chamber where there\nIs supposed to be nothing right but then you have to have some basis for this and clearly\nWe have a I I'm just looking at one two three four five six seven eight\nAbsolute definitive uh marks on these roads starting with the descending passage way all the way up to the top of the king's chamber\nRight so for example of course not a Twenty one which is a ... which has a surface\nThat is around fraction of twenty fifth of Nineteen twenty fifth that aligns with the uh the uh you know the ... that ah that guard the entry of the great pyramid show right that that cost on the Twenty one is right under the ...\nOr so in other words if a soldier with a feeling than the than the one that we just talked about is a course number thirty four also has a round fraction of twenty fifth sixteen in this case and it runs right over the feeling of the queen chamber\nUh then the other courses don't don't have round ... twenty fifth and they're not associated with feeling so it works out very nicely and then we go to the top and then we have eight a we have eight twenty fifth\nUh and that goes across the feeling of the um off the granted power\nUm now there are ... there are two courses nine twenty fifth and twenty fifth and those ... line up with a with a two of the relieving chambers in fact the tower\nUm and and then the final point I Want to make is that the possible avoid which I marked in here um that was found last year is also aligning with eight twenty fifth so it's possible that that causes marking not just that granted power but maybe also the possible avoid if it's for real\nWhich we are talking about a rose sixty eight\nA that would be a that would be row eighty four\nRoe eighty four is at the time\nHum of the king's chamber am I reading this correctly\nYeah you are it's not the top of the king chamber and that also happens to be um\nYou know within the resolution of this scanned that they were publishing that also is approximately the top of the book that the boys\nI got it yes yes of\nCourse we don't know exactly we just it's kind of have the image so I just kind of like you know paint that that into this illustrations just to give a rough guide\nI Want to jump back a really quick I don't want this to get away from me there was a tweet earlier that is a pretty important and this is from eddy\nYeah and and he says does ah does my new see any connection between a dynastic Egypt shouldn't use of the lion and the use of the lion and go back to lead tabby\nAnd everybody's talking about go Beckley tabby today and its relationship with ... and the great pyramid and and the other things thrown dynastic Egypt is there a connection\nYeah that's a fantastic question um and I am actually I'm I'm currently looking into that uh with Robert shark we are um we're trying and but I'm not ready to make a statement yet\nOkay but the the use of the line and see this is what I find fascinating when we go back on these dates\nAnd weak constantly land and ten thousand five hundred BC for a variety of reasons one of course uh what was going on with the stars we understand that but then we have all of the uh cataclysmic events at the end of the ice age the construction of Beckley tabby\nThe erosion on this thing's all of these things are Leo Rising right all of these things happen at ten thousand five hundred BC yet which makes go Beckley taffy not an accident\nNo within references of course uh with the lines too as well extraordinary\nYeah no absolutely it's a fantastic question and I don't want to you know jump the gun because I Can't really speak with authority yet I'm so maybe the next show um maybe we'll have something more but it's a great question\nLet's go to a um I'm gonna get to the top half of the pyramid and we're going to work on that in a second but got some calls that have been holding for quite a while to speak with you my new let's go to Barry in South Carolina Barry welcome back to coast\nHello there ... and you know what I'm getting ready to say yeah man\nYeah go ahead Barry it's yours\nGo back great Cathy\nYou like that do you like to the area [laughter] okay I\n... I Love hearing is that all that you may have roared do you play so great for me to have the power\nAnd thank you bury what do you have for a minute tonight\nOh I've got two questions and then I've got a great little short clean quick joke about their armored collar just at the end\nExcellent question and I'm just going to give you a quick answer as quick as I can so um as far as we understand the Egyptian language originally was a composite of two different cultures the one culture was a southern Egyptian culture\nAnd that script was mostly phonetic 'em and evidence from that comes from ... a king Scorpio\nAnd that is I think were the African roots lie\n... other script a that was intermingled initially comes from northern Egypt uh probably from Bhutto\nBhutto was a sort of a trading a settlement in in the delta and they were trading with ah probably mess up with the live on and so they had a different kind of script that was mostly a big Charles so it was ...\nUm so what you saw what it meant while in the south what you hear is what it meant and so I think your question is very well taken and I think yes I think the uh the southern Egyptians script was probably a originally Africa maybe you do with the hair or maybe I'm maybe even further south\nAnd she brought up another really good point uh before we get to the break we've got about thirty seconds\nOr ... the Greeks adapting a ... G A chemistry coming from candidate right\nYes the issue I think she mentioned it stinks oh my yeah we we think that speaks was making before uh before Africa and I think it was we were thinking of the lioness and her name was ... and by the way that's also probably an African of Africa or Joe\nLet's take a break right here coast to coast am it's all Great Pyramid all Egypt all night long or guessing I my new saved side day his paper is right there click on his website the coast to coast am we're going to discuss the rest of it after the break stay with us [noise]\n\nFind out more about tonight's gifts to log on to ... am dot com\n[noise]\nEven in the uh the um [noise] I mean\nNone of them and\n\nThen they you know blown away [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] many\nComing in the rain in the gym\nIn the\nMorning when he more hours may contain diverging convenience\nDry hundred percent for what you say I'm Sorry I only have to our listeners century is in ...

Thomas Manu\nJeremy thank you for taking my call Manu ... search you know my question as we have the supply town and the pyramids the banks have there been any\nIntention to reconstruct the original pouring a key supply town and I know that sounds radical\nBut for example the great pyramid is missing the capstone\nAnd it just seems to me that\nYou could bring in architects archaeologist perhaps what specialties sub remote viewing into an intuition and actually\nReconstruct temples repair the temples half that's been discussed\nYes and as as a great question I'm so there's two answers to that the first one is that uh the minister of antiquities is trying to partially restored a monument so you get a feel for what it may have looked\n'em but they don't want to cover it up all with you know modern reconstruction they just want to give you a sort of an idea so they may may they may do a section and then they leave the rest on touched\nSo that's the first part of your question but there's something even more exciting going on and I have to reference a a Harvard uh it's called digital visa and what they're doing and this is on the direction of Peter or my new alien um\nThey are basically recreating gives a a a ... in the in the virtual world and I predict\nIn a few years you'll be able to\nUh descend into a virtual world and it will be exactly like the way it looked or the the way we think it looked and you'd be able to go into all the chamber's look at the inscriptions and it'll feel like you know uh the real thing and I they're working on it\nNow with these additional chambers in the upper half of the great pyramid I where did you come up with the number six or eight\nWhite so because we have we have a sequence of ah courses that conform to this uh you know the the simple rules at the surface area is around fraction of twenty fifth\nAnd so and I am pretty convinced that they that the architect wouldn't just waste I'm you know energy to create these sticker courses unless there is a purpose for it so for every single of course that has a round fraction of twenty fifth I think there is a space associated with that\nMore and more phone call before the break let's go to school out west to Daniel in eureka California Daniel you're next on coast\nHi um I had a quick question about the\nUh selling he'll watch uh I've heard him many times interviewed on coast to coast over the years and yes apparently he controlled and very closely guarded access to researchers in the public or or to the pyramids in for research and just general public access\nAnd I had heard that after the um spring Arab Spring uprising or he resigned\nWhat is your access like now with the new minister and our researchers are given better access for research in the general public and I'll take my answer off the air\nGreat question Daniel minute what's it like there now with that I saw you\nRegarding Dr hot so first of all I had a few email exchanges with him and he's been always very nice very courteous in as as the questions and so I've had good experiences with him I've never met in person than he probably doesn't know why I'm I'm regarding getting a permit so we are currently applying for\nFrom it um for a small study Robert Robert truck and I are on and I think I'm so I'm hearing mixed messages on the one hand it's also like investigators are being invited to come\nOn and on the other hand I'm hearing is that the uh they've become more selective so you know it probably depends on the project they have certain areas where they want research to happen and other areas they feel like it's a it's been exhausted\nUm you know so it's really in their hands and stuff and you can do about it other than you just try it and what they do\nWell do you think that the the ... one research would be ongoing like it is it because I have watched was ah still the director there\nI think he is actually involved a Jimmy he's on the he sits on the on the uh the board of directors that reviews the data\nSo he is involved or at least not maybe not publicly but behind the scenes he's involved they occupied by a if you put\n'em you know I think there's sort of a mixed\nBack here you know there is the public's eye your boss who you know comes on TV and gives announcements and then there's the the scientist you archaeologist who loves what he does um you know it's difficult to kind of what it all out but\nI think um you know they they have to strike a balance between protecting the monuments and allowing people to research them and I to be honest with you I understand it and you know some of the projects\nThat uh you know you want to do you can't do them because it might destroy the monument so I'm\nWell you're being you're being shaped him political right now and I understand that might do it and I respect that yeah but there's the other part of this where we have been told for so long if there is nothing to discover there\nAnd that they have not moved from match dance and now it looks like it's going completely in the opposite direction that is why are they gonna have to open right now are they going to have to back pedal\nYeah so it to the to the listeners question I think I forgot that goes down you I think right yes\nUm yeah so I think what you you said because they love and so I think that has something has changed a sort of a you know people are even each opposes that talked to some of some of the scholars there the local scholars they feel like you know they have more of a voice that can you know\nA fait or they can research and I think it's been I think it's been good for the country and I think it's\nGood let me jump in right there I knew I got to take a quick network break this was coast to coast am more

California my new uh the bones have been amazing you ready to a head straight back to it let's do it let's go to speaking of Southern California let's go to it's good to Monique right here in someone right up the street Monique\nAnd some other features that the basic features that we know about the great pyramid you can find them in the ... in the dimensions of the ... of him you know\nAnd you know we don't have time to get into it today but the papers on my website Go check it out and tell me what you think that I think the answer the question is yes I think is the world's first example of an architect using his own to him as a blueprint for monuments\nAnd thank you for the call Joe and that paper is underneath the latest papers the second one listed over on my news website\nAnd one last question from Twitter before we had to the break this is from dino and do you notice is are there any other pyramid in central and South America that carried the same traits as the ...\nTraits meeting that's just what it says in the winter we don't know yeah um\nI I assume there would be a couple of things I Do know is referencing your one would be size in orientation or to true north and may be uh something astrological\nAh within the alignment\nWell let me let me put it this way so I think I you know I've I've watched this documentary or which is intriguing they're basically saying is that all these monuments are lining up a across the globe and I find that fascinating I and I don't know how to explain it\nIf that is true that would definitely suggest that master plan that you know people were coordinating this this this is building activity and of course that's what Graham Hancock\nOr has been writing about four years and uh so I I think it's possible yes but just specifically some other trades I I Can't really comment because I don't know enough about it\nWell let me help you with this idea\nWhen we look at the the tops of the the the pyramid in Mexico in Mexico city and the mind structures throughout Guatemala and Honduras 'em and believes that the tops of these pyramids there's always something there\nWhat about the top of the great pyramid is would do not not the top top ... there'll be chamber\nOr something and the and the upper levels\nYet as well I think so I think that could be that they could be a space uh that I'm connects that connected to the summit\nEr and of course the summit itself I'm you know like I said before John a\nDrop off ... vow has provoked pose that the summit of the great pyramid was not at peak was basically a virtual top and a and it would have been a you know as fear and it's interesting that the diameter of that fear is a meter\nOr it's a very interesting a very interesting theory a and others have proposed similar things\nThere's even a hero cliff I think I'm\nA this was the first mentioned by a state Jeannie in a night in the Nineteen Seventy one book by Peter Tompkins that there was this fear on top of the great pyramid so not if you're a media and by the sphere so yes I I think I think those theories out there I but I don't know how you would otherwise prove it I'm\nNo you've got to anomalies in a and one is clearly defined and row one Ninety six and do you do have a ratio there could there be a chamber at the very top\nI I think so\nHow big would it be\nI'm looking at those upper rose or the dimensions of the pyramid at that high um how big a chamber be\nI think a chamber like that would be\nMaybe no more than five feet something like that five feet by age and height I'm saying right or maybe maybe a five six courses or something like that\nUm and they would be it would be difficult to detect it may be on a on the ... and especially if you have a grand gallery in between which you know the last year ... was from the queen chamber so I think in order to protect these spaces you'd have to put the place up in a in the uh in the or the chamber of that's off limits right\nNow yeah and how would you how would you detect more than one chamber will the new one scan show multiple chambers that were stacked up on top of each other\nYeah maybe not if they're stocked up maybe not but ah they might not be stocked up um they could be you know like the one for example I mentioned that uh Rudolph guns and bring a is suspecting that will be a chamber that's in the southern part of the pyramid maybe close to the face\nYou know so they may not be stocked up I'm a one way you could do a Jimmy is by putting the plates into that knowledge that we talked about you know the one that ah who Donnan buyer investigated it up on the south it's on the north east side\nYou know the north east corner right in the\nNorth east corner it's a fairly sizable states you know I mean I I don't know how big the plates are but I Wonder if you could set up the place up there and then you might be able to actually ... different chambers they made it might be possible\nHow expensive is it to perform these ... studies\nIt seemed like it wouldn't be that expensive because you're just placing the the wage throughout the pyramid and then of course running a computer system it's not like there was any ads excavations or right right it's not that expensive but\nYeah they have I think they've already spent the main capitals already spent basically uh you know making the plates\nAnd then you know that you have to pay the people to do the experiment I'm guessing multiple a million dollars I think maybe ten ten million or something like that to do this project I'm a and most of that money has maybe already been spent and now like you were saying you know and now it's just you know you just to repeat studies\nUm but I I think if you do any kind of invasive a project or and a project like this you're spending several million dollars a which if we want to go back to the things and ... that's a kind of money that will need for a project like that\nThis is coast to

I'm I'm Sorry it was the question again he's he's asking if the pyramid is actually the tip of the iceberg ah\nOkay that's a great question so um I you know one way to marry the the the theory of a lot civilizations starting something in ... and then the old kingdom are Egyptians of a building on top of it is basically\nTo draw the line exactly where you are asking a Michael I think micro is your name right yes\nSo um yeah so I think ... and in fact when even when you look on a on the pyramid itself on the on the north east corner I I was there just a few weeks ago and you know what that is that walk\nThat's not humor in stone that is actually the original hill that was there and it was molded to sort of\nYou know allow for stores to be placed on it but you're looking at something that was there before the pyramid was built\nAnd so it is possible that there was some structure there before and in fact Robert Duvall has it insinuate it is that he things that maybe there were shrines on the in the three locations and they were lying to you know the bell stars of uh Ryan a dating to zip peppy\nAnd then you know in the old kingdom are Egyptians came they basically built their pyramids on top of the shrines\nAnd so I end the softer so what's under the pyramid also you know the subterranean chamber from the looks of it it looks much older and when you walk into the ... ah you walk\nTo the what's called the king chamber there was also a you feel like you are you are basically in a to phase monument like there was something there before and then the pyramid was built on top so it's an excellent question I'm moving it is a little bit difficult of course but it's definitely be something that's\nThank you so much my new or just an absolutely perfect fascinating conversation tonight Iran coast yeah I loved\nIt so much to me we've got a twenty seconds left what's next for you\n[noise] um [noise] what are your ... one of your listeners exactly the right question about the connection between quickly tippy end in Egypt and that's that's what the\n... there's no doubt that there is a connection I there's a seven thousand year gap in there and we're going to fill it in and with your help thank you so much my new they safe out there\nWhat a conversation tonight this was one coast to coast is all about for me is being able to come in here and discussed my favorite thing which is lost history and each of course time travel ghost UFOs all of that stuff counts too but for me it is Egypt and loss history\nAnd with that I got to get out of here\nSo I'll see everybody here in a couple of weeks but before I Do that I've got to think Nathan for running the board of course Donald behind the glass Chris for being the producer for me here lecture Greg Jim leads to step in the George and my beautiful wife Rita\nWith that I Am your host Jimmy church spent coast to coast am I'm signing off go back to sleep Chappy\n[noise] and now the hard radio we can sport time capsule\nSports fans of Sandy West and I'm here to take you on a journey back to this week in sports history start off back in Nineteen twenty three for the New York Yankees when they're first world series beating the New York giants four games to to to de de ... won the world series twenty seven times the next closest team the St Louis cardinals\nClose to the store\nWith eleven is weak in Nineteen thirty three the Philadelphia Eagles play their first NFL game and lose the New York giants he sticks to nothing since then they've met hundreds of Seventy three times in New York leading the rivalry eighty six eighty\nFive and two ties including last week when by the eagles this week in Nineteen eighty three to Chicago Blackhawks in Toronto maple leafs combined says a fascist five goals in NHL history eighty four second week in Nineteen eighty eight and one of the most dramatic moments in baseball history with two outs in the\nBottom of the night and injured Kirk Gibson it's a dramatic to run home run to give the Dodgers five were when in the first game of the eighty fifth world series\nThis week in Nineteen eighty nine during a game against his old team the editing Oilers hockey greats Wayne Gretzky break greenhouse national\n... nations the entire archive of thirty for thirty\nThis audio is for your review and not for broadcast Internet posting or distribution of others he's a ... copy of the air quality urgent on his property by our media Washington DC\nOptimal helps introducing new Medicaid claims of Virginia and helping you get the most from your Medicaid benefits were more likely to go family care dot com that's go family care dot com will call a three three four six seven eight to five nine for Medicaid plans from up to my health\n\nFrom the region will studio you're a little bit of sharing reason well darn calm is just the other night and I are radio station [noise]\nTensions continue between the U.S in Saudi Arabia ...

talking about the inventory still in the dreams DOMA right before the break and I want to get back to the dream Stella briefly before we started to move forward and in the dream still up a ... most of the forum\nSays mentions and in illustrates two things is there and desert Fox just tweeted is there a second speaks well there's two things is there\nThe pay for that minute published last week is on his website we're going to be discussing this uh tonight on the show\nLike on my news website over a coast to coast to I'm going to take history there there are a list of papers on the right hand side\nThe current paper is the one that is on the top now with your uh analysis here minute it gets a little\nComplicated a little technical but the idea behind it is actually quite simple in an allegation which is is that some of the layers have a different thickness in stone and take us through bad\nYeah um when when you when you're standing in front of the pyramid and you look up the walls are you when you stand close you don't notice there's so much but when you go further away let's say you're in your hotel and you have a pyramid view\nYou start noticing that there is a certain texture to the pyramid and um ah the review or a who was it was very well known a job for a job here who don't we were my paper\nOr he calls the waves and I call it sort of a federal effect\nUm and so when you look at the details of that which was published by sitting as petri a hundred and fifty years ago who actually measured each individual course as a function of total height\nYou then you actually see the numbers and so there is these uh you know you you start with really thick courses\nAnd as you get to the top of the courses get thinner but every once in a while there is a jump so uh you have a much thicker course and then the thickness tapers off and then it resumes the overall trend which is a thinning trend\nAnd then you have another sudden jump in sickness and just keeps on going and going for twenty three times as far as I'm as far as I see there's ... peaks like that\nUm and ah and then before each one of these jobs petri noted that uh if you calculate the surface area of course and you divide that surface area by the surface area at the base\nSome of these peaks have rounds fraction of twenty fifth so you know one twenty fifth to ... so you found that there are round fractions of twenty fifth associated with some of these creepy courses\nAnd that was it uh it was not supposed to interpret it what does it mean a it was just noted but uh it just sat there um until I took a look at it again\nNow how many layers total and ... and the forty two story great German how many rows\nYeah two hundred three left and probably two hundred ten\nUh originally\nTwo hundred and ten originally is there and I have to have to immediately say there are some researchers who say the\nPyramid was not completed there was a they say that was there was a virtual top so it was actually ... at the top\nAnd the rest was a maybe a as fear and you know the one of the the most prominent researchers proposes is a Robert ... father John ... and the papers on I think it's on a Robert Duvall ths or\nAcademia a page and it's also in cause me gloom uh his brother vote to attend these he's in the back of the book where he explains\nThis theory so there are some people that I think the pyramid was not coming to a peek a and of course other people say it was ... and so theoretically at least you can say two hundred and ten courses\nNow we have is there a consistency to the uh repeating of the sticker layers\nUm\nDoes it every ten steps is in every ... there's some kind of ... you\nKnow that's a great question I I that was the first thing also I was looking for it but unfortunately I unfortunately no it's not that easy it's it's kind of you know Jimmy it's kind of haphazard has to be honest with you I\nI'm I was just struck when I first saw that I was just struck why did they do this\nOr because you know you were you could just you know simple in mind that I thought each step they were just a applied the ah the pyramid and go you know in Egyptian the Egyptians designed their appearance with uh something called they called they set that which is the purely to angle\nAnd it's a you know when you walk up a staircase basically for each amount that you go up you go a certain amount forward\nAnd that's how they could ... a pyramid and go so I thought you know each course it should be the same amount like you're going up a staircase each step is the same and and it's not and and ah and all of a sudden you know the steps gets much thicker\nAnd to your question again there's low regularity even to fat thickness so when you know it's it's completely half how's it is but of course\nNow I think I Know the answer it has to do with the interior architecture it has to do with spaces inside\nAnd we'll get to that uh after the break but what is the most amazing to me about this is that with the different layers of which there are\nA couple of dozen than earth decker yeah that the orientation for the pyramid that it still ended up at the right angle on all four sides yeah a to complete the pyramid correctly without\nAny errors but that's an engineering feat that is just beyond comprehension yeah\nWhich which Jimmy I Want it to correct something I said in a state to block interview I I think I said that uh the ... to ... um shot a shop to ... and ... published that al ... was disappearing or during\nThe twenty seventh century so I I wanted to correct that it was an arcade in a big dip her\nIt was a star Iraq\nSo it was starting to disappear in the southern part of the country and because of that because that constellation\nIt was so important to trip shows the authors propose that therefore they began to oriented oriented monuments to another part of the of the ... the pyramid ended up in the north Korean\nI got to jump in right

any spaces\nAnd war but where we nevertheless also see these type of round fractions of twenty fifth that there must be space is just the same up there and I'm saying at least six if not then\nNow we're going to get to that exactly that's on page three twenty eight yeah but staying on page three twenty six with this cut away yes you need to have if you are going to propose these extra chambers above the kings chamber where there\nIs supposed to be nothing right but then you have to have some basis for this and clearly we have a I I'm just looking here one two three four five six seven eight\nAbsolute definitive uh marks on these roads starting with the descending passage way all the way up to the top of the king's chamber\nRight so for example of course not a Twenty one which is a it it that does which has a surface\nArea that is around fraction of twenty fifth of Nineteen twenty fifth that aligns with the uh the uh you know the ... that ah that guard the entry of to the great pyramid show right that that cost on the Twenty one is right under the V.\nOr so it is in other words if a soldier where they're feeling than the than the one that we just talked about is a course number thirty four also it has a round fraction of twenty fifth sixteen in this case and it runs right over the ceiling of the queen chamber\nUh then the other courses don't don't have round fracture the twenty fifth and they're not associated with ceilings so it works out very nicely and then we go to the top and then we have eight a we have eight twenty fifth\nOr and that goes across the ceiling of the um off the ground at tower\nI'm now there are there are two courses nine twenty fifth and ten twenty fifth and those ... line up with a with a two of the relieving chambers in fact that the tower\nUm and and then the final point I wanted to make is that the possible avoid which I marked in here um that was found last year is also aligning with eight twenty fifth so it's possible that that causes marking not just that granted power but maybe also the possible avoid if it's for real\nWhich we are talking about a rose sixty eight\nA that would be a that would be will eighty four\nNo role eighty four is at the top of the king's chamber am I reading this correctly\nYeah you are it's not the top of the king chamber and that also happens to be a you know within the resolution of this scanned that they were publishing that also is approximately the top of the book the big boys\nI got it yeah yeah of\nCourse we don't know exactly we we just it's kind of have the image so I just kind of like you know painted that into this illustrations just to give a raft guide\nI Want to jump back a really quick I don't want this to get away from me there was a tweet earlier\nIs a pretty important and this is from ...\nYeah and and he says does ah does my new see any connection between a dynastic he'd you shouldn't use of the lion and the use of the lion and go back ... taffy\nAnd everybody's talking about go Beckley tabby today and its relationship with ... and the great pyramid and and the other things thrown dynastic Egypt\nThere a connection yeah that's a fantastic question um and I am actually I'm I'm currently looking into that uh with Robert shark we are um we're trying but I'm not ready to make a statement yet\nOkay but the the use of the lion see this is what I find fascinating when we go back on these dates\nAnd we constantly land at ten thousand five hundred BC for a variety of reasons one of course uh what was going on with the stars we understand that but then we have all of the cataclysmic events the end of the ice age the construction of Beckley tabby\nThe erosion on this thing's all of these things and Leo Rising right all of these things happen at ten thousand five hundred BC yet which makes go Beckley tabby not an accident\nNo within references of course wouldn't winds too as well extraordinary\nYeah no absolutely not it's a fantastic question and I don't want to you know jump the gun because I Can't really speak with authority yet I'm so maybe the next show um maybe we'll have something more but it's a great question\nLet's go to a um I'm gonna get to the top half of the pyramid and we're going to work on that in a second but got some calls that have been holding for quite a while to speak with you my new let's go to Barry in South

Kush language which is of course ... ... to ... years ago or ... or ... as the you know we're talking about a quarter of the way it was for ... years ago\nIt's been ... older than any other language you can put a little bowl opponent show ... which was of people who is just big law it's a cush people still you know Richard ... bag loan which are from the coach\nWhich is do you think like\n... is a bit of a little late it was a little people of all the pilot or\nThey ... they will know height or some way or the world\nI'm going to I'm going to pass that up to my new I actually have a couple of comments about that Isaac and and thanks for the phone call a\nMinute the origins of the word pharaoh and its meaning\nYeah I I couldn't buy some thanks for interpret I couldn't hear the whole question I I'm ... so so he chipped colleges are things that are in the old kingdom a that term was not use\nSo that term pharaoh it's technically speaking doesn't apply to the kings of the old king them I think the first uh I'm I and I can't remember if it's middle kingdom new kingdom when\nYou start using that term uh and that probably means that when it first appeared\nAnd that's all I Know about it offhand I said what I've read about this before but I don't want to say something wrong so I I this is what I remember\nRight in that there's two two points that need to be brought out here uh when we were ... going back to um men as a um and in the first and now I'm going to say the word they were referred to as kings\nYeah right right\nLike in armor and meant is uh the first ah kings of Egypt could be some are saying that the the same a menace unarm are may be the same or they could be two different teams they weren't called pharaohs back then\nRight and now there's another ah ah\nI have research that is a little bit and I find it fascinating that the Kurdish people were the original Egyptians and then the Egyptian that are there now I'm more more workers or possibly even slaves to the Kurdish people\nYeah um yeah I Can't really comment on it 'cause I don't know enough about it um I I have regarding what the king was called I can tell you that uh\nBy the fifth dynasty the king had five different titles um and then the very beginning um you know the kings were called horse kings so it was horse armor\nAnd hors ... so uh so that that was the first that was the first title and then quickly after a campaign you know the designation\nA net some vets which is basically referring to operate or Egypt\nAnd then came to to lady's name a you know and then came to cartoonish name later um but uh the as you just set yourself so Farrow came later I I just looked it up if I was like ... he is the first time it with you\nThere you go let's go east of the Rockies us go to Jay out here in Los Angeles and Jay you're up next on coast\n[noise] [noise] hello hello J. lo J.\nYou guys doing I don't know how high is there a first time caller long time long time listener\nI'm I Am actually um eat chips and I'm On my mom's side and I'm growing up as a kid I Would always hear my grandma or at least they\nTell me a lot of stories that there was always passages from here there there's always secrets or the um\nThe great pyramid has secrets that there's\nTunnels here of their you know there's always stories that Graham you know grandkids hear their a grandparents' day the woman always stuck with me that I ... really\nTo get clarification on I've seen stuff like on line but\nI Try to take it with a grain of salt\nUm I really am glad that you're on the show a ... I really wanted to ask you for your um [noise] uh expertise on this if you guys have ever heard is there an opening\nOr any access behind this ... year old on top of their head or anywhere along in

[noise]\nWe are not being told 'em all the details of have you have you guys heard any anything like that\nWill shape you're in luck because [laughter] man who's been researching some ... paper about it so I'm going to it now my new before we get to what's underneath the the on the left to front the love from palm\nThere has been photographs of the top of this being tried in the ground up or what appears to be a hat your whole life and I have also read a lot of research about uh the right\nHere uh an entrance behind the right ear that Jay is referencing year she was talking about uh the head of this being spurs and possible entrances\nYes so there is that there is a space or in inside the head of the things and it's been a basically locked up there's a there's a little hatch\nAnd I'm I'm I think Roberts ah ... was telling me about this I think ah you can there's you can't stand in there it's maybe six foot deep\nI'm but I'm not sure it goes anywhere I from my understanding is it's basically a blind LBJ but um but you know maybe there's some maybe there is a a hatch hiding somewhere but I don't know about that\nUm I can tell you that the uh you know the ... um they have a ... of course they have an extensive labyrinth\nCharted under this beings are and this was published in the thirties by a a chronic a person that was chronicling the quote was a crucial\nAnd he has a chart that shows all of that but you know to my knowledge there is no physical proof of it\nUm there is a a there's another blind pouch in the back of the things I'm One of them was caused by um you know by early researchers that were basically trying to force themselves are into this things and looking for chambers\nLooking at the idea of a Greek scare the architect from all the tremendous job trends super big John talking but tempers a farming old knowledge building big golf ... structures\nUh who's to say I mean it'd be good to you know I guess people in the ... the ah periods are solid because you know maybe just where you say is structured spaces be actually filled with ...\nOr the rocks\nAnd everything you know arches inside because but he's like a temple\nYeah Rob go look at a news research paper on his website and and read through it that to jak lead the conclusions are that my new is presenting in this paper my new we mentioned already six to eight and boy could there be more\nYeah so I I have to you know I've been I Need I have to mention shop you know so he of course proposed an internal ramp years ago um I think it was Eighteen years ago with Bob Brier they published a book\nAnd he proposed this is the the ... basis basically to get the stones up the pyramid and this can from last year didn't show it but I think the theory is that I think it's possible that the scandal was not sensitive enough to detect those spaces\nAnd then of course I'm proposing that this that there are spaces that are not necessarily logistic I think that could be illogical and chop you're dealt with probably disagree with me\nOr you know you're you're the paper a but he still thinks it's possible that there are logistical spaces in it but you know beat out of it may so we agree there are probably space is up there\nAnd um I just want to ask you a quick uh because the pyramid of course who it's it's it's hot spaces inside research in the sixties went to Congress pyramid because they thought it can how can it be that we have all these spaces inside you know corporate pyramid buddy ... all we have is bills only chamber\nWell let me jump in I've got to take a break
