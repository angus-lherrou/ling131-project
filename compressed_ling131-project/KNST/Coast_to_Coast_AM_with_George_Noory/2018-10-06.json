could see and talk to earth and spirits the problem is most babies\nAnd children can which she didn't realize that when I was four she started taking me to funerals so that I could talk to the relative that\nDied and Italian\n[noise] ... everybody's related somehow and so you know I was Graham a special granddaughter they could come in and talk to the dead the only thing and I was never scary to me I mean the person was just standing there and yeah I could see his body and the gasket\nBut he was fun and he was talking to me and I you know there was no question but would ask the question\nOr the relative would ask the question what they want her to know and I did not have to repeat it because the ghost heard it but they would just give me the answer and then I Would tell whoever asked the question the thing that scared me George and all of this was\nI'm definitely old enough but that back in the day they had way ... these\nYoung did they did hire people who cried and everything else\nOh and carried on they did everything but wrong the floor that scared that it'd be ... to me it wasn't the dead person as the live person 'cause I never understood I thought they were sick I didn't know what was wrong\nWith them [laughter] did you perfect your skills as you brushed or did the did you always happen like that\n[noise] no I think than the older I got the easier of course it was I think the more you do anything the easier it is and then in ... even though I've done this for so long I still learn stuff all the time and\nBy so it it improves every time I I really believe that it does it takes me about three seconds now to open a white light make a big enough for somebody to walk through\nI can keep it open fairly long if I'm doing a place like a hospital or an airport or restaurant where there are ten Fifteen twenty goes waiting to cross over\nThe county morgue um gosh there was all kinds in there and I just have I learned how to keep it open long enough\nAnd it was it was a learning thing you had to learn how to do this\nAnd it was trial and error because I really couldn't ask anybody about it and as crazy as this sounds our youngest daughter terror can do this\nAnd that she doesn't do it my way because she does not want to see the people in our eyes she just wants to hear them so everybody does it differently I think everybody has the ability it's how you develop it and how you use it\nEvery time I've talked to you you been a speech about everything you do have you ever been scared to death with something that is\n[noise] I ... this past year has been unusual and um I was afraid of one thing oh maybe twenty five\nThirty years ago that happened a a ghost actually flipped and a red handled acts in front of my face and and I wouldn't go into\nHouses if I thought a ghost can kill me I Am certainly not stupid but I remember I was in the garage and that acts hit the concrete floor and slid into a fiberglass garage door you had no idea how loud that was when it hit\nAnd it was the three steps into the house from the attach garage and I remember sitting on the top sitting down and going maryann what are you doing here [noise]\nAnd then it dawned on me knock it off because all I'm going to do is give them more energy\nI Can't walk into a house and be afraid because that's what they don't eat they don't sleep they need human energy I'm not going to feed them and I ... and the bottom line is your dead nominal live I've got a step over you bud\nAnd you know I Can't grab throw you into the light it's still free will\nBut you're gonna leave this house one way or the other and now that I'm older you know when I was fourteen Twenty one twenty five telling a fifty five five Seventy five year old man this is look at me and go sure girlie\nNot so much anymore now can I tell them to do something they usually listen at a usually older than all of\nThem have you ever okay have you ever come across from around the double\n[noise] I think that I have seen him maybe three times or ones that were so evil that they had come from the black cool yeah and I if I ever run across that situation now I really\nTry to protect the family the best that I can and I actually get a hold of a religious person somebody that has more training in that field and me\nTo try to get rid of the devil or the demon or whatever it might be\nExactly that's exactly right and there are people that their their team and now just ... it can take care of that more power to him\nYou don't perform exercises and things like that have\nYou I Do not I people have had um possession where I had done that and I actually stopped doing that because every time I Would do a possession\nI Would end up leading somewhere I Would get scratch or or looked like a\nGE or something and it's like oh no no no no no no no don't have to do this anymore and that again something that I Would refer to in order to increase\n\n\n\n\nAnd welcome back Marion when ... was it was very young when you were the consultant to the Gulf shores for television show did you have to step in and go no no no that's not how it's done\nI did that every week\nAnd I sit there on friday night and watch it and they do it anyway you know it's like\nOh my gosh and then people would call me and they'd say why did you let them do that if like\nI did they did it on there and they knew better right of course\nThey will love would call me up to date because she always got her her script\nYou know like three days before the new one right\nWhen she was good with you she liked to you\nYeah and she would call me up and she'd go you should see what the haven't made\nYou know I don't know but yeah no and she she knew that it was the first half hour was usually over the top the second half hour\nThey seem to bring it back down a little bit but it got the information out there even if it wasn't as hokey as they made a\nNew to Dr James van Prague nuts\n[noise] well no because he couldn't see the ones that they were filming what do you mean talking about why not look so we're about beer is like the ones I owe\nSo no he was a consultant on the show to are also but he didn't uh but he really couldn't help set the stage because he really didn't know exactly what the heck they were going to do it's like when we were in one of the studios I Know\nWe're doing a um [noise] a something for one of the talking head magazines I don't know which one it was and we came around the corner and there was a a myth barber stand with standing there\n[noise] and I I looked at her and I my mind went totally blank all I could remember was Victoria ... from the ... valley\nExactly and what she was classic actually\nAll while she was a little whip up I think she was so tiny and so and I'm I'm starring because it's like oh my gosh and uh and\nShe was there around and she was so disgusted the way the movies were being made now the way the studios were acting and she says none of this would have been allowed in James the the mistake of one of the cameraman said who\nIs that in James Mates mistake of saying some old time movie actor oh no oh yeah\nYou know better than that of\nCourse he did but I think he was just let's get this you know let's keep going I literally I I had to talk her into letting me make the white light and go into it\nAnd I she says I got to keep things going here and I said and how's that going for you is anybody listening to you and she just looked at me and I says and how many people have you talked to since you've been dead\nAnd she just looked at me I said you have no idea how much better you could do if you went into the light\nAnd she said huh and I said have you talked to other people live people she said\nNo and I said so do you think I'm telling you the truth she said yeah go ahead and make it she says I'll go but\nYou show up and talk about it and she went in the light so [noise] I Hope that one of the people that when I get up there she screams\nYou remember that movie pulled guys in the the little ... little lady\nKept showing little I don't go home I won't want why did she say that\nI don't know I I had no idea I\nThought that the ... or tricked or something some strange way to get changed her personality\nI Know they they turned it on a dime I didn't understand why they did it it's like\nWhen go with ... with being shocked for somebody to buy it out there in LA and uh the person that would take me around took me to this this house of a couple of producers that had a goat in their house and sell\nIt turned out that they knew who the goat was which is actually sort of unusual because usually the person doesn't know they don't go right and so and I guess he thought it was really important he says to me while I was\nPerson on the ... whore house he says and and uh and I helped you know we work on that and I looked at him and I thought this when did my eyes at him and I said boy do I have a bone to pick with you and he looked\nAt me I says why did you put flies in the attic what did that have to do with anything\nAnd he said we had Fifteen seconds to kill\nI said well I have nothing to do was go I you needed to exterminate or not a gold person I says why did you even do that it it's like people just do things that they think it's going to be scary or it should be part of it I don't know where they come up with this stuff\nIs a dangerous Marie I'm to dabble with the other side if you really don't know what you're doing\n[noise] I'll tell you one of the biggest pain than my side is we ...\nYeah I agree with that\nI had no idea what you're inviting in and it's sad because it's usually teenage girls high school\nWho am I going to go to

get up and move around\nOn others as otherwise it's just a stove up so I have talked me into it I went and uh like I said it was about\nAn hour away and we got up that direction and hung out with people for a little while and uh they all wanted to go to a bar probably I don't know maybe\nAnother thirty miles from where we were there and uh I was like well whatever you know I got to be late afternoon but time and the early evening and a\nWintertime and we got out there and I got this real strange feeling after I got into this bar a they knew people there I didn't know anybody other than who I drive with and it was just weird it felt like everybody in there\nThat was in that bar we're focused on me\nI didn't understand why at the time you know and I thought well what the heck just about\nLike a bar full of empires from something here exactly as like well I mean I felt like a a lamb or the swatter right and sign up on a rope or something yeah and and I\nI got real uncomfortable and I told him I says hey look I'm not feeling good I I Need to go so they they agreed and and we left that place then they went to this other place that way out in the country and it was an old I mean\nThis was an old dad gummed seeding bar yeah and I went in there\nWith them and to this place and that was a bunch of old people that they're again I've felt that hard enough and the air and uh I told him I said hey look I'm all just go sit out the car\nBut these these folks who brought you there they felt comfortable right\nOh well I've known him because I worked\nWith him um and uh yeah there are to me it didn't you know I didn't feel any threat from them it was just in the places that I attended they know where they took me\nAnd I'm like I said it ended up being a night of heavy snow and it ended up being a level three snow warning which means that you're not even supposed to be out\nSo we're out in the country after I go out back to the second bar after I go out and sit in the car and they finally decided well come on let's go\nWell we go down the road a little bit and next thing you know a were off on the farm and the car won't move forward or backward guards there was like six or seven I was in the car and uh they tried pushing couldn't get no no moment um\nSo they decided they were going to walk up to this house and see if I could get some help on the house was completely dark and you know I sat in the car I couldn't walk so I was I was I was stuck no matter what on there is no way I could run away do anything\nAnd I think that was you know part of what people were sensing when I was there you know in those places earlier in the evening and\nThe more time went on time went on I started getting nervous around these people and and so I just sat there to myself and the only thing I could think to do was ah are farther art in heaven hallowed be thy name leaders\nAre doing that under my in my mind over and over and over reciting the Lord's Prayer\nAnd it was weird because those guys are this one girl that was what to do that I went up her where she looked at me and I was an outer ring a word she says are you pray him\nAnd I says yeah and she goes ... better\nShe knew him going up\nI was like oh my goodness about ten minutes later here come the people at walk up to the house and says any luck you know the telephone nope instead I

is\nMoms and dads aren't ... kids anymore when they say I'm afraid in the bedroom there's the men in my closet\nYou know parents are finally starting to listen to their children when they are upset about something and kids they know what's going on there are so innocent they can see parents that crossed over spirit that haven't crossed over normally kids aren't afraid and lift the spirit is new to them\nLike you learn when you were a kid\nExactly that's exactly right so and at least I had grandma to go to and talk to and get a dog you know straightened around in my head\nMost of these kids

well I mean I felt like a oh I Am a at the water right and sign up on a rope or something\nYeah and and I I got real uncomfortable and I told him I said hey look I'm not feeling good I I Need to go so they they agreed and and we left that place then they went to this other place that way out in the country\nAnd it was an old I mean this was an old dad gums the bar yeah and\nI went in there with them and to this place and that was a bunch of old people that there again I felt that often enough and the air and I told him I said hey look I'm all just go sit out the car\nBut these these folks who brought you there they've found comfortable right\nOh well I've known them because I worked with him um and ah yeah they're to me it then you know I didn't feel any threat from them it was just in the places that I attended they know where they took me\nAnd I'm like I said it ended up being a night of heavy snow and it ended up being a level three is no warning which means that you're not even supposed to be out\nSo we're out in the country after I go out back to the second bar I probably go out and sit in the car and they finally decided well come on let's go\nWell we go down the road a little bit and next thing you know a war off on the farm and the caller won't move forward or backward or there was like six or seven I was in the car and uh they tried pushing couldn't get no no momentum\nSo they decided they were going to walk up to this house and see if I could get some help on the house was completely dark and you know I sat in the car I couldn't walk so I was I was I was stuck no matter what on there is no way I could run away do anything\nAnd I think that was you know part of what people were fencing when I was there you know in those places earlier in the evening and the more time went on time went on I've started getting nervous around these people and and\nSo I just thought to myself and the only thing I could think to do was uh\nThe farther art in heaven hallowed be thy name leaders are doing that under my in my mind\nOver and over and over reciting the Lord's Prayer\nAnd it was weird because those guys are this one girl that was what this new that I went up there with she looked at me and I was an eye out during a word she says are you pray him\nAnd I said yeah [noise] and she goes we better\nShe knew what was going up\nI was like oh my goodness about ten minutes later here come the people at walk up to the house and says any luck you know the telephone nope instead and I was like\nWow that was weird so they get in the car started up and pull out with no problem\nLike I didn't understand that we're in a car pulled out of the bomb while we were stuck\nNow at any point did they try to hurt you or anything\nNo no but you know I just kept I just kept that that bothers the lord and Jesus in my heart\nWhich we had these strange Myers about nothing\nIs going to be stronger than the the liked it in may\nWhat do you think that ... role and what do you think their game was what were they trying to do\nA lot I don't know maybe trying to um where they were somebody an do um where they're going to kill you [laughter] I don't think so no I don't I don't think so but I think they may have been trying to\nUm when me over somehow or another 'em\nLike they wanted your soul\nYeah it was weird I I had talked to this only to my therapist one other time but I definitely felt an odd present I'm I'm very uh\nIntuitive anyway mhm and uh it it just something that struck me as odd\nI Hope you didn't hang around with them any other time [noise]\nUh no actually you know I'd only run into one of them since then and uh they're still around but um [noise] wow it was where\nAnd one night a real ah George ... dead now that's\nA ... thing to say over there\nAnd I would never ever think it would be you\nWell that's the thing with ... up the attitude which is right now I surprised me Joe or I was in a state of depression\nThat's actually where I hate to say it but the ad a God I lie to go and do that I Will say it would have some chicken I gave him a gun away so it wouldn't do it about two years ago\nThat smart if you even think about that get rid of that gun\nOh as a matter of fact I yes it's go I gave it to my nephew he's a gun collect stuff you don't name shooter is like but anyway\nUm what are the cause of the experience and the color of going through several days feeling like there's I mean it was a horrible feeling George\nI mean I don't even think about it but I couldn't stop thinking about God and and all of a sudden I put myself into a trash\nAnd I talked to ... that is a little Ryan showed up at the park with my own spiritual lowered ...\nAnd what you know I started coming out that depression and Georgia justice field right\nNow and by the way if you ever get into that mode again you know you can call us\nYes on that or I ... you you were on my list oh or do something drastic and ended up having a don't get
