A. dot com call now\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\nAnd welcome back to coast to coast will take your calls next hour regardless of your thoughts on whether those global warming climate change we don't muscle you because people have different views Steve the book outside the green box told me about the title first of all\n[noise] sure well that's a that's a book that tells you what your green consult doesn't tell you a written for a general audiences and businesses and a one popular business a phrase use over and over and think outside the box so the\nTitle was think outside the green bucks because businesses today are are really trapped in the green bucks a sustainable development there they are forced to do many things\nAh that don't really do anything for the environment and so I go through a what I call first before horsemen of the environmental apocalypse a which are overpopulation\nThe idea that humans are growing too fast and and populating the planet too fast or the second one is global pollution the idea that we're increasingly polluting the environment\nAre the ice caps melting or not\nWhat we've had a gentle warming again we've had a degree in the last hundred and Thirty years and so there's a little bit of ... at the north pole and I'd Greenland\nBut the amazing thing is the ah the south pole ISIS getting thicker I Love the show a picture of the Amundson Scott station in in my presentations should I say this is the or the third station the United states has man since Nineteen fifty do you know what happened the other two stations\nAnd occasionally somebody to come up with the right answer the answer is the other two were buried by snow\nAnd they leave built\nThey built this last station on stilts at seven modular buildings and they they Jack up each building every year over accumulating snow and that's where Ninety percent of the world's ice is and the south pole climate models cannot explain why the ISIS getting thicker in the south pole\nBut on that we've lost a little bit\nUm if you add it all up but there's there's really no concern or that we're losing large amounts of ice\nIt's a ... it's incredible when these stories come out saying that huge sheets of ice and falling off the shelves melting away and everything else\nYeah I mean well you know they knew or knew west\nAntarctic ice sheet but but usually what they don't mention is there are about a hundred volcanoes under that ice sheet so it is possible that west Antarctic ice sheet could melt if we have big volcanic eruptions there but uh this is not being caused by carbon dioxide it's another natural factor\nWhat about ... want renewable energy\n[noise] plus or minus\nYeah this hundred percent renewable thing as I was as I was mentioning the the biggest problem with the wind and solar is their intermittent and they can't read if you're going to maintain continuity of electricity supply they can't replace traditional nuclear\nOr coal ... when you put in solar wind or you only get about ten percent of the total capacity as far as adding to the capacity of your system so if you want eighty percent of renewables or a hundred percent renewables you have to build a vast amount of wind and solar\nAnd people are saying batteries vast amounts of batteries\nSo this means you you've just added a huge expense to your electricity infrastructure or some of the studies say that uh in California for example they were going to triple\nA the cost of a wholesale electricity and that's going to probably double or or or two and a half times or your total electricity on top\nSo this hundred percent renewable energy sounds good\nUh practically it's going to be very very very expensive\nLet's talk for a moment Steve\nAnd about pollution how bad is the pollution\nOut there actually it's a pretty good news story as I talk about on my book you know I talked about landfills landfills used to be a mess yes or no they uh all modern landfills and in Europe and the U.S\nAre lined with a with a a waterproof barrier to keep things from leaking out they're covered with dirt every day to keep a\nA rats another room and the other way\nUm our air is very much a a cleaner since Nineteen\nEighty are six major air pollutants rolled down at a combined Seventy percent those are the ones I mentioned the carbon monoxide nitrogen oxide sulfur dioxide or water is is a is not where it ought to be but the the Great Lakes have been cleaned up many of the offshore areas have been cleaned up\nIn Europe at the Rhine River is making a comeback the Daniel rivers is may come back as a matter of fact the interesting thing is people say well energy use as a big problem but it's funny the nations that use the most energy per person\nHave the lowest levels of air and water pollution today and those levels are declining\nSo this idea that using energy causing ... causes pollution really is not accurate the nations that are not able to put energy use effectively um can't use it to reduce their air and water pollution and so they're they're in the worst state\nSo it's really a good news story what we need to do is get get the nations have become more wealthy and then they will start cleaning up there and start cleaning up their water and uh so it it really is a good news story a from a pollution point of view\nNow what's going on Steve because regardless what side of the fence you people are on with climate change why is it so bitter as opposed to dialogue and he this is my opinion and I appreciate yours it's screaming match is yeah yeah it\nIs kind of remarkable I have a I've spoken at a couple of universities and done a couple of debates but I get turned down about ten times the one I'm going to be up at the grand Valley State Michigan on the twenty fifth of October in a little thing but it's fairly rare now that that a university will invite\nA climate skeptic to climate discussion [noise] um so it has become very polarized and\nDo you get booted\nNo I've never had a disruptive situation and you know I'm always very respectful and the theory is plausible a man made climate change and that we do have a greenhouse effect but over the last Thirty years the data showing that the climate models are wrong they made some assumptions which are wrong so\nSo a natural factors dominate um and we need to go on reducing real pollutants but not not carbon dioxide\nWell she that's what's so important people really need to distinguish the difference between pollution and climate change brought on by cycles as the sun is heating up the solar system itself is warmer than it used to be\nAbsolutely there are the earth is dominated by long term cycles called them a lot of which cycles which are uh the tilt of earth's axis changes over time the procession\nOf earth's axis are are they orbit around the sun changes and these are like twenty thousand to a hundred thousand years cycles they cause the ice ages then we have medium term cycles every Fifteen hundred years or so that\nUh scientists believe the sun causes and those are they're they're fluctuating temperatures so we've had the\nMedieval warm period a thousand years ago when I was very warm\nUm the little ice age in Europe uh about five hundred years ago when they were actually burning people at the stake they\nThought they were witches and they were causing the cold weather and our modern warming and then we have short term cycles as well El Nino is an example and the regular cycle every three to seven years\nCycles in the Pacific cycles of the in the Atlantic so the statement climate change is real is like saying water is wet\nWhat's to come back in a moment Steven open up the phone lines and what people participate with you\nSign up now for ... zone or free

leaders of a a signed up to this ah the ah ah most of them signed the Kyoto Protocol and Nineteen Ninety seven\nAnd um it was I was at a conference at the University of Chicago today and they mentioned it all the nations of signed up to the Paris accords even\nEven the the President Trump has said he's going to withdraw it is kind of a universal thing um but uh you know the uh the members are not living up to their to their uh commitments it's very very tough when you need to uh\nTo impose a things on your nation and you and you uh uh have to impose costs on renewable energy and also there's there was this big demand that the world set up the United nations they wanted a hundred billion dollar annual\nClimate payment to go from the wealthy nations to the\nDeveloping nations a hundred billion annually quite a big amount and a year and has that has completely collapsed a matter of fact the guy who was ahead of that just resigned this last summer and with the ... with uh the United states cutting its commitment or they're nowhere near that they're down about four or five billion dollars a year\nWhich is there a scandal among some of the scientists who were ... you know pro man made climate change with the emails and things like that\nYeah the east the climate gate was called the University of east East Anglia back in two thousand nine\nOh they don't know who ... somebody released thousands of emails either end in sight or or a hacker and these emails showed some very bad ah behavior or there were a uh guys that are\nOr were saying I'm a don't tell anyone that the United kingdom has a freedom of Information Act or there are people are racing emails\nUh there were people a trunk heating or data or there were people trying to you know interview or to influence the peer review process I'm\nJust I'm just not a tough situation you know and and my thought is by interpretation is that that the scientists to these things and by the way this was a this was the primary mentioned before the climate research unit which is the primary keeper of the world's temperatures\nAre these folks I think we're we're trying to do whatever they could to try and save the planet to try and convince the world if you think the world is going down the wrong track\nOf they were pulling any means to try and do that but they were they were following very very poor a

young to call during\nThe day after tomorrow is based on the idea that um manmade warming would would stop the Gulf Stream basically slow down the Gulf Stream which is part of a the a\nA global uh uh overturning a circulation there's this huge ocean current\nUh which which carries a millions of square miles of water of the gulfstream goes north goes up to Iceland and then it sinks into it slows down deep and then it goes down into the deep underneath that goes down to the south Atlantic the Indian in the Pacific\nThe the theory basically was\nThat are warming would cause a cause of water to melt up there the ice caps to melt would stop the current and it would cause a U.S move us into the next the ice age\nUm I think most scientists now realize that that that is very unlikely we just don't have enough ice up there um to to affect the current so are there ... there was a fair though a number of years back that that was slowing down but after they looked at the data they found that the no the gulfstream wasn't slowing down it's really not happening\nIt was a good movie though [noise] yeah okay this whole thing right\nLet's go next to John in Hawaii west of the Rockies John I'm not hearing much about the volcano these days what so what can you give us an update on that\nAll I\nStill make your head\nStill doing its thing well okay go ahead John\nYeah but in order to uh to quiet down I just want to stay you we're we're talking\nAbout landfills ... when\nI when I was living in Oregon okay and I used to drive by the wind will that they had and I could see out in the meal that they had a big fat and it was about a twenty four ... booth\nPlane you know they were were burning off\nThe methane gas or what have you now why don't you put a generator on that\nAnd we'll do ... you know Chris city now\nCome back and they said no no no it's going to cost too much I can have anything out now that can't be the only land they all in the United states we know that and they're all going to be burning off methane gas now I Wonder why haven't there been anything done about that\nWell I think there are recapturing that are in some place as a matter of fact that's a big push in California they talk about they talk about that being renewable gas\nOr they also want to get methane from water treatment plants and even a dairy operations and and uh uh agriculture\nUm the problem is though it is really more expensive um gas from landfill is about twice as much as our natural gas regularly and it goes up from there um water treatment of three times as much I think there he gets up to about ten times as much\nSo they are capturing that and some in some places they're capturing the gas from landfills\nOr but it does tend to it does tend to add to the expense of things that's that's the only issue\nNext let's go to Michael in Virginia Beach I'm Michael\nHi George and thank you for having the bond you're stuck into spoken to him several times I heard him on many shows and

century that's been going for the last a couple of hundred years or any politician who tells you he knows how to stop sea level rise I hold onto your wallet\nOh we need to adapt to rising oceans oh we're not going to be able to stop that and that is a largely driven by natural factors\nWould obviously has happened in the past because there were discovering the ancient cities that are under

matter what they what they think in California\nRoots in woodland hills California is with us ... go ahead\nHi George thank you for taking my call Hi Steve I'm Bruce you know before I ah I Want to talk about the word climate change but before I get into I just kind of like to mention I perhaps to a lot of listeners that aren't aware is a\nGlobal elites that run this country who are masters at keeping us completely oblivious and done and what's really going on\nThe word climate change is a narrative we hear all the time to weather stations and news articles scientists that is not the proper word the word is\nAbrupt climate collapse and we never hear about the word climate engineering these are programs now that have been in effect for over seven years and they've been ramped up over\nTwenty years this the aerosol injections they're spraying God Knows how many millions of tons of aerosol anyone could just look up in the sky if they don't doubt that a lot of Temperance\nSandler harp technology is and you know if anyone wants to prove this to himself I can tell you how to do it first of all\nAny time you watch the news you are watching at him manufactured why you're not seeing the real no a weather satellite map that we used to the many years ago we're seeing animated cartoon\nThere's a fight a it's a YouTube one Pacific redwood that this guy is obviously a former meteorologists he keeps on him is his name but he is showing actual weather satellite map but here's the thing that's interesting\nYou can see storm front hurricanes tropical storm low pressure zone coming directly into California and they're being blocked\nAnd it's being blocked by heart technology which our ground based atmosphere heaters anyone could look this up\nThey're very powerful I Believe they can put out as much as three billion watts of power and can the upper atmosphere to Fifteen hundred degrees they can steer hurricane they can fall hurricanes they can blast thunder head they can break up low pressure zone and this is what's happening this is not\nAn act of nature it's an act\nOf the military industrial complex what's having our with our weather ... when I hear about it and the new\nLuskin Steve's reaction to the roost like you\nBruce said something I'd have to research I'm really not up on that I Know there's been some quotes eating attempts but to the rest of it it's not something I've run across um and there's been a lot of discussion about the climate engineering but to my knowledge there's not been anything done on a large scale that's something I'd have to look look into it further\nLet's take one more caller may be too if we have some time in and tell ... go ahead [laughter]\nWell Mr going that man just said is exactly right I Want to these sort of it if it happens to believe\nThat the way to add on is being gay oh engineered the camp trails or a proven fact even the discovery channel show now George should recently a gentleman on his show talking about ... put out a video called Franken's guy and the idea behind it was to create a canopy over the blotting out son\nWell people I write so much\nHeck shoes word hate\nAbout the fact that they're doing this so they're going to back off of it now what they were telling us that they said they were going to back off the trail we don't have the weather's going to get real radical now they have they have the ability to geo engineering this weather\nDown to earth science I mean it's to the point now you can go to Wall Street and bet on the stock market on the weather if they want hurricane that they want to intensify the hurricane through the age of heart\nAnd now on top of that then you got the geo engineering of the show on the crops which is destroying the honeybees are almost becoming extinct and if they you know that's pretty much gonna destroy everything now I Do agree with you about the nuclear power plant that was a foolish idea didn't man ever come up with man is not smart enough\nTo harness that kind of power safely okay now I Do agree with that\nBut here's the thing that Trump I'm proud of him he got us out of that climate accord 'cause it's a sham ... they want they were doing stripping the wealth of industrial nations away\nDistributing it into the pockets of the global elite\nAnd meanwhile China that's over there with their sky completely on pollution not paying a dime into it either as Russia but the United states of America was going to play the oh I can now I don't blame a Trump one bit I grew in fact I was proud of him

William she and the author of the big foot terror in the woods William you were telling us about somebody in a canoe when uh the brake guns\nYes yes oh well this gentleman was a canoeing in a creek are up in Vermont and really he was pulled urging stomping when he came across some nice holes that he felt he could get some good trout and\nHe sees something going up and down in the trees that he described as like a chimpanzee so he's watching this thing going up and down and think to themselves\nWhat on earth is a monkey or a chimpanzee doing up here\nNow he couldn't cross the river\nAnd when the thing came down on the tree it went into the the trees surrounding it a little in other words there were like low boroughs ten Fifteen feet and then this big tall tree standing in the middle so when it was up in the high tree he could see it and when they climb down we couldn't see it\nSo obviously you're out there this thing has your attention\nWhen he's watching this thing going up and down and at one point it comes up\nSits there and won't position and staring at him so now he's looking at it\nIt's looking at him and then it lowers down again well moments later he sees some ... in the bushes on the other bank which kind of came down a hill alongside the fool's\nAnd here is this little big foot sitting on the shoulder of daddy coming along the bank and going out of sight in front of him into the woods so you had one carrying the other one\nWho knows it's anybody's guess what this little critter was doing maybe it was like you know I I Know it sounds ridiculous but I think of it in human terms like when we used to go down to the monkey bars or something to play with your kid in the park you know\nThat's right now you mentioned earlier about a couple that moved on to their house to get away from big what happened\n[noise] well I've had a ... there's been a number of people that moved to the house is a a\nA United sooner aren't and rural areas right\n[noise] ... ah yeah for the most part are people who have backed up against a wilderness areas or for instance when we talk about man this is a very interesting a story a\nInvolving no sighting but evidence like it's nobody's business uh these people and when you talk about Maine George I don't know if people really realize this\nMaine is the size of the risk of New England combined and you know Ninety percent of it is uninhabited so when you talk about wilderness it's not just the Pacific northwest British Columbia Canada here we have a lot of will\nLive and I think you get more credit card users you know they have\nSome sort of get your free\n[noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\nOkay well come back we'll you she was William the abominable snowman the lady from the humility is is that the same as the big ... we talk about here in North America\nI don't believe so uh although I'll tell you something really interesting\nUh I had an account of was told to me by all things a Russian professor\nWho was out hiking with his landscaper that he had befriended because of his vast knowledge of things but time nickel and they form this unlikely friendship and turned that into a hiking partnership\nThey had run across a couple of big for its\nMessing around with some trees are in the woods and they got close enough to them whether they could hear them ...\nAnd the professor\nSaid that it sounded like a Siberian dialect that he was unfamiliar with no this is a Russian speaking immigrant saying that what he was hearing sounded like some type of Russian that he was unfamiliar with\nSo when you talk about the the Eddie in ah the abominable snowman\nIt's hard not to think of the land bridge that was one step above the Bering Sea\nAnd did these things or had these things go back and forth I have no idea but it was just really unusual to hear this gentleman\nA speak about this on dialect that other people have said they've heard a voice is I had a couple that uh was canoeing in Minnesota and they parked on a\nPulled the canoe up on a piece of the lake where they thought look clear and they could sit there and rest for a little while\nAnd they ran across some sasquatch and the trees structure in there or they will only seen by them they walk by through the trees they heard them ... and they said it sounded like when you stand at the counter in a Chinese restaurant\nAnd they're shouting orders back and forth to each other\nSo it's very very odd but as far as the ah the ah yeah any any abominable below snowman I have no idea uh I have a Sanders since book the abominable a snowman come to life\nAnd uh you know that thing is like reading uh an encyclopedia on the creature\nA and yet getting back to what I said earlier none\nOf this stuff means anything\nTo the majority of people around the globe that book is a hoax all of my stuff as a whole ... all of the conversations about Bigfoot or a hoax the film is a hoax all of the uh uh a durable ridges on the footprints taken everything's a hoax to them so\nYou know we have to just keep doing what we do a in spite of uh what the majority of the people out there I think about it and that's one of the things I Love about coast\nYou know uh uh we all\nTune in because we're hearing things that we can't get in Oklahoma changes nobody's talking about what you're talking about\nYou and photos and big could encounters where's the Tania\n[noise] well I've had a couple of them are one of them are called the dead falls incident but one night I'll share with you a was named the orb\nAnd it's really interesting uh these three scout leaders had four young boys got all working on their uh Eagle Scout badge\nAnd they decided to take them uh to this mountain in a mountainous area or in uh Pennsylvania to do a weekend of survival training\nOr on the first day they were pretty much focusing on building huts lean twos and and different things like that and and the second day or the focus was on that of ah getting attention being shaved so they were spending their time in an open area spelling\nOut the words help and SOS uh using branches and bows and then they were making Smokey fires using a green a green vows and that night they decided to go on a night hike to see what it was like\nA navigating around in the dark mhm uh now during the day they had\nClimbed up the side of the mountains to look down and see what they had made to see what it looked like from a higher elevation and they had gone up into the same area right night\nFor the ICC but when they got up there it turns out that the one scout leader was it you will fall on Tuesday is which was very bizarre considering what you're about to hear he had a pair of military grade night vision or by knock you lose your own monarch yellow\nOr that he had brought along now when they get up into the trail\nOne of the kid says hey what's that and they noticed in the distance a light moving around in the woods\nNow of course the first instinct was it somebody with a flashlight or a you know a battery operated lantern but then they realize that this thing started ... daughter around in a crazy fashion which immediately told all of them this is no human being and what it is we don't know so they started moving closer\nAnd that got closer they got the night vision on it and they could see now that was in orbit around bluish white light moving around and the forest\nAnd now this really had their attention so they got even closer they were trying to get closer to it they didn't know how big it was because they didn't know how far away they were from it finally they got to a place where they believe they were about Seventy five yards away from it and when they put the night vision on it\nThey could see that it was about two feet wide bluish white or but it was about uh ten or twelve feet off the ground and it was a looming aiding the trees around it right so that that passing a\nWas that bright yeah I

next hour regardless of your thoughts on whether those global warming climate change we don't muscle you because people have different views Steve the book outside the green box told me about the title first of all\nSure well that's that's the book that tells you what your green consult doesn't tell you a written for a general audiences and businesses and a one popular business a phrase years over and over and think outside the box so the\nTitle was think outside the green box because businesses today are are really trapped in the green boxes sustainable development there they are forced to do many things\nAh that don't really do anything for the environment and so I go through a what I call first before horsemen of environmental apocalypse oh which are overpopulation the idea that humans are growing too fast and and populating the planet too fast\n[noise] what we've had a gentle warming again we've had a degree in the last hundred and Thirty years and so there's a little bit of ... at the north pole and I'd Greenland\nBut the amazing thing is the ah the south pole ISIS getting thicker I Love the show a picture of the Amundson Scott station in in my presentations that I say this is the or the third station the United states has man since Nineteen fifty do you know what happened the other two stations\nAnd occasionally somebody to come up with the right answer the answer is the other two were buried by snow\nAnd they leave built\nThey built this last station on stilts at seven modular buildings and they they Jack up each building every year over accumulating snow and that's where Ninety percent of the world's ice is and the south pole climate models cannot explain why the ice is getting thicker in the south pole\nBut on that we've lost a little bit um if you add it all up but there's there's really no concern or that we're losing large amounts of ice\nIt's a ... it's incredible when these stories come out saying this huge sheets of ice and falling off the shelves melting away and everything else\nYeah I mean well you know they knew I knew it was\nA an Arctic ice sheet but but usually what they don't mention is there are about a hundred volcanoes under that ice sheet so it is possible that west Antarctic ice sheet could melt if we have big volcanic eruptions there but uh this is not being caused by carbon dioxide it's another natural factor\nWhat about ... one renewable energy [noise] plus or minus\nThis hundred percent renewables thing as I was as I was mentioning the the biggest problem with the wind and solar is their intermittent and they can't read if you're going to maintain continuity of electricity supply they can't replace traditional nuclear gas or coal\n... when you put in solar\nWind a you only get about ten percent of the total capacity as far as adding to the capacity of your system\nSo if you want eighty percent of renewables or a hundred percent renewables you have to build a vast amount of wind and solar\nAnd people are saying batteries vast amounts of batteries\nSo this means you you've just added a huge expense to your electricity infrastructure uh some of the studies\nSay that uh in California for example they were going to triple a the cost of their whole so electricity and that's going to probably double or or or two and a half times or your total electricity on top\nSo this hundred percent renewable energy sounds good uh practically it's going to be very very very expensive\nWhich talked for a moment Steve again about pollution how bad is the pollution\nOut there actually it's a pretty good news story as I talk about on my book you know we talked about landfills landfills used to be a mess yes or no they uh all modern landfills and in Europe and the U.S\nAre lined with a with a waterproof barrier to keep things from leaking out they're covered with dirt every day to keep a\nA rats another for him and the other way\nUm our air is very much a a cleaner since Nineteen eighty\nAre six major air pollutants are all down at a combined Seventy percent those are the ones I mentioned the carbon monoxide nitrogen oxide sulfur dioxide or water is is a is not where it ought to be but the great lakes have been cleaned up many of the offshore areas have been cleaned up\nIn Europe at the Rhine River is making a comeback the Daniel rivers is may come back as a matter of fact the interesting thing is people say well energy uses a big problem but it's funny the nations that use the most energy per person\nHave the lowest levels of air and water pollution today and those levels are declining so this idea that using energy causing ... causes pollution really is not accurate\nThe nations that are not able to put energy use effectively um can't use it to reduce their air and water pollution and so they're they're in the worst state\nSo it's really a good news story what we need to do is get get a nations have become more wealthy and then they will start cleaning up there and start cleaning up their water and uh so it it really is a good news story or from a pollution point of view\nNow what's going on Steve because regardless what side of the fence you people are on with climate change why is it so bitter as opposed to dialogue and he this is my opinion and I appreciate your age it's screaming match is yeah yeah\nIt is kind of remarkable I have a I've spoken at a couple of universities and done a couple of debates but I get turned down about ten times the one I'm going to be up at a grand Valley State Michigan on the twenty fifth of October in a little thing but it's fairly rare now that that a university will invite\nA climate skeptic to a climate discussion [noise] um so it has become very polarized and\nDo you get booted\nNo I've never had a disruptive situation and you know I'm always very respectful and the theory is plausible of man made climate change and that we do have a greenhouse effect\nBut over the last Thirty years the data showing that the climate models are wrong they made some assumptions which are wrong so so a natural factors dominate um and we need to go on reducing real pollutants but not not carbon dioxide\nWell she that's what's so important people really need to distinguish the difference between pollution and climate change brought on by cycles as the sun is heating up the solar system itself is warmer than it used to be\nAbsolutely there are the earth has dominated by long term cycles called them a lot of H cycles which are uh the tilt of earth's axis changes over time the procession of earth's axis are are they orbit around the sun changes and these are like twenty thousand to a hundred thousand years cycles they cause the ice ages\nThen we have a medium term cycles every Fifteen hundred years or so that\nUh scientists believe the sun causes and those are they're they're fluctuating temperatures so we've had the\nMedieval warm period a thousand years ago when it was very warm\nUm the little ice age in Europe uh about five hundred years ago when they were actually burning people at the stake they thought they were which isn't there are causing the cold weather in our modern warming and then we have short term cycles as well El Nino is an example in their regular cycle every three to seven years\nCycles in the Pacific cycles of the in the Atlantic so the statement climate change is real it's like saying water is wet\nLet's come back in a moment Steven open up the phone lines and what people participate would you\nSign up now for ... zone or free email newsletter get it today

home I don't remember how did you get there I don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years ago was that I don't know I was at a rally last\n\nAnd welcome back Steve Moore I'm with a ... what are the views worldwide about climate change\n[noise] well they uh the world leaders have pretty much signed up to this more than a hundred and Ninety world leaders of a a signed up to this ah the ah ah most of them signed the Kyoto Protocol and Nineteen Ninety seven\nAnd um it was I was at a conference at the University of Chicago today and they mentioned it all the nations of signed up to the Paris accords even\nEven the the President Trump has said he's going to withdraw\nIt is kind of a universal thing um but uh you know the uh the members are not living up to their to their uh commitments it's very very tough when you need to uh\nTo impose a things on your nation and you and you uh uh have to impose costs on renewable energy and also there's there was this big demand that the world set up the United nations they wanted a hundred billion dollar annual\nClimate payment to go from the wealthy nations to the\nDeveloping nations a hundred billion annually quite a big amount\nAnd a year and has that has completely collapsed a matter of fact the guy who was ahead of that just resigned this last summer and with the ... with uh the United states cutting its commitment or they're nowhere near that they're down about four or five billion dollars a year\nWhich is a scandal among some of the scientists who were ... you know pro man made climate change with the emails and things like that\nYeah the east the climate gate was called the University of east East Anglia back in two thousand nine oh they don't know who ... somebody released thousands of emails either end in sight or or a hacker\nAnd these emails showed some very bad ah behavior\nOr there were a a guy that ah\nAh we're saying I'm a don't tell anyone that the United kingdom has a freedom of Information Act or there are people are racing emails\nUh there were people a trunk Keating a data are there were people trying to you know interview or to influence the peer review process I'm\nJust I'm just not a tough situation you know and and\nMy thought is by interpretation is that that the scientists to these things and by the way this was a this was the primary I mentioned before the climate research unit which is the primary keeper of the world's temperatures\nAre these folks I think we're we're trying to do whatever they could to try and save the planet to try and convince the world if you think the world is going down the wrong track\nOf they were pulling any means to try and do that but they were they were following very very poor a scientific or or procedures\nOkay let's go to the phones now Eric truck driving in Indiana hello Eric\nDon't charge or is there the macho guy has everybody doing the you're\nJust scared the heck out of my guess\nIraq to hey buddy a many many years ago the founder of coast to coast art bell and his buddy ... Streever wrote a book called the coming global superstorm\nAnd that inspired a movie called the day after tomorrow and while I was wondering was or is it remotely possible that if things are keep going the way they are or with art and uh what is predictions\nCould very well happen that the events portrayed in that movie as well as the events portrayed in the movie two thousand twelve with\nYellowstone popping the cork in blowing Wyoming and the Kentucky or is it very possible that the ban in both of those movies could very well happen\n[noise] yeah I don't know about the two thousand twelve of Yellowstone and that for Kaine although I understand there's a big went under their young to call during\nThe day after tomorrow is based on the idea that\nUm manmade warming would would stop the Gulf Stream basically slow down the Gulf Stream which is part of a the a a global uh uh overturning a circulation there's this huge ocean current\nUh which which carries a millions of square miles of water of the gulfstream goes north goes up to Iceland and then it sinks in it slows down deep and then it goes down into the deep underneath that goes down to the south Atlantic the Indian and the Pacific\nThe the theory basically was\nThat are warming would cause a cause or water to melt up there the ice caps to melt would stop the current and it would cause a U.S move us in the next the ice age\nUm I think most scientists now realize that that that is very unlikely we just don't have enough ice up there um to to affect the current so uh there was there was a fair though a number of years back that that was slowing down but after they looked at the data they found that the no the gulfstream wasn't slowing down it's really not happening\nIt was a good movie though [noise] yeah okay this whole thing right\nLet's go next to John in Hawaii west of the Rockies John I'm not hearing much about the volcano these days what so what can you give us an update on that\nAll egg and they'll make it\nStill doing its thing whoa okay go ahead John yeah\nBut in order to uh to quiet down I just want to stay you we're\nWe're talking about wind field ... when I\nWhen I was living in Oregon okay and I used to drive by the wind meals that they had and I could see out in the field that they had a big fat and there was plenty for what blue flame\nYou know they were were burning off the methane\nGas or where he now why don't you put a generator on that\nAnd we'll do ... you know electricity now\nCome back and they said no no no it's going to cost too much I can have anything out now that can't be the only land they all in the United states we know that and they're all going to be born in ... methane gas now I Want to go why has there been anything done about that\nWell I think they are recapturing that are in some place as a matter of fact that's a big push in California they talk about they talk about that being renewable gas [noise]\nAh they also want to get methane from water treatment plants and even a dairy operations and and uh uh agriculture\nUm the problem is though it is really more expensive um gas from landfill is about twice as much as our natural gas regularly and it goes up from there um water treatment is three times as much I think there he gets up to about ten times as much\nSo they are capturing that and some in some places they're capturing the gas from landfills\nOr but it does tend to it does tend to add to the expense of things that's\nThat's the only issue\nNext stop let's go to Michael in Virginia Beach I'm Michael\nHi are you arguing thank you for having Steve von Loor bumped into spoken to him several times are\nHurting on many shows and he has a breath of fresh air in inside and that accuracy or there is one point that ah other guests on coast to coast have brought up in the past and I think we should warn are good friends\nNot to make the same mistake that these are climate change hopes are are are using a bag lady I Believe you said a one point three billion people on this planet live on two dollars a day is that correct yeah I think it's\nAbout it's I think it's actually about two billion dollars I'm Sorry two billion Peebles it's quite a few of those are those are the United nations numbers I mean I haven't gone out and counted them\nOkay well I was using the one point three billion a papal so two dollars a day comes to point six billion dollars a day\nOr we would have just been nine hundred and forty nine billion dollars a year just dumb old they are two dollars a day just four hours a day and I'm going to come to the point that people like frosty will reject may end or a robbery or\nA young child than a\nHere's the point if you've already said they were willing to do a hundred billion they're certainly not going to be willing to do nine hundred and forty nine billion right and and so\nSo what's the process is told us is this is just sat in thinking that we can see your ah that by doubling people daily\nA dollar allowance or would somehow going to a massively improve their lives they're doing All right it was out as a boss she will rich a lot of them are are

we're not going to be able to stop that and that is a largely driven by natural factors\nThat obviously has happened in the past because there were discovering the ancient cities that are under

years this is the aerosol injections\nThey're spraying God Knows how many millions of tons of aerosol anyone could just look up in the sky if they don't doubt this a lot of Democrats\nSample harp technology is and you know if anyone wants to prove this to themself I can tell you how to do it first of all\nAny time you watch the news you are watching at him manufactured why you're not seeing the real no a weather satellite map that we used to the many years ago we're seeing animated cartoon\nBut there's a fight a it's a YouTube one Pacific redwood that this guy is obviously a former meteorologists he keeps anonymous his name but he is showing actual weather satellite map but here's the thing that's interesting\nYou can see storm front hurricanes tropical storm low pressure zone coming directly into California and they're being blocked\nAnd it's being blocked by heart technology which our ground based atmosphere heaters anyone could look this up\nThey're very powerful I Believe they can put out as much as three billion watts of power and can have the upper atmosphere to Fifteen hundred degrees they can steer hurricane they can fall hurricanes they can blast thunder head they can break up low pressure zone and this is what's happening this is not\nAn act of nature it's an act\nOf the military industrial complex what's having our with our weather ... when I hear about it and the new\nOnes can Steve's reaction to the roost like you\nBruce of some I'd have to research I'm really not up on that I Know there's been some quotes eating attempts but to the rest of it it's not something I've run across um and there's been a lot of discussion about the climate engineering but to my knowledge there's not been anything done on a large scale that's something I'd have to look look into it further\nLet's take one more caller may be too if we have some time in in Tulsa, Oklahoma he said go ahead [laughter]\nOh God well Mr going man just said is exactly right I Want to these conservative it happens to believe\nThat the way to add on is being Gail engineered the camp trails or a proven fact even the discovery channel show now George should recently a gentleman on his show talking about can't drill team put out a video called Franken's guy and the idea behind it was to create a canopy over the earth blotting out son\nWell people are so much heck shoot word hate\nAbout the fact that they're doing this so they're going to back off of it now what they were telling us that they said they were going to back off the trail we don't have the weather's going to get real radical now they have they have the ability to geo engineering this weather\nDown to earth science I mean it's it's to the point now you can go to Wall Street and bet on the stock market on the weather if they want hurricanes that they want to intensify the hurricane through the age of heart\nAnd on top of that then you got the geo engineering of the soil and the crops which is destroying the honeybees are almost becoming extinct and if they you know that's pretty much gonna destroy everything now I Do agree with you about the nuclear power plant that was a foolish idea didn't man ever come up with man is not smart enough\nTo harness that kind of power safely okay now I Do agree with that\nBut here's the thing that Trump I'm proud of him he got us out of that climate accord 'cause it's a sham meant they want they were doing a stripping the wealth of industrial nations away\nDistributing it into the pockets of the global elite\nAnd meanwhile China that's over there with their sky completely on pollution not paying a dime into it either as Russia but the United states of America was going to play the oh okay now I don't blame a Trump one bit I grew in fact I was proud of him for backing us out of that sham\nLonger he somebody had to wear out of time Steve and ed thank you for your comments Steve thank you good luck with the work outside the
