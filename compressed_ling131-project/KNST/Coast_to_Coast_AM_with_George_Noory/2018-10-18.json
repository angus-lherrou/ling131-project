government and maybe they get it maybe they don't\nA you know no interest or a minimum very low interest like ... maybe one and a half percent or so just enough to cover the costs of administering the program\nWhere does the lending money come from that one for the for these loans\nWell the money is used to come from essentially Wall Street because the ... it was private banks that were making these loans are today this money comes from the federal treasury because as I said Obama um federalized all any program [noise]\nAh so the federal tax payer puts the money out a and the federal taxpayer 'em and let's be clear we're not really talking about the taxpayers we're really talking about the department of education a ended sort of\nCrony contractors that's where the money is going and they they keep that\nEssentially away from the taxpayer and they keep it for themselves [laughter] ah but um so yeah this is a federal program money it ultimately comes from the taxpayer who at this point as I said is making something like Seventy five billion dollars a year in profit\nOr and even making a profit on ... I should add so that's a a something that makes this a predatory lending system by definition\nAre their predatory lending laws in various states\nThere are there are state use three laws are in every state in the union and federal student loans\nAre exempted from all of them [laughter] there are also fared collection practice laws\nFederal um a fruit than lending laws uh and these again are restricted or completely remove a for the case of federal student loans\nWho came up with this scam\n[noise] well the genesis of this the genesis of this really comes back to sort of a swampy belts\nWay ... ball of bankers are which included a it started with a company called Sallie Mae which was a\nSponsored entity back in the seventies [noise] uh and by the way one of your other guest who appears on your program frequently Catherine Austin fits yes served\nOn the board of Sallie Mae back when it was actually controlled by the government and she was there right at the nexus of when the company went from being a publicly sponsored enterprises\nTo a holy private for profit enterprise and she can tell you many of the stories about people like Albert lowered a bill defender for in other executives at Sallie Mae who had no interest in serving the public and at\nEvery interest in making money off of this system [noise]\nSo you can point to Sallie Mae and um they're very disturbing also other groups like the consumer Bankers Association [noise] uh like many of the state run Gehring tours in the country um like USA Funds\nThese people were all in it for themselves and they saw an opportunity to make money and they did everything they could\nTo make these loans as oppressive as possible and here we are twenty Thirty years later living in a under the the fruits of their labor\nWhere do you recommend for a parent who use child is ready to graduate from high school and they want to go to college\nWell the the only good advice that I can give it at this point George is do not borrow and if you have to borrow\nDo not borrow from a student loan company so don't borrow federal student loans don't borrow private student loans from a bank you know that they where they where technically it is called a student loan\nBecause soon as you call it a student loan federal or private\nYou lose bankruptcy rights are and for federal loans you lose statute of limitations you lose fairly collection practices treatment lending a state use three laws all the all the rights all the consumer protections but I mentioned [noise]\nUm so really don't borrow is the best advice I can have but if you actually have to borrow go to a private bank at a private line of credit [noise]\nUh and do it that way because at least then you'll have you know every consumer protection that exists for every other type of loan\nWhatever happened to the days of scholarship so they still being awarded to people\nWell you know Georgia of course scholarships and grants are still out there but the colleges have been raising their prices so astonishingly much that you know no amount of grants or even state funding has cetera can keep up with their budget\nUm you know I was just in Syracuse recently in the price to go to Syracuse University has now Seventy thousand dollars a year well I can guarantee ... per year\nThat's tuition room board books um for for your course for a four year college and by the way it no longer tapes for years to graduate George the average time to graduate from undergrad it's now six point two year what happened\nWell again the colleges are sitting in the ... seat vacant because there's this lending program standing behind the whole thing and the federal government and the other lenders are willing\nTo pile as much dead on the back to the students as possible the colleges have carte blanche to not only raise their prices but also really straining to students out and keep them in college for as long as they can possibly do it [noise]\nSo it's it's the time is getting longer the pre your cost is just exploding and that's why we're seeing these just insane storied where people are graduating with you know a million dollars in debt ... there was a story just recently we're\nLosing a guy walked out of dental school with yeah a million dollars in student loans\nNo wonder dental a belt bills are so high\nThat's right you know and and this really hurts the broader economy when you have one point six trillion dollars in debt you know strapped onto our younger workers just out of college um they have to charge a huge amount just to pay out that burden\nAnd you know we're seeing comments from people like Jamie diamond is shaping Morgan Chase and William deadly at the New York Federal Reserve bank and many

the short end of the stick and by that I mean a you've got these payday loans that are outrageous and predatory are that are geared mark for people who need some money and you know they're having a tough time you've got these student loans situations and one of the worst icy are these um\nSecondary car market a lender\nAnd who will finance people who really can't afford a car because they have to have a vehicle so they'll finance them\nWould just what you said they want to default so what they'll do is they'll say All right I Want five hundred dollars down you can buy this used car\nAnd so the person the poor person gives them the five hundred dollars\nKeeps a car for a couple of months makes payments for a couple of months then defaults the car gets repossessed and they sell the car for the same amount of money if not the ... the ... if not more and with financing and they do it all over again and they make more money on it\n[noise] yeah that's right you know that that's a great analogy George and you know I make a similar analogy off and I say you know student loans it's like buying a car where you pick it out you buy it online and say you know look it's has great reviews you go and so you buy online you go to go to the dealership and you pick up the car\nAnd you're driving out of the dealership and all of a sudden you realize that the car has no breaks and you wind up in the ditch\nAnd you go back to the dealership you're like hey guys you know this car has no brakes what's going on and they go well hey buddy you know what can we tell you\nYou should read the manual because this car comes with no breaks you know [laughter] uh and this in fact is really what's going on with student loans in particularly as you as you rightly say for lower income people um\nYou know a ... what we're seeing particularly in past ten years or so is these sort of fly by night expensive for profit colleges are marketing very heavily to um you know disadvantaged uh\nUnder privileged people\nUnder yeah under privileged people people who were born with a silver spoon in their mouth and they're getting a horrible sort of a nonsensical education is just a joke a and lo and behold they get saddled with the loans uh and this rex their life um\nI mean they should be getting more interest rates better financing deals but because they're credited shots and they don't have the ability to make the payments the way most people do they get the short end of the stick and that's very rural\nYeah you know it's a it's a real cruel irony and and just in general you know there are a means test for student loans in the first place so the only people the people that get student loans and it's about\nI mean let's be honest is about Seventy percent of everybody who goes to college winds up with student loans but still this is a a um a an economically needy group of people who you know don't have a silver spoon in their mouth and\nHow cruelly ironic is that is these very people that the lending system was supposed to help\nUh and it's essentially wrecking their lives you know the default rate across all borrowers by my best estimates is over fifty percent\nAs breezy eat greasy once once the tuition like in Harvard or Yale\nA it's a it's on a par with the the number I mentioned for Syracuse earlier is probably Seventy or Seventy thousand Seventy Seventy five thousand dollars a year\nAnd there are even more schools by the way um but uh yeah the the ivy leagues are running you know they'll they'll be up at a hundred thousand per year within I'd say a couple three four\nYears I should have pushed my kids' sports when they were younger so they get scholarships to go to university smart\nYeah that's right well you know even scholarships really won't pay the freight anymore I mean the price even at state schools were seen annual cost of attendance of thirty plus thousand dollars a and\nYou know the scholarships really have an increased uh on that scale and so it's you know unless you get a full ride it's a very tough proposition to go to even a state school these days you know we're we're getting stories from people go to community college and wind up with you know fifty sixty thousand\nDollars apiece crazy so this has\nJust gotten unreal um this is not\nThis is not your father's a college environment you know it used to be that you could pay for tuition\nBy working a summer job or maybe a summer job in a part time job during college well you know those days are long gone um the colleges have gotten so brazen with the amount that they charge a and I should say their own salaries as well it's it's just stupid flying\nLet's go to Joe truck driving in Indiana that get us started Hey Joe go ahead\nGeorge tile and good thank you\nGeorge got good news for you too man a throw rally over there and a lot of the other day\nYeah there was a big signs they throw support the sealed their\nFate or he left right after you hold that

under the ... the night and a private plane crashed on a mission to several years ago probably about seven years now you know and it was a sad time but ah pretty much went under and they laid everybody off\nAnd I was one of those people too so I helped her job over here and I found one but they wouldn't even let alone as fast as I didn't have that little piece of paper saying that I'm there without doing well and I think also for ... years you know\nYou probably in more and more experienced than most people\nThere and I looked at the local schools they were to forty four thousand dollars just to go for oh I I think it was up to her horse\nJust don't take well you know it's like they're away\nSo I ended up going out and I spent thousands of dollars on the grades are learning to drive semi thrive\nAnd then I felt like I got shafted on those I found out that I could have done it for about half the price now they've been\nA let's get your reaction to this is Ellen what do you think a trade schools well\nYou know even trade schools are participating in the student loan program these days and so the prices of trade schools are getting jacked through the roof or as well you know when you have this landing system stand behind these schools\nYou know they can charge almost what they want because there's all this quote unquote free money out there and so for guys that want to pay out of pocket you know what are they supposed to do they can't compete with that\nUh and it's just a travesty it's it's really shutting more people out of getting an education even at even provoke Texan other trade schools are as it is you know allowing them to actually go to college which was the intent of the lending program in the first place\nTo go to Gordon sorry to hear the Gordon

they in in and around consolidation ... read the action program and I'm kind of concern and right now I'm On a ... based repayment program\nAnd I have no idea what that is that that was going to ask if he had heard of it is comedy or and\nIt was like a scam Jimmy Allen doesn't it do you have student loans out there gene\nI Do I Do I got my first time you know trying to work on my bachelors\n... well what ... what these companies do these companies somehow have the ability whether they buy the list or not but they find your name and they know you have a student loan and in many cases Allen aren't they scammers\nYes there are a lot of scammers out there and I haven't heard of this UTSA company but there are a million of them and the sounds exactly like just another one where they're looking for two things they're looking for people who are in the fall that they can ushered through\nThis loan rehabilitation a scam that I described earlier where they\nMake you sign for a much larger loan and then get a commission off the top of that or or they're just trying to get you to read your your loans and ... surgery or consolidate your loans or otherwise refinance your loans into a new again larger loan or and make a commission off of that\nSo I Would I Would rip that thing up because it sounds like it's not worth the paper it's written on\nJames truck driving in Texas first time caller Hi James go ahead sir how they're\nGeorge it's pleasure to speak with you on your way I loved your reading of upgrade Allan Poe's tell tell\nA job thank you and I hope we hear more of it before Halloween that point though I'm\nA very interesting I've I've just had a my loans and all for a little over a decade maybe Fifteen Years and they fell off on my credit report and lo and behold this ... this is just last week I got a letter from a company called central research L L C\nI Hope you don't mind me mentioning mentioning them in particular a but their information is a hundred percent correct the principal was sixty four hundred and some change there's you know they're listed a breakdown of all of the uh uh costs that I've heard\nAnd I was wondering what advice you can give me do I try to negotiate directly with the video he tried to negotiate with these people have there's something like four thousand dollars in interest and also a few\nSounds like another scam Ellen what do you think\nRight I mean first of all I Would\nI Would never deal with a third party collection company you know unfortunately I don't have any great advice for defaulted borrowers because they're truly is known to give other than\nHelping us fight for age are twenty three sixty six and getting our bankruptcy writes back so that they can't steal from is legally a but certainly don't deal with third third party collection companies\nI'm the owner of you're alone is probably either a a guarantor or the department of education at this late date I suspect it's probably the department of education\nSo I mean if you can make an offer to them of a hundred and twenty percent\nOf the get alone he'll take it a fall dude you know that's something you you can do but certainly dealing with a very close to me like like what you describe it and they get\nThe information Ellen lucky said they had everything down to the penny how did they find these are public clearing house that has all these things out there\nNo more than likely they are sub contractors to either a guarantor or maybe directly to the federal government itself so the information they have is good um but I can tell you that dealing with them is only going to add to whatever price you wind up paying\nSo I definitely recommend I'm getting to the bottom of if you if you want to negotiate find the owner of the note rather than these third party collection companies because they're only going to add cost onto the process\nBy a friend that had alone with a company that went bankrupt you never heard from them again\nWell you have to be very careful these are zombie loans there are no statute of limitations for these loans so you may think alone went away maybe it went off your credit report like this gentleman but I'm telling you they will come back from the dead and you\nWouldn't even leaders down the line at least expect it\nThat's right yeah they all they are waiting in the wings to to balance a like a shark or whatever [noise] um that's the thing about not having statute of limitations these things can follow you literally to the grave\nWell what you need to do is just say send me a copy of my loan I'd be glad to talk with you and you know what Ninety percent of the time I bet they don't ...\nYeah that's right I'm I'm guessing that something like fifty percent particularly for older loans is probably even higher than that they do not have the original sign\nPromise not at all Allen once again thank you for the information truly enjoyed it up next aliens in the Pentagon homeboy

that same period yeah yeah that was fun you did a great job there thank you\nGreat job indeed aliens at the Pentagon I Love this title tell me more\nOkay it's essentially it is my new documentary that I put out to tell the story all off and leave and taking your credit Graham a cat but she can take July is that story and and really to\nTry and one document tree Patel as as fast as I can the entire story of US government don't want any relationship with this phenomenon or watch seven decades now\nLots of people have been talking about the Pentagon the CIA what's been going on there these new revelations that keep coming out Nick what do you think of them\nThey are absolutely staggering there's no doubt that this has been the biggest single revelation the UFO community I think decades I the only story that I think comes\nBy and I would say this wouldn't I is that the vacation and release of the British Government files but the the revelation that off to decades to know the U.S government did have a UFO program off to roll and it was run by the ... super secretive defense intelligence\nAgency I'm I'm an Asian feel that the day and and you're like hey for years they said no no since project we ... we haven't been doing this with no in traffic or no investigations\nAnd of course they were\nAnd that's what I really focused on in in the new film aliens at the end again to try to train on tango the numerous threat to the story and there are numerous threats I mean we've we've seen the videos we've seen the talk\nOf mistreatment both the all the different players involved and maybe we'll get into some of this robot big yellow a Senator Harry Reid charmed along I mean you couldn't make this stuff up\nNo you you can't make it up and how do you track all this stuff because it's coming from all different directions these days\nI think the answer to that one is it's very cautiously and very carefully and and absolutely and meticulous detail because I think the problem with the story in one sense\nFor years people have said the problem is that particularly with the gal them we have two little information about what's\nGoing on with the eight story with with these revelations\nWe almost have too much information and I think the public I mean it's just about a case for the deep specialists or is it difficult for them but for the public eye I think it's just the confusing man if you think back to when the New York times\nWhen they are they a landmark story on this on\nSixteen last year and then the the three videos came out to a than a than a third one but now the public have been absolutely bought it thinking yeah well this the videos and then there's this guy and then this millionaire businessman\nAnd and the struggling to see how it all fits together and say that that's what I've tried to do to take that back and and give people an overview of this from my incite a perspective of having run a similar program in the u._k.\nTold me a little bit more about the film we're getting a lot into it of course tonight it leads up the Pentagon but tell us specifically about your rule\nWell I took a lot on on on that one and it was quite a diversion for me usually I I just sit in the interview seat and then you've done this of course ... time his health you know you sit in the ... said a direct tech kind of talk\nTo you and you spend a couple of hours and and also the question I when you see the final product sometimes you think wow well you know I go edited down to a few soundbites and\nYou said put that but at the end and I wish they'd taken it out and I'm not sure I Would have told the story like that\nSo they only ends at the Pentagon ... did they fight teamed up with Warren ... from reality films and we essentially I had the the idea that I Would script that thing so scripted the entire movie I ... the I ... a million and a half thousand would I think he was\nScript for this and unfold in that way I have absolute control of this\nAnd then literally I went into a recording studio you know padded walls and headphones on and I knew right to it the whole thing and and then I sat down in front of a camera and did did parts of it too to camera and in that way\nIn that way although there is a direct to who's done a brilliant job of putting it all together I'm Mike alone I but I was very much in the driving seat having done the script and and in that same\nWhen we look at the final pro dog no one can well I Can't say gosh this this somehow didn't turn out the way I wanted it because I had my fingerprints on it from from start to finish and that's a departure for mayor dates a completely\nNew role to me I I there are people of course who are used\nTo this sort of thing uh people like Jeremy coal bellicose just made a a a great movie but um you know only I was a departure for may so took me to some interesting new territory\nWhat are you hoping to accomplish with\nFirstly I as I say really to try to\nGo through some of the the confusion about what's been going on and just how the complete story from from start to finish but another thing that I've I've tried to do this I think we've probably discussed this before but one of the big problems I think that\nThat this field has is\nIt we know young people are interested in in the subject but they don't go to many conferences and and you know it is difficult to engage with them\nSo by putting this out as video on demand we go ahead on to all the platforms\nThat the young people the watch these things on when they stream as many people do these days so it's on Amazon and iTunes and Google Play and food do and video and all those\nSorts of things so the the aim was to take this subject not not just to the conventional UFO conference crowd but but too young to get people and and another thing\nIs you know it's been a year since ... had his press conference where he\nGot together with the to the stars of people um and it's been nearly a year of course since the New York times\nWhen the story I I did ... or you know in some ways the story I think has pulled down a little bit so we'd aliens at the Pentagon don't want to reignite this and put it back where it absolutely belongs center stage and under the spotlight\nAnd how is this organization do nowadays like you like you said I I'm beginning to feel as if the momentum is waning what do you think\nThat when when you say the organization I'm E. E. T. I.\nRight yes um well that's very interesting question and the answer is no one knows because in in all of this\nThe U.S government has had forty two ways says in these sorts of situations only as little as possible\nAnd we we really have very few pieces of the puzzle from the government itself which is is pretty much profit because we don't frankly we don't even know whether a tip is still an ongoing project\nI I think people like Lou Elizondo ran it of course say yes it is it still has its mission\nIt still continues he of course all though he's resigned from the Pentagon and still has has a lot of contacts and friends that he he says it's still going now other people I think have disputed that and certainly we have been told that the\nAnd there were a lot of religious folks Nick that believe that\n[noise] yeah and and it it it's frustrating and a thin because and and it's almost ... clay ironic in another way that that you know you have a bunch of people\nIn in the ... the the the IRA elsewhere and and in the u._k. and the ministry of defense you got a bunch of people who thought yeah this we're dealing with a real phenomenon\nAnd we should be investigating it researching it in a proper scientific manner and we come up again skepticism and you might think well that's fine that's that's what you'd expect um\nBut that skepticism isn't the soil to Nicole\nOr intellectual\nA human that skepticism that I think most people I associate with that concept it's actually it it's a\n... probably trying to do the trick been skepticism itself I mean it to to have effectively the so called UFO skeptics in the end picking 'em\nSay that they don't they don't believe in extraterrestrials but they believe these things demonic quality just in one sense it's swapping one on your plate fringe belief for another so we'll these ... these people were skeptical told\nThey would believe that they would you believe us in some some great Warren happen with angels and demons\nNick we're going to take a break we'll come back and chat more right here on the coast to coast or you\nKnow you can you show up dates in tune with other ... would you do in the ... stadium Facebook page just go to ... dot com slash goes to go see him and the like button [noise]\n\n\n[noise] ... was very very big surprise\nVote coming November six in the mid term elections you search\nAnything is stages job down\nDesigned for information right now\nSeven Ninety\nNow a year in rocks spotlight Seventy three November Seventy ... second album use a minor\nEighty thousand dollars signaling the downfall of one of the most of the police criminals Nineteen twenties and thirties\nBegan serving his time the U.S ... century in Atlanta but amid accusations that he was the leading the system and receiving cushy treatment he was transferred to the maximum security lockup Alcatraz Island in California San Francisco bay he got out\nEarly in Nineteen thirty nine for good behavior like my health problems for the rest of his life component died in Nineteen forty seven and eight forty eight at his home these island Florida\nThis week and I used to be a Chevrolet began to sell a car truck hybrid city calls emails amino inspired by the food ranchero which already met on the market for years the el camino was a [noise]\n\n[noise] but I never heard them ringing\nNo one never heard them into\nThe will to [noise]\nAh well in the sky but I never saw ...

of congressional hearings would you think could happen it could happen when\nI'm I suspect now it will be next year because of of course we've we've just had the bruising judge Kavanaugh um ...\nComing up to the midterms but as I say we know the Senate Armed Services Committee and the house armed services committee have been looking for his ... ha it\nHave been doing and secondly I think that interest has said wait until the white a question of you ate pays\nMore generally we actually know in parallel that that a representative Amy para I think it was a has had some discussions with the chair of of the uh science technology and space committee and the space\nSubcommittee that could actually be a little bit of a don't fight about that I mean that's another point if this congressional interest which we know Israel\nEvolves into formal congressional hearings the question arises will where should those hearings the\nAs I say should they should they sit in the armed Services Committee or in the\nThe space subcommittee or the the science technology and space\nMain committee I think I think it will be difficult to get it away from the middle of tree frankly it was a a military and intelligence program and I I just can't see how you would get it\nOut of of the armed Services Committee and indeed\nOne of the subcommittee is is is the emerging threats and capabilities\nSubcommittee which specifically talks and it terms of reference about unconventional threats will if ever there was a ... a forum to to discuss the UAE pay a mystery it's it's ...\nSo so you you know I I think it ... we know as an absolute indisputable fact\nThat there is congressional in traffic we know that there is lobbying going on for formal hearings I've actually I Can't say too much about this but I I supplied some briefing myself and I've certainly set that might be I'm happy to to testify if my own experience of having done this for the British Government\nWould be useful um but but watch this space one of the other things\nWhich I think is is bizarre and fascinating is I think so far they haven't really been\nFor a national daily newspaper reports that have actually gone into the fight but yes there is this congressional interest in UFOs and you know war all four of those articles or in British newspapers\nAmong us one us no not yet no\nNo thank God we do what we do and we have so many good pot jesters out there doing what they do to get the word on there\nI absolutely but but this is going to transition into the mainstream and and just this week fortunate play only got the chance one one of the things is I Know do some work as a freelance journalist myself ah it it's kind of like like we said with a million of penned again\nYou know if you don't like the way that you you are portrayed on TV sometimes right you're right in documentary well I I take the same view with newspaper articles and this this week I had an article published in the guardian newspaper which is is one of the most respected national daily nearing\nAgreed on line or two\n... yeah I absolutely as they all have to be these days and and my my article in the guardian basically\nUm I expose this the Senate Armed Services Committee and House Armed Services Committee interest and I I think that things will be going on behind the scenes as a result of that article but it it's it's staggering but have before articles\nI've seen about this all four of them a great ... one US\nI'd love to see a survey by the way you just mentioned the Internet on line or I'd love to see a survey of twenty five to thirty in that category who read a newspaper every day as opposed to going online and I bet it's like Ninety percent on line\nI'm sure you're right I mean I'm of course all of the age where I like a hard copy a newspaper in my hand and when I write things you know I I used to get disappointed like when somebody said oh it's it's certainly ... but now I guess my ... my reaction should be well great like\nGets it gets the attention [laughter] absolutely\nAll right let's go to the phones Brian in Indianapolis east of the Rockies say Brian\nHey George morning hey good to talk to you again hey hey\nAh first of all you had that you'll put up the show about a special report about working less in being at home and you know I got I got got co signed for student

number fourteen or something like that to come out in the ... the\nThey they they sign they said they scientifically prove the UFO didn't eat this now you said earlier that the some of the believers

you'd\nWork thanks Bryan will not talk to you too I'm trying to get time to do a live show in Indianapolis perhaps the next year if we can pull that off I think he was also talking about Nick the con didn't report\nYes um that that was um of course widely regarded now as a bit of a ... job and I think quite rightly the U.S air force made it quite clear that they wanted just to get out of the UFO\nOr at least they want it to the public out and and that's another point that we make in in the documentary aliens Pentagon really the winding up of project Blue Book um which was kind of just like the program went dark\nAnd of course this is the famous uh Poland a memo\nWhich which says the UFO reports which could affect national security are all made a in accordance with I think it's a chain up one for six and ... part of the blue book system\nSo so in other words the clue with there all along that that you ate he reports that had national security implications we're never going to be in the public program of Blue Book anyway\nNo that's a good point Nick since you've been doing this and you've been doing this for how long now how many years\nWell my goodness ah I guess I was

I should add so that's a a something that makes this a predatory lending system by definition\nAre their predatory lending laws in the various states\nThere are there are state use three laws are in every state in the union and federal student loans are exempted from all of them [laughter] there are also fair\nDebt collection practice laws federal um a truth and lending laws uh and these again are restricted or completely remove a for the case of federal student loans\nWho came up with this scam [noise] well the genesis of this the\nGenesis of this really comes back to sort of a swamp the beltway cabal of bankers ah which included a it started with a company called Sallie Mae which was a government sponsored entity back in the seventies [noise]\nUh and by the way one of your other guests who appears on your program frequently Catherine Austin fits yes served on the board of Sallie Mae back when it was actually controlled by the government and she was there right at the nexus of when this company went from being a publicly sponsored enterprise\nTo a holy private for profit enterprise and she can tell you many of the stories about people like Albert Lord a bill defender for in other executives at Sallie Mae who had no interest in serving the public and at\nEvery interest in making money off of this system\nSo you can point to Sallie Mae and um they're very deserving also other groups like the consumer Bankers Association [noise]\nAh like many of the state run Gehring tours in the country um like USA Funds these people were all in it for themselves and they saw an opportunity to make money and they did everything they could\nTo make these loans as oppressive as possible and here we are twenty Thirty years later living a under than the fruits of their labor\nWhat do you recommend for parents who use child is ready to graduate from high school and they want to go to college\nWell the the only good advice that I can give it at this point George is do not borrow and if you have to borrow\nDo not borrow from a student loan company so don't borrow federal student loans don't borrow private student loans from a bank you know that they were they were technically it is called a student loan\nBecause as soon as you call it a student loan federal or private\nYou lose bankruptcy writes a and for federal loans you lose statute of limitations you lose fairly collection practices truth in lending a state use three laws all the all the rights all the consumer protections that I mentioned\nUm so really don't borrow is the best advice I can have but if you absolutely have to borrow go to a private bank get any private line of credit\nUh and do it that way because at least then you'll have you know every consumer protection that exists for every other type of loan\nWhatever happened in the days of scholarship so they still being awarded to people\nWell you know Georgia of course scholarships and grants are still out there but the colleges have been raising their prices so astonishingly much that you know no amount of ground serves even state funding et cetera can keep up with their budgets um you know I was\nJust in Syracuse recently in the price to go to Syracuse University is now Seventy thousand dollars a year well I can guarantee ... per year that's tuition room board books um for for your course\nFor a four year college and by the way it no longer takes for years to graduate George the average time to graduate from undergrad it's now six point two year what happened\nAgain the colleges are sitting in the ... seat they can't because there's this lending program standing behind the whole thing and the federal government and the other lenders are willing\nTo polish much dead on the backs of students as possible the colleges have carte blanche to not only raise their prices but also really string the students out and keep them in college for as long as they can possibly do it [noise]\nIt's it's the time is getting longer the pre your cost is just floating and that's why we're seeing these just insane storied where people are graduating with\nYou know a million dollars in debt ... there was a story just recently we're losing a guy walked out of school with a million dollars in student loans\nNo wonder dental uh the belt bills are so high\nThat's right you know and and just really hurts the broader economy when you have one point six trillion dollars in debt strapped onto our younger workers just out of college um after charge huge amounts just to pay out that burden\nAnd you know we're seeing comments from people like Jamie diamond a gp Morgan Chase and William deadly at the New York Federal Reserve bank and many others are about how the student loan problem\nReally affecting the broader economy I mean when you have Ninety million dollars in interest clicking off that's Ninety million dollars where people aren't buying homes cars they're not starting businesses scaling entrepreneurship uh it's really starting to be filled\nAll right we're going to check in with you with phone calls with ... college when we come back if you've got a student loan give us a call if you've got a question give us a call\nIf you're an instructor at a university and you want to just give us your feedback on that give us a call as well we'll be back in the moment with Ellen calling

turkey the president told vox business\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nWelcome back to close to ... with us we're going to take your calls as we talk about the student loan scam what was it Allen that made you get involved in this\n[noise] oh well I had a um I had student loans I have three ... and um\nI graduated and found myself unemployed underemployed for short amount of time uh and I tried everything I could keep my loans in good stead through to ferment forbearance cetera uh but what I fell into and what a\nProbably forty percent of everybody out there with student loans is falling into a is a lineage system that actually want you to fall so they will lose your paperwork\nThey will give you bad information they'll baffle em bamboo and compel your loans to default which is what happened to me in my loans very quickly doubled or tripled with penalties and interest and\nAnd so I started doing research and what I found was just astonishing uh I took my my ... my findings to first Fortune Magazine ah and then I wound up top story on sixty minutes\nA and this was a peace with Leslie stall yeah a a piece for which Sallie Mae and the federal government we used to be interviewed I might add a and so it was sort of snowball from there a right of course\nAnd I thought this was going to be maybe a two or three year project\nTo get you know justice on this matter a but here we are low and behold Thirteen Years later and Congress has not moved one inch and I'm hopeful that'll change very near future because the numbers have become just so astonishing uh but you know we're going to need a lot of help from the people out there whose lives this is affecting\nWhy isn't Allen that people who have a rough credits or have a a very difficult time to make payments\nSeemed to be the ones that get the short end of the stick and by that I mean a you've got these payday loans that are outrageous and predatory are that are geared more for people who need some money and you know they're having a tough time you've got these student loans situations and one of the worst icy or these um\nSecondary car market a lenders who will finance people who really can't afford a car because they have to have a vehicle so they'll financed them\nWith just what you said they want to default so what they'll do is they'll say All right I Want five hundred dollars down you can buy this used car\nAnd so the person the poor person gives them the five hundred dollars\nKeeps a car for a couple of months makes payments for a couple of months then defaults the car gets repossessed and they sell the car for the same amount of money if not the ... this is not more and with financing and they do it all over again and they make more money on it\n[noise] yeah that's right you know that that's a great analogy George and you know I I make a similar analogy off and I say you know student loans it's like buying a car where you pick it out you bite on line and say you know look it's has great reviews you go and so you buy online you go to go to the dealership and you pick up the car\nAnd you're driving out of the dealership and all of a sudden you realize that the car has no breaks and you wind up in the ditch\nAnd you go back to the dealership and you're like hey guys you know as far as know breaks what's going on and they go well hey buddy you know what can we tell you\nYou should or read the manual because this car comes with no breaks you know [laughter] uh and this in fact is really what's going on with student loans and particularly is used as you rightly say for lower income people um\nYou know a ... what we're seeing particularly in past ten years or so is these sort of fly by night an expensive for profit colleges are marketing very heavily to um you know disadvantaged uh\nUnder privileged people\n... yeah under privileged people people who weren't born with a silver spoon in their mouth and they're getting a horrible sort of a nonsensical education's just a joke a and lo and behold they get saddled with the loans uh and this rex their life um\nI mean they should be getting more interest rates better financing deals but because their credit shots and they don't have the ability to make the payments the way most people do they get the short end of the stick and that's very wrong\nYeah you know it's a it's a real cruel irony and and just in general you know there are means test for student loans in the first place so the only people the people that get student loans and it's about\nI mean let's be honest is about Seventy percent of everybody who goes to college winds up with student loans but still this is a a um a an economically needy group of people who you know don't have a silver spoon in their mouth and\nHow cruelly ironic is that is these very people that the ... system was supposed to help\nUh and it's essentially wrecking their lives you know the default rate across all borrowers by my best estimates is over fifty percent\nAs Raziq greasy once once the tuition like in Harvard or Yale\nA it's a it's on a par with the the number I mentioned for Syracuse early is probably Seventy or Seventy thousand Seventy Seventy five thousand dollars a year\nAnd there are even more schools by the way um but uh yeah the the ivy leagues are running you know they'll they'll be up at a hundred thousand per year within\nSay a couple three or four years I should have pushed my kids into sports when they were younger so they get scholarships to go to university smart\nYeah that's right well you know even scholarships really won't pay the freight anymore I mean the price even at state schools were seen annual cost of attendance of thirty plus thousand dollars a and\nYou know the scholarships really have an increased uh on that scale and and so it's you know unless you get a full ride it's a very tough proposition to go to even a state school these days you know we're we're getting stories from people go to community college and wind up with you know fifty sixty thousand\nDollar she's crazy so this has just\nGotten unreal um this is not\nThis is not your father's a college environment you know it used to be that you could pay for tuition\nBy working a summer job or maybe a summer job and a part time job during college well you know those days are long gone um the colleges have gotten so brazen with the amount that they charge a and I should say their own salaries as well it's it's just stupid flying\nLet's go to Joe truck driving in Indiana that get us started Hey Joe go ahead\nGeorge high on a\nGood thank you [noise]\nThey got good news for a man a Trump rally over there and a lot of the other day\nYeah there was a big fines they throw at least according to see all day\nAnd he looked right at the whole ... oh [laughter]\nI Love it but uh anyway I I I wanted to gripe a little bit of trades will do a ... a former company I used to work or I got trained on egg wildly\nAnd when a company went under the under the company I'm a private plane crashed on a mission to several years ago probably about seven years now you know and it was a sad time but uh we pretty much went on during the late everybody off\nAnd I was one of those people do so I didn't know her job over here and I found one but they wouldn't even let alone as fast as I didn't have that little piece of paper saying that I'm there with all due oh and I think well over ... years and\nYou probably in more than ... you had more experience than most people\nYeah and I looked at the local school there and they were voting for thousands of dollars that go it for oh I think it was a two month course\nJust on well you know it's like they're away\nSo I ended up going unless ... ... dollars on the grades are learning to drive semi thrive\nAnd then I felt like I got ... on that I found out that I could have gone up about half the price that even\nA let's get your reaction to this zone where do you think of trade schools\nWell you know even trade schools are participating in the student loan program these days and so the prices of trade schools are getting jak through the roof or as well you know when you have this landing system stand behind these schools\nYou know they can charge almost what they want because there's all this quote unquote free money out there and so for guys that want to pay out of pocket you know what are they supposed to do they can't compete with that\nUh and it's just a travesty it's it's really shutting more people out of getting an education even at even provoke tax and other trade schools are as it is you know allowing them to actually go to college which was the intent of the lending program in the first place\nTo go to Gordon sorry to hear the Gordon and Lakeland, Florida have already go ahead\nHey thank you for taking my call 'em I Want to publicly thank gallon he the one pointed out to me\nThat the lack of bankruptcy protecting encourages

I'm Sorry all\nThis year I Would just be careful maybe ... or something dogs are pretty smart\nDog reads a mom and dad are golden retrievers then they're excellent guard dog they found like Savage that they're just in general they conveyed by it I said my sanity you know and especially talking about isn't alone and thank you for asking George sure\nAnd my question is I just got this thing in the mail today friend didn't even have on the time ... label where it was fine and it said in the big ladders final noted\nNever heard from the company but its current unified document services and saying you didn't have around consolidation ... read the action program\nAnd I'm kinda can turn on right now I'm On a ... fan base repayment program and I have no idea what they did that that was going to ask if you heard of it is comedy or and\nAgain to me Allen doesn't it do you have student loans out there gene\nI Do I Do I got my first time you know trying to work on my bachelors\n... well what ... what these companies do these companies somehow have the ability whether they buy the list or not but they find your name and they know you have a student loan and in many cases Allen aren't the scammers\nYes there are a lot of scammers out there and I haven't heard of this year's company but there are a million of them and this sounds exactly like just another one where they're looking for two things they're looking for people who are in the fall that they can assure through\nThis loan rehabilitation a scam that I described earlier where they\nMake you sign for a much larger loan and then get a commission off the top of that uh or they're just trying to get you to read your your your loans and ... surgery or consolidate your loans or otherwise refinance your loans into a new again larger alone a and make a commission off of that\nSo I Would I Would rip that thing up because it sounds like it's not worth the paper it's written on\nJames truck driving in Texas first time caller Hi James go ahead sir\nHi George it's pleasure to speak with you on your way I loved your reading of a growing pose a failed hill\nHuh that job thank you and I'm hoping to hear more of it before Halloween that point though I'm\nA very interesting I've I've just had a my loans and all for a little over a decade maybe Fifteen Years and they fell off on my credit report and lo and behold the same way this is just last week I got a letter from a company called central research L L C\nI Hope you don't mind me mentioning mentioning them in particular a but their information is a hundred percent correct the principal was sixty four hundred and some change there's you know they're listed a breakdown of all of the costs that I've ever heard\nAnd I was wondering what advice you can give me do I tried to negotiate directly with the video he tried to negotiate with these people I mean there's something like four thousand dollars in interest and also a few\nSounds like another scam Ellen what do you think\nRight I mean first of all I Would I Would\nNever deal with a third party collection company you know unfortunately I don't have any great advice for defaulted borrowers because they're truly is known to give other than\nHelping us fight for H. are twenty three sixty six and getting our bankruptcy rates back so that they can't steal from is legally a but certainly don't deal with third and third party collection companies\nI'm the owner of you're alone is probably either a a guarantor or the department of education at this late date I suspect it's probably the department of education\nSo I mean if you can make an offer to them of a hundred and twenty percent\nOf the get alone he'll fall through the you know that's something you you can do but certainly dealing with a very close to me like like what you describe it and they get\nThe information Ellen like you said they had everything down to the penny how did they find these are public clearing house that has all these things out there\nNo more than likely they are sub contractors to either a guarantor or maybe directly to the federal government itself so the information they have is good um but I can tell you that dealing with them is only going to add to whatever price you wind up paying so\nI definitely recommend I'm getting at the bottom of if you if you want to negotiate find the owner of the note rather than these third party collection companies because they're only going to cost onto the process\nBut my friend that had alone with the company that went bankrupt you never heard from them again\nWell you have to be very careful these are some beat loans there are no statute of limitations for these loans so you may think alone went away maybe it went off your credit report like this gentleman but I'm telling you they will come back from the dead [laughter] and\nWhen you release down the line at least expect it\nThat's right yeah they they are waiting in the wings to to balance a like a shark or whatever [noise] um that's the thing about not having statute of limitations you can follow you literally to the grid\nWell what you need to do is just say send me a copy of my loan I'd be glad to talk with you and you know what Ninety percent of the time I bet they don't have ...\nYeah that's right I'm I'm guessing that something like fifty percent typically order loans is probably even higher than that they do not have the original shine\nProblem [laughter] not at all Allen once again thank you for the information truly enjoyed it up next aliens and the Pentagon

there thank you\nGreat job indeed aliens at the Pentagon I Love this title tell me more\nOkay it's essentially a ... minute documentary that I put out to tell the story all off and leave and taking your credit gram but to take your life that story and and really to\nTry in one document tree Patel as fast as I can tell that story of the U.S government don't want any relationship with this phenomenon watch seven decades now\nLots of people have been talking about the Pentagon the CIA what's been going on there these new revelations that keep coming out Nick what do you think of them\nThey are absolutely be staggering the town that has been the biggest thing go wherever they are the UFO community I think that the only story that I think come\nLife and I would say this wouldn't if the tea classification release of the British Government files but the the revelation that off two decades to know the U.S government did have a new effort program after all when it was run by the ... super secretive defense intelligence\nAgency I'm I'm an Asian feel that the other day and and you're like hey for years they said no no since project people close down we haven't been doing this with no in traffic or no investigation\nAnd of course they were and that's what I really focused on in in the new film aliens the Pentagon to try to train on angle the numerous threat\nTo the story and there are numerous threats I mean we've we've seen the videos we've seen the talk of mistreatment both they're all the different players involved and maybe we'll get into some of this Robert Bigelow Senator Harry Reid charmed along and you couldn't make this stuff up\nNo you you can't make it up and how do you track all this stuff ... because it's coming from all different directions these days\nI think the answer that one is it's very cautiously and very carefully and and absolutely in meticulous detail because I think the problem with the story in one for you people have said the\nProblem is that particularly with the album we have two little information about what's\nGoing on with the eight story with with\nThe revelation [noise] ah we almost have too much information and I think the public I mean it's just about a case for the deep specialists or is it difficult for them but for the public eye I think it's just a confusing mess if you think back to when the New York times\nWhen their their landmark story on this on\nThe sixteenth floor chair and then the the three\nYears came out to first than a than a third one but now the public has been absolutely bombarded there thinking yeah well this the videos and then there's this rock stone guy and then this this ... millionaire businessman\nAnd and they're struggling to see how it all fits together and so that's that's what I've tried to do to take a step back and and give people an overview of this from my end Slater perspective of having run a similar program in the u._k.\nTold me a little bit more about the film we didn't want in the course tonight Pentagon specifically about\nWell I took a logs on on on the one and it was quite a diversion for me usually I I just sit in the interview seeds and and you've done this of course civilian times yourself you know you just sit in the ... said a direct tech kind of\nTalks to you and you spend a couple of hours and and onto the questions and when you see the final product sometimes you think wow well you know I\nGo edited down to a few soundbites and I wish they'd put it in and I wish they'd taken it out and gosh I'm not sure I Would have told the story like that\nSo they only ends at the Pentagon and what I did fight teamed up with Warren ... from reality films and we essentially I had the the idea that I Would script that thing so I scripted the entire movie I ... the I ... a million and a half thousand would I think he was\nScript for this and unfold in that way I have absolute control of this\nAnd then literally I went into a recording studio you know padded walls and headphones on and I knew right to it the whole thing\nAnd and then I sat down in front of a camera and did did parts of it too to Cameron in that way\nIn that way although there is a direct to who's done a brilliant job of putting it all together I'm Mike alone I but I was very much in the driving see having done the script and and in that sense\nWhen we look at the final pro dog no one can well I Can't say gosh this is somehow didn't turn out the way I wanted it because I had my fingerprints on it from from start to finish and that's a departure for me it's a completely\nNew role to me I I there are people of course who are used\nTo this sort of thing uh people like Jeremy coal bellicose just made a a a great movie but um you know only I was a departure for may so took me to some interesting new territory\nWhat are you hoping to accomplish\n[noise] firstly I as I say really to try to\nGo through some of the the confusion about what's been going on and just how the complete story from from start to finish but another thing that I've I've tried to do this I think we've probably discussed this before but one of the big problems I think that\nThat this field has is\nIt we know young people are interested in in the subject but they don't go to many conferences and and you know it is difficult to engage with them\nSo by putting this out as video on demand\nWe go on to all the platforms that the young people the watch these things on when they stream as many people do these days so it's on Amazon and iTunes and Google Play and food do and video and all those\nSorts of things so the the aim was to take this subject not not just to the conventional UFO conference crowd but but to young people and and another thing\nIs you know it's been a year since termed along ... had his press conference where he\nGot together with the to the stars of people um and it's been nearly a year of course since the New York times\nRan a story I I did ... or you know in some ways the story I think has pulled down a little bit so we'd aliens at the Pentagon when to reignite this and put it back where it absolutely belongs center stage and under the spotlight\nAnd how is this organization do nowadays like you like you said I I'm beginning to feel as if the momentum is waning what do you think\nThat when when you said the organization I'm E. E. T.\nRight yes I Am well that's very interesting question and the answer is no one knows because in in all of that\nThe U.S government has said they'd always says in the ... situations only as little as possible and we we really have very few pieces of the puzzle\nFrom the government itself which is is pretty much profit because we don't frankly we don't even know whether a tip is still an ongoing project\nI I think people like Lou Elizondo ran it of course say yes it is it still has its mission it still continues he of course all though he's resigned from the Pentagon and still has\nHas a lot of contacts and friends that he he says it's still going now are the people I think have disputed that and certainly we have been told that the\nIn the book if ... if I think it is where it refers to say as being the print some power of the air and match I think he's where a lot of these conservative religious\nPeople dead the idea that UFOs might beat them on it\nAnd there were a lot of religious folks Nick that believe that\nYes and and it it it's frustrating in a sense because and and it's almost ... combing Klee ironic in another way that that you know you have a bunch of people\nIn in the cod that the IRA swear and and in the u._k. and the ministry of defense had a bunch of people who thought yeah this we're dealing with a real phenomenon\nAnd we should be investigating it researching it in the proper scientific manner and we come up against skepticism you might think well that's fine that's that's what you'd expect um\nBut that skepticism isn't the sort of\nNicole or intellectual or humanists skepticism that I think most people I associate with that concept it's actually it's a\nDeep probably trying to build the trip and skepticism itself I mean it to to have effectively the so called UFO skeptics in the Pentagon um\nSay that they don't they don't believe in extraterrestrials but they believe these things that the money well it's just in one sense it's swapping one arguably fringe belief for another so we'll at least by these people were skeptical told\nThey will believe this but they would you believe us in some some great Warren having with angels and demons\nNick we're going to take a break we'll come back in ... more right here on coast to coast or you\nKnow you can get you updates ... would you do in the ... they just go to the book Doug ...
