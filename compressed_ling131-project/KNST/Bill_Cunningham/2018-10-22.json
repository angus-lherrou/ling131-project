Research Center ... well ... all one of my buddies\nEvery few months as the media coverage is Ninety two percent negative Ninety five percent negative the media is protected by the U.S constitution only business in America that gets constitutional protection the media should call balls and strikes a lot of good stuff a lot of bad stuff why does the media only report the bad enough the good\nThey only report the bad and this administration the Obama administration you would think that our economy is growing at four percent and we had more Americans working than any other time\nIn our nation's history they've conflated those to see the Trump agenda is not what the mainstream media wants to talk about\nI here's a great example just last week I think it was a President Trump did an interview with Lesley Stahl for sixty minutes she interrupted him sixty five times during that interview to put that in comparison when sixty\nMinutes during an interview with bronco bomb or a couple of years ago they interrupted him four times and they have their own agenda their agenda is to make the president look bad\nNot to give him the credit that he deserves for the successes that he's had because they're no longer in the business of reporting the news and they're now in the business of making the news and that's the big change over the last two decades\nCorey Lewandowski the president or the other night in Montana framed in his mob versus jobs the only difference is the immune to Jay and I think that's brilliant on his part because one look at Brett Kavanaugh\nAlong about a trucks that ever Trump sticker on getting burned I look at congressman getting shot I look at a Republican congressman Republican operatives getting beat up and getting stuck into side with and\nI look at how you're confronted in airports in restaurants mobs versus jobs and do you think the average American I think forty percent of what the president forty percent oppose him there's twenty percent going back and forth do you think that the moniker of the president mobs versus jobs is going to stick\nI think it will stick because what the American people see and hear what people like Eric Holder had to say very recently when they're down we kick them and we kick them in the head you know the the calls to violence\nBy the leaders of the Democratic party whether it's a Maxine Waters or other is saying if you see them in a gas station if you see them in a restaurant you go after them you don't give them a break\nYou know that's not the way our country is supposed to be\nAnd I didn't support proper Obama but never ever ever did I ever remember Republicans or conservatives for that matter going after members of the previous administration when they're eating dinner at a restaurant we've now seen it with Sarah Huckabee Sanders we've seen with secretary Nielsen ... we've seen with Senator Ted Cruz we've seen what happened to Congressman Steve ...\nWhere he almost lost his life because the mob violence say\nAntifa is so out of control there you go on their desire is destruction it's not to make our country better this president has created I think\nOver for a million new jobs in the last Twenty one months and that's where we should be doing look even if you don't want\nThis president if he didn't want him to succeed you want him to succeed because you want our country and succeed and that's what the differences that Democrats I hate to say this they hate this president more than they love their country\nOr the other issue the culturally acceptable didn't mean to fame and to make fun of an industry or the president and the first lady you may recall about a week ago TI who's a rapper that I Will watch\nNonetheless I saw it on TMZ I did a video in which a look alike millennia Trump was stripping nude in the oval office performing sex act in the oval office and it was culturally acceptable to do that I'm sure you might sell a lot of\nLot of his songs and records not can you imagine three years ago if a country artist\nHad depicted Michelle Obama stripping naked in the oval office and performing sex acts in the oval office what would the outcry from the media have been if it was Michelle Obama\n... it would be front page news for a week on end that wrap that the the country artist\nWould have had his life probably threatened on multiple occasions but look let's go back to just again about a week ago Hillary Clinton gave an interview about her husband and his relationship with Monica Lewinsky and they asked her\nDo you think that relationship was inappropriate and less than two weeks ago her answer was no it was appropriate because she was an adult he was the president of the United states\nLeader of the free world Monica Lewinsky was an intern and Hillary Clinton is still justifying her husband's behavior can you imagine for one second that was the the converse if Donald Trump had done that with\nHow she stole the last election from Bernie Sanders right we'll put those back and plays shivering this system just like she did it last time and she'll lose worse\nShe did a great job great job by Corey Lewandowski will do it

Mexico there right now is three to five thousand strong and they're heading toward the Texas border this is a terrible event for the Democrats over the next two weeks before the election they have the video and the pictures of thousands of migrants\nWhenever I watch MSNBC all I hear about is women and children\nThen I see the video of these migrants coming to urban areas in America and they're almost always young males and the young women tend to be raped or sexually molested the men are drug meals and I'm sure there's good family members among them and Kevin Jackson of you and your wife and your children were in uh\nWe're in Honduras and the bill Cunningham and my wife and kids were in and we're in Honduras living the horrors of socialistic left wing military hunter regime the first thing I Would want to do would be to get to a ...\nThe coverage of our media indicates that uh they're joining it up against the Trump stir our media believes that somehow that this event with tens of thousands of individuals coming from those violent countries on earth is a net negative for the president I Do not believe that\nI think the main reason that Trump won the presidency and twenty sixteen and that Republicans will keep the house and when to keep the house and the Senate in about two weeks will be the fact that this immigration issue is you want to remind Americans what's at stake in this election\nAnd uh the coverage tonight on the nightly news and tomorrow or Monday Tuesday and Wednesday or you're going to be the same it's going to be terribly negative\nTowards Trump

Brett Kavanaugh having been\nConfirmed for the Supreme Court is very important because I think he is the road of the five of the five member majority would be interested in raining in the administrative state by cutting back on the activities and the rules that they're able to make\nCan you give me a concrete example and I think government agencies I think of the FCC I think the IRS but\nYou're telling me there's hundreds of government agencies bureaucrats about about one point two million strong new every day meeting offices mainly in Washington or all all over the country\nAnd then they got to do something they just can't sit there and drink coffee all day so they started not enacting rules because they want because they have some generic piece of legislation giving them real making powers and then they issue these three thousand new rules that day that must be complied with how much farmers are causing us\nWhere I think it's causing a lot of harm in the center for businesses of course\nIt creates a lot of regulations that they have to fight with compliance activities are very extensive for business is one of the estimates that I have in the book is that each near it car who really in dollars to comply with government regulations\nThough that ... trillion dollars actually gets passed on through all other Americans who are consumers of the of the products that businesses ... so\nThat an important factor in the fact that ... trillion dollars this more than the government actually ... ah either from this this is talk on the individual each year\nFor a very significant thing I'm Glad it can be turned back towel and be reduced give me\nThe idea here and described in the book is that the court can step in and begin to review carefully the legislation under which all of these rules are made and very frequently\nUm the rules are based on laws that were ... years ago sometimes generations ago and they are perpetrated by the administrative agency to give them the authority to all these new rules and the court\nLook at that legislation again and say wait a minute you're gone too far the Congress did not give you the authority that make this rule and there are a number of examples in the book where are you can see that the that the agency has gotten well beyond what Congress actually authorize so\nThe court is willing to step in and take those steps and that's what fortitude is necessary that's why the book is called ... do they have to have the strength\nOf character that go in and make these decisions that will turn down regulations of um of administrative agency then we can actually begin to reduce the amount of regulation and the rules have come out of Washington\nPeter Wallison let's go back in time did not hot summer in Philadelphia and Seventeen Ninety seven\nArticle one they said the founding fathers said and we believe that the Congress the house in the Senate or the most powerful instrument talent is a government

of the Chevron decision will Nineteen eighty four and because there isn't any a ruling from the Supreme Court says\nCongress cannot pass to the agencies its own legislative power that's a violation of

Nineteen eighty and twenty ... which is what a a thirty two year period reduced American economic growth by over twenty five percent\nWhich amounts to annually Thirteen thousand per person in America annually and so this is gigantic it's huge it's growing and the only entity that can truly stop it\nAnd the president can't stop at the Congress could stop it but they're fools and feckless

uh focus again\nOn the popularity of those books has overshadowed his original project but one that got him on the path of pursuing missing persons cases\nTen years ago next month they made his first appearance on this program with me to talk about the ... project\nA groundbreaking investigation into the big mystery and which Dave applied many of the techniques and strategies you learned as a

foot and wild man stories and news reports dating all the way back to the year's sixteen eighty\nAnd well I think David is probably not likely to take a position on what the answer to the mystery might be he has pulled together a pretty amazing collection of reports from eyewitnesses newspapers journalist hunters and others who've seen these creatures up close and personal ... welcome back\nHey George thanks again for having me I'm\nAbsolutely no good\nTimes on the show and I appreciate it\nSo returning to work on big but does it feel like you're dating your ex\n[laughter] it's a it's kind of odd just like you said it's it's always been doing in the background and it's something that's always had my interest I think it's an elusive topic that uh there's a lot of conjecture out there but not a lot of facts\nYou'd never stopped working on it does you know what I mean you're focused may have been elsewhere but it's always been sort of a you kept an eye out for articles and information\nYou know I Can't say that I've committed much energy to it in the last say seven eight years and focused on missing people but\nWhen you're going through the archives and you're trying to pull out articles about missing people I'm always reading about all kinds of things that I see on these first pages of news news articles and such and\nI started to come across these ah these stories about\nUm something that looked like big foot when you read the articles but when you read the title of it like Ninety percent of the time it will say wild man and I hadn't done a lot of archived work on the topic before but\nYou know eight years of digging through these archives for missing people articles I just started to pull them and put them in a folder and over the years that got large and eventually I said you know this is pretty intriguing I I think even if you're an optimist or a pessimist on the topic\nIt's it's convincing that something over the years has been around us\nAnd has been documented in and it shows the historical aspect that most people don't understand\nUm ... we're going to get into the specifics articles about big wild man and giants and sometimes they're the same and sometimes they're different but I wanted to just for those who were not listening ten years ago a when you were first year we kept the project how you got started on that what\nYou learned and what kind of got its hooks into you know all these years later\nSo I I never had a dog in the fight or I was working for a technology company I was getting ready to retire and raise a couple of kids and\nTo the guys I was working with that were super wealthy came to me and they sent me in this room and they told the story that independently without knowing each other when they were kids they had a big fund encounter in the mountains of the ...\nAnd they found each other later in business and you know we're sort of set a coincidence I started talking about Bigfoot and they found each other and and were shocked that they each had a similar encounter\nAnd they said you know Dave we you have Twenty years as a police officer or you have years of investigating an HR you're the guy really to give it that independent look will finance or you go about it at your own pace me no year for kids to raise that\nHelp us out with this we really we really want to find out\nAnd initially I said no and they kept coming back coming back and they said at your own pace you can do it\nSo I I Wonder about looking for an area that had a few things first of all I wanted Internet I needed a hotel and I knew that there was Native American history with the topic that ran deep and I needed it within say six to eight hour driving location from where I Lived at the time in Los Gatos California\nAnd I coordinate down the area to ... which is about thirty miles south of bluff creek where the Paterson given one film was made in sixty seven\nSo I started to do some geographical research some topic graphical some weather and I started to bring this together and then I\nWent up there and make contact with the group of police that a police background I approach them and they said hey maybe you can break down some doors for me\nI'm not going to I'm not going to stretch the truth I'm going to tell the truth and every witness that comes forward they're going to have to write an affidavit to what they saw under penalty of perjury\nAnd I wanted to raise the bar on the topic a little bit so that that would be no question about what was stated because they sign it and there'd be no question about it for the story was fabricated because it was done under perjury\nSo I I started that route and a couple of the cops there knew many of The Elders and this was so helpful and breaking down the doors
