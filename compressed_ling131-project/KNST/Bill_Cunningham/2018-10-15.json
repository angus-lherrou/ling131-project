was ridiculous about our hats and or a jacket that she wore\nAnd a fashion statement she was making it's just ridiculous how the media coverage that you know media Research Center and my friend Brent ... says it Ninety three percent of the media coverage of Trump is negative\nI think it's higher than that I don't recall with all these great things happening the media objectively covering the Trump Administration give me fifty fifty somebody stopped me the other day and said why do you think it is CBS NBC ABC or the New York times Washington Post every big city newspaper Hollywood movies too\nLate night comics throw one way and and I said I I guess it's groupthink because they all live in either Hollywood or New York\nBut but it can you imagine if CBS or ABC would say you know what we're going to go a different direction\nWe're going to start covering the news objectively we're going to have conservatives from top to bottom in America is a conservative country right thirty two states are controlled by ... a Republican governors house the Senate scream court we are basically a moderate to right wing or conservative\nWhat if CBS would say from top to bottom we're going to resolve well we're going to reflect conservative values and cover the news objectively\nI think those of us who are normal would flock to CBS News and the ABC NBC and CNN would take one Alabama hit the only one that is conservative more or less right now is Fox you know if they're leaning left quite often was Shepard Smith and people like that\nAnd you see what the ratings have Hannity are every night John draws about four million viewers every night so those kinds of interviews I just conducted was a regular event on CBS Evening news or ABC I give up any hope for NBC\nThose ratings would double and triple and it would become the dominant evening\nNewscast if somehow one of the other ones would say you know what from top to bottom we're going to reflect the values of people in this

you're like the hostage receiving president all the world they're coming in how important was to get back just religious leader who was being persecuted in Turkey\nWell he is and he's a great religious leader and it was a you know they accused him of things that he didn't do\nWhat we got him back and we got back I uh we got back many people actually if you look at it as like seems like all the time we're bringing back people and uh I Know President Obama pay one point eight billion or nothing to bring back a few people from around one point eight billion\nAnd uh we got back and he's going to be safe very shortly he's in the air just eat literally just took off\nAnd he'll be at the office he'll be in the oval office big welcome a big welcome yeah you know evangelical Christians everybody everybody wanted her back what happened to them was incredible and he was held hostage but now he's ah he's going to be happy I'm sure he's very happy right now\nAbout your wife is good she's a lawyer to Africa sure which was unbelievable what happened there talk about what was the goal and what was accomplished with Maloney in Africa well\nShe's a terrific first lady and a great human being and she wanted to go and see for herself Africa because we've heard so much\nAbout it some very good step but some very tough stuff in the sense of the way people live and she made forceps and she also went to the pyramids and Egypt and that was quite something special\nBut ah and the poverty is incredible you know the level of poverty it was very sad a beautiful in one way and very sad and and the kids were beautiful\nThey loved her and she came back and she said I Hope you're going to\nContinue to give a lot of money because they need it it's not a question of it's not a question of defense it's not a question of it it just touch on the human basis they need it and she had a big impact on me I Will tell you a bill she really had a big impact\nOn me and the other thing the mid west I looked at Canada Mexico and South Korea\nMillions of jobs have been credit and you were told a year or two ago by Gary Cohn and others that you know the candidate deals probably not going to happen Mexico's two top NAFTA is ingrained what did you do that caused Canada may not be real happy right now in Mexico may not be right in the south Korea\nTo kind of play because we're the big dog in the kennel but they don't treat it that way what did you do with the\nDeal and we're also the piggy bank that everybody wants to come and then Rob and uh Mexico we made a deal and we told him look otherwise we're going to have to just actually car industry which would have been bad for them and frankly I wouldn't have wanted to do it but we were going to do it and\nWe made a deal with Mexico we could not make a deal with Canada they just wouldn't make a deal that was fair for us because NAFTA was a total and complete disaster you know that better than Albany you saw what happened over here with all you still have building's empty will just everybody moved out\nI don't know what they were thinking so that's why I refused to call it NAFTA I said the deal with making I refused so we call it the U.S embassy a and it works good but we made a great deal is with everybody what happened then is Kennedy came along in the end\nWe were unable to make it I said we're going to tax you cars coming in and then what happened and they made a deal they made a deal they made a deal and it's a deal that we're very happy with I Hope they are very happy with hope everybody is but it's a fair deal for us and\nWe have now we just made a deal with South Korea which has spent much are much improved approved deal you know improved I Will say that Hillary Clinton you remember she made that deal and she said it's two hundred and fifty thousand jobs and she was right for South Korea so\nThey got two hundred and fifty we didn't get two hundred and fifty it was a terrible deal so essentially we terminated that deal and we made a new deal with South Korea\nSo how many jobs you're talking about talking about Canada Mexico we're talking about a million\nWhat you're talking about millions of jobs potentially don't forget we've opened up countries that were just totally close to right if you look at Canada we couldn't sell our dairy products out there and if we did it was a three hundred percent ... people don't talk about that you know if I put on a ten percent or twenty percent are are they make a big deal of if they have three hundred\nActually three hundred percent two hundred and Seventy five percent two hundred and eighty five percent these are the terrorists they charge so essentially that's a wall\nBecause if you have to pay a tariff like that you can't sell the product is so expensive so we've opened up Canada and we have a very good relationship now I think they respect us more than they did before\nBut now at least it's fair in our farmers are in love with it you see what's going on it's beautiful now we're working on China and we're working on the European Union which of absolutely taken advantage of our country and the European Union has been brutal and the way they took advantage of the United states for many years\nI mean they were formed to take advantage of the United states that was a reason they were formed\nHow can we how can we take from the United states\nSo the European Union they formed and they are they're very unfair to us they have barriers where we can't sell into their into into their countries\nThey have a tremendous tariffs that make it impossible and yet they still Mercedes Benz and BMWs by the millions they come in there and Indians and we charge him essentially no tax it's two and a half percent but for the most part they don't

you know I Love it a turtle turtle he's not here yet man he's late and I [noise]\nI've only counting of the great American thanks for listening tonight and I was always a kick to have on the president\nAnd the share his thoughts with you and uh I understand what's gonna happen a more frequently uh over the year twenty Nineteen and twenty twenty which I could not encourage\n... imagine this country imagine\nSome of the fallout and what about uh three weeks three weeks in a day or two if the Democrats take the Senate one consequence of that will be there would not be any federal judge has confirmed\nBy the U.S Senate over the next two years and won't happen and then if Trump is reelected and twenty twenty what'd you this point appears to be likely and the Senate stays democratic and twenty twenty when I come from any federal judges for the next two years or for the next two years after that\nSo we're looking at possibly a six year timeframe that the Democrats take the Senate when there are no federal judges confirmed by the United States Senate under Chuck Schumer thing about that and the impact that would have on your life in my life\nBecause CNN and the Democratic party and NBC ABC and CBS\nListening to Leslie stall and sixty minutes few hours ago there in a complete meltdown over the possibility that Trump could be reelected they're doing polling already encouraging Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders to run and I can dent in twenty sixteen\nThe only Democrat that Trump could have beaten was Hillary Clinton every other one probably would've beaten the president and America would not be right now\nMourning in America revitalization a brand new American economy three point seven percent unemployment rate crack down on the southern border we have new ... new trade deals with Canada and South Korea and Mexico the president just talked about with you and I we wouldn't have any of that stuff going on\nAnd so that's why three weeks in a day for now it is so important especially if you live in\nUh Ohio if you live in a if you live in Missouri if you live in North Dakota if you live in Florida if you live in Texas there's ... there's a few critical races that will determine whether or not the Democratic party will investigate\nOr whether the Republican Party will legislate just think about two to six years ever having no federal judges confirmed anywhere\nAt the Democratic party takes US Senate they will shut down completely they will not work with this president digging anything done including criminal justice reform reforming marijuana laws whatever it might be the president is on the precipice\nAnd twenty Nineteen and twenty twenty of doing some great stuff and I do not believe I Do not believe the Democrats are necessarily going to take the house I Do not believe that the polling was so wrong and twenty sixteen it was a joke\nAnd so if the house in the Senate stay in Republican hands good stuff this is just the beginning on the other hand\nA wise man told me in Washington that the first two years of the Trump presidency will be peaceful compared to the next two years if the Democrats take the house and or the Senate that's what we'd gone through the past two years to fight cholesterol and scream to move this country forward\nWill stop completely and there'll be investigation upon investigation and no legislation it'll be sink Trump at all costs sink the ss Trump and you know it and I know and so if you're in one of those a contested congressional districts\nWhether it's California Texas Florida Ohio Colorado North Dakota wherever it is go out and vote Republican to keep the house in the hands\nOf ah the successor of Paul Ryan whoever it might be and especially if you're one of those five or six states that have a Senate race that it's so competitive\nWhat like in Nevada or Arizona or North Dakota or Missouri even in Michigan Ohio Florida you've got to go out and vote imagine the world with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer completely in charge of the house in the Senate because at that point zero zilch NATO will get done\nCNN and et cetera is then to destroy Kanye West mode because the most loyal voters in America are black voters for the Democratic party and when African Americans figure out what the Democratic Party historically has done to them and not for them hopefully the Democratic party ... held a peg\nThanks for listening tonight big night I think having the president on is always a great joy also Bill O'Reilly the book is killing the ss and of course diamond in Silicon I don't know how we equal or exceed this kind of show next Sunday night but the great American built Cunningham will\nDo my best thanks for listening tonight and fleece I'm going to urge you if you're in one of these contested house districts are one of these great Senate races please go out and vote because the future of this country is still counting ...\nFly with you and the president [noise] some
