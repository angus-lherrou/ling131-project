little girl because she was so calm and he was being so nice store and here's the big problem the Republican Party is filled with\n... and ... now there's a couple of New York ... words trucks and buses\nWho were scared to death their own shadow not one Republican mail center white males senator was willing to interview a woman for the thought they'd be called sexist racist than thousand other words by liberal they gave it to a woman a woman prosecutor named Mitchell who is the single\nWorst prosecutor I haven't seen in my entire life ... you and I could have put this girl on the stand and you and I would have destroyed our bill we would have had or just a apoplectic she wouldn't know what to say her entire case sort of and ripped to shreds about five minutes and she couldn't get a decent questionnaire and Ken around the five minute questioning\nShe couldn't get it out and you got to say is true you fly all the time yes or no it isn't it true that you told there's too many you needed a ten day break to be able to drive your he isn't it true that you will not give us that there is no she gave the Washington boat isn't it true you blind yourself with a foreign ... most of your life\nIsn't it true not one single witness to boy you said in the ... came from you isn't there you go up and who\nIsn't it true that you said that in two thousand twelve you finally awakened and wits your psychiatrist because you were redoing your house and that renovation about security door is what may bring back your memories of this attempted rape\nExcept there's a problem we checked your records and you built the house you did the renovation of two thousand eight not two thousand twelve you're a liar they could have said are you a democratic operative how many Democrats did you speak to connect you with the top Democrat lawyers and George George lawyers\nTo get involved in this case they could have after a thousand questions they could've after you will they did after who paid for your lie detector test now I don't know what do you mean you don't know where's the follow up question everyone knows ... why would someone do it for free the whole thing is ridiculous\nThey could've after about a thousand issues like in two thousand twelve when you claim out of the blue you enter repressed memory of rape\nIsn't it true that in two thousand twelve Mitt Romney named three potential people would be a Supreme Court nominees and one of them was Brett Kavanaugh is that how you came to know Brett Kavanaugh isn't it true that Planned Parenthood two thousand twelve just got hit the newspapers all over the country that's in roe versus Wade make believe it was just overturned and they showed the pictures of the night Supreme Court justice\nAnd they replaced Ginsburg faced with Brett Kavanaugh and they said this is going to be Mitt Romney's Supreme Court nominee overturns roe versus Wade is that how you got to know his name have you decided to become a heroin or the left by making up a story I mean there's a thousand things they could have said is it true your father and CIA is it\nTrue your grandfather was CIA [laughter] it's a true your brother was working for a law firm that down and GPS fusion is that possible and you're not a democratic operative where all those questions\nHow bad is it true the bread Kevin O's mother Marilyn said John trial judge Robert

was standing in a in a courtroom singer parents being questioned\nBy a judge the judge and incredible power over ... of her family's life and even though eventually they came to lose out that's my understanding they did not lose the house and the judge actually in the in kind of root for them\nIt doesn't matter you may have developed a deep seated hatred for that judge and found out that that judge his son is going to be Supreme Court nominee there's a thousand things you could say the CIA one it's amazing that's not a conspiracy theory or debt CIA at her grandfather CIA\nAnd her brother is with a company with a law firm founded fusion GPS on all things considered\nThis and other deep state fraud conspiracy that no other way about it there's no coincidence any of this stuff but having

Hope you get murdered or ...\nI Hope someone comes in murders you or one of them had a great line they said I Hope there's a woman in your house and shrimp tonight the plunge didn't injure at his house and mentally disturbed or left is all they know how to do is talk about murdering people disagree with and then they call that's crazy I mean you're just dealing with sick\nPeople who will do anything and say anything because they believe\nA lot ... that the ends justify the means and that's why this Christine for came forward and that's why the woman at Yale came forward and that's why the ...\nCharge gang rape came forward and the next\nFive women you hear about this week are all going to be liberal women wear pink vagina ads in March and anti Trump rallies\nWho think they're saving the world by coming forward in line it's as simple as that this guy is innocent he's a boy scout is Jimmy Stewart is an easy Andy Griffith and made very are empty is a fine man at what they did as a character assassination and they're sick\nPeople there's something wrong with all of them Democrats ... there's nothing else you could say we are target number one white\nStraight Republican men are the target of the Democratic party said well we're\nOther provable fact in June of twenty sixteen Trump put on the loose the twenty five judges that would be on his list from what you would pick

radio more from Nineteen Seventy three coming up [noise]\n[noise] I'm shed for government to speakers\nDemocrats would likely have a shot keeping Brett Kavanaugh off the Supreme Court were not for something known as the nuclear option\nIn twenty Thirteen than Senate majority leader Harry Reid grew frustrated with repeated filibusters from Republicans of lower court an executive branch nominees so after much consternation read look the fuse on what's known in the Senate as the nuclear option back then it took sixty votes to break a filibuster in the center on old nomination\nChanging Senate rules requires a procedural vote or sixty seven years but there was another way to lower the bar on filibusters biased abolition and do precedent\nReid didn't change the Senate rules he instituted a new precedent for breaking filibusters on all nominations except the Supreme Court reached decision incensed Republicans in the minority facing a possible filibuster last year on the nomination of Supreme Court justice Neil Gorsuch Republicans now in the majority return fire with a nuclear strike of their own\nLowering the bar for those nominations too\nWith the speaker's lobby ...

I Want to tell you what troubles me greatly about Thursday\nAnd then I Want to get your perspective and I I kinda look towards Fox News often as a place I can go to ... conservative commentary and things of that character and ah after a doctor forwarded testified ... the son of Mike Wallace Chris Wallace said\nForge testimony is extremely emotional extremely Raul extremely credible\nNo uh no one could listener delivery delivery of those words and talk about the soul to the impact it at our life and not have your heart grow up to her this was a disaster for the Republicans so started Chris Wallace Thursday Afternoon judge ended up ... generally I respect that I think Dr Ford is exceptionally credible\nKarl Rove the great political theorist that Ford is a credible unbelievable\nSo when when I heard those commentaries I thought we were done and then I of course watch Brett Kavanaugh's testimony and the feeling is the Democrats showed toward him Thursday Afternoon and everything flip completely ... but when you have Chris Wallace\nAnd you have an Android Apollo Tono and Karl Rove saying that a woman is credible\nWho providers witness names that turned out not to be witnesses at all\nWhen you have ah Christine Ford straight up lying about her in capability of flying which you flew everywhere but every one of the witnesses re future story has no memory of the gathering and the woman wants a anonymity to testify\nTurn down the opportunity to be questioned in private and then we find out or lawyers never told her she had that opportunity at all\nSo every time I Try to test her credibility making bart that turns out to be great grossly lacking\nSo when conservative commentator said she's believable she's credible and clearly she isn't it we completely lost our way\n[laughter] I think we were painted Karl Rove yeah completely lost our way because he went to one telling us that Donald Trump never had a chance of winning\nThe people can see through it I think most people that I was talking to laugh at your testimony that the critics women and men\nI sound Brett Kavanaugh people even though there was such a notion\nFrom falsely accused in a man who end up in the court of public opinion in the current day leading up to this quote unquote hearing a life with completely turned upside down his wife with getting death threats\nAnd his career with looking to be entirely sabotage and destroyed as well and his reputation and here we have Christine horn\nThat something happened to her or she obviously has been in therapy for decades or she sat her so she has two front doors you know anybody that has to crime\nDoorbell no there's no snow\nSo obviously she has issues now just because she says something happened doesn't happen\nAnd we have plenty of examples that or just because she says Brett Kavanaugh right there it maybe not but all the evidence that she'd for that so far all start being out of it ends\nIn fact if you present innocent of Cornwall in which the so called victim provides for names Brett Kavanaugh mark judge PJ Smith labeling Kaiser including her best girlfriend legal in God's or\nWho would have no motivation to line or a light all\nWho said I don't even know Brett Kavanaugh all the all of them said the event didn't happen including mark judge you wrote on the floor supposedly with the ... with bread Kevin on Christine forward he said it didn't have a good discount marked judging okay what about PJ Smith who simply a classmate\nWho said these events never took place when Christine Ford's said they did then wheeling Kaiser her best girlfriend said they didn't happen but she also said I believer why believer but they didn't happen I don't know I don't know how that works at all and then you have are saying that\nI I was flabbergasted when Trump running for the presidency and twenty sixteen what the name of bread cabin on the Supreme Court list\nFact the matter is he didn't put his name on the list when he was running it didn't happen till November twenty Seventeen so how could you be frightened during the campaign about bread Kevin or getting the Supreme Court when his name wasn't on the list at all\nAnd how can she be believable to those are like you just mentioned Chris Law Karl Rove and not all the\nTime is up I don't know because ... ... exactly at what were they watching and hear like you said when I had a sexual harassment case that fell short\nOf being an assault case however I had the burden of proof that was my responsibility or order for a present the evidence I had to be cross examined I had to be the post let me tell you something\nI wasn't given lawyers from the defensive side that treated me with kid gloves no okay it was a very uncomfortable hearing song it talks about equal rights and gender equality what are you know what\nI was treated not as a woman that as a mad as a person bringing bringing forward charges against another person you know so to watch that lawyer that the Republicans hired\nTreat her as she were a child she's a doctor and not take the opportunity to necessarily poke holes in the many stories that she had concocted she didn't like to fly eyes and then we find out she was all over the world I and also just the holes in our story said thank thank God for Kaine people thank God for Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd thank God for Lindsey Graham because\nThere on sexual harassment and assault against their staff or what if somebody sitting on the Judiciary Committee\nKept a secret did in the U.S Senate to Congress all the private settlement Seventeen million dollars never got out did it\nNo I don't know where we have people lecturing another example Kamala Harris she's talking about integrity and she is lecturing Brett Kavanaugh at that hearing Kamala Harris got her start on a\nBrown Haslam couch she with having a public affair with a married man when she was assistant da and San Francisco and Willie Brown with the mayor of San Francisco so I don't need a feminist like Kamala Harris\nTelling me how I should live my life or hot there should live their life and she has never had to explain those types of actions what would the me too movement say about a woman having an affair with a married man what about the Mary mountain whites\nDon't know how about Cory Booker sexually molesting a Fifteen year old girl US Senator from New Jersey no big deal right\nRight I feel\nLike we got her on ... you're the best we'll see what happens in a few days but dye pray to God Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed and all those crops thrown out really be the\nDemocrats though we beat this that's kind of politics the personal destruction character assassination at the poll we need to make sure that we show up and numbers that they can't handle and we make sure that we keep the house and keep the Senate and even grow the house\nMegan bar if you're a great American thanks for coming on to build Cunningham show thank you very much

England clam chowder today pronounced originally I was told on called la ... what were we talking about a young\nGuy go Fifteen minutes couldn't say Fifteen Percent or more [noise]\n\n\n\n\nWelcome back you know I don't think a day goes by went up I don't get at least one or more messages from coast listeners asking me witness that missing for one one guy coming back Wednesday ... going to be back on the air\nAnd I always tell them not soon enough we get more requests for Dave than any other guest that I've experienced since I've been with the program for ten years and that's a that's because he always brings the goods\nI Am jazz that he always allows me to get the first interview when he unveiled a new book and like the other books this new one does not disappoint\nA Davis you probably know spent Twenty years in law enforcement then worked in the tech industry for a bit but found is true calling as an investigator of unusual disappearances and his work in that area has become a phenomenon a known all over the world multiple books a documentary film\nAnd maybe some other surprises to come Dave great to have you back\nIn Georgia I'm always humble that anyone even wants to listen to listen to me though or appreciate the invite\nWhen you say you know I noticed something as I was reading the new book today that you make some personal observations than I have not uh I haven't seen it you go this far in the other books I insights\nInto your own emotional reactions to some of these cases and it seems clear like the subject really gets to you and you've got I think eleven hundred and thirty five cases that you profiled over the years thousands more they'd be looked into\nSome of them really seemed to get into your head though I I think in part because of similarities some of the missing to your own life right\nYou know I think that's true um I've been very fortunate to me family of people who have been lost\nAnd when you meet these people it really brings brings home the emotion and there's a lot of parallels to my life with a lot of these families and I've written about people that remind me of myself a lot of times and ah\nI've put that in the book just recently ... probably because it's it's more of an evolution of my writing and\nHopefully people see that you know hey if people are really really good people these aren't the Drake who is fighting these are\nThe upper echelon and it's the conundrum to me why I don't find people that are down and out in life that are disappearing but it it seems to me that it's always the high rollers the people that are high performers that are disappearing\nYou know one place in the new book you mentioned how as a rule you did not reach out to the families of the missing now sometimes you meet him ... due to various circumstances but in general you don't call somebody up out of the blue and say hey can I talk to you about your dad loved one or you're missing loved one\nBecause it seems like an invisible line that you don't want to cross over but I Wonder has the success of your books help in the sense that these families now reach out to you that they're unsatisfied say with the the\nSearch effort or something and they're they're turning to you for some help her answers\nIt has happened and uh [noise] I don't want to inject myself into a search or into the turmoil that evolving with somebody disappearing now somebody reaches out want some help absolutely I'm going to be there I'll do everything I can\nAnd there's been cases just recently where that's happened and I've been glad to help and uh\nI've kinda guided them and it it seems that a lot of these families\nAnd covered the same sort of issues time and time again and frustrating as heck sit back and hear the frustration and their voice a\nCommon one is is it seems as though when jurisdictions stop searching they get to a point seven to ten days and they say hey there's nothing else we can do there's no place else to search\nA runner and out of resources we've got to stop well many times families and friends rally at that point and they get a group together and they keep searching for what I tell these people is you've got to get a copy of those reports that the jurisdiction wrote search and rescue report\nLaw enforcement report the who they interviewed who they talked to were they search the effectiveness of the search\nOr the areas that they completely eliminated in the in the areas that they thought that they still should search more because without that you're really searching blind and there's been instances just lately where people have said no they said they won't give us anything\nI I find that baffling\nWell I mean that's how they've treated you I was gonna ask you the same question about different agencies I Know how the national Park Service feels about you and that they are we should anybody who has not heard your earlier interviews or is not familiar with the books who might be listening tonight\nI'm maybe we start there where you can explain the history of your interaction with the national Park Service the forest service government entities in general because they've shut you out I mean I guess I I'm interested to learn that they're doing the same thing that the families of the missing but uh it's really\nKind of clear over the big picture that they don't want to help solve these mysteries\nYou know it's a sad note on humanity if that's the case but there is a lot of obstruction so when I started out I was told by a couple of Park Service rangers that they had found\nDisappearances and their parks where they had worked that bothered um didn't make sense when they tried to find information they couldn't\nAnd they thought somebody with an investigative back right on to be looking into it\nAnd that sort of how it all started and I filed a series of freedom of Information Act of course it gets to national park service they have the largest contingent a federal\nThe train police officers and the national park police\nAnd they're trained at the federal law enforcement training center they get the outstanding training or smart people they understand what should be done and I asked for a list of missing people well they came back and they said they don't carry any less and they don't have any list of missing people in their parks and jurisdictions\nFor like to see if\n\nLiterally therapist album houses of the holy ghost in the morning to you and the u._k. and you want to hit dire maker\nNow a year in rocks\nSpotlight
