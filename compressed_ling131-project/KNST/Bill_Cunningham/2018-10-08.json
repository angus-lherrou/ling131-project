Ohio I'm sure there's massive voter fraud in Chicago New York and whatever\nBut Ohio in Cleveland Columbus I Would not be surprised at all if there's hundreds or thousands of illegal votes cast because of the tabulation system and there's no check and balance because there's no Republicans in Cleveland\nWell the thing is Mr Cunningham if you're ... code red Jonathan signing would be an excellent guess for your show before the terms but here's the thing\nThe way it works with the algorithms and the mission and the companies that are ... and then I think it's only three or four the entire country and it's done in the cities\nAnd what you would have is a situation where the machine is program where the Democrat as a thousand actual votes cast Republican has an actual votes cast\nShe is going to say eleven hundred for the Democrat nine hundred hundred for the Republican it's programmed in advance\nAnd the person that runs the city that Democrats in most cases they're the

is glad she room Brett Kavanaugh's light wonderful what\nThe left and the Democrats have indeed done to others they tried to do to Brett\nKavanaugh what they tried to do to break capital they will try and do to us if they can the second thing is is that all mine entirely destructive behavior of attacking institutions people they are people\nConstructive in ten a nice things about our society it really to me bill is nothing less than the continued\nSome version of our nation beginning in the Nineteen twenties with the communist and their attempt to undermine us from within and I don't think we see\nThat but I think if we do a it will provide a great context for the situation that we're in your Catholic as mine are you aware of this terrible a present state of revelations in the sex abuse is and the official cover up that that was actually very much started by the communists\nWell whatever it was it's all you know as long as they should be able to do it again let me\nTell you this
