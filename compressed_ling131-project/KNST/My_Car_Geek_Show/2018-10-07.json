renowned TV show sixty minutes captivated\nAudiences around North America with a special segment on the French paradox\nYou remember the French paradox this is the counterintuitive concept that says\nRed wine actually promotes our cardiovascular health and vitality scientists were intrigued\nWell fast forward ten years Harvard researchers in Boston test over thirty thousand compounds searching for the one the best activates genes that control our weight or energy healthy aging and even longevity the holy grail of medical research and what did they find\nOut of thirty thousand compounds tested the single best gene activated was was there a troll yes ... the active ingredient found in\nThat's right red wine five years later ... is one of the hottest breakthroughs in the field of healthy aging\nNow our guest today says that's just half the story so here with the rest of the story Dr Alan ... let me introduce Robert Twenty years Dr precedent as the institutional New York radio hosting his own highly successful health radio show\nHe holds a PHD in clinical nutrition you been a longtime product formulated and high level advisor for purity products that depressed mood welcome aboard\nMark always great speaking to ya\nWell it's great to have you with us now let's talk to them this was very drop a nominal those people out there who just to vaguely familiar with the story what exactly is ... spiritual and why is it all over the news today\nWell first of all it sure is all over the news especially the Health News you know I read about twenty health journals a week and every one of them seems to have an article about resveratrol basically\nResveratrol is what we call a poly feeding all it's found in red wine it's found in purple grape juice it's found in berries it's even found in ... and the interesting thing about resveratrol is it's actually produced by plants\nBy plants themselves to protect themselves against any kind of injury any kind of infection and against any kind of radiation\nAnd the scientists really first became interested and resveratrol mark about Nineteen Ninety two when raspberry ritual was first isolated from red wine it was also found at that point in the skin of grapes as well\nAnd this is what got all those scientists interest in the early studies showed that resveratrol seemed to extend the life of fruit flies of worms that even some fish well anything that extend the life of anything is going to the attention of scientists\nAbsolutely wow well\nBy two thousand six Italian scientist discovered that resveratrol extended the life of certain fish by fifty six percent and it even increased their swimming ability well also in two thousand six and here's what really got them interested\nA Harvard researcher David Sinclair reporter that was very troubled counter acted the negative effect of a high fat diet and mice bite thirty percent\nNow given that most Americans seem to be on a high fat diet\nThis was pretty darn interesting well later research goes on to show that resveratrol had a very positive effect on a number of interesting things like blood sugar levels like normal cell growth and it even seem to protect the intestines and the colon\nIt definitely supported normal and cinematic activity in the body it improved indoor and\nIt was even a great study at the Institute of genetics and cell biology in France that showed that it dramatically improved indoor and storing aerobic activity and it even proved to support brain function\nGreat study from Weill Cornell Medical school to New York I was just reading at an even neutralizes free radicals but the reason the bottom line reason mark that it's all over the news nowadays is research at Harvard\nThey found that caloric restriction eating less actually slows the pace of aging and extended the lifespan in laboratory animals by forty percent\nWell whenever our health is threatened any receive health threat like not eating enough caloric restriction your body feels threatened this which is on what they called the longevity gene in your body it switches on sort of a protective mechanism that begins on a secular level metabolism changes\nYour ability to adapt than coke dramatically changes as a major\nPositive influence on growth hormones and stress hormones there's actually an increase in repair all of this switched on by a family of genes we called sirtuin but here's the tape according to the work done by David Sinclair at Harvard no this is important\nThe most potent activate or of the sirtuin genes in addition to caloric restriction is resveratrol and a great hope is that what's happening and all these animal studies all these amazing benefits with resveratrol will translate into people as well\nAnd this is why millions of people all over the world are now taking resveratrol pretty much every day\nWell this is amazing but let me just step back for a moment I Know you've been working with purity products for several years of their co Q. formulas but now that feature co enzyme Q. ten which uses just as important as was there a troll especially for your heart health and you also say in some ways it's got even more evidence behind so let me ask you this who needs co Q. ten ... what exactly is a good four\nWell first of all let's take a quick take a walk\n... is a co enzyme has any substance in the body that speeds up the rate at which a chemical reaction takes place it's like a vitamin in many respects well co Q. ten is the nutrient that is responsible for the energy that's the key word the energy that supplies your brain your heart\nYour liver your kidneys in fact we need co Q. ten to literally convert all the food we eat into energy wow that's amazing\nYeah well that's what it's all about not only that but it's a very powerful anti oxygen and I remember Marc let's go back to Nineteen sixty three that's a while ago well I was teaching for the first time physiology and nutrition and I remember speaking about co Q. ten at that point and that this is Nineteen sixty three\nAnd at that point it had only been discovered six years before Nineteen fifty seven at the University of Wisconsin\nWhere they were looking for what makes the heartbeat they were literally looking at heart and saying what is making this darn thing beat well they found out that was co Q. ten and that co enzyme Q. ten supplies that energy in fact by Nineteen Seventy eight a British biochemist named Peter Mitchell wins\nHimself a Nobel Prize for describing what he called the bio energetic energy created by co Q. ten\nSo we could say it's so darn important because your energy is related to the amount of co Q. ten and your body and without an adequate supply of co Q. ten you're living in what we call an energy deficient state your heart and he's co Q. ten\nIn fact the highest concentration of co Q. ten in your body is right in your heart muscle\nYour brain needs co Q. ten at all times co Q. ten supplies energy not only to your heart and brain but to your immune system it supplies energy to your lungs to your liver\nSo needless to say we need all of this energy that case is that as we age and this is unfortunate levels of co Q. ten fall we lose this vital organic energy now in fact the research shows by the time you're eighty\nYou've got less than fifty percent of the co Q. ten in your body as you did when you were age twenty wow yeah it's really quite dramatic so I Would summarize co Q. ten by saying it's what I call it daily essential\nI mean you could eat sardines and mackerel and peanuts we're co Q. ten comes from but it's not going to be enough just from your diet\nWell Dr person I just didn't you told purity that'd be quite a bit of research that it was time to combine these two reads the co Q. ten and the ... you know why he's proud of is cutting edge combination purity calls it they're huge super boost formula what can actually do people\nWell its energy I mean the combination of these two incredible nutrients resveratrol and co Q. ten in fact\nOne of my students called the advantage I like that so I adopted the term it's combining to amazing nutrients unto themselves which a spectacular but when you combine them indeed this spectacular this if we can call it that this is enhanced this advantage this cardiovascular advantage", "year": "2018",
