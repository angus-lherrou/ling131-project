minutes but lots to cover today we'll get back to it here with Sherry Turkle she's an author and pharmacists\nAlways great to have you on the show such great information Sherry can you share with us a quick study or to to sort of backed us up highlight the science behind the elite asked his anthem that's found in as to FX 'cause I Know there were dozens and dozens of studies maybe you can pull out and highlight a couple of your favorites\nYeah for sure so Dr Mark Miller he's a PHD at biomedical research or he explains that well he's talking here about how\nFree radicals compromise and undermine\nFunction and sell you the performance in the body he says after his Anthony's simply ... per at negating this as evidenced by clinical trial showing improved performance and accelerated recovery in fact research published in the journal of medicine and science\nAnd sports and exercise found that those who took four milligrams faster than the daily over twenty eight days scored better cycling times with greater output and those who did not take it for the fights that you\nMay remember this after that and it's one of the few\nThat fireball antioxidants that can actually neutralized free radicals\nEven at the site of the mitochondrial membrane if like secular body armor protecting yourself your joints blood vessels brain heart and Oregon's on many levels so listen to this mark and there are four teen clinical studies on after than than for brain how\nSeven studies on skin health fourteen studies and I help including research for depth perception\nAnd focus fix steady\nGoing after than than supports cardio function\nForty two studies on healthy aging and cellular health and there's a ton of research on human performance to showing benefits for energy stamina endurance and the fact that facts it's incredibly powerful and versatile it helps you stand the game of life stay energized active alerts healthy and even stronger\nValues impressive on so many levels so much rain information there and I know there's last as Anthonette was about a dozen happens to\nBe here I see there's a patent for promoting I health\nAnd reducing I fatigue there's a pattern for inhibiting the expression of cytokines and sales end up having to get this on composition for body fat reduction there's one for improving muscle atrophy an older adult Sherry I'd like to be a little bit of a skeptic here how can this one simple nutrients\nMagically do all of this disaster ... give us so many benefits I mean really\nYeah I Know it's it sounds amazing too good to be true but it really is true many studies that I'm referencing here they're ... met these are reputable clinical studies conducted by leading researchers around the world that really back\nThat benefits the vast event than either way muscle output is better with asked event than to and this comes from after that the research published in the international journal sports\nNutrition November two thousand nine eleven this was another study done with cyclists they took four Nelly ... than than it was a small study\nBut very positive showing that cyclists improved\nTheir trial time by two minutes and twenty kilometer bike race I mean that's a meaningful improvement in a race like this and the researchers said that they also burn fat more efficiently which makes sense\nBased on this research purity can actually make the claim that asked FX will promote and improve power output in your muscles I mean I tell people asked FX in his strength and power out\nIt it's transformative if you like energy and this was found in other studies to like one that looked at hand grip strength\nAlso much great information you're just tuning here we're talking with a pharmacist and author Sherry Turkle here I'm your host mark Larson on his hand ribs study the you mentioned I understand there this involved what a twelve milligram dose\nAnd they saw Ninety three percent boost in hands drank the people who struggled with tennis elbow now that's a big deal but our listeners might be saying well okay maybe I don't play tennis ... what about me what does it mean for me right\nRight so so think about this uh Ninety three percent increase in a person who has some repetitive stress in their album it's an almost doubling enhanced strength so just think about all the\nThings that you do in your daily life picking up groceries your kids your grandkids gripping the steering wheel of a car playing golf for tennis gardening or riding a bike a doubling of grip strength makes a big difference I mean when you take after than than you get stronger you feel stronger you get more energy and difference if you play sports\nYou play stronger so to me it's really quite extraordinary\nBut it's great information to not sure I Want to share a couple of more testimonials caught my attention out of so many right there on the purity website again these are unsolicited these are from real people here's one from Rick user male age fifty five sixty four lives in Naples, Florida he writes this\nWhat a great product to ask the FX has been for me after starting taking out the back of my work out and strengths has increased as if I were in my twenties again and I've only been on a ... for two months now can't wait to see the long term effect I look forward to taking as to affects every morning for my afternoon workouts I'll be taking this product for a long time\nHere's ... she's a female aged forty five fifty four she lives in Laurel park North Carolina she writes this quote\nI've been using asked the FX for a month now I can see the difference in my energy level\nI now have more energy feel better since taking this product I can actually see a difference in my skin as well\nI'm a smoker who has smoking lines around my mouse but the lines have diminished about fifty percent\nOverall I Am so thrilled with my energy level I Love this product just a couple of samples from the real people who have responded on ... website and Jerry I'm looking at the list of\nPatents again on this asked as an open compound this is where the\nYou know the science research backs up we are talking about this is just flat out amazing Sherry a lot of people out there are going to think when I'm going to say here sounds a little bit odd but you said before the show this supplement may even help people drive a car better or use the computer more comfortably I'm a ... come on how does this out but\nIt does sound funny but asked that may actually help in these areas to an end here's why one of the interesting things about ... then is that it's a relative of vitamin a and we know that vitamin as good fries good for vision asked a sad thing is to ask the fact that it's actually been shown\nTo fight oxidation and I tissue scientist at a study where they found a forty six percent improvement in a measurement called depth perception that that perception that third party to determine\nDistances between object there basically to see in three dimensions and researchers they study the handball team specifically looking at how quickly they could change focus and guess what the handball team that was supplementing with actors and then\nThey were able to improve their accuracy and improve their performance and that that perception test\nOther research has also shown that after that that helps reduce I fatigue and you know when you're on a computer that's a big deal everyone's on computers these days for long periods of time and and it's hard on her eyes and we know that if you're driving a car and it's late at night and your reaction time it's slow\nThat's not good after that that actually helps the\nIce focused and refocus eye doctor hacked PHD one of the leading researchers at ... says that the\nProduct actually helps your eyes be more resilient you see\nBetter with it your eyes are healthier I mean who doesn't love those benefits\nAgain we're talking with a pharmacist in health author Sherry Turkle about our free bottle offer for purity products talking about asked the FX\nSo much ground to cover Sherry I Want to get back to the skin benefits in this issue of wrinkle reduction or not I repeat not as a cream or as a lotion but as a cap so you take it orally this patent also covers this or you say this ingredient is proven to reduce wrinkles and not just by a little we're talking a dramatic amount what's going on with is\nYeah I Know it's it's fascinating a huge benefit people want to look younger I Know I Do and and I've noticed significant benefit since I've started taking it but it's a science here that really shy and the whole concept of taking\nOral supplements to improve skin health relatively new concept here in North America but in Japan this is mainstream after the fact that it's already one of 'em if not the most successful ingredients in a new class\nMm [noise]\n[noise]\nFox News on that he had like Senator Rand Paul doesn't by Saudi Arabia is explanation that journalists your mom ...
