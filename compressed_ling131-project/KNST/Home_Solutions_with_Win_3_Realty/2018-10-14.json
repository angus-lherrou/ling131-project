soon yeah oh man what a difference now remember the days of guys would come in they smoke cigarettes in front of the bullpen watching the tape or or a library case some of them\nBrought their um their I'm brandy and cognac and\nYou know cigars stink about this how long the trades were the guys on the floor that with a market make is they were making so much money then if you think about it oh just spreads regret that it's not just to spread what all the all the flow you couldn't sit on your computer and trade they it it took so much\nTime for the retail guy put the what is it the institutions that get the auto and they're sitting there going okay oh we got a ... cell here okay we'll just let it come down with salad there will be buying it will get the price and then it'll bounce up and

trading against you and now you just gotta there to help\nWith the markets the specialists about what they used to be amazing the change has set up a crime\nIt's exciting to talk to people about that

disappearance of a Washington Post columnist but the president appears to be stopping short or pulling the plug on an arms deal with the kingdom\nAmerican home for rent was about the biggest that came to Tucson and you know they had purchased around five hundred single family homes in Tucson but like black stone in Phoenix had purchased six thousand back in twenty eleven and twelve they were buying them you know by the you know just in bulk sales\nAnd everybody thought when the market improved they would sell them in and make the profit well instead they secured ties them got more money and they bought off more homes and and you know the the most millennial population is the generation is really having\nA tough time uh with with buying homes because they're chasing a price that's increased um the average cost of a single family home in Tucson has gone up a hundred thousand dollars in the last Seventy two months\nSo six years a hundred thousand dollars and Jerry at today's interest rate what's a hundred thousand dollars cost a homeowner in a payment\nNow I mean you know for every ten thousand dollars you're by you're looking at about sixty bucks so I mean a hundred thousand would be about six hundred dollars right\nSo add that to whatever it was back in in twenty twelve and a six hundred more dollars a month that's a hundred and fifty extra dollars a week\nUm that is coming you know out of your paycheck and\nYou know and it's reached a point where especially the kids coming on to college and have a car payment and student loan debt and they just can't qualify any longer and they're gonna be renting for very long time I mean unless you know some major there is there is upward pressure on wages\nAnd um you know over time people will get their their their loans paid off their student loans it's a ten year payback period um so I guess when they're thirty two years old they can buy a house instead of twenty two\nWell yeah I think there's a lot of demand um I think most fires have 'em they just don't have that they lack the down payment in the lower and they uh they have the income to qualify they just that they lack the down payment which is why downpayment assistance programs are so\nYou know I I'm a you know like the pathway to purchase program is in such demand for that reason but um I think you know it's just that lack of them in Tori is a um I think it's frustrating for for for buyers\nAnd um you know I I uh I'm\nPeople leasing doing you know four to six months leases instead of doing a yearly saying well I'll Try again in February see something different than say I I I Am hearing more frustration\nAnd from a that you know again I'm Talking about the the the hundred to two fifty right right um where we're buyers are getting frustrated with the lack of a mentor is oh heck I'll rent and I'll look at it in the spring and hopefully things are better um\nI don't know you know that um what does that mean for the typical quiet months of November December does that mean they're going to be more ... than normal you know all the time will tell\nBut you know I mean we've got a um so we got some had when we got rising interest rates we have very low and then tore um we did have great demand a but that is a it's a local problem at the national problem and I mean it is what it is\nSo um that's tap our knowledge base in the studio this morning mo Matthews um um he and his wife Kathy own a a company called fresh start and they are also with the XP reality um in in um actually ... my sponsor any XP realty\nBut um what what kind of prices do you have out in Richmond, Virginia\nOr median home price is right about two fifty in Richmond okay a cheaper than I thought yeah [laughter] what what was it at the peak of the market back into time I'll be about three Seventy five to four hundred I Would say Mm hum as well yeah\nOkay and then what about him and tore finding the same shortage of tore\nDefinitely worry right now I'm In most most major counties were we most of our sales occur like in Glen Ellen in Rico county\nRight now um we have probably you know three or about a week's worth of inventory or a number of weeks were [laughter] I mean it's the stuff is good um you know when it hits the multiple listing service it really goes under contract with multiple offers usually within you know the first\nSeventy two hours of right away so it's it's very um\nWe have no ... hardly any inventory um and it's a high demand area a lot of good schools a lot of good neighborhoods so people are flocking into that particular market and then you know all around even in a an outskirts of other areas were still finding low the low inventory as well so\nI'm a market\nSo I'm a model also um owns a and Kathy own home pastors franchise I'm and I'm just kind of curious with the inventory that type of you noticed a downturn in the number of people that are calling with their ugly houses that they don't want to offload\nYeah yeah definitely I mean it's a it's a we're getting I'm less leads but we're the good part is or costs to buy a house still is about the saved so it's harder if we're so basically we're not working as hard as we used to have to work I worked at all these leagues so we're ... we're\nLayer conversion has improved exactly oh good for you All right when we come back we've got some news to talk about

... years ago when three team leader bombs ...\nGood morning and welcome back I'm In the studio with Jerry son to be a mortgage and uh some friends from Richmond, Virginia\nBut I'm Jerry ... is your go to guy when when it comes to getting a loan and you go to your physician once a year for your annual checkup you really need to have a natural check up on your on your finances and there are several\nListeners of this program who've contacted Jerry\nAnd they have multiple properties and it was you know sure he's got a lot of experience and and you know sometimes it's like well why would I Want to refinance a a three and a half percent loan when when the rates now five and\nWell it might make sense I mean that's the thing of and Jerry will be the first one to tell you if something doesn't make sense and and also come up with creative ways that enclosed deals and\nUh we've got people that are saving over a thousand dollars twelve hundred dollars a month just from restructuring some of the debt they haven't and we had one a dentist\nWho who basically had so many loans to banks want to give 'em any more [laughter] and buddy you have these loans were really mature loans and the pay off on some of these properties was down to forty thousand dollars\nBut he couldn't even refinanced them as long as he had all those loans in place so we ended up having to give him a short term private money alone\nHe paid off several of the homes refinanced several other one's got more equity out ended up paying off a bunch of them now you had room to go buy or more home so um and he wanted to do that before he retired and was unable to you know before he lost his big income\nSo I mean this is the kind of strategy session that you really need to hold\n'em you know about your personal finances for most people their home is the biggest asset that they have ... and and it really makes sense to give jury son to calm and and figure out\nYou know and it's actually starting to slow down some as we come up upon the holidays and it'd be a really good time to look things over and\nIt's anticipated rates are going to continue to rise for at least another year and I'm In the rye sharply actually so this may be a really good time so Jerry what's your phone number of somebody wanted to give you a call on your personal cell phone and talk strategy and make an appointment to come sit down with\nSure my numbers five to zero three seven zero nine five seven six and I'll give you an example of a story that happened just just yesterday and that was a gentleman called me who had not upgraded his home in Fifteen Years\nAnd he has a three point five percent market and um watch they paid the more give him a Fifteen year fixed mortgage and Andy Pettitte down two houses working well north of four hundred thousand got a mortgage about a hundred\nAnd so he wants to pull a hundred thousand dollars to remodel and I and it's like well you do an equity line are we all know equity line right now or five and a quarter the five and a half that prime rib by the end of the year\nAnd most banks are going to be offering you know probably anywhere from primer quarter to a half above prime so that by the end of the year to rate on an act like six percent oh is that the right approach or do you just bite the bullet and refinance and do\nA a a new on even though the rate is basically a point higher from where he is today and it's a tough thing to to to swallow you know it's it it's like I don't want to let go of that that really low rate and you know I I don't know I I didn't have an answer I said these are the options and\nThat's a tough call you have to weigh out\nThe you know the value of having that low rate versus the enjoyment you're going to have a remodeling your home\nRight and also if you do a you know a blended right analysis and basically look at one of the first loan is only Seventy grand and he wants a hundred and it would make sense to get the hundred at the the five percent rate rather than pay six hundred because you know the first position loan doesn't make that big of a difference\nRight right and that's what we're looking at all those analysis and it's just it's a\nThe Mac gets a um I mean you can look and see what's clearly the best from just an analytical standpoint which frankly is from my conclusion was that it wasn't that he should do nothing at all but then why haven't remodel my house and Fifteen Years I mean that I Need a new kitchen I Need new plant says\nThat's what you and that's a intangible thing to\nTo evaluate you know so ... or you know you could just selling moved to a new house that's another option do\nYou know and the values are rising there's this article that came out this week and says where we'll property values rise and fall you one hundred metropolitan areas with the largest populations in the United states are expected\nTo experience a four point five percent appreciation of property value over the next year and that's actually getting better because of everybody's been expecting ten percent for so long of course you know we found by fifty percent so we can afford to do that for a while um but four point five percent is is a national average\nAccording to heroes a real estate solutions and they're less quarterly forecast\nAnd Washington in Nevada\nTopped the list of metropolitan areas\nWith the highest expected appreciation rates Washington having four\nCities in the top and and the Nevada having three ... so I Know Reynosa just going crazy with the with the new Tesla plants mhm and and if you go to Las Vegas from their building that raiders stadium and I mean there are just cranes everywhere I was there for a conference a few weeks ago\nAnd um so I Am so Reno's a rocking at a Las Vegas is is rocking it um Washington I'm In the Seattle area they just about run out of space I mean that they're blocked by by mountains and by ocean and there's not too much more space to to go to but also Colorado\nUtah in Oregon are in the top ten of 'em you know where the property values are going to rise the highest\nAnd then Texas Midland Odessa um are expected to see very healthy rises and of course that's oil country and I'm a College Station where in Texas and M Ms\nAnd then also in San jose California is is um started to see a little bit of a slow down and San jose last year passed a San Francisco for the highest you know median home price in the United states\nThe average person that lives there pays more than one point two million dollars for a home that average Joe at one point to a million dollars or a home so where are the rates falling actually Illinois has um three metropolitan areas that are predicted to lose value", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Home
