{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KNST", "content": "I'm from a trick okay [laughter] sixty\nThree I remember you mentioning that one that's the Pima County bond that is being discussed right now this was actually quite quite controversial within our own Hispanic Chamber uh we had the ... group come in and talked about four sixty three\nWhich is bonding for transportation dollars within Pima County\nI'll tell you the small business a sentiment in that in in that committee meeting when we had them come in let's say they did not like the idea of bonding for this they did not support the thought that Pima County would just simply bonding and put that debt and the county to go fix our roads and where were the priorities in the county budget\nOr why weren't why wasn't that money being spent as it should be on transportation and roads and so on and some other priorities in the county I see the small business sentiment was no when we went to the board of directors which is ultimately how decisions are made within the chamber they get the final vote there was so much debate that chamber decided to sit on a neutral\nUm and so that is you know how our process works in the chamber I'm personally I'm not going to vote and supportive for sixty three\nOrder trick [laughter] it was on the other one\nWhat was your third one I I'm Sorry I don't recall\nOr the ... for for all the perks for ...\nAnd ... and I don't live in the city of Tucson so I won't be voting on that\nFor what you were in ... yeah well that's all true they're going through very mode angry rabbit jerk answer your\nJob your on your toes James Bond she sorry\nYes yes I'm calling in regards to her comments she made a ... they got down here though so\nYeah that's the the landing a steel grates I Believe that came from ... where they would actually lay them down if I'm correct on that I Apologize but they stand thirty feet tall but they\nThey don't stop the professional yeah they always stop for people because what they do it's like ... through them with her and tortures that actually\n... doors and which can opener and ... but I live here and there's really quite an act of\n... or ritual here and uh our little desert to between you know it's only four miles away I'm very aware of and I mean on a daily or nightly basis um\nAnd I we need a stronger sense we knew they were NATO that they cannot manipulate physically and come through or or um it's not high enough I mean they can scale is\nGo to the professionals it's not the ... century it's the professional that are bringing the human trafficking\nAnd he'd been kidnapped who's well with guns and counterfeit money and everything else that you can think of that's on the world black market is coming across the bow direction\nYeah and ... for that in your right I have\nTraveled with you know I mentioned share of ... and his team and others to to see different places along the border and what the what the wall looks like or know while\nI'm and I know that they're looking at different prototypes of of things that can be built there and ultimately I think it's going to take many tools it's a wall it's going to be surveillance technology a lot of those big towers have gone up down around the ... area and and uh uh Douglas area and so on\nBut that doesn't cover all The Revenge and crevices we know that is the train there so there I think there's additional surveillance resources that are needed\nAnd we also need increased border patrol though we're having a challenge in recruitment and retention that's a whole other issue that\nI Know congressman Sally and others have worked on did you all we can to recruit and and for the fire border security and then assist our sheriff's with additional resources and so you're playing a major role in this\nUh but I Do think Wallace is part of this but you're right if they're cutting through it or scaling over a and it's the drug smugglers and human traffickers we need to figure out another solution\nOh it's just terrible I mean of the people really new\nI mean this ... billions and billions and billions of dollars that's going back and forth across that open border and and the structure of a children's lives and the goal of an elderly people dying out the desert um this is just and saying that the ...\nOh wow a weakness in our border that what people against our country\nYeah no you're right absolutely thank you so much for the call ... thank you for getting feedback\nThank you very much for taking my call but I Do jog or Steve and trucks Coleman before I Do have a question for you wouldn't be able to track a little bit we've gone through this debacle of what I call that would describe northern okay what's your general feeling about what happens\nPolitical chaos and dysfunction I guess I could summarize it was a horrible to watch regardless of what side you might have been on um I think both Dr Ford in judge Kavanaugh were victims of this political process\nUm the Senate Democrats said on this for several months she wanted to remain anonymous and yet they pulled her out two days before to testify at MIT just shows you how\nTo show you girls will it up\nI think so I think it was not on a\nLittle bit better idea that we do 'cause you're a little stuffed closer to all this garbage that goes on yeah if I was in the hands of the the abuse ...\nWhat a fiasco for an and think how their lives have been impacted me Dr Ford end judge Kevin I mean I think it's a shame and I thought it was just total political dysfunction\n[noise] but it shows the um\n[noise] it it shows that the dysfunction and it shows the the lane set which people will go that are there in Washington too to manipulate and when you go back and look at things that have been happening for years now there is just so much and I think that's what the American people are fed up with\nIs you know the most recent stunt with with um judge now justice Kavanaugh was awful but it got so many people fired up on both sides we've talked on the show about how\nFriends you can't even go out and have a conversation anymore you can't be a woman\nAnd disagree that all women are not telling the truth because all women do not tell the truth just like all men don't tell the truth whether it's at whatever the topic is there's just not in it that this\nThis culture that we're in right now of the inability and I don't know how much you've experienced um\nOr see it but we see through social media just the interaction that\nThat whether it starts at the high school level to college to beyond a difference of opinion a difference of how you deal with something nothing it's not tolerate it any more if you don't believe that the way the mainstream or how you're wanting to what they're wanting to\nYou to believe there's a narrative out there that if you're against that narrative and a lot of people are it is just set it that the whole political climate has become yeah and\nI think it it ... how we get things done right ultimately I don't even hardly anything with this political discourse\nShit or the simple idea you're prove you're innocent until proven guilty\nAnd I completely support you're innocent until proven guilty\nAnd it's just a ... a mess that up right and that if I rule of law allow people to lie\nTo think that can lie and their word is going to be taken because then they hide behind the me too movement and the ... movement in the ... and everything else\n... and what they're doing I think he's bringing down the importance of the me too me what it's supposed to be being brought down by the ... yeah just said even if it's not there and we'll go ahead and back you and then we'll blame the other person\nBut then what about uh what about the other side of it\nOkay what about the other side what about the today we're bullies are going and what they're thinking and we're going to be\nBoys are not going to want to take any risks they don't want to be strong anymore they don't want to be what they were brought up to be they don't know we're worried about women and we should but I'm worried about boys understand where they fit in society where am I going to fit\nYeah you know it's what okay so your opinion\n[laughter] after that I just uh\nYou know this ... regardless of the issue in an alley it's we how do we accomplish things on behalf of our country and we get things done it was your first question when I brought up my support of term limits no budget no pay is he going to do it this district CD too is entirely split it's twenty it's forty percent Democrat forty percent Republican\nTwenty percent independent studies there yes in a wind here yet to go to ... you're going to become the speaker of the house and

[noise]\nGood morning and welcome back I'm In the studio with Jerry sent a VIP mortgage and Jerry is you go to guy for home loans and refinance is and if you have more than one property you definitely need to call juries and\nHe's got his thumb on the pulse and basically you know it's it's here rates are going up we don't think they're coming back I don't expect him to go up more so now is the time to get in and and\nFigure out what what should I Do when you've got these properties am I going to hold them I going to keep them if you have any kind of long term plan and and possibly one of you know get some um\nYou know some equity out or something I mean this is where Jerry will help you and and he's helped or listeners of this program save over twelve hundred dollars a month they still in the same properties or payment went down by twelve hundred dollars a month\nAnd and I just by restructuring the debt so ah Jerry if someone wanted to contact you about either getting recalled for a new home purchase or adding to their rent rental portfolio or I'm just you know refinancing restructuring the dead on what they already have how do they reach\nSure my number five to zero three\nSeven zero nine five seven six\nAnd you know what I what I Love about Jerry's if if you meet with him and\nAnd he says well you know what you should just really hang onto your three and a quarter percent loan I mean I Can't touch that and it wouldn't be wise for you to to do that or instead of refinancing that maybe we can put a second on it but seconds are you know they'll just rate loans it's crazy I look the other day and we're over seven percent for an adjustable rate loan\nSo I'm arms are uh adjustable rate mortgages five your arms or not they're they're they're actually a little bit lower their singing the hype for it but I'm seconds you know equity lines of credit are getting up to seven percent because\nBanks what they do is they they will be a prime rate plus a margin that's how most banks do their their uh\nTheir equity lines while we forget primates moved up to five and a quarter percent or so it'll be five and a half by by December so you know if someone's prime plus one that's what the bank you know give you\nGoing to be at six and a half percent so equity lines are not cheap anymore\nOh well that's very interesting so Jerry um what do you what our rates this week haven't seen any change after that jumped up so much last week has there been any settling out or\nNo so mortgage rates are thirty year fixed mortgage rates are are sitting right around five percent you know for um a Fifteen Years in Fifteen year fix mortgages are in the mid fours\nI'm at a VA or in the high force so rates are moving higher but again they're still historically low and they uh\nYou know they're not going to be coming down anytime soon ... when you look at the protections and I\nRead a lot of protections in forecast from all the major investment banks around the country and they're all predicting that treasury yields are going to continue marching higher in two thousand in Nineteen and potentially even to two thousand twenty\nOr and so you know we're just rates are going to be somewhere in the five to five and a half percent rain for the next probably six months and then you know but that's OK that says we\nOvertime I mean when you look back over time I ... from Nineteen Seventy one which is when Freddie Mac started tracking mortgage numbers all the way until two thousand and four and the rates never once drop below\nSix percent and then they they actually fell below four percent for the first time ever in twenty twelve so everybody got used to this for the last six years but it's really that that's you know a short clip of of time and and the overall scheme of things and and you know if there ever was another major downturn the banks have to have room\nAnd the government has to have room to lower the right back down to encourage people to borrow and so that's why we got to push a little bit higher\nAnd and that's you know a ... it's funny where where you're starting to see a lot of talk about recession and the ... recession is on the horizon whether it's two thousand Nineteen twenty Twenty one or maybe even pushed that twenty ... twenty twenty two but one is going to be is going to happen I mean it's a cycle\nNow the million dollar question is how deep whatever session sure has some recessions are pretty mild and they're not not a big deal but then or you have and that are ... are quite steep which is what we went through in two thousand eight\nUm it's it's inevitable for when that happened but we are in the longest recovery cycle I think the second largest longest\nAnd make it through the end of the year will be the longest\nIt'll it'll be the longest that recycles so you know it's a um\nInterest rates will be moving higher over the next year and when you look at it that you start to settle down and they're not increasing at an unsustainable levels I think the buyers confidence will be will be continuing to um pushed them into I think it's time to buy\nSo it's all about confidence when things get too hot or too cold it's been a and they just decided to hold off as long as we we keep that we're not too hot not too cold will be All right they call it that gets the gold ...\nYep I'm hey Jerry I'm going to throw something in here when I we have um\nA lady that has been listening to our program since we started\nAnd it's really funny over the years she's called me and said you know I listen to your show every Sunday I get out of church and I and I listen to it on the way to the casino\n[laughter] she this lady her name is ...\nAnd and she is a loyal loyal listener every year she makes a donation um from her fabric store to our make a wish a conference and and and the people that won the uh the gift card this year\nI'm and she came by the conference and said Hi and and I'm invited me to come down to the store and and she wanted to meet my mom so my mother is eighty four years old and she was in town for the conference so I took my mother and my wife down declare store\nA down on 'em Campbell
