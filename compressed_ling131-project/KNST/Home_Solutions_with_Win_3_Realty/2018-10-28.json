I was upset by the insider trading or is it really true that the politicians and they're and they're a help to\nGet that information in the ... in a a a legal ramifications and how does that affect the overall market\nWell a that's a great question and if you ask me that ten years ago there were there was absolutely no law against the new senators are house or you know anybody in Washington and basically that worked for the government in the legislative branch and the\nThat and the judicial any of the branches would be prosecuted but now that they've started tightening up and are there still it's a moving target and they still can do some form of it but it's not that it's not as bad as it used to be\nAnd I you know reality is them going in in in\nYou know insider trading is it's not really going to be impactful on the market or the stocks it's just\nWhy did they ask you know my thing is that no that's my my yo it'd be geniuses of I was going to do a bill against pharmaceutical knowledge but that that's that was showing them oh yeah that was going\nTo be my point is that why are the you know politicians allowed to do something that you know regular in the ... and yeah I mean that that's the thing that's always bothered me but that's been you know that's Washington and they make the laws and the laws usually benefit them the mess the best so\nWhy don't they talk about this on our a network news programs or nobody seems to care about their\nNow you know it's a [laughter] that's a very that's very good point I think that you know you as a you know a viewer should say something you should you know either write them or email them and say that this is something that should be addressed at least\nNot forgotten about and you know the media the media is certain\nWhat they like to do is I like to cover certain stories and you know there's always the five sexy stories and then there's some news somewhere that doesn't constitute a sexy story to them so but if you make a point and you know the other listeners make a point you know they may listen they may they may you know at least have some sort of a you know\nOr maybe a small piece on it you know sixty

Thirteen hundred days my gosh are three hundred sixty five days in a year\nNow but the the lack of maintenance is that the issue right in that house it's just more and more maintenance\nThan what if the roost started leaking and now it's getting wet season after season after a season we actually had um a property a note that we've purchased up in Milwaukee that hadn't been lived in for eight years\nIn the basement had like four feet of water in it and in the wintertime it was an ice skating rink and in the summertime it was a swamp and and and you know there's always we ended up selling that hope that note once we we got the property and we ended up selling for Seventeen thousand dollars in a neighborhood that sells for close to a hundred\nBut I'm so there's always a buyer for everything no matter how bad it is and ah but this is where you know understanding the market and having your thumb on the pulse of what's happening out there\nIs really really important and you know the president you might have heard in the last several weeks he's doing a lot of flying around the country having rallies before the midterm elections sure\nAnd these multiple times called out the Federal Reserve saying knock it off you know this is high enough the economy's coming to a standstill because you're raising the rage too high and every other recession\nHas resulted from the banks lowering the rates are raising raising rates too fast for over correcting mhm and they don't give it time to you know the market to adopt to it and see if it keeps going and then hit it again they're just going bam bam bam and and uh\nYou know in some cases a lot of people are just conspiracy theories that they're doing it on purpose because every time there's now during the ... that's when the banks make more money so um what's your thought on that you're in the banking\nBusiness yeah it's a it's clear [noise] you're starting to hear that\nMessage over and over again not just from from our ministry but from a a from economists out there that you\nKnow are we raising our rates too quickly um and have we\nAre this is really need to be kind of talk through before we continue to raise and you're seeing that in this past week the volatility in the stock market and earnings and also why earnings are lower potential earnings were from these companies is is directly related to\nIn some cases to interest rates rising up to rapidly so it's uh it's interesting um it'll be it's gonna be next interesting next few a few weeks for sure\nAll right we'll talk more after the break this is Tucson solution\nHigh it's Garrett Lewis let me tell you about my buddy Bob Zach minor he leads the wind three teen power by e XP reality and get this\nBanks call Bob when banks can't give someone along because they don't fit the stereotypical box the banks called Bob to get the deal done if you've been rejected even though you have a good downpayment call Bob three one for sold and if you're a frustrated agent is lost sales\nCall Bob to find out how you can work with him and his when three team powered by e XP realty three one for sold eyes Karen Lewis if you are a real estate agent that's down on your luck not working out too well\nDon't worry my buddy ... who leads the wind three team at the XP realty trains agents all over the country and he's willing to train you you'll learn how you can get your sailors more money for their homes\nAnd help buyers that banks turned down learned bombs creative ways to help your clients to buy a home and sellers keep more of their money Bob leads the wind three team power by e XP realty three one for sold\nVIP mortgage we take a great deal of pride in being the preferred choice if she's not kept real estate agent in like ... at when three real T.

In the studio with Jerry son to be a mortgage and Jerry is you go to guy when it comes to getting a mortgage refinancing your loan restructuring and you know during had right before the break a story he was going to share with us\nAnd several of the people who listen to this program of contact the jury over the years and restructured their portfolio and this is where having somebody that really understands you know the time value of money and then what's better you know you might say well I've got a three point five percent loan\nBut it's a thirty year alone in your twelve years and you've got Eighteen years left to pay so why would I Want to go in and refinancing you know four and a half percent on\nWell if you sit down and run the numbers maybe it's better to have a four and a half percent loan for Fifteen Years and not\nThose extra three years of payments to see what that comes out to and and that's the kind of thing the jury will run for you and actually tell you you know this is a better thing or you know what I Love about jerseys honest and if it isn't the best thing is going to say you know what you should just stay right where you are because that's the best thing you could do so what's the story Jerry\nSo as a general in contact me last week it's a radio show listener and he owns eleven um property finance properties which you know in the world the conventional financing when I say conventional that's Fannie Mae Freddie Mac the max you can have is ten\nSo uh when you have eleven it's problematic because you cannot refinance your your any of your properties except their primary residence\nOr and this particular situation the borrower had some private money arms some adjustable rate mortgages that were coming due soon so he had to do something and he went through different lender and the other lenders I'm Sorry I Can't help you because it was over eleven probably you know you had eleven property\nSo we sat down and met last week and started we'd look sort of looking around and hey what what can we do to fix this problem and sure enough we came up with this game plan where um it was such a win win situation for for him and his family that I'm an end up saving them over six hundred dollars a month\nAnd a ...\nBut we ended up bringing up a another slot for him for being able to buy a property down the road\nSo it was a um it's just funny where it just when you take outside look outside the the the box and just say oh you have eleven property so I Can't help but instead if you turn around and say okay let's look and see what we have here and let's look at a ... a B and C and\nYou know I don't know the outcome when I start analyzing surfing and like I don't know which options going to be best let's just put 'em all out there and then we'll never know when you're on try it right\nAnd we did just that insurance up ended up coming up with this great plan that um is is are going to set him up for a huge win for for for for many many many years so it it just sometimes it is worth doing is really worth doing just that I'm taking your portfolio and let's analyze it\nAnd and look at it from abroad macro perspective to see what we can do to to help a person situation\nSo six hundred dollars a month that's a hundred and fifty bucks a week basically ... and ... but more importantly it's seven thousand two hundred dollars a year\nTo just take that out ten years at Seventy two thousand more dollars you put in that guy's pocket mhm this from someone else told them no and so I Know that doesn't work I mean you have too many loans I Can't help\nYou in this case you know he had a private money one that was coming due so or whether they know what's going to be called so he was going to have to you know sell it and sell it very quickly and which may have worked out fine but sometimes when you are have to sell something quickly you may have to sell it for less than you would\nIf if the normal market was on the they put them in it it kind of put them in a corner in a way and and uh um when we got done it was wow this is better than you know\nCould have ever predicted and that's the only that's the success stories we liked it it it was\nAwesome you know what that's um you know one of the reasons why I just love doing the show which areas as he you know he never says known in the ... and I I Can't tell you how many people over the years\nHave saved their deal because the you know something happened the buyer you know did something stupid went out and bought a bunch of furniture the week before closing or something and and ah you know sometimes that's not able to be changed but oftentimes Jerry can just say you know something simple like\nWell do you have someone then my co signed for you and and boom problem solved A M and nobody else even thinks of that and and that's you know just common sense and and a lot of experience as what is what makes that happen\nAnd that is so anyway thanks for helping our radio listener and and wherever that was that's listening a thank you for for helping promote our show I mean this is we we love to help people and\nAnd uh that's when we try to do every week not make the show or a big infomercial about us but try to provide knowledge in in in a\nNew ideas to people to educate them about the real estate market where they can make wiser decisions decisions with their finances absolutely so um let's talk about there's an article Jerry came on a everybody talked a little bit about zombie properties and [laughter] you know we don't have a lot that\nI I have to say this article did come around right around Halloween\nYou know [laughter] and and what is is on the property and you know it's a property that basically the people moved out of before the bank foreclosed and it's bacon and sometimes that can be taken property for years and even upwards of five years\nWhere nobody's living there and the neighbors are frustrated because there's all these deferred maintenance items and people are breaking instilling all the copper and now they're coming in and after school and you know doing things and bad things that they shouldn't do and and now crime is entering the neighborhoods so that's why it's a big deal and there are some\nMajor cities around the United states Philadelphia\nIs one that has one of the highest percentage of zombie properties out there and it's it's funny a lot of these are in the rust belt areas Illinois has a ton of them and the government I'm actually city of Chicago spin over three million dollars buying up these properties and and just to lock them up born I'm up in and take control of them\nBut I'm a you know when you hear all these rumblings about oh the economy is slowing down and I just wanted to quantify something there was an article came out this week called coming to America and it's talking about foreign nationals coming to the United states to buy a home and that oh my gosh the searches",
