but some Democrats are hinting they'll continue to try to learn more about the sexual misconduct allegations against him\nBack during the um you know oh seven timeframe I mean people were in the mid six is getting a loan and and again overtime I purchased my first home and talked about this many times in Nineteen eighty two and the prevailing rate was over Eighteen percent back them up\nAnd you know that it was crazy new car loans were Twenty one percent interest\nAnd uh you know they got a new car loans that are you know just one percent interest so it it's um\nWe're we're in a in a great time we we have a tremendous shortage of homes across the United states and and now with with a hurricane in North Carolina that's just placed a whole bunch of people and and you know that is going to affect short term the jobs report because on that's\nWhat happened this this this this time so that the jobs report that came out and thank you or are they the jazz working at a hundred and thirty four thousand jobs were created in the month of September the prediction was close to ... one eighty to two hundred\nRight we've averaged two hundred and one for the entire year\nThat's right so it it we fell below protection but Wall Street extracted off as well that was destruction from the hurricane that's why it was a\nUm that's why this summer came short so it's funny that the bad news that happened Wall Street is just kind of in the bond market has kind of shrug it off like oh that's because the hurricane um now the real meat of the uh equation is um the hourly or weekly\nOr a payroll numbers right is what people get paid on a weekly basis is actually higher\nAnd that is moving higher which is showing that there is wage inflation and that was the route of what what has caused mortgage rates to even\nA a worse or you know sell off as we call it a\nOn a into friday was because of this number that shows that that inflation is taking place in people's payrolls people are being paid more for their their hours\nAverage across the United states the ... year over year numbers to point eight percent um so the average American is making two point\nAnd ... percent more than they were last year at this time and when you look at everything you buy a new ad in the labor cost of of that any kind of service industry or store or anything and and we just ran into this uh this week in a um\nWe had a roof report back in a in a contract that was written in may and\nThe people had a a clause in their contract that they it was a contingency clause so basically they needed to sell a home before they could buy another home well it finally you know we got this deal closed the last day of September\nAnd the roof report um you know and that we had for me they said well we're going to need to be quote that because a lot of the prices of roofing materials of increased ... so\nAnd the uh other agent had ... had a company come out and just not looked at the roof quote but looked at the\nHome inspection report where they indicated a bunch of broken tiles so they went in and replaced all the broken tiles and they said well that was four hundred and something dollars and it's like well we had to bid for Thirteen hundred and forty dollars outcome and we look at what was done is like well what about ceiling all the chimney caps and and and doing all the other things that were on there\nWell the roofers right now with all the rain are backed up about three weeks so they so we can't get out there and and and that needed to close at the end of September so ah we went ahead and close the deal well we've got the roof quote I'm this week\nAnd that even though the four hundred dollars worth of trials have been replaced the bed came in and actually higher than it was previously because of cost of other things and we called the company and they said well you know will stick with the quote we gave me before but I mean our costs on everything has gone up\nAnd I was just talking to a a builder friend of mine um is at our CrossFit gym this week\nAnd he said you know concrete is a hundred and twenty dollars a yard yeah I mean I I build a hundred and sixty houses in Tucson but I haven't built one since two thousand and stuff and we used to be a concrete at forty two dollars yard in or seven so if you want to know why house prices have to go higher\nI mean not only is labor increasing but the cost of materials is going I yeah and and the lumber with the uh you know Canadian lumber embargo which should settle now that the NAFTA thing has been resolved and then we got to open trade but you know what that tactic really did work to negotiate a better a better deal for the United states\nUm so so Jerry and and uh we've talked about Hurricane Florence and hitting in just dumping on North Carolina and parts of South Carolina\nI'm you know they're saying that a near term that's going to you know everybody kind of frozen a bunch of people got laid off and nobody was doing new hires during that time but now wants to rebuilding starts there will be actually more need\nFor people to know where it before so this downturn in the job's number is a short term thing that's really driven a lot by the hurricane\nAnd and you know we we if people have been\nIt's been a hot topic at the at the polls for a long time about you know minimum wage and having a Fifteen dollar lowest minimum wage in in the United states and I don't know if you remember what your wage was in high school I started sacking groceries\nAt two dollars and thirty cents an hour that was the minimum wage in Nineteen Seventy six so um you know for somebody I'm working at a job I mean Fifteen dollars seems like a lot like a lot like ethics sex on what it was back in Nineteen Seventy six\nBut when we come back we've got more I'm a news to talk about we've got uh some some more on the job to report and also I'm an interesting story on a Denver regarding homeless people will be back

home prices are starting to stall and the numbers of sales are lower than they were last year\nWith the number of homes for sale or lower than last year because there's no end the story so if you don't have as many to sell how can how sales numbers keep up with with the same number of them were actually very close to last year as a matter of fact last month we we tied a dead I I'm with the with the previous year\nBut here's what's interesting this a mark swimming as a chief economist at first American\nHe said in September consumer house buying power declined\nTwenty eight thousand dollar um compared to a year ago if household income has not increased compared to a year ago the increase in mortgage rates would have reduced consumer I was buying power\nBy thirty thousand dollars

when three team leader ...\nGood morning and welcome back I'm In the studio with Jerry sent a VIP mortgage and right before the break we started talking about the pathway to purchase program which this program actually allows you to\nUm get a government money for up to ten percent of the value of the home you're purchasing and you can use that in any way you see fit as far as you can use of torn down payment if you've been in ... lost because you needed three percent and closing costs and other people didn't ask for that\nYou can use the money to three percent for closing costs um if if you're smart and you talked to a jury son he'll train you that you could actually\nPay two percent toward the I'm a mortgage insurance right up front by it out and buy it out and that way you get rid of the mortgage insurance on your payment which lowers your monthly payment and\nI'm also if you pay your closing costs you still have five percent off to the value of the home and this program is if you stay in the home for five years\nThen you don't have to repay the mortgage mortgage just goes away so they put this second mortgage on but if you stay in the home for five years as an owner occupant then basically the loans forgiven\nAnd it's up to twenty thousand dollars I mean it's a big chunk of money\nIt's a big deal I mean how long does it take an average American family living in Tucson, Arizona making forty seven thousand median income roast a year to put away twenty grand right I mean it's huge but then the average American family doesn't even save two hundred dollars a month\nSo twenty thousand dollars is a hundred months of of savings I mean that's eight years just if they said religiously two hundred dollars a month\nRight right no it's it's it's a gift horse but it's a um it's running in very short supply and so it's it's funny the last few days so ah I had you know the we had four we met it on um when the window open and none of them got accepted we're with them we were within minutes\nI'm going and so it's really um and and\nConcerned now about November because all these people and covered it didn't get the money if sellers are willing to stay and allow them to extend the they're closing dates what is going to happen in November\nI there's that many more backed up people\nIt's going to be a blood that so I'm the only solution that I see that as a um is you know for sellers anyway is that if someone says oh they're approved going you know using pathway to purchase\nA ... but you know it's all you have to say look you're approved rate but if you don't get the funds you have to have a backup plan and you know if you're not going to get the if if you don't get a lottery of funds and you got to go with another downpayment assistance or something so it is because sellers have to protect themselves\nAll the worse I mean basically when you when you accept an offer your home goes active contingent\nAnd it's it's tough to market nobody goes on showing homes that are already have accepted offers on them so you're showing activity just comes to a screeching halt\nAnd and now you're sitting there with an empty home with a buyer who may not be able to qualify and and you know the whole thing with with um alone is when when you write an offer and it's accepted there's three contingencies you have an inspection contingency which isn't just inspecting the home that's\nI I Want to verify that there is no sexual predators anywhere near I Want to find out you know you went to school scores are and you know the all the different things you have a ten day window typically that's that's the default on an Arizona contract where you can for any reason cancel and move on after that ten days you come back\nWith an inspection report either I cancel or I Would like you to fix these things and that's a buyer inspection noticed seller response well the next thing to do after the repairs have been negotiated is to order the appraisal there's an appraisal contingency\nHas to have praised for as much as as being paid or else you know there there's another negotiation taking place well after the appraisal comes in assuming it came in and value are higher\nThan that contingencies removed but all the way to the day of closing is the financing contingency when I can buy this home without alone so here a buyer comes and writes an offer I'm going to close in six weeks\nSo think about this here we are in the first week of October six weeks from now we're at Thanksgiving right and then this person says oh I Can't close because I didn't get the money\nSo now you have to\nTry to sell your home at a time when everybody was decorating the home they currently live in for Christmas and nobody is outhouse shopping very few people and and your number buyers just died and I mean this cost you a sale this year and on a vacant home that's sitting there I mean you're carrying cause can be up to one or two percent a month\nOn tearing that house just the taxes keep going the insurance the utilities the ... and and you know vandalism increases on a vacation home builder hunger it's a ton of market so there's there's all kinds of adverse\nEffects and and we actually had a deal that the fires were counting on halfway to purchase money\nAnd we accepted their offer our our clients did because they didn't ask for any repairs\nOr any closing costs excuse me closing costs well they did not get the money so they called back and said hey we still want the house but we're going to have to renegotiate because we need closing costs now\nSo all of a sudden the seller who's been high fiving everyone thinking their house is sold\nIt hasn't sold anymore so so that's the problem I Wonder what agency Jerry's that that's that's allocating these funds are you hearing department of housing okay so I mean that's a ... is there any way that anybody could go to them and say this is ridiculous scheme you got\nGoing on ironically I was on the phone for hours with or that aid for the um this past week and um you know there's nothing that um they at least they weren't they I talked to many people there and said yes this is our deal we we can't change it it's a um\nMore effectively re regulated where we're not going to change it this program and\nWhat we're trying to make it as fair for everyone as possible\nWell the the first time this program on out years ago it was there was not a monthly women can be used as much money as you want to put into the money was gone and and ... during that first run up you know so much where she is\nIn the first few months but then it kind of died off you remember that wasn't a big thing anymore", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Home Solutions with Win 3 Realty", "city": "Tucson",
