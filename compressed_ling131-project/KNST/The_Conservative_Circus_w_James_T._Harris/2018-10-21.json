{"station": "KNST", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Conservative Circus w James T. Harris", "month": "10", "state": "AZ", "day": "21", "content": "I live in if you're not getting all three hours became commando show I joined ... had already get Kim Dotcom\nAnd for just a few bucks a month you can watch the show you can get the pod cast chat with all the great folks in the chat room because they're fabulous by the way\nAnd then we have contests you can come see the show and the list goes on and on the on the head over to get Kim Dotcom once again that's get Kim Dotcom it all three hours of the show it's great for when you're walking exercising driving because after all knowledge is power\nA time in Scottsdale, Arizona so low there Tom\nBlow their Kim what's going on\nWell I have a question uh I'm just give you a little set up here I'm a dentist\nAnd ah have a a website that I have one son mind right now I Want to try to put together for another part of my practice\nAnd I've been toying with the idea of putting a check ups function but sure what you call it in the website to where people could ask questions before they came in and the question I Would have for you is\nIt is a beneficial or that you ... you would do is it are easy to do and of course what kind of back up to I Need to have as far as\nThe employment of people to support that are the questions or what have you you know all of his oh yeah oh really good questions by the way Tom I'm you know we read deployed shop dot commando dot com\nAnd uh you know we put a chat function in in the shopping website oh my gosh it's amazing you know uh how how many people have basic question than him by you having a human being there\nIt really will help with the return on your investment are you thinking that you're going to get overwhelmed by these questions\n[noise] well I Would say I have to have someone in place so I just recently was approached by a company that said that they would do is they would have ah\nThey employ individuals to support the ah the ... function somehow that would work because they would give me thirty quit or I Would give them thirty questions ...\n... a prospective clients would ask them and those are the three questions I Would give them the Andrews as well so as I as a person would call and they would get a hold of this company and they would have if they asked a question though she they had the the canned answer that I've already given\nBut of course are those should include both of those dirty flushing yeah ... and say\nHere's the reason why I'm hesitating that\nIs that I think if you were dealing with a product okay\nAnd I'm not saying that you're dentistry is not a product but you're also providing a very personalized service right\nBut and I don't know if that would work with a personalized service such as yours doctor I'm like we we looked into that for the shop to but part of us\nIn our businesses that I Want people to know that you know we're with them right we're not a bunch of robots that they can depend upon us they can trust us and to a large extent is that I have to trust you with my family members and friends and also with myself or my oral history and my role hygiene right\nSo so I Would be hesitant to doing that I Would put a check up on the website and see what kind of volume that you get\nAnd you you are able to turn it off you can say that it's only available for me to five so maybe there's a gallery guy in the office said you could say you know what you're going to get it a couple of hours a day you're going to get a couple of hours a day a couple of hours a day and you may find that you are truly in fact uh getting\nThe same question time and time again\nOf which then you know that you need to put maybe a different button on the website make something more prominent or maybe there could be part of those thirty questions later on but I think you'll find that the volume isn't going to be that high and the people that will that you'll engage will be people that you can convert\nTo a a paying client\nBecause they're going to feel that human touch now when you start looking at different shed depending upon where you get your website it may already be built in as a function may cost you a couple of hundred or maybe a couple of bucks a month for that\nIf you're building your side from scratch they have names like then desk chat is free uh there's also live chat and there's also live agent um are you building the site or somebody building for you\nAh yes well the the we do at the ... already been billed than we have another company building a another website ... but but when the media but third tempting is calling me about that in the ... function I don't I wouldn't I wouldn't add I wouldn't let the third party do it yet\nI Would I Would I Would just I Would encourage you just to test the waters the kind of questions you get and then you can also listen to those questions under ... choose as part of the website but if you have a person behind this instead of an automated robot and I know that there's a lot of\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n\n[laughter] [noise]\nIt won't be forty five degrees you know we don't want our quarters\n\nWe'd already indicated

I Know you can make that difference and it's important and I think it's important for the listeners especially those up there in your district right right they did there was an importance right now we're we're in in a in a position as we said the midterms don't really bring people out\nBut the people that are filled with hate right now are going out to vote so it's important that they go out and they make sure and it's just like it's a simple district nine\nFor there you go that's it just ... if it's Hillary it's any that pretty dirty damn easy yeah you just say for are just like the car except it ends in a\nConnect the dots connect the lines and you're done what I put it in the envelope\nSo what are you seeing you know you've seen down there the issues obviously the the camps are a huge issue right like I said before it operating bases um and I know I'm not going to put you on the spot because I Know that people were going to do this unity what are you gonna do I mean you're coming into it but you're coming into it I Believe\nThat you will maintain that door open door policy was\nAbsolutely you know and as we talked about in the car I mean first of all I Want to say first of all I Want to thank the national border patrol council further endorsement I Am incredibly proud humbled means the world to me I'm yeah I'm a native Arizona right I was born and raised here of lived on the border you bend in Mexico many times as a kid as an adult\nWhat the border patrol folks are doing the agents are doing they're they're risking their lives every day you know their their main to keeping that then green line and so I have the utmost respect and admiration for border patrol sort of have their endorsement especially the first time candidate means autonomy\nI appreciate having I I Want I Want to just let you roll with the Mike in aspirin to listeners out there the importance of of of the vote the importance of voting the right way\n... this is your voice the vote is your voice and again I think all of us that have worn the uniform like we talked about earlier you we understand that we go out we do the mission for whichever elected leader that we have and we always do a good job and we always you know\nYou know followers but but we have to do is to vote is the opportunity to decide which of those people are going to be you know set in the mission given us the resources have in our back you know all the top cover and\nAnd it it's a big big difference in two thousand Eighteen the difference between me and my opponent my opponent hasn't even said he wants\nA physical barrier on reporter that's crazy ... yeah and it might not have like walls that his home must just be like a rough with colors you know what people we've talked about this you know everybody has a lock on their front door and it's not because\nYou you dislike people or anything it's just because it's the ... you know everybody has what you do it because it's a way to keep your family safe and secure ... and I said at a you know\nI said a lot you know I don't like my front door because I hate the people outside it's 'cause I Love the people inside a certain you know one of the things you lay you alluded to you know you go back to Congress and you'd be won a foreigner thirty\nFive people so that the the big thing is one first of all I'm going to Congress out of service I'm not going to Congress because I'm termed out of my regular job like my opponent is or because I Want a promotion\nI like my job you know I work at a trauma center I get to save lives every day which is a blessing and I had a gift to be able to do that sort of thing 'cause I'm a doctor by Iraq onto so for the listeners who didn't know that so I have a job I Love I'm doing this because\nSo we need to have people need a voice and they need representatives there and one of the things I'll do when I get to Congress is I Will talk to every\nOf every other of those four thirty four people and ask them to take the the tour to walk the the fence line that I just walked with you because there is no substitute for that you got to walk that and you gotta walk with somebody like you so you can see\nThe reality of the situation on the ground and that's one of those things again that you know we have fewer veterans in Congress than we've ever had in the history of the country oh wow that's shocking yeah Eighteen percent in the Nineteen seventies it was Seventy five percent in the house eighty one percent in the Senate now it's Eighteen percent\nSo again it just I I think people are well intentioned but they don't know what they don't know and one of the things you learned working up the ranks twenty five years in uniform is you gotta walk in the navy we say you know you've got to take things down to the plate you got to walk the spaces which means you don't just sit up there on the you know in the captain's\nMess and just how the people tell you what's going on down in the engine room you got to get down there in the engineering and you're going to say I was like a lot of border patrol leadership needs to go through the navy for us in figured I went out and I tell you that when you see it when you lay your own eyes on it and it will likely said you gotta drive that highway when you drive that highway and you see that\nYou know there's a you know an or preserve on the you know I'm ... and there's a reservation on the west side and you see that and you see it with a military mind and you say this is a court or of entry\nYeah this is a tough area to to patrol and to keep safe and then forty percent of the drugs coming into the United states are coming through those court or\nIt's insane like Americans don't know about the people on the other side do\nRight now or do they know like their current ... this is their career right and they don't have a retirement plan\nSo they're just they just keep working in that area I tell you that's an important and you know I think it's important and I am very happy that you say you going to go back and talk to you know the other four hundred plus yeah that would hold the same position as you because we have guys right on that congressman that are right from the border in really close and they don't show up was that guy's name was the big issues in the red nose what's his name off\nRight we have that guy you know\nHe he doesn't go out there he hasn't really reached out\nTo a counselor and I said you know yeah we may not agree with things but I'll take them out there and I'll show you understand it from a military\nBackground if you've got to walk those because the thing is border security should not be a partisan issue it shouldn't be whether you want to call by person or non part right if not I mean that's how the military that's why I Love the military was it wasn't a partisan place in and despite working for four presidents I deployed under three of them\nTo Democrat one Republican I always want you to do jobs the best of your ability accomplish the mission there is no partisans in a foxhole there's no Parsons down there I ... we just you know can you count on the people that you're down there with solar shoulder to get the job done\nAnd people I Would encourage everyone to go do it because\nIt gives you a perspective and it gives you an insight and the reason is when those drugs are flowing across the border you know those that ... those opioid Oh yes there are killing Democrats or Republicans what their who they're killing our American uh-huh and that's why it is everybody's business and so when you understand the problem\nThen you understand then you it helps you find the solution no it's\nBig I know the agents really appreciate when when people are run for public office and they take the time to go out there and see what we also right we don't have enough of that to be honest I Am thankful that you went out there and that you saw it because now you have you already have that edge because of that\nUm but it helps it it's very very helpful see your doctor or and I knew that so you're a doctor but you're a combat medic riser you all serious serious things out there\nThat's one of the things that inspired me to run I was in Afghanistan and two thousand and I was part of the Obama surge ... got there in June right after General McChrystal took over it was very high op tempo we talked about a lot of that ... and those patrols and convoys there was a lot of\nSort of reminiscent dry on that lonely highway without like driving on those roads in Afghanistan and I tell you what I'm\nYou know when I saw people one of the things that folks don't realize and this is like nothing you would ever get magic could happen\nYou know our soldiers would be putting tourniquets on their arms and legs before we go out on patrol so that if you got blown up in your leg was dramatically amputated you could synch down your own tourniquet to save your own life\nBut when you see people doing that young men and women\nYou realize there's people risk and more than reelection risk and more than reputation and they do it you know and and as you know the camaraderie right being out there are people you know they brushed it off they kind of joke about it laugh about it but you know that is a big deal and they need a voice yes and I said to myself then\nThese folks need a voice because people don't realize that's what's happening\nAnd and so here I Am you know run for Congress to give those folks a voice because we're coming up on our Eighteenth year of war mhm no\nHope you're listening to the for our he's he's like he's running for district nine\nGo up there it's important to go out there and vote twenty five years ... a navy combat medic and in just an all around great guy and we've had this is the second time we've we really hung out a this was a longer time and and it was really ... it's an eye opener to talk to you\nBecause you're so down to earth that guys need to know that I Know there's a lot of former military that work within the agency and hey go up there and back up one of your own you know it's it's a big deal it's a huge deal especially in these midterms you said that it's a real turn out right usually a terms yeah oh we can't have that we\nCan't have it there's too much at stake there is far too much at stake you know our country's future of the direction our country takes\nYou know is is in the balance and we live again this is one of those other things in right you know part of the reason people or whether they're coming across the border or whichever way because America has this opportunity we have democracy right where most of the places when the navy or the marine corps your travel agent roaster\nYeah I can barely I use the F bomb very eloquently I think but then I always get mark on him around mark and I feel I tone it down and he's going to go out and said you said jeeze art that's ... that's what I Do because I Know it's like\nHey you know what I mean you know what I'm saying mark and police work we would call that verbal judo so that's great see that's what I like it so tell us you know he just talked about it because I Know I read your book\nAnd and I said hey this we can plug your book here mark and people will buy it you'll be like in New York bestseller you want to go to work well ... was into like a bird book today but it certainly was a kid knowledge\nThe deep friendship that you know I've had with art and prior to our it would've been a ... random Jed those crazy you know so much older guys the one guy I'd probably\nThe less hair than you do Brandon has lesser than me says 'cause I grew up watching it but you're clearly the best looking I don't know who the smartest is like ... or ... when a ... I worked in Phoenix at my last four years with the financial enforcement association\nI'm we encountered a serious problem well I shouldn't call it a problem I should call it a crime has called illegal immigration [laughter] uh it was a literally killing my members I've had six officers killed by illegal aliens oh it was literally killing\nOur Hispanic community partners in Phoenix right it was clearly a sanctuary city policy we went head to head with chief show this\nAnd got a change so that we could not only partner successfully with federal immigration punishment that we could facilitate their success\nIn forcing while heck we deal with the FBI the da da da da and specter ... U.S Marshals but we weren't allowed to the border patrol or I should call they didn't make sense it was risky it was dangerous and we saw the aftermath of that [noise]\nNo yeah I Know you guys went through some Susan ... times and obviously losing an officer just plain and simple is is a big deal and it's like you know what since since you were a police officer for the longest time you hear that argument though mark you hit the argument that a lot of people make of well we have criminals here what's the difference\nYou know is is is the illegals really that bad because but the way I see it is yeah I Know we have criminals here but we don't need to import more criminals right I mean that's what it comes down to well and that kind of talk\nA lot like it sounds like the concept of an acceptable casualty rate uh-huh well only ... I Can't imagine Steve for are on the battlefield saying well we only had ten killed right no good doctor would be upset if he had one wounded\nA there is no acceptable casualty rates in proactive constitutionally base law enforcement or we leave no man we leave no woman behind him these policies were forcing\nOr actually mandating illegal aliens to commit another crime created another victim and cause more damage first before we could partner and proactively interact with border patrol and I\nKnow and I know you you've been very active for quite some time no just not as a police officer would you be a very active in ... I I guess I call it the movement of making sure that a police officers are taken\nI don't want to be serious 'cause I think they're taking serious but they're not taken for granted I guess is the word that I'd be looking for um you were very instrumental in helping the national book will come so with a lot of the\nIssues that we've had an endorsement you've been very instrumental you I mean you helped us form a great partnership with share of George pile\nUm who thinks because if you you've got an us in their front door many times um and and there's just a lot of things that you've done I Want to ask you this though it's when you're twenty five years of of being\nA police officer you're very uh\nClint Eastwood dish [laughter] club dirty Harry you know a young ladies would of course not rowdy gates from raw but you know\nThere are worries me I look old like an eighty two year old ... [laughter]\nI don't want your five bucks a late is that you know nice where did I Know you're with Joe clear you know and he's been on the show a couple of times\nAnd he talked about the times you know his him being a security guard at the metro mall he was really and he got fired did he got fired for because if you're an idiot [laughter] yeah but in all your years did you ever tell one of the ...\nGo ahead make my day\nAbsolutely no no no I I Would advise him frequently have this thing called Miranda and how much of a wonderful time they would have in Sheriff Joe jail a there you go back that no that's that's awesome\nSo twenty five years sure story mark the listeners when I hear a story you know we have a lot of law enforcement to listen to have a lot of uh civilians and I'll listen to it\nUm I Know you've been we've been together at a lot of these oh I don't know events where there's a lot of protesters and the people that protest against law enforcement you senior share of protests\nAgainst law enforcement and I've seen my\nMy share of a lot of bad things involving law enforcement I'm clearly I'm\nBiased towards law enforcement in the sense that I greatly admire uh men and women who choose to run into a gunfight a it's a great honor to serve those who served to to help those who helped protect those\nWho protected that they would interest me with caring for them was great honor a and and their success clearly him positively impacted the success of the community and when it's been\nWhat has been delightful for me as the transition from the camaraderie and the partnership\nOr in friendship from law enforcement and Phoenix\nTo federal immigration enforcement ... with the border patrol it's been very natural made a lot of sense for me so the ability to serve you guys and your membership\nOr not only you know political into professional capacity certainly for my position and judicial watch Rahm but also from a from a spiritual capacity in the sense of providing some a Judeo Christian ethic some principals to encourage a to stay the course or because you know we always used to joke about\nEverybody loves a firefighter\nOr nobody loves the cop when I finally got her and her house it's a great thing about when the cop knocks on your door so he's going to go to jail ... they're always behind the curve um\nThe men and women that I work with as well with you we never start to fight\nBut we always have to finish it\nAnd if we don't finish it correctly we're going to go home hurt or dead right and if we don't finish it legally we're going to go home indicted so there's a huge burden we don't start it but we finish it but yet we're a hundred percent responsible for the outcome is a huge burden I admire anyone who gets paid\nThe pittance that local law enforcement of federal law enforcement gets paid for that huge ... New York I see you guys get paid a lot anyway\nYou hear it on time limitation if you want to get rich you don't want to law enforcement [laughter] ah that's not where the money that\nRight and and I'm going to switch gears and they may make some people uncomfortable and just giving me a weirdo\nI'm ... I'm actually listening intently so it was fascinating yeah because I I\nMike what my question sort of like what is the biggest hassle for law enforcement dealing with the illegal immigration situation with our hands tied are they able to do their job that's something I definitely want to know about\n... percent tuition I tell you that the biggest hassle for law enforcement\nLaw enforcement whether it's federal or state or city\nThese men and women have a lot of pressure mhm I'll tell you something right now yeah Ninety five percent of the pressure from police were called is used that term for me right doesn't come from the bad guy in front of me comes from that manager behind me was going to second guess me six months eight months of twelve months down the\nLine [noise] five percent of the pressure comes from the bad guy but I can empathize and even sympathize with the bad guy I Know what he's going to do I know why he's doing and I'm trained to handle that\nBut when the manager and I'm sure you see this to art in your shop for national border patrol council\nHas all this time ah to second guess\nYou Steve decisions life and death decisions and the wind whether it's in the city of Phoenix or in Dallas where the shooter don't shoot rats don't arrest search don't search uh the biggest risk the manager has he might get a paper cuts and have his feelings hurt\nBy my guys are getting shot at you guys getting shot at and rocks that is that's the pressure or no to the ... tale that when it comes to immigration issues\nIt makes absolutely no sense\nThe agenda with open borders that impacts Phoenix police officers and certainly with border patrol in ice guys and gals is this pursuit of power and profit yeah the last one power\nThe right wants profit and the way you get power and profit is by taking advantage of all people group on that board and you saddle them with crime and you've settled them with the menial in the ...\nDana patched and it's just absolutely brutal\nAnd disgraceful that people would take advantage of people group ah\nIn in encouraging motivate others to break the law right that that's just shameful and once again it spills over not only into communities but into two professional careers and also victims and suspects like there's a huge cost you ... you know what's\nAmazing is that you're right you hit the nail on the head there's a lot of managers that they've forgotten where they came from you know I I reading through my notes obviously we have issues here you guys have had the issue is what do you think it is that makes these managers forget we call it drink the Kool Aid sometimes but it's amazing you know we have different things at", "city": "Tucson"}
