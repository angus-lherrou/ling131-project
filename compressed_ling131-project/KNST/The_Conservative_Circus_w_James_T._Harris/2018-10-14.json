that\nHey we're going to take a real quick break folks we're gonna come back with a President Trump's talk on condemning some Democrats on uh the way they're acting towards\n... ice and the way they're acting towards law enforcement in general uh I'm hoping to get\nTo a later on in the show on the more apprehensions that we're seeing and obviously the crisis that the human screw up the human scrub there's the human smugglers are creating in Arizona and ah you'll be interesting to hear that there's some managers especially at the Tucson station\nThat are not a really helping with this crisis and uh they're just they're taking advantage\nOf some border patrol agents and I wanted to talk about that because as always enjoy exposing bully and I think that's the mentality that is going on at the Tucson station particular anything going a little bit she\nMen and women who carry their gear Gerber is unstoppable decades of innovation and dedication and put them on Tom Green out as a master of knives and tools reverse problem solving lifesaving products are designed whether you need to have a specific activities in mind today that includes much more than a blade it is a lifestyle\nWhen law enforcement and tactical professionals need quality products they go five eleven tactical five eleven tactical as are the loyalty and trust of those protecting humidity and families worldwide we're proud to have five eleven is our sponsor Ross promote their products because saver and our second and so forth [noise] hey\nTo the Greenland folk prejudice trust 'cause damned some Democrats\nAnd their attempts to a sort of police from cooperating with ice and in stemming tide of these lethal drugs\nAnd I think it's important for people to understand because we have way too many people are dead or running for political positions that are anti law enforcement and it's it's scary\nWhen you start looking at and at the same time I think you have individuals that are already in political positions that don't understand what it is that we do so what they're doing is\nThey're trying to make us the villains that way they can pull the votes from a certain group of people right when it comes down to a like these antifa jerks that you see all the time um which I've seen some of these on these guys\nAre probably get the one big yoked anti forgot to come after me but it is what it is I just tell you that I see some of these antifa folks and uh some of these and our so called anarchists and\nI don't know Andy I don't think they could fight their way out of a paper bag right you know they're pretty weak looking individuals' a but apparently they think they can be tough guys and they're out there talking about it and one thing that I wanted to talk when we get to President Trump's remarks right\nBut one thing I Want to talk about as there was um some antifa folks\nOn September twenty first his window for the media first reported it right and uh it was a website it was in it and ... a website and it did\nCall for the slaughter of it this is what it says the call it's a call for the slaughter of fastest border patrol dogs and their boss wow\nAnd that's in reference to uh to publish claims that are known by a tea for activists so it goes on and it shows and it says um killers and brown sugar uniforms which we don't wear brown so they already there colorblind\nHow the United states border patrol brutalizes the masses and uh it was written on the September twentieth of twenty team and then they're well known anti fur activists it's the the writers and the new service and uh I think his name is Rick Salazar\nAnd they called themselves revolutionaries and it's time to rise up with the masses right and and cause violence against fastest\nBorder patrol dogs and their boss says he goes on to say slaying them slaying them that's what it says ... laying them with revolutionary fire and justice\nThe source also stated that they said a red guards and their supporters\nAs they have said just before the time for activism is over now is the time for a war believe that\nSo they're calling out for an all out war on\nAgainst border patrol agents directly it's a little right on the source also advocated too and ah the barbarism that the U.S imperialism and for masses from Central America and Mexico\nTo exact rubble luge revolutionary vengeance and seize power\nSo I don't think that has done it enough media play\nAnd I don't think people know what antifa how the the ... started where it started I don't think people really know about it just is you hear it once in a while and that's it yeah they're bugs\nIs what they are then you'd be squashed and I know it sounds horrible to say it and then they'll say oh well arts law enforcement and he'd say you know what guys these people are domestic terrorism there are a threat to America there are a threat to our way of life and I took an oath to defend this country against all terrorists foreign\nAnd domestic and that's where people were getting lost and these people were domestic terrorists but to go ahead and say it's time to stop activism it's time to start the war it's time to go on an all out war\nHey listen man at the end of the day I just want to live to be an old man and if some of these anti for guys come and there was a problem and I got to take a few of them with me so be it\nShould agents keep their eyes open ... or even more now I've always I mean it's like they have always\nI think all on force meant when the time we're all on force but needs to keep their eyes open and you have these certain regimes and you have these these actors so called activists and you have these throughout the entire border though the um the hubs across the border people as I like to call them you know and and\nThey're anti law enforced that's when it comes down to and they say well\nYou know the people that you guys were wrestling are not criminals if I break into your house in my criminal\nIf I just go into your window at my luminal yeah you know I'm a criminal you know if I Need something I'm going to go in there just to take it 'cause I'm In need store criminal you know regardless of if I'm Broken into your house before are not at all it takes is one time and I'm a criminal so I'm tired of hearing this oh well these these\nIllegal immigrants do not need to go to a concert legal aliens I'm tired of hearing that don't call them aliens for one I'm tired of hearing people\nAttacked that that's the legal word illegal aliens and the reality is\nI don't care if you break into the country once twice or if it's your hundredth time you're breaking our laws of our country and you are a criminal\nYou may not like it you may be bothered by the fact that you're being called the criminal which are criminal\nAnd and and a lot of it stemmed and my my frustration is when I did this Fox a town hall John ... couple of weeks ago yeah there was a girl there and she was very like don't call me a criminal don't call me an alien that's what you are\nAnd then I and I went on her face on our on our Instagram page on her Instagram per person on Instagram page right [noise] and\nOffer pictures are or how Mexico's fantastic how she root for the Mexican team has the Mexican seems so great in fact she has a picture on her um Instagram\nWhere it's her birthday cake right and it's a Mexican flag ... so I'm sitting here going didn't why do you want to be a citizen of this country\nYeah you know what I mean it just doesn't make any sense your allegiance is obviously not here it's over there so go I'm I'm okay with you just\nPractice what you preach yeah right\nUh I got so many things in my head that I Want to talk about\nPresident Trump delivered those ... or some remarks are at the one hundred and twenty fifth annual conference as an exposition of International Association of chiefs of police along the opposite of Florida and yeah that's a long name [laughter] he got a lot of praise though from from a lot of the attendees and um\nHe talked about the brave efforts with federal immigration and Customs Enforcement office the eyes\nHe says\nWho does what does he doesn't do something a particularly as I keep teasing some issues at the Tucson ... [noise] you're listening to the Greek\nTexas federal wellness center founded with a vision based on principles focused on superior healthcare utilizing a combination of physical medicine physical therapy and surgical expertise visit the website at Texas F. W. C. dot com [noise] this is the green line\nAs the vice president of the national border patrol council I represent more than Fifteen thousand border agents we need leaders who will help us fix the border prices just in cinema opposed funding to help law enforcement fights and drug cartels and she supported dangerous sanctuary city policies here say cinema is weak on border security\nThe national border patrol council was proud to endorse Martha ... for Senate and we know Martha has our back and she'll do what it takes to secure the border\nAnd my family and I approve this message and now back to the green [noise]\nBack and they want to talk about prevention\nRio Grande valley sector chief ... says that the numbers have doubled for those crossing the border illegally\nOver for thousands or four thousand arrests were made for the first week of this fiscal year compared to just over two thousand arrest being made on October of twenty Seventeen they've doubled why do you think they've doubled\nBecause catch and release is still going on\nBecause there's no consequences for the individuals that are breaking our immigration laws\nBecause the rhetoric alone that President Trump delivered when he first took over office dropped the numbers and our leaders within the United states border patrol failed to act upon that window that's when it comes down to why because this is what you have\nYou have an all star team which is the border patrol agents\nThere are all strict then you have the managers and the coaches the general manager all that and then you have the owner which in this case I Will attribute the owner as being President Trump\nSo it works right so we are\nConsidered I Would say under new ownership with all star players that need motivation that need the proper gloves hats\nBalls foot wear uniforms\nNeed all that the owner wants to give them too\nBut the general manager who's been a general manager for quite some time uh is a feeding different information probably to the owner then you've got the coaches and the manager\nWho are are the same coaches and managers that were there before they just change their position one turned into another manager and the other one is now the batting coach and just flip flopped\n[noise] so where is the problem in the managerial staff that all star players I just said the all star players were the ones that were in line wanting this new owner and they're happy with the new owner President Trump the issue has always been\nThe general manager and the and the manager of the coaches of the team [noise] we're not going to change the game plan if you have the same manager in the same no matter no I'm not saying fire or higher position leaders\nBut give them another position somewhere else I don't know that's all I'm saying I think we have good leaders within border patrol I think a lot of them are going to be retiring here soon because it's their time to retire then they're done and they don't see any change it I see it all the time with some of the leadership I speak to\n'em it's going to be a scary next few years because we have\nI don't know less than responsible or less than professional leaders that are going to be staying and they're going to be getting higher positions now and then you shouldn't have the higher ups which are running the organization that are still running it and they're doing a horrible job\n[noise] so that's my rent on that because I think it's important that the\nThe regular citizen understand I'm not trying to attack because there are certain things I Want to hold back on not because I'm scared to say it but because I don't want the general public to think here's art just ranting and raving attacking his agency I'm not attacking my agency we have\nAnd tested agents rank we have fantastic leaders unfortunately many of the managers that are in this agency that are calling the shots and the bigger wig people are in DC that are causing shots are doing a horrible job\nAt the expect the expense of the agents and at the expense of um some of the leaders that actually want to be leaders it's just the way it is yeah\nYou're seeing this crisis you're seeing the amount of individuals are coming into that states you're seeing it here in Arizona as I said more than fourteen hundred Central American illegals primarily from Guatemala have been found traveling in large group since August in remote areas in different parts of the desert in Arizona\nI've been surprised to see the number of groups you don't have it you'd think two three four maybe ... people to the hundreds ... amazing hundred people because there's no consequences any there's all kinds of us are getting cut costs are getting released so for listeners who don't know what catch and release is and I know we've explained to her\nBut ages catch him they fingerprint um they don't have any prior criminal history the United states keep in mind I don't have the database of their country so I don't know if they committed crimes and their country\nRight um there's nowhere to house them\nSo you release them you're making pinkie swear that they're short for an immigration court that's it based on a on a ... I mean there's more to the process obviously our paper was but that's in it then\nAnd then that show that's what it is\nNo consequences or you know they were talk we were talking about the crisis the Arizona issue\nThe agency it did cite that at least eight years instances since August twentieth in\nWhich a group more than a hundred undocumented aliens usually including families and small children were found in areas of south west Arizona now I talked a somebody sent me a message I don't even know what was it I get I get messages all the time and anonymous people and there was a big group that they arrested and are they all had the same phone\nNumber in their pocket right and so this I guess this guy is an uncle to over a hundred individuals but they answered head you know so and so you're the uncle yeah I Am just what\nCatch and release it's obvious there's the smuggling organization is just ridiculous and they're laughing at our laws I mean that's what upsets the heck out of me you know um\nYou see the amount of illegals that are coming through you see them you know turning themselves in large groups you know ... huge groups that are coming through there and they're coming through Yuma\nThey're coming through 'em or ... or ... grand valley there everywhere you know a chief or Anthony provides Nick ... did say this is a humanitarian crisis that is impacting border security\nWhere the judges were the immigration judges and you know why aren't\nThey at the border we there's a you go to the Tucson sector and there's a sign parking and one of the spots is assigned for the immigration judge right there's no one ever partner oh\nYou can't even find parking at Tucson station but yet the judge has a parking spot and he's never been there which is crazy it just said you know what I mean it's just I don't understand how this thing gets run 'em\nAnd so this is affecting a lot of the agents [noise] I see this too yeah and I'll tell you where where this is where it there's a twist\nYou heard me say there's managers that aren't really leaders and that's just I guess it's everywhere but\nI Need to find out I don't want to drop his name yet until I'm One hundred percent sure it did happen right\nBut we had a leader ... to ... well we had a manager at the at the Tucson station right debt ordered an agent to go to handle a case which you can do that's why I'm not saying that's part of our job right and managers yeah give you cases\n[noise] knowing full well that the case was going to go past his regular hours I think it was like half an hour before the end of the shift right\nWe're twenty four hour operation\nSo he orders is individual to go do it now this individual is kind of work Twenty years in the patrol she she is a fantastic agent right she's done a lot of horse patrol prosecutions you name it she's done it so this manager\nOrders her to go take the case she does it because you know this is what it is there's some history back there behind them to [noise]\nAnd there's certainly history and drink with his manager right [noise] so she's handling the case it's it's it's goes into after her ten hours of work right um there's some agents that are finishing off their own paperwork their time and they tend to cheat and stuff that they're regular redo\nSo this managers upset any any any he's got a couple guys would bull's eyes on him that he wants to attack because there's\nThe guy's power hungry that is what is the guy's a power hungry one of these power hungry managers that you know he he he probably can't run anything you know on his personal life so now he decides to be a bully with agents", "station": "KNST", "city": "Tucson"}
