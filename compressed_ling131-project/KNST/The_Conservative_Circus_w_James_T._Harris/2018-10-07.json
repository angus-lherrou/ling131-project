radio station [noise]\nThe deadliest transportation accident in the U.S in nearly a decade I'm Steve Rapaport Fox News twenty people killed in a crash involving a limo in upstate New York\nHe was worried that the bill would have unintended consequences right\nAs these three for nine would have prohibited the civil arrest of any one in uh California court house\nWhile attending a court proceeding or having legal business in that court\n\nLet that sink in a ... it would have ... prohibited it though right so there's the problem everyday in\nEvery court house in the United states thousands of people are subject to civil arrests for violating all manners of laws in court orders\nHad asked me three for nine been signed into law by governor moonbeams brown\nCalifornia would have shot itself in the foot and hobbled both its court systems and many of its own law enforcement agencies\n'cause just anyway somebody showed up for a court trial and they had a warrant\nThen they wouldn't be arrested right\nOh wow so he so see but the way they pushed it ... the way they wrote it they thought it was just going to affect illegal aliens mhm but no I was going to go as it was going to\nFall on across the board right right and that would have been like disastrous for California\nSo but what's most disturbing is asked me three ... isn't the virtual singing signaling incompetence that led to its veto rather what happened is if the bill hadn't inconvenienced California courts\nAnd Ken of for California law enforcement\nGovernor moonbeams he would have signed that law wow and then you know he would have done so knowing full well that ... you know sanctuary state legislation\nThe bill was both on constitutional\nAn egregious and an egregious violation of the principles of federalism on which the United states was\nBuilt they haven't\nOh because the people currently running California care one way more about illegals access to\nCourts than they do about the safety of the United states of America and the United states citizens that's what it comes down to what we\nWeren't they also looking at something where there was going to be no more bail depending on the area of the kinds of\nStupid stuff there I mean it's just yeah I don't get it and I don't understand where these politicians come up with this it's bothersome um and we were talking about it earlier ... before we were on the air and you were talking so there's a lot of things that people don't understand\nIs that is an issue this being one of them ... years and and I'm cool you know I understand the help other people out in and I get that but do you do help others out\nBy sacrificing your own yeah you know what I mean it it's ... it's like gold or Francis Francis down during Texas little France's maple yeah people call him he's not really but yeah so so Francis O'Rourke um\nHis big push to be a veto veto veto veto veto\nThere you go [laughter] and they came up with that one [laughter] we didn't do veto being so um yeah he wants to push this whole um\nFree access of a college tuition for illegal aliens\nSo realistically even those people that are super far left leaning right than even if you got to sit there and be upset because I Know not everyone can go to school\nI mean it is what it is right I mean you better yourself and you do stuff and there's grants you can apply for and there's ways you can move forward there's\nYou have options right in the end you're going to have to pay back of course because nothing's free but this guy wants to go ahead and give it free to illegal aliens I think anybody would be a little bit of golf college yeah college yeah but ...\nAlso want to go that can't get funding right here that were born here\nOr right it's just I don't\nGet it but here you have here you have you know moon beam and veto veto Francis veto Francis veto and and moon being brown and\nThe Bernie Sanders and my personal favorites the man with this stash that won't go away our very own ... so [noise]\nGrow grow and he was a music [noise]\nAnother town politician\nWho is way more interested in illegal aliens\nAnd possible voter\nBase that they would form in the future rather than the citizens of the of our own country in this case being California hardworking taxpaying everyday citizens of cars I've met some people from Kelly\nIn the Central Park and and they're very very conservative they are not like a lot of\nPeople would think there do you guys need to vote moonbeams out\nRestore some semblance of sanity in California in sunny California so quite some time ago and I don't remember the show we had my love black belt\nJujitsu ninja he was my ... to a structure he moved to Colorado but we also had our very own uh the Tucson pride\nBorder patrol agent ...\nCroissants Rivera yeah now I'm pretty sure at the time we had him here he had just got it in his purple belt so we're going to bring them on\nHe's an agent is important people need to know what's were found what we do and I think it's a fantastic time to be moving in mind is just the rights really fast with ... you're listening to the green light [noise]\nIf it weren't for the union the American public the people who still respect law and order and the people who still respect this nation would have no information basically a court you guys are very alone you have every force in this country mobilized against you for political reasons\nWhen it's about more than words or pictures when I go to the spot where the border patrol agent was murdered where one was was I Believe lord\nTrapped and killed and so I Walk up to pass that I think that that the agent would have taken and then there's this American flags around his his memorial [noise]\nAnd I go up to this large cross all I'm saying is is do you find her and there's the slap of does this piece of laminated paper flapping in the wind that you can't see what it says so I'm I'm looking through this you find her and I looked up at the top of the cross and I go back down and when I straighten out this piece of paper\nIt's a picture of him holding his kids is and I'm Sorry [noise]\nSaid um we love you pop you know and that just right there it was just like\nSo real to me when it's about exposing the truth\nAnd getting the story right\nBreitbart Texas\nTexas federal wellness center founded with a vision based on principles focused on superior healthcare utilizing a combination of physical medicine physical therapy and surgical expertise visit the website at Texas F. W. C. dot com [noise]\nAnd now back to the green [noise]\n... C I F ... can be a little bit better than I brought us\nInto the show yes you didn't like the whole welcome and working in the end of your room it was okay it's ... it's October\nHalloween or how about your show you or I was going for that spooky feel yeah you know I'm\nSo but I promise I told you guys I Would get a guest on I think it's an awesome yes I'm very excited to have him on but I kinda messed up the beginning in ... in the introduction\nBefore the break you never miss I did this time at least that I just I said his last name directly to doubt it um but one of the issues that we've had is obviously I I dropped the ball when was the last names but I didn't do it this time\nWhen I dropped the ball and it is I kind of removed just rank a little bit so we had responses river on the show before and I said it was back when he had his purple belt\nBut we've talked during the break and I stand corrected he had his brown belt already a which is pretty cool um and and ... and ... and I'm Glad to have him on because\nWe we go back on the show and I and I wanted to talk to Chris and\nExplain what he had been going through and what he's he's done so far within Brazilian jujitsu right and Chris\nAnd I knew what you guys you're there's sometimes when you talk about martial artist but I've met a lot of martial artist in my life because I've been involved in different types I've never reached the levels that our guest has reached but I've met a lot of people [noise] and\nNot all of them are humble some of them can be jerks to be honest I'm now they're very high level guys within Brazilian jujitsu then I have ... or the nicest most humble guys you've ever met me how I met some jerks well no\nWhere you have to defend yourself or your family\nAnd it doesn't you don't need to be law enforcement that's what's important right but I Need you to explain these guys the reality of yeah you have done you have weapons\nAnd maybe you won't achieve a black belt maybe you will or maybe it won't but why is it important that you do training or something and why specifically and I know what I'm hearing a lot of you\nBut why specifically the ... or anything else\nWill like um like kind of like kind of a reference we've made to the beginning to to um\nTo the original USC a that's a fight like we like I mentioned earlier or especially whether it's on during the off duty or\nNine times out of ten or in my experience it's going to\nEnd up on the ground so I'm not not just for the fact that like to to learn how to of course it's awesome to stick to stick to it in and learn you know all the all there is to learn the basics but I'm\nOf course you don't use it basically in as far as the law enforcement perspective I'm not going to I'm not going to sit there and want to fight somebody on the ground because I Know I Know uh\nI Know digits of meetings that that ah that defense that I Know to be able to stand up and get back to my feet to\nTo be able to see my surroundings I mean obviously not controlled environment\nYou're like a lot of competition there is not going to be another attack or another assailant it's just you against your own but I'm On the streets for example with you know you're at the movie theater or you're in the field or whatever um you don't know what else is going to be around so um I always tell\n'em people that\nThe reason I Do it um for work or for like in in the scenario that I just talked about is to be able to\nTo know how to for example the skates from no somebody mouse and you fall down and somebody ends up on top of me you know you their basic very basic movements that you can apply to get out of them opposition and be able to eventually get your feet to you know three chicken soup terrier and reach your\nYou know whatever your ass on in the middle seat or whatever you cherry but um that's that's kind of way\nI'm what I'm referring to that does that make sense to what you were asking\nNo it definitely makes sense because I think that's important that people people understand and and I know we talked about it when we weren't when we went on you and you had said\nYou know what you learn in a couple of months down alone can help you make genetically yeah for\nSure I mean just just to name just a sentimental sort of a of a a digits who are are like four to six months I always tell some I always tell people especially beginners that\nI'm forty six months of digits who is it's like night and day is against somebody that doesn't know anything if you moved to the future you stick to it for four to six months and that you as if you find yourself in you know four months back or six months that you would just demolish\nYour your past self and that's kind of a a I mean it's kind of silly to think of it that way but that's kind of ... it really all states and and you know the basics is are are very based it there's\nA very basic movements that you can now that you can do to accomplish a\nOr to be able to stand back get back to your feet and out and the guy who over at um like especially I don't know about other stations but at our station um the guys that are actually doing their going now they're kind of find that stuff um in in our use of force thing\nThe only issue is you know you know the lack of participation in the ... the lack of motivation of of a lot of the agents not just and not just that is that once every quarter is is just not enough to\nBe able to dash something yeah that is why are like that\nYeah you know what I mean it's just not enough time to to one hour or whatever it is that they showed the technique that those guys are showing a lotta times are are effective in and very basic but um if you're on the drilling that for thirty minutes or whatever they do sometimes is classes are like Fifteen twenty\nTwenty people you know that they use force classes and that's just too many people for help to be able to drill it and then like I like I said the lack of motivation sometimes\nAnd uh it's it's it's not enough ah so I always talk about um how you should at least do something what what anything or like you said like you did karate or whatever or um\nEven like just go and do some cross that or or whatever you know what I mean just act as to where you're not going to be um you're not going to put yourself in a situation where you can't even get your feet NATO\nWas that was that your little shout out to our good friend Ryan is that what you said CrossFit\n[laughter] yeah [laughter] yeah what do they hide [laughter] I won't make you laugh that really got out of it right yeah I Love ... uh but yeah it\nIs it's funny you mentioned that when a but no you're right and and I think that's always been my gripe I guess you would say people used to say oh well aren't you know he's bringing the union thing issues complaining about how how the how the um use of force is going but that was my gripe that you got guys that are not really in shape\nOr not that I'm saying that they're out of shape but you know what I mean not I guess they're they're physically not trained or prepared for some of the moves that they may be shown in the use of force when it comes to like the ... the defense most\nThat's one of those things so you go full force at one time and you can get hurt because you don't have the technique\nDown and and then in the end\nYou're only doing it like once a quarter for Fifteen twenty minutes you're not really going to it's not going to help you what's going to hurt you more than they help you that's why it's important to go find someone and actually do the training\nAnd I think a lot of the times we hear cruise a lotta times is obviously the money issue people say oh well it's kind of expensive I'm not sure well I mean I think your life is is ... ... it is worth more than what you're gonna spend\nYeah that's for sure that's that's definitely true I mean I'm not a thing that we're talking about teaching classes I can show it has nothing to do with uh the the use of force training that we that the guy do on a quarterly basis I teach a class over at\n... at the station now I'm a condition for combat as instructor also so I teach a class\nSo we actually have um three days a week Monday Wednesday friday but I teach out of the room the friday class and those are also available to to uh um agents are and it's part of the the what is it called the ... or whatever\nThe workout rancor workout program and you do it over\nAnd those are free you know that doesn't cost anything um and and it's it's it's you know conditioning for combative than we do some you know some striking some round stuff and I'm\nSo there's there's several people several regulars that we have that that take advantage of that but I Wish there was always I always wish there was more\nBut that's what I like to know what what what David have you guys are doing it Chris\nA Monday or Monday Wednesday Fridays on Mondays is a one or the other condition for combat as instructor I'm using the ... got to he does really good at a a boxing drills he's a he's more boxing oriented right but he does a lot of a lot of drills or um\nOr with a with a boxing base so those are really good in the classes are only an hour long a seven to eight um and then Wednesday's my in my class and he's uh Wednesdays is more like um the way I Do my class I kind of try to mix it up and do a little bit around a little bit of standing\nAt the end they do a little circuit I'm trying to simulate a like a a Fifteen minute fight mhm ah three three five rounds at the end and you start\nLittle circle you know like maybe like some some bag work some you know some ground and pounding the dummy some battle ropes and you know little things like that to just get to get the blood flow in a lot of people that I Know I'm always throwing but I'm always invite you write for class and and um and you know I I like\nI even tell them if you want to just come watch you know for five minutes at the end like state can see him and it's just the people from out you know from all all um experience levels you don't have to have you know like you have to do a lot of drinking it's actually better when you when you're not experience because\nI like I tell these guys a lot of the guys and gals I'm\nIt's better to\nNot have any experience for us because you don't develop any bad habits kind of right being um arranging my when when you have all these by British out all these different guns but I'm so they develop bad habits from other weapons or just bad habits from shooting and all it's the same thing with um with this you know we\nAre and then I tell people you you just go at your own pace you actually need to take a break of eating just stop stop and nobody's going to yell at you know ready nobody's pressuring just want you to get your heart rate going in\nAnd develop a little bit of technique nighttime there incorporate a playground stuff on Fridays class it's a it's ... it's really kind of morphed into a or did you get to craft I've been doing it since two thousand twelve and and um\nThe friday classes all did you do with the games with the ... it's not you know it's not mandatory but\nThat's what we we mostly where I'm On a friday class so that one was pretty cool because we get we actually get a lot of a high level guys that come in and and I trained with us there's a there's a guy out of a sudden we have another canine hardly who's a very a", "station": "KNST", "city": "Tucson"}
