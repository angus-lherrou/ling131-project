{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KNST", "content": "Unbeknownst to use then right next ... in the room next door you have no clue so again no what your children are looking at on the Internet you know what their ... to talk to on social media I think it's very important early interventions everything\nIt absolutely is and you can't encourage parents and family members and guardians enough to contact authorities if they see something that they believe in suspicious if there is anything concerning in what they notice with their children's social media accounts it's important to let someone now\nYou know again a a repeat this is if you think there's something inappropriate or even possibly illegal let us know let us take a look at it I mean law enforcement there that's what we do will come in will look at it\nUh we'll talk to your your loved one your your children unless determine if there's something there that we things or just give some advice to the child will spend a few minutes that's what we do we're we're public servants for a reason\nYou know the other thing I Want to hit on his what's going on on the borders was grown our southern borders I I Know in ... county uh thanks to my border team are collaborative efforts with them or do you see his staff and our federal partners we've done some amazing thing to stop the drugs low\nBut what hasn't stopped flowing is the the human smuggling like we're talking about today here uh so far this year we've got a hundred and forty thousand family units so far across the border in United States is you're on top of that another hundred thousand on occupied children\nThat are um now being addressed by our federal government and I'll just be honest with you and this is not a cold day or night on this and a sheriff's\nUh from the national sheriffs association are way down to share ... county myself sheriff Napier and others years on the southern border we're being tasked with this and we're looking for answers because\nThe federal government has tapped out when I mean by tapped out of the fact that as their resources are over extended when it comes to this um they have thirty five thousand ankle bracelets left\nA which is not going to be enough so what do they do or what their what their plan is greyhound buses which is another one that has tapped out because of all the ah family ... family use are coming to our southern border and their take him to their final destination so\nI don't know what the answer is concerned for sheriff's obviously is we got to be a form 'cause we represent communities and in the mix of all this are vulnerable people vulnerable people\nThat's absolutely true and these are the numbers that we know about and the ones that law enforcement or actually intervene on think of the numbers that to get through that we don't know about and those are the ones that are in the really vulnerable populations women and children who come across the borders with a group of others\nAnd once they're here not being in the country and not having the ability to go to law enforcement perhaps if someone is putting them in a situation of being violated in sexual ways or\nOtherwise um they really are vulnerable to becoming victims of crimes and not in a position of having anywhere to go to report it or at least that's the way they feel about it\nAnd you're up you're right we hear that a lot too and uh and and and ... we look at consequences in your office will be consequences for those or break the law there there's a unique situation here with those coming across and um is right now there's over forty five thousand in custody of which is\nOver what they are even allocated so it's it's a huge\nStress pressure onto our federal government and the current system in these immediate attention there's no doubt about it needs to be the attention because in the mix of all this is going to be victims are going to be in your office and I'm going to be at our offices or as we invest it is and these these cases of prosecutions sound easy but\nThey're not as a lot of challenges these prosecutions you talk a little bit about that\nAre challenges and it's because of the vulnerable populations that we deal at a large part of the time you have people who are forced into situations and doing really unspeakable things\nAnd things that they don't want to talk about in order for us to prosecute someone and hold them accountable for this kind of thing you need to have a victim who is going to talk about it and not just come forward and tell law enforcement what's been happening to them\nThat someone who's going to stay involved throughout a prosecution and as I'm sure you know that's not something that takes a month or two that something that takes several months and sometimes a year or more\nAnd to have someone go through that process we're very fortunate in our office and I'm other offices around the state I Know have victim services divisions as well\nThat we have advocates in our office who are dedicated to understanding the needs of sex trafficking victims and to be able to serve that particular part of our population\nSo that we can hope to keep them engaged in services and provide them with the assistance they need to be able to get out of this kind of life\nWell it it's tough because you have a a population that\nHere's government a lot of ways they fear the ability to come forward of\nSome other things some other consequences possibly being deported we've heard that and uh and and I'm all about making sure the laws of war to the fullest when it comes to\nYou know following the pluses legally\nBut I also understand the reality of is you know victims of the victim doesn't matter where they're from we need to make sure we take care of our victims and that those perks that cause the harm to our victims are held accountable but it is a challenge is Ruth challenge when it comes to those to come forward that really want help from law enforcement\nAnd then again these cases don't last overnight to being ticket you pay a fine you move on this these are very complicated cases that are mostly drawn\nThey absolutely are and I think again when you look at what can the community do to try to help 'em victims that are in these situations so many of them don't want to come forward so many of them don't want to trust law enforcement\nUh to begin with and it makes it difficult for us to identify those but there are people in our communities every day who noticed something happening maybe down the street from them\nA inordinate number as cars are traffic or males or see girls are juveniles a young people that are in a certain area and they noticed that traffic perhaps day after day and maybe into we hours in the morning or night and\nThose are things that they can again Paul and report to law enforcement if you see something that you believe\nCould be consistent with sex trafficking or\nWhat you may identify as some sort of prostitution activity it's information you can report to law enforcement and let them investigate give them an opportunity to be able to see what's actually going on it's important to get our communities and fall so we can identify these people who are being victimized in this way\nI a hundred percent agree on that and please I encourage you as a share of and speaking of sheriffs throughout the United states\nCallers call your local law enforcement we're here to help and that's what the bottom line is we're not here to play politics\nNot here to use me where we're here to find that solution for you and in ... and\nReduce and get rid of the harm that's been brought to you so I encourage you that and we have a victim services and throughout the United states most counties have that I Know Pima County you have that he told the last few minutes or what your victim services tales\nOur victim services has trained advocates who not only respond and nine one one type emergencies they respond to virtually all violent crimes hearing Pima County anything having to do with domestic violence and they provide the\nInitial support after someone has suffered some sort of trauma and the sex trafficking area we have someone specifically trained to identify the needs of sex trafficking victims and to be able to\nTalk with them and work with them to make sure that they are matched up with the services that are most needed in that particular moment for massive people and at least trafficking situations it's certainly going to be just finding a place to live\nAnd finding a shelter that's going to be available to them and again our community partners in NGOs that we have here within Pima County\nUm there are some that to a really great job that providing those services are advocates then continue to work with these victims throughout the court process so they can be with them from the very beginning of when the trauma was induced throughout any kind of trial\nWell was great to see that I Know it's\nWhat's what a tray she's talking about is reciprocate in many many counties throughout the United states and cities and and the courage to come forward and you know just a real quick notice them into our last few seconds here is about six thousand dollars are tells charging to bring up a humid across the border\nJust think about that and they can't pay their indebted and to use these criminal cartels so please say something\nYou see some it's not right it probably isn't give us a call list check on there was no fall for calm law enforcement and uh so ... you can tell you a very passionate about what you do not talking to you before the show so thank you so much for coming on the show today and for all your ... barber law for what they do here in the county and\nBeyond and thanks for having us on here again everybody have a safe weekend and please\nDon't mortgage companies have equal housing lender and I'm a less three to seven for jury Harrison animal last Wednesday will succeed find one age is license to do business in the state of Arizona and California\nBecame number one oh six eight five one age ... for seven five nine licensed by the department of business oversight onto the California residential mortgage lending act on information loan programs and the interest rates are subject to change without notice on subject underwriting approval terms and conditions applied\nRegion will studio your local and regional dotcom fantasy [laughter] Hi art radio station\nFox News alert on Rogers stir and its official Brett Kavanaugh will be the next justice on the Supreme Court the Senate confirming him just one hour go by those slim most of margins\nOn this vote the eyes or fifty the news or forty eight the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh of Maryland to be an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United states is confirmed\nWe use that word and we use another word right\nTo kiss the rear ended up really going to change\n[laughter] right [laughter] anything that they want he will give them\nHe was worried that the bill would have unintended consequences right eh speeds three for nine would have prohibited the civil arrest of anyone\nIn uh California court house while attending a court proceeding or having legal business in that court\n\nLet that sink in a ... it would have ... prohibited it though right so there's the problem every day\nIn every court house in the United states thousands of people are subject to civil\nArrest for violating all manners of laws in court orders\nHad asked these three for nine been signed into law by governor moonbeams brown California would have shot itself in the foot and hobbled both its court systems and many of its own law enforcement agencies\n'cause just anyway somebody showed up for a court trial and they had a warrant then they wouldn't be arrested right oh wow\nSo he so see but the way they push the ... the way they wrote it they thought it was just going to affect illegal aliens mhm but no I was going to go as it was going to\nFall across the board right right and that would have been like disastrous for California\nSo but what's most disturbing is asked me three ... isn't the virtual ... signaling incompetence that led to its veto rather what happened is if the bill hadn't inconvenienced California courts and Ken of for California law enforcement\nGovernor moonbeams he would have signed that law wow and then you know he would have done so knowingly full well that ... you know a sanctuary state legislation the bill was both on constitutional\nAn egregious in an egregious violation of the principles of federalism on which the United states was built\n\nThe habits oh because the people currently running California chair way more about illegals access to courts than they do about the safety of the United states of America and the United states citizen that's what it comes down to what we\nWeren't they also looking at something where there was going to be no more bail depending on the area of the kinds of\nStupid stuff there I mean it's just yeah I don't get it and I don't understand where these politicians come up with this it bothers some um [noise] and we were talking about it earlier ... before we were on the air and you were talking so there's a lot of things that the people don't understand\nIs that is an issue this being one of them ... years and and I'm cool you know I understand that help other people out and and I get that but do you do help others out\nBy sacrificing your own yeah you know what I mean it it's ... it's like gold or Francis Francis down during Texas\nLittle France's maple yeah people call them but he's not really but yeah so so Francis O'Rourke um his big push to be a veto veto veto\nVeto veto there you go [laughter] and it came up with that one [laughter] we didn't do veto being so um yeah he wants to push this whole um\nFree or access of a college tuition of for illegal aliens\nSo realistically even those people that are super far left leaning right than even even though you gotta sit there and be upset\nBecause I Know not everyone can go to school I mean it is what it is right I mean you better yourself and you do stuff and there's grants you can apply for and there's ways you can move forward there's you have options right\nWhen the end you're gonna have to pay in back of course because nothing is free\nBut this guy wants to go ahead and give it free to illegal aliens I think anybody would be a little\nBit of going to college yeah college yeah it's it's absurd that want to go that can't get funding right here that were born here\nOr right it's just I don't get it but here you help here you have you know ... veto veto Francis veto Francis veto and and moonbeams brown and the Bernie Sanders and my personal favorites\nThe man with the stash that won't go away\nOur very own ... also [noise]\nGrow grow and he was a music [noise]\nAnother town politician\nWho is way more interested in illegal aliens\nAnd possible voter base\nThat they would form in the future rather than the citizens of the of our own country in this case being California hardworking taxpaying everyday citizens okay cause I've met some people from Kelly\nIn the Central Park and and they're very very conservative they are not like a lot of people would think there\nYou guys need to vote moonbeams out\nRestore some a semblance of sanity in California in sunny California so quite some time ago and I don't remember the show we had my love that's black belt\nJujitsu ninja he was my ... instructor he moved to Colorado but we also had our very own uh the Tucson pride\nBorder patrol agent ...\nResponses river you\nKnow I'm pretty sure at the time we had him here he had just gotten his purple belt so we're gonna bring them on\nHe's an agent is important people need to know what we're about what we do [noise] and I think it's a fantastic time to be able to come on it's just the rights really fast with response was the man I listening to the green light [noise]\nIf it weren't for the union the American public the people who still respect law and order and the people who still respect this nation would have no information basically a court you guys are very alone you have every force in this country mobilized against you for political reasons\nWhen it's about more than words or pictures when I go to the spot where the border patrol agent was murdered where one was was I Believe lord trapped and killed and so I Walk up to pass that I think that that the agent would have taken and then there's this American flags around his his memorial [noise]\nAnd I go up to this large cross all I'm saying is is do you find her and there's the slap of there's this piece of laminated paper flapping in the wind that you can't see what it says so I'm I'm looking through this you find her and I I look up at the top of the cross and I go back down and when I straighten out this piece of paper\nIt's a picture of him holding his kids is and I'm Sorry [noise]\nIt said um we love you pop you know and that just right there it was just like so real to me when it's about exposing the truth\nAnd getting the story right\nBreitbart Texas\nTexas federal wellness center founded with a vision based on principles focused on superior healthcare utilizing a combination of physical medicine physical therapy and surgical expert team visit the website at Texas F. W. U. C. dot com [noise]\nAnd now back to the green [noise]\nWe're fact rather ... C I F ... a little bit fatter than I brought us\nInto the show yes you didn't like the whole welcoming to walk out of your bedroom and it was okay it's ... it's October\nHalloween or how about your show you or I was going for that spooky feel yeah you know\nI'm so but as promised I told you guys I Would get a guest on I think it's an awesome yes I'm very excited to have him on\nBut I kind of messed up the beginning in ... in the introduction before the break you never miss I did this time at least at least they said his last name directly to doubt it um\nBut one of the issues that we've had is obviously I I dropped the ball when was the last names but I didn't do it this time\nWhen I dropped the ball and it is I kind of removed his rank a little bit so we had responses river on the show before and I said it was back when he had his purple belt\nBut we've talked during the break and I stand corrected he had his brown belt already ah which is pretty cool um and and ... and ... and I'm Glad I have him on because\nWe we go back on the show and I and I wanted to talk to\nChris and explain what he had been going through and what he's he's done so far within Brazilian jujitsu right and Chris\nAnd I knew what you guys you're this sometimes when you talk about martial artist but I've met a lot of martial artist in my life because I've been involved in different types I've never reached\nThe levels that our guest has reached but I've met a lot of people and not all of them are humble some of them can be ... to be honest\nAnd you know moment may arise\nWhere you have to defend yourself or your family\nAnd it doesn't you don't need to be law enforcement that's what's important right but I Need you to explain these guys the reality of yeah you have done you have weapons\nAnd maybe you won't achieve a black belt maybe you will for baby won't but why is it important that you do trained in something and why specifically and I know what I'm hearing a lot of you\nBut why specifically the ... or anything else\nWill like um like kind of like kind of a reference remained at the beginning\nTo to um to the original USC a that's a fight like we like I mentioned earlier a especially whether it's on during the off duty or\nNine times out of ten or in my experience it's gonna\nEnd up on the ground so I'm not not just for the fact that like to to learn a lot of course it's awesome to stick to stick to it and and learn you know all the all there is to learn the basics but I'm of course\nYou don't want it by use it basically and as far as the law enforcement perspective I'm not going to I'm not going to sit there and want to fight somebody on the ground because I Know I Know uh\nI Know digits a meetings that\nThat ah that defense that I Know to be able to stand up and get back to my feet to\nTo be able to see my surroundings I mean obviously not controlled environment you're like a lot of competition there is not going to be another attack or another assailant it's just you against your own but I'm On the streets for example at the you know you're at the movie theater and you're in the field or whatever um you don't know what else is going to be around so\nUm I always tell are people that the reason I Do it um in in the scenario is that I just talked about is to be able to\nTo know how to for example the skates from me five fall down and somebody ends up on top of me you know you their basic very basic movements that you can apply to get out of them out there shouldn't be able to eventually get your feet to\nYou know three chickens you're carrying are rich or you know whatever you're asked on in the middle seat or whatever you carry but um that's that's kind of way I'm what I'm referring to that does that make sense to what you were asking\nNo it definitely makes sense because I think that's important that people people understand and I know we talked about it when we weren't when we went on you and you had said\nYou know what you learned a couple of months down alone can help you make genetically yeah for\nSure I mean just just to name just a sauna models of a of a a digits who are are like four to six months I always tell some I always tell people especially beginners that I'm forty six months of digits\nWho is like night and day if against somebody that doesn't mind just as you move to the future you stick to it for four to six months and that you as\nIf you find yourself in you know four months back or six months that you would just demolish\nYour your past self and that's kind of a a I mean it's kind of silly\nTo think of it that way but that's kind of ... it really all states\nAnd and you know the basics is are are very basic there's a very basic movements that you can now that you can do to accomplish a\nUh to be able to stand back get back to your seat and apps and the ... over at um like especially I don't know about other stations but at our station um the guys that are actually doing their going now they're kind of blind that stuff um in in our ah use of force thing\nThe only issue is you know you know the lack of participation in the ... the lack of motivation of of a lot of the agents not just and not just that is that once every quarter is is just not enough\nTo be able to dash something yeah that is why are like that\nYeah you know what I mean it's just not enough time to to one hour or whatever it is that they showed the technique that those guys are showing a lotta times are are effective in and very basic but um if you're on the drilling that for thirty minutes or whatever they do sometimes is classes are like Fifteen twenty\nTwenty people know that they use force classes and that's just too many people for how to be able to drill it and then like I like I said the lack of motivation sometimes\nAnd uh it's it's it's not enough uh so I always talk about um how you should at least do something what what anything out like you said like you did karate or whatever or um\nEven like just go and do some cross that or or whatever you know what I mean just act as to where you're not going to be um you're not going to put yourself in a situation where you can't\nEven get your feet NATO\nWas that was that your little shout out to our good friend Ryan is that what you said cross ...\n[laughter] yeah [laughter] yeah what do they hide [laughter] I won't make that amount that we already got out of All right yeah I Love ... uh but yeah it is it's\nFunny you mentioned that when a but no you're right and and I think that's always been my gripe I guess you would say people used to say oh well aren't you know he's bringing the union thing issues complaining about how how the how the um use of force is going but that was my gripe that you got guys that are not really in shape\nOr not that I'm saying that they're out of shape but you know what I mean not I guess they're they're physically not trained or prepared for some of the moves that they may be shown in the use of force when it comes to like the the the defense moves\nThat's one of those things so you go full force at one time and you can get hurt because you don't have the technique down\nAnd and then in the end\nYou're only doing it like once a quarter for Fifteen twenty minutes you're not really going to it's not going to help you what's going to hurt you more than they help you that's why it's important to go find someone and actually do the training\nAnd I think a lot of the times we hear criticized a lot of times is obviously the money issue people say oh well it's kind of expensive I'm not sure well I mean I think your life is is ... ... it is worth more than what you're going to spend\nYeah that's for sure that that's definitely true I mean I'm not a thing a we're talking about teaching classes I can show it has nothing to do with the the use of force training that we that the guys do on a quarterly basis I teach a class over at\nAt at the station now I'm a condition for combat as instructor also\nSo I teach a class that we actually have um three days a week when they when they friday but I teach a weren't we friday class\nAnd those are also available to to uh\nUm agents are and it's part of it or was it called the ... or whatever\nRight workout rancor workout program and you do ...\nAnd those are free you know that doesn't cost anything\nUm and and it's it's it's you know conditioning for combative than we do some you know some striking some round stuff and I'm so there's there's several people several rigors that we have that that take advantage of that but I Wish there was always I always wish there was more\nBut that's what I was to know what what what they have you guys are doing it Chris\nA Monday or Monday Wednesday Fridays on Mondays is a one or the other\nCondition for combat as instructor I'm using the ... got to he does really good or a boxing drills he's a he's more boxing oriented right but he does a lot of a lot of drills I'm\nA with a with a boxing base so those are really good or not the classes are only an hour long about seven to eight um and then Wednesday's mine are in my class and he's uh\nWednesdays is more like um the way I Do my class I kind of try to mix it up and do robots around a little bit of standing at the end they do a little circuit I'm trying to simulate a like a Fifteen minute fight\nMhm ah three three five men around at the end and you start real sort of the you know like maybe like some\nSome bag work some you know some ground and found him a dummy some battle ropes them you know little things like that to just get to get the blood flow in a lot of people that I Know I'm always throwing ride my bike right for the class and and um and\nYou know I I like I even tell them if you want to just come watch you know for five minutes at the end like state can see him\nAnd it's just the people from out you know from all all um experience level as you don't have to have you know like you have to go out drinking it's actually better when you when you're not experience because I like I tell these guys a lot of the guys and gals I'm\nIt's better to\nNot have any experience for us because you don't develop any bad habits kind of right being on the arranging my when when you have all these guys that are shut all these different guns but I'm so they develop bad habits from other weapons or just bad habits from shooting at all it's the same thing with um with this you know we\nAre and then I tell people you you you just go at your own pace you actually need to take a break of eating just stop stop and nobody's going to yell at you nobody nobody's pressuring agree just want you to get your heart rate going in\nAnd develop a little bit of technique nighttime I incorporate a ground stuff on Fridays class it's a it's ... it's really kind of morphed into a or did you get to class I've been doing it since two thousand twelve and and um", "year":
