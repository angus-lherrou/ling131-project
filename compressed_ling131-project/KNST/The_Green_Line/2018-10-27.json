people you put away Knoxville\nUm I could tell you a couple of the cases that\nWere a high profile and then some maybe not\nSo high profile but that isn't humor involved roast born a what's an operation in East Tennessee we had a sheriff's department was providing protection a\nFor ... other gambling prostitution a liquor running and that department was not only\nProviding protection they're also participate uh so I had a\nOne of the agents company as a senior agent and said you know want to do this and one investigate this was going to take time I got to have your support said OK laid out so we initiated it was a long term investigation\nUm we pretty much dismantled the sheriff's department are used in a number of undercover agents funding undercover agents that know about cock fighting um interesting process so\nWe took that down and there's still some repercussions years later I'm another case we worked with Memphis division call Tennessee walls we uh Tennessee had the the best legislature money could buy they were taking bribes uh taken\nRunning computer scams like Chicago pretty much very much so we teamed up with a Memphis division because they have their legislators and we had ours and we start taking them down or the or\nOne of the U.S attorneys at the time was in the Republican Party and he was uncomfortable or so he recused himself because he didn't want to be seen as\nA attacking Democrats are so that had its own legal a loop ramifications we had a a an incident where we had a\nTwo young men want her to start your own of white supremacy group\nSo they recruited another guy and they were talking and they planned on running operation where they would or Rob a bank and then when the cop show up getting a gun fight until the cops and then take the money will the guy they recruited came to\nUs and said you know what I'm good with taking other people's money but I'm not hanging around the shooting eat any cops is that what do you want me to do so we wired him up a gossip conversations at\nWhich in [noise] excuse me um [noise] and we we took this guy's car and where it up as well because they were going to use his car and\nWhen it comes time to go in and robbed the bank they're going to go into a church parking lot\nDress up get your weapons out of the trunk drive and take over the bank will we set up that we knew which banks are going to hit so we had our people inside that bank we under surveillance going on them that day we had our uh FBI air force in their own shots\nAnd what happened was they change plans in the middle of things\nSo they went to a different parking lot and the second one was going to be by our informant if they had the guns on them his hat is bowling camp was going to be building front Bill Bill the ball camp would cover his eyes if they had the guns in the trunk he was going to have the hat on backwards\nAnd so we had our SWAT Team ready ... anytime swat teams use recalled out the head of the office or the assistant special agent in charge has to be on ...\nThat's that's the responsibility it's accountability and uh it it works well but I was on the seat and I have preached to preach and preach to all my agents use your body armor you get it for free where so\nWhat happened was\nWe decided to take these guys down before they make it to the bank because we don't know there's going to be another change their plans or what so as soon as I pulled in the parking lot of the church another church\nWe are surrounded him drove in\nArrested him we're all looking at our informant you had these hat on backwards which meant the guns and the Trump would also installed a kill switch on the engine of his car so that once they got they couldn't get ... they couldn't couldn't go anywhere well that didn't work because we tried to tried to kill switch in the car starts right up\nBut one of the things that happened was I got in there and I left my body armor in my bureau coroner jumping the surveillance car so I'm near with a\nMachine gun and no body armor so at the scene everybody else has body armor and I have a Buick [laughter] I'm hiding behind [laughter] we'll we'll of a\nBureau Buick a and I had to make numerous apologies\nYou're eating crowd [laughter] I Am but you got the bad guys we got the bad guys and what happened to the informant\nUh he ... he was a cooperating witness so ah he didn't want to charge we arrested him to make it look like right you know attack them correct um another\nTale as there was a a bank robbery in South Carolina and we got a tip a call from a guy that said I Know who did the bank robbery it so and so in this world lives will Knoxville division covers to time zones\nAnd this was in the central time zone so\nHow'd the SWAT Team surround this guy's he had a double wide trailer on the side of a mountain\nAnd he was a white supremacist he was rumored to have machine guns in his house this was election day so his kids were home two daughters because the schools were used as a polling place and\nWe didn't know what we really had on the inside but the a SWAT Team I've been there all night it was pouring rain cold mountain range and are willing to go shading and he finally hung up wouldn't negotiate with the negotiators so I said you tell a\nTell this guy that he's got one minute to come out with his hands up or I'm

went ... country by force and you're waving the flag of the country that you're supposedly lean\nIt's not migration is definitely an ...\nI have nine hundred and eleven shares so far and that post over fifty eight thousand people we've reached with that post which is I think it's pretty good well\nI don't understand why isn't the government of Mexico doing more [noise] and how can I say this about getting a\nI think a lot of people you want to understand that because I don't I don't have to tell you where\nThe Mexican law enforcement officers get paid miserable yeah they get peddling peddling famous\nSo the way they survive is through bribes ... that's just the reality we've all heard it you know they they survived through bribes I grew up on the southern border I'm I'm guilty of myself of going down to Mexico when I was younger and at times running a stop sign\nAnd giving the cop there twenty bucks and even he left me alone you know it's just that it's accepted over there\nAnd when you have these many individuals coming through it's an opportunity for a lot of these law enforcement officials to line their pockets\nBecause they know these people are carrying something repairing some kind of money or they connect themselves with some cartel and uh that cartel itself pays their monthly fees to the Mexican ops and mix it with a federalism Mexican\nOfficials and he goes on and off so that's why they don't have any\nReal big push to try to stop because they're making money off and in the end there also realizing that these guys aren't going to stay in Mexico anyway they're just passing through on their way to invade the United states of America\nNow I've heard what's what are we supposed to do how can we do it oh it's too late blah blah blah you

a bank which with foundation's being run by retired chiefs that didn't do as a border patrol agents that would that work anywhere any favors when they weren't chiefs and now all of a sudden they're holier than thou\nAnd then what you do is you do real sanctions on those countries and by real sanctions I mean you close the embassies ... those the embassy in Guatemala El Salvador\nStopped giving their cows let their politicians are governors and everyone else in their family stop giving them these stop stamping their visas to come to the United states and shop\nAnd I know it it sounds weird because additionally it may be a hit on on our economy right because you see all the but it won't be to that level right they'll get the picture and they'll start enforcing their immigration\nAnd at the same time I think some of these invaders will relies instead of invading my country where everything is hunky dory [laughter] right\nThey'll they'll they'll do rise up and put at least half that amount of effort\nTo get rid of their dictatorship rained get rid of their horrible gr because they're not coming with the intention is to assimilate they're not coming with the intention is to become
