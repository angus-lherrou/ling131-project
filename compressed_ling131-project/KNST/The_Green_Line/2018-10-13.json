{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KNST", "content": "Excellent book I don't get a I don't get any endorsement money for those folks but uh it's an excellent book um it's a very long about a thousand pages so it's going to take me probably four months to read it the rate I go but\nUm people don't know they really need to explore history um a lot of things in history give me hope and and us ground is one of those things um\nHe was a ... odd it often in his life he was at the bottom I mean he was a failure in many many ways is failure in business I was drummed out of the service because of alcoholism or the alleged alcoholism\nUm he had a very mediocre presidency after ... rising as high as you could go in the union army or to really be in the hero of the civil war a to then I'm a failed presidency in in in impoverished his family\nPeople do not know that um he was um shortly after ... are not being president anymore he was diagnosed with cancer\nAnd was terminal and somebody approached him about writing his memoirs and we're going to pay him of the very sizable sum of money to ride his memoirs so as grant is literally dying from cancer he is dictating his memoirs\nAnd I'm very shortly after he dictated the very last party he died but it was very important to him that his family did not die impoverished\nAnd that's how he provided for it so if you get a chance to read grass memoirs excellent read very much a will to get your heartstrings um Lincoln is another one of those figures in history that um\nIs a really outstanding um another book I really highly recommend this team of rivals by Doris Kearns Goodwin a excellent book a talks about the rise of Lincoln in the Republican Party and um another one that's excellent is April Eighteenth sixty five talks about the month of\nApril and Eighteen sixty five the end of the civil war a assassination of President Lincoln um and that this country could have spawn into a civil war that you know guerrilla war that would've lasted forever\nAnd it's really the work of grant a Lee and Sherman that prevented that because there was this big vacuum of leadership in the country after the assassination of Lincoln and\nThese people that were I mean absolute warriors\nAre shut down and they really prevented a that degenerating into a guerilla warfare that would've lasted\nWho knows how long um but it's a very good reading I think that I'm a country that does not understand it's histories is doomed to repeat it um and I think we really need to look him my personal love is from Eighteen fifty five to Nineteen fifty five\nAh just part of the civil war the birth of the Republican Party um to the end of the Korean War\nAnd that hundred year period or the United states of America changed very very significant way and ah I encourage people to study their history and and look at politicians not from what you heard on CNN or Fox News or whatever but to actually uh study this stuff in and to know your history\n... did you read the book that a McCain road before he passed\nI'm not I don't tend to re contemporary history I really stop about Nineteen fifty five ... I'm a red Reagan's biographies probably the closest I've come\nI'm I Will say the bill O'Reilly Books and I know he probably didn't write most of it but the killing series is pretty good ah killing Reagan is a pretty good book a killing pat and\nA killing Kennedy um he's not really very generous in his book about Reagan or he's not very generous and his uh viewer you'd think he would be a but he's really not uh that's that's an excellent book\nUm that's one of things I Want to do when I retire is I Want to have more time to read and I know it seems silly but I enjoy I enjoy reading there is a civil war series by Shelby Foote as three volume series it's a well more than a thousand pages\nOr but I'd really like to be able to Wade through that because it's excellent ah excellent book I'm kind of a weird share of 'em [laughter] I'm a Republican with a very progressive education and that makes me I'm a enough in the center to make a lot of people mad at me 'cause I get hit in the right cheek and the left cheek all the time and that must mean I'm doing something that's okay I guess\nWell like you said right is right and health lay right will prevail I know there's a lot of uh books written lately [laughter] um the\nCurrent administration you intend to read any of that is no I think that history a tense to settle itself um\nWhat we think of being history today or or somebody's opinion today\nThat as time spins out um will change a little bit as we better understand what the times are I think we understand I'm John F. Kennedy better now than we did in Nineteen Seventy here um that we understand more about Martin Luther king than we might have a right after his his death\nSo I think that we need time to settle these things a little bit and to have a more clear all clear retrospect 'cause it's clouded right now by a lot of emotion and a lot of\nA discussion back and forth um it's really unclear um you know if if President Trump runs another term and he ends up being a two term president\nHow ... history will really treat this time it's unclear as it's currently unclear on how Brock Obama's presidency will be treated I just don't think enough time we need time to settle that and to then go back in a very rational way and look at what was really accomplish or what was it\nHow do you feel about Nixon\nNixon would have been an excellent president had he not had um moral failures um and I would almost say the same thing about Bill Clinton\nA Bill Clinton was an out Republicans you're about to crash or vehicles out there I Know that a Clinton was actually a pretty adept president but he had some moral failings\nI'm President Nixon was actually pretty effective but he had these psychological failings um they've caused his presidency to not be as as good as it otherwise could have been\nHis are really intelligent man\nHe did a lot of the you know to eat we were out of Vietnam he did a establish relationship with the Chinese there were a lot of things have happened under the Nixon administration that were actually fairly good and he was a very intelligent man\nI'm you know people think that ah John F. Kennedy was so popular well in the time of his presidency was not that popular\nOh I think we look back on Lyndon Johnson and say there's some pretty good things by the way the movie um LBJ that um that Woody Harrelson plays LBJ in that movie I thought he could never pull that off\nBut he did and it's historically accurate um that's one thing I think that really bugs me is when I look at history movies a lot of them are so historically inaccurate it makes me ... the the movie on Lincoln where they go to Tommy Lee Jones and Sally field's plays a ... a his wife I\nWas awful from a historical perspective it was absolute garbage\nIt just it I could I had to walk out of the room I was getting so angry 'cause it was just it was just not historically accurate at all um but I think time these settled those things so I think maybe in Twenty years or will be able to look back on Trump's presidency in Obama's and it'd be more rational about it than we will be able to do today\nYeah I think that um people during the Nixon administration and the way things are happening and my dad always said you know step outside of that that's all you're in it what's going on you have a better perspective\nAnd I think time is required for that a little bit too I think that\nYou know you need to get a little separation of time and then reflect back on a more calmly I'm Bill Clinton did a lot of very decent things as president ah but his moral failures overshadowed a lot of those things\nThere was a lot of bipartisanship under the Clinton Administration um Reagan did a better job of that but now we become very very divided again\nAnd I think we need to kind of get back to a little bit of the middle ground and for those elected officials out there remember why we put you in office\nThat we put you in office to get things done to move our country forward not to see what you could obstruct are are getting away ah we want you to move our country forward that's why we put you they're not so you could get a pension not so you could run around saying your senator or congressman such and such\nWe put you there to get stuff done and I think a lot of these people on all sides a lot of blame to go around here are letting us down\nOkay I think we've only got about a minute left but I wanted to touch base on really quick about some of the scams that are going on your office get calls I Know all the time what is the latest and greatest don't do it scam\nThe latest and greatest is really simple if it if it looks too good to be true it is um you're not gonna get unsolicited emails from the IRS or your bank asking you for personal information\nUm and a lot of these are exceptionally convincing my wife took a call from Microsoft and I walked through the house that I just got home she goes oh Microsoft is on here there's something wrong with our computer they\nWant access to it and she had bought it they had they had the hook in deep and my wife bought that they're very good at what\nThey do I'm so be very careful and uh use good judgment out there\nThank you for coming on happy to be your ... being here and until next week I Want everybody to shop local stay stay and stay tuned for border patrol you'll mortgage\nHe has an equal housing lender and I'm a less three to seven for sure here's an animal less one zero sixty five one age is license to do business in the state of Arizona and California\nBecame number one oh six eight five one age ...

or it was pretty funny no hell no [laughter]\n\nThat's fantastic fantastic [laughter]\nLove that hey we're going to take a real quick break folks were going to come back with a President Trump's talk on condemning some Democrats on uh the way they're acting towards ... ice and the way they're acting towards law enforcement in general uh I'm hoping to get to a later on in the show on the more apprehensions\nThat we're seeing and obviously the crisis that the human ... the human scrub nurse the human smugglers are creating in Arizona and ah you'll be interesting to hear that there's some managers especially at the Tucson station\nThat are not a really helping with this crisis and uh they're just they're taking advantage of some\nBorder patrol agents and I wanted to talk about that because as always enjoy exposing fully and I think that's the mentality that is going on at the Tucson station particular anything going a little bit\nSo join us after the break [noise]\nMen and women

forth [noise] hey\nPrejudice can\nDamned some Democrats and their attempts to a sort of police from cooperating with ice and in stemming tide of these lethal drugs\nAnd I think it's important for people to understand because\nWe have way too many people that are running for political positions that are anti law enforcement\nAnd it's it's scary when you start looking at and at the same time I think\nYou have individuals that are already in political positions that don't understand what it is that we do so what they're doing is\nThey're trying to make the villains that way they can pull the votes from a certain group of people right when it comes down to a like these antifa jerks that you see all the time um which I've seen some of these on these\nGuys are probably get the one big yoked anti forgot to come after me but it is what it is I just tell you that I see some of these antifa folks and uh some of these and our so called anarchists and\nKnow Andy I don't think they could fight their way out of a paper bag right you know they're pretty weak looking individuals' a but apparently they think they can be tough guys and they're out there talking about it and one thing that I wanted to talk when I get to President Trump's remarks right\nBut one thing I Want to talk of was there was um some antifa folks\nOn September twenty first is when the media first reported it right\nAnd uh it was a website was on it and ... and it did call for the slaughter of it this is what it says the call it's a call for the slaughter of fastest\nBorder patrol dogs and their boss wow and that's in reference to uh to publish claims that are known by a ... activists\nSo it goes on and it shows and it says um killers and brown sugar uniforms which we don't wear brown so they already are colorblind\nHow the United states border patrol brutalizes the ... and uh it was written on the September twentieth of twenty teen and then they're well known anti fur activists it's there the writers and the news service and uh I think his name as all Rick Salazar\nAnd they called themselves revolutionaries and it's time to rise up with the masses right and and cause violence against fastest border patrol dogs and their boss he goes on to say slaying them slaying them that's what it says\n... them with revolutionary fire and just as\nThe source also stated that they said a red guards and their supporters as they have said just before the time for activism is over now is the time for war\nBelieve that so they're calling out for an all out war on against border patrol agents directly it's a little right on the source also advocated to end or the barbarism that the U.S imperialism or ...\nFor masses from Central America and Mexico to exact rubble luge revolutionary vengeance and seize power\nWell I don't see that has done it enough media play\nAnd I don't think people know what antifa how the the ... started where it started I don't think people really know about it just is you hear it once in a while and that's\nIt yeah they're bugs is what they are then you'd be squashed and I know it sounds horrible to say it and then they'll say oh well arts law enforcement and he said you know what guys these people are domestic terrorism there are a threat to America there are a threat to our way of life\nAnd I took an oath to defend this country against all terrorists foreign\nAnd domestic and that's where people are getting lost and these people are domestic terrorists\nBut to go ahead and say it's time to stop activism it's time to start the war it's time to go on an all out war hey listen man at the end of the day I just want to live to be an old man\nAnd some of these on T. for guys come and there's a problem and I got to take a few of them with me so be it\nShould agents keep their eyes open ... or even more no I've always like this I've always\nI think all of them for spent wintertime we're all on force but needs to keep their eyes open and you have these certain regimes and you have these these actors so called activists\nAnd you have these throughout the entire border though the um the ... the hubs across the border people as I like to call them you know and and\nThey're anti law enforcement that's when it comes down to and they say well\nThe you know the people that you guys were wrestling are not criminals I break into your house and my criminal\nIf I just go into your window at my luminal yeah you know I'm a criminal you know if I Need something I'm going to go in there just to take it 'cause I'm In need store criminal you know regardless of if I'm Broken into your house before are not at all it takes is one time and I'm a criminal so I'm tired of hearing this oh well these these\nIllegal immigrants do not need to go to a concert legal aliens I'm tired of hearing that don't call them aliens for one I'm tired of hearing people\nAttacked that that's the legal word illegal aliens and the reality is\nI don't care if you break into the country once twice or if it's your hundredth time you're breaking our laws of our country and you are a criminal\nYou may not like it you may be bothered by the fact that you're being called the criminal journal criminal\nAnd and and a lot of it stemmed and my my frustration is when I did this Fox a town hall John ... couple of weeks ago yeah there was a girl there and she was very like don't call me a criminal don't call me an alien that's what you are\nAnd then I and then went on her face on our on our Instagram page on her Instagram per person on Instagram page right [noise] and\nOffer pictures are or how Mexico's fantastic how she root for the Mexican team how the Mexican seems so great in fact she has a picture on her um Instagram\nWhere it's her birthday cake right and it's a Mexican flag ... so I'm sitting here going didn't why do you want to be a citizen of this country\nYeah you know what I mean it just doesn't make any sense you're allegiance is obviously not here it's over there so go I'm I'm okay with you just\nPractice what you preach yeah right oh\nI got so many things in my head that I Want to talk about\nPresident Trump delivered those ... or some remarks are at the one hundred and twenty fifth annual conference as and exposition of International Association\nAnd I have heard for those that have a problem getting out to the polls that some of the uh ride services are going to be doing free rides to the polls so getting ... who's going to be dependent on your that's great who you're using but they want to make sure that people get out and vote\nAgents needs to go out and vote I I talked to two and a lot of agents and they're like a you know I didn't have time on it and go no\nGo bolt plain and simple go vote if if you're at work and it's you're working well into the hours where you don't go and you can't make sure that they give you the opportunity to by law they have to let you go All right that's just the way it works\nUm we'll take a break I said we wouldn't but we're not break anyway I'm because I'm going to talk about this breaks and what people get away with and ... and ...\nWho does what and who doesn't do something a particularly as I keep teasing some issues at the Tucson ... [noise] you're listening to the\nTexas federal wellness center founded with a vision based on principles focused on superior healthcare utilizing a combination of physical medicine physical therapy and surgical expertise visit the website at Texas F. W. C. dot com [noise]\nThis is the green line\nAs the vice president of the national border patrol council I represent more than Fifteen thousand border agents we need leaders will help us fix the border prices\nHere since cinema opposed funding to help law enforcement side to drug cartels and she supported dangerous sanctuary city policies here say cinema is weak on borders security the national border patrol council was proud to endorse Martha ... for Senate and we know Martha has her back and she'll do what it takes to secure the border\nAnd my family and I approve this message and now back to the green [noise]\nBack and they want to talk about prevention\nRio Grande valley sector chief ... by the uh says that the numbers have doubled for those crossing the border illegally\nOver for thousands or four thousand arrests were made for the first week of this fiscal year compared to just over two thousand arrest being made on October of twenty Seventy they've doubled why do you think they've doubled\nBecause catch and release is still going on\nBecause there's no consequences for the individuals that are breaking our immigration laws because the rhetoric alone that President Trump delivered when he first took over office dropped the numbers and our leaders within the United states border patrol failed to\nAct upon that window that's when it comes down to why because this is what you have\nYou have an all star team which is the border patrol agents to there are altered then you have the managers and the coaches the general manager all that\nAnd then you have the owner which in this case I Will attribute the owner as being President Trump so it works right so we are\nI Would say under new ownership with all star players\nThat need motivation that need the proper\nGloves hats balls foot wear uniforms they need all that the owner wants\nTo give them too but the general manager who's been a general manager for quite some time uh is a feeding different information probably to the owner then you've got the coaches and the manager\nWho are are the same coaches and managers that were there before they just change their position one turned into another manager and the other one is now the batting coach and just\nFlip flopped [noise] so where is the problem\nIn the managerial staff got all star players I just say the all star players were the ones that were in line wanting this new owner and they're happy with the new owner\nPresident Trump the issue has always been\nThe general manager and the and the manager of the coaches of the team [noise] we're not going to change the game plan if you have the same manager in the same general manager no I'm not saying fire\nOr higher position leaders\nBut give them another position somewhere else I don't know that's all I'm saying I think we have good leaders within border patrol\nI think a lot of them are going to be retiring here soon because it's their time to retire then they're done and they don't see any change and I see it all the time with some of the leadership I speak to\n'em it's going to be a scary next few years because we have\nI don't know less than responsible\nOr less than professional leaders that are going to be staying and they're going to be getting higher positions now and then you shouldn't have the higher ups which are running the organization that are still running it and they're doing a horrible\nJob [noise] so that's my rent on that because I think it's important that\nThe\nThe regular citizen understand I'm not trying to attack because there are certain things I Want to hold back on not because I'm scared to say it but because I don't want the general public to think\nHere's art just ranting and raving attacking his agency I'm not attacking my agency we have fantastic agents right we have fantastic leaders unfortunately many of the managers that are in this agency that are calling\nThe shots and the bigger wig people are in DC that are calling the shots are doing a horrible job\nAt the expect at the expense of the agents and at the expense of um some of the leaders that actually want to be leaders it's just the way it is yeah\nYou're seeing this crisis you're seeing the amount of individuals are coming to the United states you're seeing it here in Arizona as I said more than fourteen hundred Central American illegals primarily from Guatemala have been found traveling in large group since August in remote areas in different parts of the desert in Arizona\nI've been surprised to see the number of groups you don't have it you think two three four maybe five people to the hundreds ... amazing hundred people because there's no consequences ... there's no classrooms are getting ... to getting released so for listeners who don't know what catch 'em all leases and I know we've explained to orbit ages catch him\nThey fingerprint um they don't have any prior criminal history the United states keep in mind I don't have the database of their country so I don't know if they committed crimes and their country right\nUm there's nowhere to house them\nSo you release them you're making pinkie swear that they're short for an immigration court that's it based on a\n... I mean there's more through the process obviously or paper was but that's in it then and then that show that's what it is\nNo consequences or you know they were talk we were talking about the crisis the Arizona issue the agency did cite that at least eight years instances since August twentieth in which a group\nMore than a hundred undocumented aliens usually including families and small children were found in areas of south west Arizona\nNow I talked ah somebody sent me a message I don't even know what was it I get I get messages all the time and a lot of people and there was a big group that they arrested and are they all had the same phone number in their pocket\nRight and so this I guess this guy is an uncle to over a hundred individuals but they answered head you know so and so you're the uncle\nYeah I Am just what catch and release you know it's obvious that it's a smuggling organization is just ridiculous and they're laughing at our laws you that's what upsets the heck out of me you know um\nYou see the amount of illegals that are coming through you see them you know turning themselves in large groups you know ... huge groups that are coming through there and they're coming through Yuma\nThey're coming through 'em or ... or ... grand valley there everywhere you know a chief or Anthony provides Nick how to humans did say this is a humanitarian crisis that is impacting border security\nWhere the judges what immigration judges and you know why aren't they at the border we\nThere's a you go to the Tucson sector and there's a sign parking and one of the spots is assigned for the immigration judge right there is no one ever part there oh\nYou can't even find parking at Tucson station but yet the judge has a parking spot and he's never even there which is crazy it just said you know what I mean it's just I don't understand how this thing gets run 'em\nAnd so this is affecting a lot of the agents [noise] I see this too yeah and I'll tell you where where this is where it there's a twist\nYou heard me say there's managers that aren't really leaders and that's just I guess it's everywhere but\nI Need to find out I don't want to drop his name yet until I'm One hundred percent sure it did happen right\nBut we had a leader at ... to ... well we had a manager at the at the Tucson station right debt ordered an agent to go to handle a case which he can do that's why I'm not saying that's part of our job right and managers yeah", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Green Line", "city": "Tucson", "day": "13"}
