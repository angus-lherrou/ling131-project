{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KNST", "content": "So that was only two years ago in two thousand twelve six years ago that number was um four hundred and fifty four so that just kind of gives you a perspective and an idea of how bad it's gotten in the last Eighteen months worth\nTwenty four hundred on those that's pretty remarkable it's about a three hundred percent and yeah\nI wanted to I wanted to go back to uh so how did we get to the deflection idea where to come from and cause a little non standard a lot of people out there will you know think tough love is a better approach or whatever but it is you know I I have to tell you the\nThe issue is so we'd go out to a store it's a win will shop lifted and uh the store security we holding them for us\nAnd we'll go out and we'll talk to that person and in the course of processing the shoplifting arrest wound up doing a search and in their pocket will find say cocaine or heroin or methamphetamine [noise]\nUm and then the only thing that police officers could do at that point the only thing that we were allowed to do until deflection occurred uh a program began in July first\nWas booked him into jail so let me talk to you about what that means because most people aren't booked into jail most people don't know what that means so this is someone who may have a job a likely as a job and now gets a felony\nFast and because of the felony arrest for having the narcotic in their pocket\nThey get booked into jail which means they probably miss work that day they get out of jail very quickly it's not fair held a long time but when they get out of jail now they have appointments that they have to be enough to get a public defender if they don't make enough money or they got to hire an attorney [noise] um and if their work finds out they'll likely be fired from their job\nAnd uh at the end of of everything maybe they do get into drug court six eight nine months later so suddenly now they're getting a treatment opportunity at six months to a year after the arrest\nAnd what we thought about this was three years ago and this is on the national stage we were part of a discussion and said that doesn't work we need to get people treatment when they're at that point and I got to tell you if someone finds heroin in your pocket when you get caught shoplifting and you're likely shoplifting in order to buy the heroin\nOr when that happens that is a point where you might be receptive to treatment you might be the most receptive to treatment especially\nIf it means all those other negative consequences don't happen vision yeah your job your head right here everything and so not everyone's ripe for the opportunity to be deflected a lot of people are still going to be going to jail for it I get that but the truth is\nThis program is just outstanding Lee successful I mean I Would have told you that three years ago we didn't envision\nTen percent maintaining contact with treatment after they walked out the door\nAnd the things that were at fifty or sixty or Seventy percent somewhere in that range is just astronomically successful it's beyond anyone's wildest dreams so for those people who sat and said no we need to put them all in jail it just wasn't working it just wasn't working and then this approach we can give it a shot and you talked about\nEven if you don't have somebody in your family who is affected by it you're still affected by it because who pays for the class to jail\n[noise] yeah exactly I mean the cost to put people in jail is not just the cost to put him in jail it's a cost of taking care of their kids it's a ... it's just an astronomically expensive proposition if what you're concerned about is money it is very expensive for people who have substance use disorder century that\nNot only that but so much as I said earlier so much of the crime that we that we see the property crime you know the perjury that's the shoplifting that it's all associated with\nPeople who have substance use disorder is trying to either get merchandise that they can sell or trade for their drugs so again going back to the bottom line how do we how do we begin to fix that is to treat the underlying problem\nThat was deafening during the break\nYou were asked about the origin of pocket drugs I don't know what that is so when people started to have more and more of the disorder problems\nWhat happened in the Nineteen nineties there was an article in New England Journal of medicine that instructed health care professionals to treat pain like it's a vital sign when we is that you we assess your blood pressure your heart rate your respiratory rate how much how much oxygen as in your blood\nWe're told me that need and start asking how much pain arguing and then because of that decision reimbursement position um\nReviews started to generate around your ability to control someone's paying sufficient started to feel I Need to get paid under control I went to prescribe opioids because what's better at controlling pain\n... years ago and they did some more research in the American Medical Association came back and said no way you can't do that you're creating a problem if I'm getting at we need to stop so they were told to stop doing that\nStop prescribing these high doses when we did that we wound up with a whole community of people who want things that they should never be in pain\nToo are dependent on opioids so now that is something that we are getting behind now we have people who are buying their drugs on the street because they think cut off\nTo prescribe or said no more so now you have to get at some point you're addicted people who are continue to use opioids don't use them because they want to get high they use them to avoid going into withdrawal\nThey're trying to avoid getting sick\nSomeone who doesn't to withdraw field now as yeah vomiting they have ... have a headache they're miserable this is the worst flu you ever imagine in your life that they're going through for days to try and get clean so in order to avoid that feeling they continue to you\nAnd and I'll go back to exactly to your point you know a a unfortunately of English teeth and I was at my dentist recently and\nI'd been there a year ago and and she told me that when we had this discussion and actually she has a lot of questions about what was going on and I talked with her about it and uh she told me the last time I was there a few weeks ago that she completely stopped prescribing Roxy and\nI went well I was kind of extreme I'm thinking and she says but nobody's complained no single patient as complains she uses all the sudden paying them no she recommends Tylenol Tylenol and ibuprofen and and that's been my personal experiences that works very well for me\nBut uh seven major you know a dentist with a major practice stop doing it I just let you know that\nThat article in the New England Journal of medicine I pulled up and looked at its two paragraphs it's unbelievable and it was referred to I think in a fraud\nAnd the attorney general those two apparently at a fraud to by by people across the uh the medical profession to prescribe all these things so now as they backed away from these again it gets us right back to\nWhere we weren't forces these people back on the street drugs\nAnd the one thing you can say for a pharmaceutical Oxley was it was safer than street drugs and I'm not saying it was good but it was definitely say from the street drugs now they're on street drugs and the question is\nYou know our number one messages counter Cox alliances if you are prescribed drugs by a doctor only get them from a licensed pharmacy don't get them from your cousin don't get them from someone who picks them up for you unless it's your family member who does it because you're you know I'm not not able but I have to tell you that people will go down and they they think that they're\nIn an Arizona is you know people are very comfortable buying what they hear is Mexican prescriptions well first of all the legal to import prescription from Mexico just by what you may hear\nAnd second of all there's no guarantee that those are from a licensed pharmacy so we just really want people to make sure they stick to licensed pharmacy they know that treatments available affordable effective\nAnd that could actually be the first call if they've got a problem with drugs quote cook will get them to where they need to go it's no wrong door\nSo that will actually come out they have

killing my members have had six officers killed by illegal aliens oh it was literally killing\nOur Hispanic community partners in Phoenix right it was clearly a sanctuary city policy we went head to
