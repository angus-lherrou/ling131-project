C. C. uh the the actual program starts about six thirty but those dinner and dancing to follow okay oh what a great opportunity to come out and have some\nFun yeah isn't anybody so you're listening right now someone listening day can say I love the military I Want to go to the good night out I can support and we'll find out what it's going to do and what its support anybody can just\nAnybody can buy a ticket or in fact there um our tickets still available right now if you go to a Tucson YMCA dot org or then you can find some tickets there are but you can also or pay at the door for this event as I Believe ah ah the tea cc is such a big venue that there'll be seats for everybody\nOkay now uh now I mean is there are certain could address that needs 'cause it's\nKind of a it's a ball yeah it is a it is a formal ballgame and one of the reasons that it is formal is because of the recognition of our nation's military and it gives a\nThe military I'm a representative was an opportunity to put on their dress blues and ah and I say blues because I'm an air force guy we were going to get it and uh and uh but it's a great opportunity for them to also ah come out in a celebrated with us but\nI recognize the fact that uh I'm In being able to participate with the military or it is a high honor ... so that's why are they a high dress yes is one of those\nThings and that's where the gallons or ... or ... you know what a this is one of those are\nGreat opportunities are geared for our guys are like us to take out our ladies are in um give them a great date night out yup and give them a chance to to wear that ah that ball a I'm\nA fashion that they had been waiting to pull out of the closet and ah so you could be a winner on both fronts need to be a winner with your hunting and you can also recognize the military at the same\nTime exactly exactly and again we're going to throw this out\nThe entire interview to Tucson YMCA dot org yes to find out more information about the military bulge takes place on November the tent at the tea see see 'em and before we get into what happened to the ball and the seating rages on it and it gets really cool not the money that is he's collected what is the benefit what is it going to do\nUm here's a one of the great things about the ball also too is not only is it a fund the evening but it's an opportunity for people to actually give back to those members of the military or many of whom and as we approach Twenty years of\nDeployments in Afghanistan yeah or Twenty years of deployment as we of course I have wild down things in Iraq but Twenty years of actually being at war\nOr the longest period in our nation's history the longest period than the two hundred and forty plus years of this grand experiment that we called America\nYou have an opportunity and we all have an opportunity to recognize those folks who have many of them had multiple deployments to defend these great freedoms that we have here in this country but also to have an opportunity to be able to celebrate the fact that ah those freedoms continue\nThat went on to talk about the deployments and um but some of the things that that are involved in this to the money raised yes goes towards the families right they get to use\nThat it gives them an opportunity to get free memberships or early in the house so to actually get subsidized memberships to the YMCA or gives them a chance to uh\nSome even to a of their kids to get an opportunity to get free swim lesson allow uh so uh you can just imagine that Garrett being a dad yourself\nOf or the benefit of being able to um take your kids are too many of the uh facilities are of the YMCA but they're getting them to have the opportunity to learn how to swim\nIn fact a Garrett I've got a personal story that um that's where I learned how to swim myself really I was at the YMCA and in fact the first place I ever saw an indoor pool in my life was that the\nUh blend veal YMCA and Cleveland, Ohio don't get a growing up as a kid and a Garrett I come from very humble beginnings and the and I can personally tell you that are more than likely we could not afford it membership\nOr someone actually had to pay for us and and pay for me and I'm Glad they did because that was a transformational experience for me as a youngster and so just imagine now here's an opportunity for someone to do likewise right here in Tucson as other than there is\nOnly get paid back they can they get paid back this way you're listening to is the talk of Tucson I'm Garrett Lewis I Am in here in Studio\nOr with Tony ... who is the presidency of the United way who's involved will get to the United way as well and also a veteran thank you so much for your service will talk about that as well and this is all for\nThe military ball that's going to take place on November tent at the T. C. C. and you can get more information again at a Tucson YMCA dot org you can even buy tickets they uh get information that you might think it's at the door that night but it's a bully to look good\nI can be a lot of fun but speaking of the points I mean\nPeople get deployed sometimes for a year at a time yes I mean that is a long time to be without your family\nIt is um and you can imagine are the issues that uh uh these those kinds of extended separations can call yeah ah and ah but the great thing about um the YMCA is that it has a long history of being able to support the\nUm the families who are sometimes left behind ... and ah so the YMCA becomes a hub a and an opportunity for these families to go find other\nFriends are and to also be able to find some really community resources that they need to be able to help them a go through the hardship of deployment and just thinking about a good many of 'em are people who are part of a\nCritical jobs within the military have multiple deployments yes over the last Twenty years\nI don't think that there's any way we can every pay these families for the sacrifice name has she'll just to be able to to give something back and they can find some some\nGreat entertainment ... I'm ... to take their mind off of things have can't imagine like wake up every day and wonder where where is my my other half where's my dad where's my mom\nAnd I see these videos on the news of when uh the moms or the dad come back and he surprised the kid at school and the kids just tear up and I mean any of watching it on on line and watch it on these if it's incredible it'll you know I Can't even imagine how appreciative also and they\nThey are because they're great people who have pre should have the military families are do after you get this kind of a\nAbsolutely they are Garrett and you can actually see it on their faces a I've had the pleasure of not only are being honored this time around at this great event but I've attempted to you that I'm I'm several times over the course of a\nA having a chance to be a part of this community here in Tucson and and it's an enjoyable event because you can actually see\nUm how much of the military uh and their families really appreciate the the recognition and um it's great to be able to feel that in the room it's almost palpable there and really the evening and so a\nNight right it is they get to be the star is it absolutely is they get to dress up and like you said in the news for you\nYou and and yeah and they always look so short hair you know it's almost intimidating that aspect of it is but I got to tell you after\nWe go through the ... a\nA a a really um a ceremonial part of the vet or they get the let their hair down because uh there's always a great band that comes up or that starts to play right after the program ends\nAnd die if you get to let you down and and have a great meal on top of it they have served fantastic food at the event uh and then you get to dance so uh I really enjoyed taking my ah taking my wife out and having an opportunity to be able to get out on the dance floor with her too\nWell tell me about the ceremony tell tell me what happened to the ceremony\nUm it is a one of those things that are will make your heart soar", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Talk of Tucson", "city": "Tucson", "day": "27"}
