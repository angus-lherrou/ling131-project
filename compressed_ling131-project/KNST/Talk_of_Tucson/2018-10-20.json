{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KNST", "content": "Um who is having a great event happening the fall Fonda coming up on the twenty eighth good morning thank you so much for being here for having me tell us what exactly useful Fonda yellow while the fall fond\nThough it will be our fifth annual it is a bike ride that is not a race it's intended to highlight a\nBeautiful roads in Tucson community there's beautiful roads their beauty of it there are beautiful roads a youthful scenery I'm not talking about the pavement but I'm Talking on the senior Asia and the company\nSo it's a chance for people to get to ride with some of the kids that are in one of our programs team I'll group out so older kids that ride bikes and they're pretty darn strong varying from ages twelve to twenty but um we pair off people with a\nGroup of ... ah riders youth writers and they got to get to know them get the experience it's kind of key to our mission about empowering use\nWell let's backtrack for a second sure what it is for those that aren't familiar el group boat in general it's about bike riding correct\nCorrect well it's morally more about youth development so L group of cyclists nonprofit we've been around for almost fourteen years wow yeah and uh it really started with the idea of\nFinding kids that hadn't found that thing in their lives they got them excited him on the right path and\nUsing the ... school as the means to do that to help them find confidence to help them develop character and teamwork skills and all that stuff we just happen to love bicycles and use them as a means that greater end\nAnd how did you were the co founder you said so my husband and I started it um and actually started with a bike riding elective at city high school when it first started and in downtown you and\nThe idea was orange kids on bike rides and then from there we on the third semester we had kids from other schools coming to our bike riding ... elective [laughter]\nSo when we had double the number of kids in the room we realize oh I'm from ... I'm from Tucson Hi these are kids that really wanted there was a niche that need to be filled\nAnd you're saying over about over two hundred fifty cyclists are going to participate in this year alone\nIn the fall Fonda yes or no um and that's not counting the kids and the families and all the volunteers takes to make it happen too so\n... founded fourteen years ago how has it grown like obviously there was a natural attraction like these people these kids coming up and saying I Want to ride bikes to how many kids are you serving now in ...\nYeah so it started on my back porch fourteen years ago with about five kids and we now have a downtown warehouse space that is a over seven thousand square feet inside we have a shot or a hundred and twenty kids and weekly program and we serve about one thousand three hundred kids a year so it's grown tremendously\nAnd you're in the schools and stuff do you work with different school I've salute\nLee yeah so we do outreach events at schools we actually run now an after school bike club at moms do elementary it's just over a mile from our clubhouse so it's right in our backyard um there are a great school that has really collaborated with us so twice a week\nWe have bikes at the school we're on a a club there and then kids from other programs of ours going help assist the staff and so it's part of that use empowering other used to get excited about by\nYou and I see that you're doing that provide scholarships community school programs value based programs sporting\n... yeah absolutely and sometimes these you'd still have access to bikes you help provide them with bicycles and so ...\nSo we are extremely fortunate that we have such a generous Tucson community and uh the majority of the bikes that all the kids ride of and donated from individuals and uh\nFrom individuals either donated their bike or donate money so that we can get bikes that fit kids especially younger kids it's hard to find donated quality kids' bikes so we've had to use grant money and donor money to to buy those but then it makes that experience for the kids so much more powerful\nAnd you have like different levels of bicycle riders\nAbsolutely yeah so some kids will start with us in our summer by can't program a we'll have a hundred and fifty kids come through every June and by camps and we teach kids how to ride every summer or we're working with kids that already know how to ride and they're elevating their skills\nAre and then within each program we kind of break it down into like an A. B. C. so\nA being like I'm more experience than I Want to take my game higher CBD and maybe I'm a newer writer and I'm learning and I'm gaining endurance and strength\nAnd all that stuff riding a bike it's such a memorable experience I think we can all look back at the time when we clicked and we're like to ride a bike now like that's a vivid memory totally and it builds confidence like you were saying it's more than just bike riding you're also developing skills for these you\nAbsolutely I think that's the thing that that I personally pride myself on the most is the story is that kids come back and tell you know three four years after they've left the team after they graduated from high school and say\nMan when I was studying for the exam and I was really stressed out and life was hit me in the face I remembered ride my bike in the desert three am at the twenty four hour racing going like I could do that I can do this you know so it's about helping them make those connections to like what you gain on the bike and how you use it off the bike\nAlso helped create diversity within our community as well and I'm sure that that you see that yeah for the last few years as well with these kids absolutely\nWe've got kids you know from on just email group we have forty two kids on the ... and they're coming from over a dozen different schools\nRight so you got kids from the south side ride inside shoulder to shoulder with kids from the north side and the west side and the east side right you bring these people together and the bike becomes is common denominator you know or they can like work together doesn't matter where you come from\nIn the physical activity like it's it's almost unintentional like getting kids active yeah and being outside which I think is really hard nowadays there's like beyond their eye pads and be inside so to bring them out and pull them out to appreciate the beauty of Tucson on a bike is awesome\nYeah absolutely I think one of the things that are a different uh supporters of really taken too is like we collect kids phones when we get into vans and we drive\nToo is that right now you're going to talk to each other you're going to play cards they don't know where that is so well they do and I think one of the things that we do a little differently is like recognize that kids are\nAre naturally capable right and it's just about helping them tap into that knowing they're going to make mistakes but like supporting them through the process of learning and you know becoming a better adults\nRight well it's so you were saying earlier that these bikes are all donated or you get grants and they'll how how does your funding work since you're a non profit how absolutely\nWill get the full pie chart you know as a non profit right away it takes everything to to make it run and him since we've done nothing but grow it's like we've got\nAn awesome community of supporters that donate goods and bikes but also cash a we're now a qualified charitable organization is I'm seeing here yeah your tax credit dollars will now go to this it's huge and it's been great for us it just happened last year and um we think it's going to be transformative and helping to reach low income kids right\nAt school that I mentioned Ninety percent of the kids at school qualify for free and reduced lunch right now that's a big deal so it's a big deal and it's an opportunity they wouldn't otherwise have so we're able to do that now\nAs we get those donations in and and with a tax credit it's kind of a no brainer like you're going to have to spend the money and send it somewhere so you can direct it you know to a cause that you believe in like ...\nWe're talking with Danielle or she is co founder and executive director of ... as well\nSo uh so let's let's circle back now to the big event the fall for our own image Rosie right falls on do fall Fonda yes so this is the fifth and a little bit and you'll do and I'm looking here\nYou get to pick your distance on this right I'm looking for the thirty five miles on horses about what you get out of me because I'm just I've ...
