Shaikh adds a is the chair\nOf she's on classics car show and ... is the president and the Rotary Club of Tucson so shall we start talking about the Rotary Club and the events that you put on throughout the shall we just go right into the Tucson classics ...\nWell I think unless it let's go into the car show that the news it's only in almost you know less than two weeks and Bruce and the team and then working all year long on this and so Bruce what do you want to say about the show well\nThe first thing I Want to say is uh if you haven't been you need to turn out is uh as\nYou mentioned as we've been doing this is all they are twelve their annual ah it's our signature fundraising event that we do every year\nSo far in the past eleven years we've ah raised a little over a one point two million dollars and uh we're excited the last couple of years as we've been able to get our net for our charities up to about a hundred and Seventy five to two hundred thousand a year\nGosh that's great and so it's Saturday on ... for it and it's at that Gregory school\nCorrect the regular school ride off of Craig cropped up by the reach a river or the ... the host of our show since we started\nYeah and we didn't say it's been forever he's been there and\nWe have almost twenty thousand people who turn out so you know four hundred and twenty classic cars everybody comes to the cars they're they're terrific there there are you know that's our customer the cars that come out and we try to take care of them but they're beautiful cars all different types\nOf vintage most of them Nineteen Seventy nine and older and people come out and there's food and activity and Bruce until you know and all of that has all kinds of fun that goes on during the day\nYeah well it was as Chuck mentioned we have somewhere around twenty thousand people would end up turning out for the event um we do want to mention that there is a there's on site parking uh we do charge for parking at seven dollars per car um as far as admission goes is that\nIt gets which are raffle tickets but also service your mission it's five dollars a ticket and for um kids that are under Eighteen as long as there with a paid adult is they're able to come in for free\nBut you know the one thing I'll say about what these raffle tickets we also have a number of people that they might buy five ten fifty of these tickets just to submit them for the rap also\nUh we certainly appreciate that kind of community sport support in are raising money for the charities\nAnd that raffle which you win for what we were apple every year as a Corvette we've had twelve different Corvettes it's a new Corvette every year or this year it's our best Corvette yet it's a two thousand five only forty thousand miles on it but it's a beautiful blue Corvette\nOr that or is it the fifty one so it's the best performing for see six\nA car that we've had out there and uh so you get the car or Fifteen thousand dollars in cash

into the car show so it's a terrific deal it's very family friendly and we can talk about that and how we have great activities for the kids and all the rest and ... and that's really what this is it's a family friendly event a lot of people there but it's fun and it's a great car shows so uh so uh you know people should buy tickets if you don't have I'm now\nWe had a when it's a win win and where can they get the tickets in advance\nBest location is to go to our website which is a tea CCS a classic scar show and you can purchase tickets on line\nOf there are tickets that you can purchase the day of the show as well um so whatever works out for people are obviously I think that a lot of people know we have over a two hundred and twenty members of the Rotary Club Tucson\nAnd I think that a lot of the folks that attend no those rotary members so they have the opportunity to just reach out to some of their fellow ... and purchase tickets that way as well\nAnd you buy 'em on line

a tough annual cheese on classics car shell which is happening on Saturday October twentieth tend to four at the Gregory school and that's a crate craft Dan River\nOr just south of river right at the retail river right\nThere you go and you can buy your tickets now also a lot of people are on social media you know like Facebook and I did notice that you guys do have a Facebook page an event page so if you want to get more information they can also go to your Facebook page\nYeah fake Facebook we in the last few years we definitely had been trying to uh up our game as far as social media so to speak\nAnd uh so I think that that's a great opportunity to just be able to look for the Rotary Club two sons Facebook page and like it and you'll get plenty of information um I Know last year they actually did some live streaming during the during the event itself\nSo I Know that there's plans to do that again this year as well\nBut you know one other thing I wanted to mention is you know a Chuck talked about it being a family friendly\nEvent I think even for people that are not um you know what I call ... ... people I think whether you're talking about little kids or adults is just walking around and looking at these classic cars is they really are amazing I'm obviously there's plenty of people that are ... people that\nUh you know they want to know just you know what's the size the engine and what was the restoration but\nUm besides that we do have a area for the kids um we have a DJ out there uh playing fifties and sixties DJ John\nUm and obviously we're making announcements throughout the day uh we have a food court ah this year uh I'm trying to remember I think we're up to ten different ah food vendors that are there and so when people come in if they want to purchase anything or food or drink\nIs a we have a token booth um so it's not cash sales there so they have to purchase their tokens or to be able to purchase any food or beverage be able to drink\nAnd Twenty one and older we have beer available as well uh so nothing like a great you know\nKind of day in October ... and having a beer and looking at great cars and it's a it's it's terrific

has a free food and beverage a free beer and wine or and or in a you know a kind of cooling and separate facilities all the rest of that\nKind of like a VIP like an explicit little area\nExactly how many people that do we have last year in the ... I'm trying\nTo remember I think that we're close to five hundred oh we also uh don't forget that we do have a TVs in there with a if the depending on what time that you may games\nThat will be on the game um\nBut you know as Chuck mentioned it's it's a way you know a lot of people like it because\nNot only do they know that they're making this donation you know that goes through our charities um but you know person gets a wristband so it's one of those where they can kind of come and go you know for however long they're out there and you know certainly we know we never know exactly what the weather's been last year was beautiful but\nYou know some years it's still been a little on the warm side so the fact that it's a air cooled tent\nUm one other as a write in that particular area we also have our feature cars and um\nTypically these are these are high end or specialty cars I'm I Do know we've gotta G T forty is going to be one of them that's out there um and to give you an idea that value on that cars and access for a million dollars wow so we\nWe have a rank higher yeah now we we\nHave arrangements are I Believe we're going to have three feature cars out there this year um so we're actually just a you know finalizing similar uh solidify occasion on those cars\nI'm also a with that are classics that we get a VIP parking spot as well so back to parking\nBruce mentioned there's there's parking onsite so we have parking on the on the uh the grade school grounds also across the street in the east lot and then we have free parking as well so people don't want to pay seven dollars for the parking or at GMC a Tucson medical center there north watts right off of Glenn that's between one and Craig crop\nUh they can park there and ah and then they're free shuttle buses to take them up to the front and uh\nYou know it's it's kind of smart as well because if you know if you've ever been to the Fort will shoot out the offer to yeah we tie the roads up more than that so yeah big crowd Andre crop looking to get in and out", "show_name": "Talk of Tucson", "year": "2018", "city": "Tucson", "day": "13"}
