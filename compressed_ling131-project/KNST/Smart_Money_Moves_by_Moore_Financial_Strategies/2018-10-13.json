{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KNST", "content": "It's well which is good I'm here before we talk about um rotary overall do you want to talk to touch base on our sponsors maybe just a little bit more what I what are we just wrap up because we have wonderful sponsor\nYeah actually it was funny I was just thinking about that that we hadn't talked about it and you know I mean the the real jump in our our ability to raise the type of money that we have been able to raise\nReally has come due to our sponsors um we've had our our headline sponsor which um has been for the last I Believe this is five years or title sponsor is we buy houses\nWhich uh you know a local business owner but he has been he and his family have been a major major sponsors for the past five years but\nWe have a lot of key sponsors in here that uh their contributions were at at the you know a five thousand dollar level\nUm people have stepped in Arizona Bowl beach flash men say more U.S ... uh Larry Miller\nBad media a rich and Judy Flynn Supercuts the temp connection and well spring's financial partners um we have a number of uh supporting sponsors we have all different sponsorship levels um and you know maybe just a\nA quick plug about sponsorships is obviously we're we're too late in the game as far as this year um but obviously the more sponsors that we're able to get involved with the car show is is the more that we're able to contribute to our charities so\nIf anybody um you know is listening to this and they're thinking hey this is the type of organization that I'd like to you know get involved with to be able to get back to the community um\nAgain I probably would direct people to the website and um you know we certainly would love to welcome in some new sponsors next year for ah for our ... our thirteenth a annual\nCar show for us the more the merrier ... you had them or you can give a hundred percent now now what what's that same shop give local I shop I don't give local or something like that well right now you want to give local because it stays local\nAfter I go yeah absolutely and it and you know the studies show that dollars it stay local go round like seven times were dollars that come in whatever it is they go out of state someplace to a bigger company they don't circulate here in Maine so it's good for all of us\nUm but so rotary um what is the Rotary Club and and what's that about I mean we used used to talk about Rotary Club is being a service organization organization of of business leaders a community leaders are and just people who really want to be engaged in the community and others that service organization has members\nWhat's really changed the years is we're really now a membership organization that focuses on our members and their development and what they can do a and and the service that we can do through that so rotary has an international an organization or their one point two million numbers worldwide we're in over two hundred where it almost every country in the world\nUh I just came back ah four months ago from the international conference convention in Toronto we\nGet together once a year or early ... oh yeah thirty five thousand people and we were yeah thirty five thousand type a good do gooders\n[laughter] [laughter] that's my own area cage I don't know what to do it right but everybody\nEverybody looking to do good and and probably where I Hope people recognize rotary most is that a rotary in the late Nineteen eighties made a commitment\nTo eradicate polio so at that point in time it's hard for us in the United states thing about it I'm I'm old enough I'm sixty now and uh I had a friend that I knew in in middle school who had had polio and it's a it's a terrible disease and and back in the late eighties\nUm three hundred and fifty thousand people worldwide died\nBased on polio and countless others were were crippled and um and so a rotary made a commitment late Nineteen eighties and since that point in time we've contributed a billions of dollars and we'd immunized to point seven billion children ... billion July\nAnd we are this close my fingers to get ahead ant really see him but I was like yeah we had there were seven teen cases\nIn the world last year Seventeen and they're all into countries there in Pakistan and Afghanistan ... uh but uh but was the bill Gates Foundation has gotten involved and given a lot of money working with us as well and uh it would be the second disease in history of the world\nBeing the first to be eradicated so serene\nRotary that's our main mission is to make sure that happens and once they are no cases we have to go three years without there being a case to say that the polio is racket yeah so I mean you can donate to the Rotary Club of Tucson we do things locally and rotary has a club based organization that has clubs everywhere\nBut we also are an international organization that tackles a tough issues so\nThere's a lot of talk okay if polio is is not your what's our next thing we're doing\nThat is true because you always have to be one step at a game where they had and\nIt looks like that might be water so for instance the er very rats and who is the\nThe the president of the international Rotary Club a and made a commitment this year in Toronto that um\nWe're going to focus on eradicating or or or or or or basically delivering freshwater hot water to everybody in Haiti\nSo any country has been really in ... was world but he made a commitment this year there that within a a window of time we're going to have a water for everybody in the country of Oman down if not all that other big problems and other places but I\nJust want to mention real quick jumping back to polio and and I'll have to defer to you because I I Know that you will recall a little bit more of the history and the type of uh funds that had been raised as a result of wrote ... becoming involved a in eradicating it\nDue to the Tour de Tucson is I saw there was one of our um members he subsequently had passed away some years ago\nUm but be became involved as far as what the tour to Tucson and so we have many people well\nThe president of rotary international became involved and it just has totally taken it to a different level so maybe if you might want to just touch on that as well\nAbsolutely so I'm Mike Harris who was a member of a a ... job is in town and his wife Charlotte Harris is an art club Mike started is a great great guy who passed away a number of years ago here about five years ago six years ago I think\nUh but um through that affiliation with el ... to Tucson I think forty two million dollars locally has been raised\nJust through that to support the polio eradication last year the number was about twelve million dollars in part of that is because John Hugo the international chairman of rotary international him he's a big bike rider mad so I mean where we get sponsored by people I think he get sponsored by countries\nRight anyway [laughter] he's all guys from one match\nWith the gates foundation um but but you know deterred from rotary international local our club now we're up to two hundred and forty four members and it's the largest Rotary Club in the state of Arizona where the the sixty third largest Rotary Club in the world out of thirty six thousand clubs\nAnd um we do a lot locally but are seen as your event is the main thing but we do everything from salvation bell ringing to working with the the circle why\nUh on their triangle why camp to working with the boy scouts up on Mount Lemmon or to do in a you know community food drives and working at the community uh food food bank and so we work in a lot of different ways locally\nUh and we're blessed to have a great organization and great members that allow us to do something like the Tucson classics car show and I make a difference in this community and to be able to give back one point two million through that were to organize and worked with you know an alternative Tucson and that is now the largest fundraising for ... that they've ever done\nThrough this is Adam linked to polio so yeah and and the Rotary Club well gentleman\nTwelfth Daniel Tucson classics car sales Saturday October twentieth ten AM to for the Gregory school for more information Tucson classics car show dot com\nAnd I want to thank you so much for everything that you do for our community and thank you for to all the members and get involved and go to the Tucson classics car show and give back\nThank you so much this has been great it's been great to be here yes thank you we really appreciate the opportunity and I'll see the car show awesome and Melissa before uh before I go I just want to say and thank you to your station here we get great support from all the media stations but I heart is terrific and supporting us with all the communications about the car shall we really appreciate it\nFrom the Rotary Club the Tucson we'd like to think Bruce Jacobson checks all year for coming in today I'm Melissa\nAnd remember the talk of Tucson can be heard every week on this station you can also listen to a pod cast of this program at heart radio dot com or by downloading the free app to your smartphone or tablet and searching for talk of Tucson joined us again next weekend for another tack of Tucson on this I hurt radio station\nLow IQ we can help you with that problem and as the aims of the two sons most\nReaders will studio your local and regional dot com is going to see him some high art radio station [noise]\nTo the bottom of it I'm Pam who sales Fox News that's why President Trump is promising when it comes to the fate of missing journalist Washington Post contributor to mark ... hasn't been seen since entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October second\nMedal of honor and you go to their website medals of honor dot com I Believe it is trust and can you just triple quadruple confirm that uh and and the caption of their website says honor he'll connect\nThrough and difference sports and fitness it's a national awareness campaign to honor fall and military and their families is that right medal of honor dot org dot org see there you go that's why ... ... all that stuff right up and so\nAn uh a gal and her husband they put together an organization\nAnd it's really about honoring those remembering those people who gave the ultimate sacrifice\nAnd it's all about healing as well you know it's one thing to hear about as a numbers that yes a number of troops have been lost or a helicopter went down and eight or ten lives American Soldiers were lost\nBut when you can connect\nWith an actual name of somebody\nThat really gives credence to the value of their life and what they did\nTo give it all for your freedom and for my freedom so medal of honor\nDot ORG go to that website and so the ... the founder of this organization a gal and her husband her name is Amy caught a I Believe or code SCOTT a it's probably pronounced quota [noise]\nShe began running in combat boots in two thousand eleven after her then Eighteen year old son left for the marine corps boot camp\nAfter competing in endurance event wearing boots Amy discovered it could be a way to honor our fallen military and showing their families\nThat they're not alone so their mission statement reads as follows honor our fallen military and their families they leave behind through and Durant sports and special events in order to help heal the visible and the invisible wounds of war for for both surviving family members\nAnd veterans and so how do they come up with a name medals of honor it was named for the symbolic act of sacrificing ones endure ins or sports participation metal in honor and memory of a fallen service member who paid the ultimate price for our freedom\nMission first their philosophy our mission and those we serve is our number one priority do no harm this is interesting they say we don't want your money we want your metal and your participation so go to that website medals of honor dot org\nAnd I want to read just a little caption here I thought this was very fascinating as I scroll through the pages here as a way to remember\nAnd it says here our biggest fear as a gold star family is that our son Ben will be forgotten having had someone race in memory of him was very healing to our family to us it signified that ... others appreciated his service and he was just not another number\nAnother name and not only help keep his memory alive but truly honor the sacrifice he made for our country\nI Know he would have been so proud and this is from Brenda gearheart proud gold star mom of lieutenant corporal Benjamin age gearheart who gave his life so\nThe more the more you read the more you know the more you find out about these organizations who are making a difference in the hearts and the lives of people who\nFor our freedom lay down their lives so we applaud that organization today for all that they are doing\nIt's our commitment as well are are we making that ultimate sacrifice no we can't even come close or even fathom what that's like but we maybe have a a small taste of that each and every day at more where we sometimes have to ask the really difficult questions we have to bring people face to face with what they're doing with their finances\nAnd how they can make it through a world that we think is going to become more time passed us and\nA harder when it comes to where we're going economically some of the things that we are doing and this is exciting for us to share is or the book the power of zero\nAnd uh I was talking to somebody earlier earlier you know when a zero good will zero good zero is good in situations where hey I paid zero in federal income tax write trust and that would that would be pretty exciting\nRight I paid zero I paid zero in state tax or hey I bought something I bought mark one of those ... that you have been talking about for the last couple of years and gosh darn there was no cost there was no fee there was no spread it was\nFree I gave them my money and all that money went right to work in fact they gave me a bonus for giving them money so when is zero good you know that's always fun to talk about but\nWhat's been very exciting for us and we just found this out last week in fact I was privileged to watch the documentary version of the book the power of zero\nAuthor David make night had partnered with a a a director and they'd be actually I I Believe the the director actually came to him and said we need to make your book into a movie and so what they did it's about Seventy five minutes is a documentary we are going to be hosting\nThis movie in theaters in around the Tucson area\nOf amber in December we're just now getting all of that together but we will certainly be talking about it on the show because after watching it\nNow we've been saying this for many many a moon but the financial sooner army is coming and so the movie talks too noble laureates economic\nProfessors people with PHD's people that have all these credentials after their names the people who are in\nThe know as to where we're going as an economy\nAnd what this means to our kids and our grandkids so this movie is very riveting it will bring you in some instances\nTo tears not so much from sadness but probably in anger\nAs to what Congress has failed to do for the last twenty thirty forty years where it's really been all about them\nAnd not about where we are going as an economy so the power of zero has been made into a movie and we will be telling you giving you more details over the ensuing weeks and months as we roll this out we're going to also be getting\nIt in Blu ray DVD form so you'll be able to check them out like a library book be able to come to our office watch it on your own terms give you about a week or so to do that then return 'em that movie to us\n[noise] probably give you a bag of popcorn to pop as well you know do something you have some fun with this but the point is and we're going to be talking about this today at great length is probably going to continue on to next week but here's a little here's a little trivia\nAs suggests we're we're going as an economy folks if you did not know this the number that the congressional budget office throws out there\nIn terms of our national debt they say it's Trump twenty\nTrillion dollars so trust in my faithful man behind the bullet proof\nGlass over there I I like to have you do a little have a little fun here with me if you you can ... part three is where you're going to be jumping in answering this but what's a uh a million dollars if you had a dollar and perhaps you use a listener you've heard this before but\nJust bear with me and uh we'll going to go through this have you had a dollar every second that you were spending how long would it take you to reach a million dollars well the answer is\nEleven days so a dollar a second you'd reach a million dollars in eleven days to reach a billion dollars you spend a dollar a second how long would it take you to get to a billion dollars thirty two years\nSo you wouldn't you wouldn't think that you go by eleven days yeah you know maybe a couple of years or thirty two years but here's the real staggering one person I Want you to jump in on this and I'm going to give you a clue be totally outrageous with may be totally beyond the ... the scope of what you would even think rationally\nTo get to a trillion dollars a dollar a second how long would it take you I Want to guess probably around thirty two thousand days dude you're off for years here yeah how did you know that well simple math\nThirty two days oh my ... you know what I was in ... you had or you have changed my opinion of all the millennials are you are\nIncredibly smart trash bin you are absolutely right a dollar a second how long would it take you to get to a trillion dollars thirty two thousand years\nThe government says we're ... trillion in debt truth be told we're a hundred and twenty trillion in debt\nI'm looking at the U.S debt clock that or are you getting ... you know it but that's wrong because they're they're not doing present day evaluation for Social Security Medicare Medicaid unfunded liabilities that's what they're\nMissing and so the question is to you the listener if this is true which I Believe it is true and this movie says it it's true and this is where I get really passionate what are you going to do about it how can you save\nFox News I'm Karen McHugh President Trump tells CBS or sixty minutes Saudi Arabia will be held responsible if they were involved in the disappearance of journalists ...\nThere's a lot at stake and [noise] maybe especially so because this man was a reporter there's something really terrible and disgusting about that if that were the case so we're gonna have to see\nWhat's going to get to the bottom of it and they will be severe punish\nCourtesy Fox and friends ... disappeared in Turkey was last seen October second Florida Georgia ravaged by hurricane Michael we'll get a visit from the

have regular so maybe I Need to switch all to do\nI don't know but you can tell we're excited about this it's an opportunity for us\nIf you listen to the first portion of our show to make a difference in your life is is votes this is not a popular message it's certainly not popular when it comes to being a politician and trying to get reelected when you when you're going to tell your constituency you know one as a government are we really need to tighten the belt we need to cut back on this when you to come back on that we need to\nReduce benefits on Medicaid uh you don't want him for ... you realize one in four Americans are on Medicaid right now\nIn New York City alone one and three see the Math Doesn't why we have to tighten our belts but a Congress refuses to do that because it's not popular it's called gridlock they're not going to do this\nSo as I said earlier the biggest threat to our national security is our national debt\nAnd this and and the numbers are scary but again back to Congress they're not going to you're not going to hear your local politician or or ... senators representatives say look we are going to go in and a reduced Social Security we're going to do this we're gonna do it at the end it's not popular it doesn't get them re elected well you know what medical hogwash with our [laughter]\nOur elected officials it really is as I said in the beginning of the show it's about\nYou it's about you and it's about your kids and your grandkids and as David Walker talks about in the movie\nThe power is zero that this is morally unacceptable what our government has done and continue to do\nAnd you know what in two years our deficit is going to be a trillion dollars and what does that mean it means that worked at we're taking in a trillion less than while we're standing look if we ran our household like the government runs there's we'd be bankrupt right and so this is happening\nThey say that just the interest costs on the national debt debt will cost more than what we're spending on the military\nAgain the numbers don't lie and you go to yes you go to what a tourist and pulled up us debt clock dot org and talk about sobering there yeah that's really scary so what the what the economists look at they look at what we call the debt to GDP ratio and GDP is uh the gross domestic product\nOr they look at the deficit to the GDP ratio\nSo what are they saying that the experts are saying again experts they're not politicians to the people who are in the no say we have a crisis on our hands because what is the government doing there they are renting\nThis money thing about when you go to the store and you put money on a credit card you're renting that money right but at some point\n... you you got the first answer right so at some point when you get your bill what do you have to do\nThat was hey yeah thank you this is really difficult this is like econ one oh one\nYou have to pay it exactly so we our mortgage you think about it we are mortgaging ourselves to foreign countries why is because foreign countries he used to be that we would want to buy us savings bonds because look we're we're helping the growth of America well now we have foreign countries coming in\nBuying our bonds and this could lead to a crisis as well what we call the sovereign debt crisis so we keep raising this thing called the debt ceiling\nAnd we cut taxes so think about that we're raising how much we're renting how much debt we want to create and at the same time cutting taxes isn't that a\nOf a formula for failure I Would contend yes it is so what does the government do all their solution is uh get those printing presses started ... return to their the printing their print they're printing money so it's something called the fiscal gap you can read about it you can Google it\nTwenty trillion know try to hundred trillion dollars and it's growing this fiscal gap folks is growing at a rate of six trillion dollars a year\nThey say we can solve this if we have the GDP grows up between ten and Fifteen Percent a year well right now they're applauding our government Trump whoever if we grow at three percent well they say in order for us to solve this problem and needs to grow between ten and Fifteen\nPercent is that realistic I Would say no ten to Fifteen Percent growth no that's not going to happen\nSo we have to dramatically increase revenue again that would be through that ten to Fifteen Percent we have to cut spending which that makes sense and we have to increase tax rates and as I said this is not politically\nThe way people want to go but it's the hard and fast facts that yes we have\nTo do this so\nWe talk about numbers we talked about different things you know there are people out there that are Sam artifice is hogwash isn't isn't going to happen but we have folks I my contention is we have the next eight years to do something\nAnd I want you to just now if you have yet to call us because time flies trust and what was a little comment you made before we went on the show today about global warming tell our listening audience about that well we don't do something in the next\nUh twelve years climatologists are saying that we need to do something about global warming and twelve years or else it's going to be the worst ...\nYes horrific everything's going to happen the melting ice caps the the decline of the seashore is the ... all of that right the humpback whale or whatever\nWell the same message holds true for economically and I use this word a lot today contention my contention is it's going to be all that that's going to be more of a crisis than global warming\nBecause\nI don't think there's really a solution to global warming everybody stops driving everybody starts stopped breathing everybody stopped eating ... that was all the ... well that's not going to happen\nYou know this whole carbon thing is that really ... what what can we do but you can make an impact on this kind of stuff so we have folks we have eight years for you to make a difference to pay the taxes the day when they are historically low\nAnd then put that money in the vehicles that will never ever ever ever ever that's for Evers require income taxation on that money ever again you know there are people that are saying oh we need to have guaranteed income for all Americans\nWe ran the numbers trust you could probably do this in your head you are a math whiz or a mad guru ten thousand dollars per person would be\nThree point four trillion dollars where are we going to come up with that money if everybody said oh we you know health care free for all the let's wipe away all the student debt let's do this let's do that well look folks the current budget of the U.S government is currently around four point two trillion dollars that's the current budget so what's the deficit\nThe deficit is we're not bringing we're bringing in a million less than a trillion I'm Sorry we are bringing in a trillion lesson that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Smart Money Moves by Moore Financial Strategies", "city": "Tucson", "day": "13"}
