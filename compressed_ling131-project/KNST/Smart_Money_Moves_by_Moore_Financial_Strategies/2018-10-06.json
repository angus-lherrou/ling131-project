Lopez saying you know I think I'm gonna maybe interested in buying buying this hotel you and I kind of wanted to he gathered about nine different nonprofit ... and said what are you guys think about you know this concept of having an idea\nWell because I'd been doing hope fast for so long and because this is kind of been in my heart you know I was just overwhelmed I'm just like yes let's do it right and everybody else was a little hesitant and just saying oh it's a big project who's going to manage it who's going to do it right and a magic\nJust to run you know the facility I mean it's a big hotel is a job you\nKnow it's a total of a hundred and forty thousand square wow so it has a two hundred and fifty hotel room tower in addition to fifty one one bedroom suite\nUm twelve thousand square feet of ballroom space huge ... one of the premier you know conference hotels and she's on before all the resorts were built right\nUm so anyway um so back to the story or the next phone call we got from him he's just like you know what I bought the hotel and this is what we're going to do and\nSo we were kind of you know full steam ahead you know I kind of describe it to everybody is you know we've been on a bullet train ever since that so um so he got in touch with gospel rescue mission and he had been a longtime donor of gospel rescue mission was familiar with the work that they do\nAnd said you know I Want you to be there with shelter services\nAnd also somebody needed needs to manage the ... or so um so would you also take on the management of the support organizations that are going to be there so I'm so I'm also a part a gospel rescue mission so we said yes we'll do that\nVery happily and um and so that kind of started the journey right um\nWe kicked off the capital campaign 'cause the building is kind of move in ready but we need to make improvements ... building so we kicked off the capital campaign in April of four and a half million dollars and we're already kind of halfway through that so that's going well\nUm so the plan is to have um like I said three hundred and fifty shelter beds available\nFor men and women and women with children some specialty shelter services that nobody in town has like a people with service dogs um respite beds there's so many shelter\nIn town then people show up straight from the hospital that\nAre still in their hospitals and nobody can take them because they still need some kind of medical care so we'll have those beds available in so many different other things will partner together with a\nA kennel that um people that come with with dogs I hadn't actually kennel there pat ... or\nSo we're kind of thinking outside the box them really are really making it um accessible as of right now we already have thirty different organizations that are signed up to do services okay I'm their G.

time of need and we have some precautions you know obviously we don't want anybody to abuse the system I'm so they get a wristband when people come in and the tabs are taken off the wrist bands you know for the services that they've already received\nSo we do have some kind of checks and balances people wonder about that and ... and um and you know so far twenty seven years I mean it's been a

all confirmation vote on Pam who sale Fox News crowds of protesters were on Capitol Hill as the Senate prepares for a final vote on Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination what makes today different is that most demonstrators will be kept outside the only way for\nWho are wheelchair bound and who are dependent upon others to help them and so I asked the question I said Bob at what point did you realize that you had to surrender\nSo that you would then allow other people to help you because you cannot feed yourself you can't shave you can't base\nYou can't do any you are one hundred percent dependent upon people he said mark that was probably one of the hardest days in my life emotionally because I realized that as a guy where the provider where's the protector\nWhere uh where our family hero and I had to now release and surrendered that position to others who now I'm at their mercy\nThey need to help me and everything that I Do and he started tearing up and I as did I was a very emotional we were there about three hours very emotional\nTime and just as\nPresidential or as serendipitous as it was the doctor who was responsible for putting this whole organization\nTogether across the country just happen to show up\nAnd we used my brother and I spend about forty five minutes talking with him and interviewing him and again this is going to going to be in an upcoming show that we're doing uh probably over these airwaves but\nHe had just lost his wife a couple of months ago and so this organization here he was one who founded and heads it up and spearhead things all across the country\nIs is so much a part of his life had not been for this\nHis wife was going to be emotionally drastically altered so\nI say all that to say this let's put everything in perspective here when we left everybody was high fiving us and shaking our hands and smiling from cheek the cheek and they were all in wheelchairs yet they have\nOf the the perspective of you know what there are other people that perhaps are and worst positions than I Am and wow my life\nWill never ever be the same after that interview where we again we spent three hours there and so I wanted to salute to those individuals at the Sacramento the greater Sacramento multiple sclerosis achievements Center for changing my life\nImpacted my life in such a way where it will never be the same I Want to read I Want to read you something\nPerhaps you're struggling with your lot in life I'm Wondering where you're at and what life is all about what's at all about how the an okay Allen sing that song interest in going thank goodness I Want to read something here and uh\nIt's something I pulled out of my my files I thought this was really interesting it says that the heart of working men and women everywhere is the longing the often forgotten and sadly disparity of to participate in something greater than themselves to belong to a cause that is meaningful\nAnd to share in a legacy that indoors and that certainly speaks\nTo the point of the multiple sclerosis achievement center\nIn order to achieve personal mastery one must first achieve clarity and to achieve clarity most often requires an outside influence someone who can pull you out of yourself so that you can more readily see yourself\nSomeone who can challenge their assumptions your belief the habits that determine what you do in reaction to what happens to you the opinion to hold the walls you set up to keep your life comfortable\nOn threatened unchallenged is that you\nAnd then finally there is a book called the strange life\nOf Ivan ... and the author says that reincarnation is not what we have been led to think it is that we are not reborn as someone else but rather that we were reborn to relive exactly the same life we've lived over and over again\nUntil we make a significant choice to do something different than we've done life afterlife so in order for things to change you\nMust change first then that said ways right into what we do it more financial strategies perhaps you're listening to the shows they mark what in the world\nDoes all this has to do with retirement planning it has to do with what we talked about oh probably a month ago where I made the comment that some people almost picked up the phone and called us some individuals almost\nCompleted the application process when we show them that this was a great strategy they almost had a plan put together by the professionals at more financial strategy to say almost\nDid it but you know what they never did so in order for things to change you must change you must pick up the phone you must say today is the day\nThings are going to change financially for me and my family\nI'm going to draw the line in the Santa going to pick up the phone Mark's been talking about having the ideal planned for many months many moon many a year\nNow is the time\nAnd some folks I can relate we all have things in our lives where we look back and

eats keeps talking about having a road map that smart money master plan boy I'm just I've had it up here I Need to do something\nWell that would be face to you're just fed up you're ready but you're
