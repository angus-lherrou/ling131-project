{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KNST", "content": "People donate clothing to us that helps us get kids on bikes so if a kid joined the team you don't have to have anything it helps kids can come from any background and here's three pairs of shorts and three shirts and young lady and you can ride a bike right\nAnd um if they'll the clothing that people donate to us doesn't work for us we sell it at the swap meet but then you're selling five dollar jerseys ten dollar shorts right that you could never get anywhere else that are probably lightly used and totally good condition the kind of spreads all of a little bit\nYou'd probably get a lot of homeless donate as well right helmets\nYeah how much does and then you gotta be careful because if you crash and once they're done right and so that's a big it's\nA big deal donate like because I'm not I don't know anything about bicycling but do people like are there certain types of shoes that are encouraged to to where when biking or going to be just whatever you want to live\nSo they're very fancy all kinds of different oh they're all ... and ... and I wear my toes and my Congress you can wear whatever you want and\nThat's the beauty of a bicycle right but ah as you progress yeah there's advantages but uh we always start kids off on flat pedals your normal shoes sort of thing and then they might progressed to clip the titles sort of thing\nAnd speaking of progressing so you watch kids you've been doing this ... been around for Fifteen Years you've been watching kids kind of grow up yeah throughout Tucson so now you have these adult yeah we're in when you founded al ... have you seen them still be into by bike riding or coming back to the organization to give back\nWell funny you ask because half of my Thirteen people on staff or alumni right so the kids that came to the program they get it they know what it is they know what it means to be impacted by a quality men during their life\nAnd that's really what it's about right people who care um and help them stay on the right path now they're doing that for the next generation so it's amazing right um I've got alumni who volunteer ah I've got alumni on the board I've got you know just alumni all over the place and so it's a really good feeling\nAnd this all started again and you're in your backyard yeah I mean isn't that kind of cool to see something in infancy stage just grow to where it's at right now and you're still could still young it it's going to have all plenty over the years Willie ... and your husband is involved in it as well rats\nYeah so yeah so he's the head coach of hey I'll group a and I'm more\nOf like the program director right and so it's exciting you know we we've already surpassed what our vision maybe may have been when we were you know twenty five years old and like let's ride bikes with kids and now it's just this wonderful community entity that continues to grow and\nAnd change him talking with Ben yellowish co founder and executive director of a group I mean this is what I'm looking at your ... we have a nine year old idea of an excuse the coolest bike ride right now [laughter]\nHe's pretty your ad and right and\nSo he is don't tell anybody but ah he's not old enough to ride with email group of but he's certainly strong enough so he rides and the ... group of chemo group with high schoolers I was just where his ability is is kind of grown up on\nA bike I mean obviously yeah and the nature of his parents absolutely no break down a little bit so there is ... what's the age range of that and then what are the kind of an age ranges beyond yeah as a team\nOf group is roughly twelve to Eighteen so your upper middle school high school age kids boys and girls um\nRepeat though is seven to Thirteen noble element upper elementary and ah and lower middle school and then uh we just started group pet do um because we didn't have enough going on but uh we\nWe recognize that there were kids that don't gravitate towards the competitive side of cycling and and still wanted to have goals studying so their focus um and this is more than that twelve to Fifteen year old their focus is bike packing which does\nCamping on your bicycle so bike touring but now with new technology you can do everything on mountain bike so he just won their first trip uh last weekend and they rode from the clubhouse downtown two colossal cave I'm far but they did it mostly on dirt\nAnd Thirteen miles a single track and they carry their tent and they're sleeping bag and they're closing their food in their ... cooking gear and camped out there and then wrote back the next day so we're we're looking and really excited to do a lot more of that\nAnd that's like such a foundational memory that they'll carry with them for forever absolutely absolutely and it was all of this we have to talk about safety a little bit yeah you're riding a bike you got your helmet on on the streets you know there's enough at risk with potholes in traffic but also a mountain biking you can get seriously hurt how are you keeping these kids safe\nYeah well I mean we focus on skills skills skills right so it's about not taking a kid to something and they're not ready for they've practice these skills over and over and over again right and then we've got qualified you know staff and volunteer coaches they go out we have at least the one to five ratio of adults to kids\nOn um teenage group known as they get younger we that ratio goes up so we go one to two one two three and repeat so um we're always looking for more quality volunteers ... help a service mentors and assist the main coaches especially with mountain bike skills so people are out there were looking for um\nDo I bet you are absolutely well you know speaking of like we were kids coming in and speaking of diversity and all that where are you seeing like demographic wise what parts of town and where are you seeing the most out you know with the gravitate towards a group of ... where they coming from what parts of town\nA lot of our growth has been word of mouth and so um what we've tried to do over the years is be intentional or about diversity and where we're doing outreach so I mentioned the ... bike club that's intentional it's down the street from us is west side barrio Hollywood right these are target audience kids that like should be ride and\nSchool and we want to have now that we exist and so we targeted there we've done a lot of work with the boys and Girls Club we've done a lot of girls empowerment workshops with those girls are again west side stuff just down the street from us I'm the outreach that we do we try to make sure that we're working with kids that wouldn't otherwise have opportunity so that\nYou get kids from all sides of town but we're also really working to attract kids wouldn't otherwise no\nNot in that specific region to so it's like bike friendly in that area actually\nYeah and so one of the cool things that we've been all over the last year is partnerships with a ...\nCommunities of refugee families um and so we've got an apartment complex on the left side just a mile and a half from us that we pick up kids from their highly complex and take them back to participate and repeat though this summer by camp we had each week we were going to different locations are picking up kids it really wouldn't be able to get to us otherwise\nAnd with these kids you're doing this you keep saying goal setting goals set a goal setting are you timing these kids are the ones that are trying to be competitive to teach them how to increase their time or how are you what are the goal studying what are the goals what are the ones that look like\nWell it it's a conversation with kids about what their goals are a lot of times it's about I Want to be able to master that set of stairs over there and so I'm going to work towards my skills to ride down the stairs or up the stairs and you do that in a controlled environment you go out in the mountain bike trail and you can get over those rocks right\nSo it's less about time and like ... place you getting anything it's always about what am I gaining personally from it and how do I you know learn how to apply that to the rest of my life\nAnd false positives round the corner of it is around ... it's coming up here yeah I mean the event is on October twenty eight which is a Sunday starts at seven thirty in the morning but I Do about eleven and get some good food it sounds like in between and after\nAnd if you start if you want to do the shorter distance that's fun thirty five distance you do not have to be there at seven thirty you can roll out at nine thirty mile wide and do it [laughter] so we got started times for people again it's not a mass star it's about enjoying riding bikes with your friends meeting new people and riding with kids in the program\nThat's really cool it costs about a hundred twenty five dollars for Iraq\nAnd that includes your lunch thank you slide by include the T shirt event T shirt a beer at the end when she bang beyond bread offers coffee and seats in the morning and yeah we there's no there's no we're not shy on food or drink at all\nIn our own like no no are you ... are you particular about what bike bring to ride during ... no I I mean ...\nStrain on on you know bring your own

until the end and so if you have yet to experience the more difference please do give us a call two nine six four four six four to nine six four four six four\nWell I only have twenty two minutes twenty two and a half minutes to tell you so much that probably ... hours and hours and hours of stuff here but you know part of what we do I talked to before the the little break about life insurance and annuities and\nLong term care and so forth many people look at what we do and they try and they trying couch it in the environment of an investment\nThey say Well Mark why would I put money into a whole life insurance policy when I could take those same dollars and put those into the market\nYou know that's a really good observation that's a great question or why would they take those same dollars and put them into an annuity when I could put them\nInto something else where I could earn more money and the reality is you know what you really need to stop applying I'm going to be gentle here you need to stop applying gentle mark okay you need to stop applying the investment mentality to a risk transfer instrument\nYou to to give you peace of mind to let you know that what we just mentioned the things I just kinda rattle off the life insurance long term care\nAnd annuities they are primarily risk transfer devices risk transfer instrument they are not investments look\nYou'll you'll probably all agree that we ensure our homes our automobiles because their last would be difficult right it would be a um unanticipated hardship on us\nBut do you the listener when you\nSend those premium dollars into cover the car and the auto or your things like your cell phone or think about when you go buy tires you'll buy insurance in case\nYou get an era terrible\nThe damage to your tired your sample of yeah I pay for all that stuff because their loss would create some type of a hardship but do you expect a return on investment for those premium dollars that you put towards those instruments\nWill typically know\nThirty forty fifty years go by even making that\nHomeowners insurance payment for the case you're fired case you fire and keep your house gets burned down or there's water damage and you never ever had a claim you don't think to yourself wow I Wonder if they're going to send me a check with interest for all that money I invested in those things well we don't think that way so what what\nMy encouragement to you today is don't look at what we do necessarily as can I make money now I'm going to tell you out of the other side of my mouth\nThat if you purchased the right type of life insurance and you manage it actively like you do other investments so if if it if it's properly structure and actively managed like other things you have in many ways it can look and feel and smell and pass a taste test when it comes to is this an investment\nWell life insurance can be many things it's it's like what we call the Swiss army knife of different instruments that are out there in the marketplace yes at the end of the day if somebody passes away which we've had four or five upwards of ten people pass away this year so far\nIt acts like it should act and that is it pays a death benefit and you know not one\nTime not one time ever and I've been doing this almost twenty five years has anybody ever asked me Mart I got this death benefit check what was the rate of return on all the premiums that my husband or my my wife spent on this nobody's ever asked me that\nThey've always asked me are we going to be okay is this enough what do we do with this money now this is my spouse in spend double form how do I make sure I protect is moving forward that's what they always ask 'cause they don't ask if they don't sit Denmark and you run a quick calculation as the the rate of return\nOn the premium dollars spent and now the death benefit nobody's ever asked me that\nSo when you look at the things that we do it more financial when we engage with you and we have that very real ... robust conversation about permanent life insurance and again I go back to what I said the very beginning of the show I put our reputation\nOur longevity at risk here by talking about the things that very few other advisers certainly over the airwaves talk about let alone in their office when it comes to properly positioning life insurance\nAcid base long term care coverages and annuities in the light of you either living too long passing away too soon ending up in a facility\nOr some type\nRates of return all of a sudden do become that important what does become important or things like am I going to be OK is my family going to be\nOkay because life happens and you want\nTo make sure you have done the very best job possible when it comes to ensuring your life there are many people will say now mark you look I've heard this a whole life insurance I shouldn't ... I've heard bad things about it I Googled it it says it's a lousy investment it's a horrible well what I say about ten minutes ago was", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Smart Money Moves by Moore Financial Strategies", "city": "Tucson", "day": "20"}
