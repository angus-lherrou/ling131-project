{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KNST", "content": "So again you get to go out have a good time as some food has some drinks and do some dancing a and at the same time really showed the military\nHow much you appreciate that is I mean again 'cause we would not be able to Juba jeopardy microphones say the things that I say that make people love me like your love but also at the same time hate me you don't get that and it's okay All right or to the gate a but it's a great job without the military actually fighting for our freedom um we wouldn't have this stuff we wouldn't have this stuff\nThan they did you know that relationship with the military and the YMCA goes back all the way to the civil war I was going to ask\nAbout that how how long have these are really\nIt's over a hundred and fifty years at the Y. is been involved with our nation's military in fact the\nThe YMCA was one of the key part there is to start to us so in the United services organization or that are of course is entertained the military for years and years or a as a or active duty military been deployed overseas and so a lot of that uh\nUh began with the YMCA\nDo you get any any people coming up to you any not military families talking about how much this is actually help them oh you have to get you can you share any any story\nSo um I can uh especially with a much San Antonio experience okay 'cause uh uh ... as a shared a are geared to that I'm prior to coming to serve this community a\nI'm a half years ago in this position here I served actually the YMCA agree to San Antonio for eight years in a in a leadership position there as a cheap develop an officer for the wives\nUm we actually began um this great I'm a similar initiative ... at our YMCAs there in central Texas\nUm and that was a actually a during the early I'm a deployments that happened with the first Gulf mhm and so here we are uh almost Twenty years later\nBut I'm One of those stories that I still remember is being able to share with a family I'm the first time that um they could\nCome and be a part of our YMCA and that that we would covers the entire expense for them to be a part of that and I still remember Garrett or having a conversation with a youngster um who says that we can come for free ... and I still remember the look in their eyes\nOr as a day for the first time came into one of our YMCAs or in San Antonio and ah and ah got on the rock climbing wall and got a chance to be able to uh actually uh uh take advantage of\nThe great childcare facilities that we had there and uh uh just to see that kind of experience and be there Garret this pretty amazed\nLose the stress of knowing that a parent is is off keeping us safe and they're gonna be gone for a year I again I I Can't even I Can't even imagine what that is with that is actually like and then on top that I mean\nIf I ever work event in my wife is staying with the kids are she as something and I have to stay home we get overwhelmed one nights let alone a whole year so it's a big help to the parents and that the the mom or the dad that is still home 'cause you gotta you gotta do things with the kids\nAnd we can't forget that we've got a great a military facilities here or in our local community so Davis mountain Airforce base or a a which we have several branches of the military who serve and who are represented there\nIs a great asset in resource to this community is and uh and it has a tremendous economic impact here\nOr that increases the opportunity for us even as a community\nOr to be able to have great living wage jobs yes and have a great opportunity to be able to stay connected with our military and for Tucson or that's extremely important\nYes it really is I by the way again this is talk of Tucson I'm Garrett Lewis I was the morning show in ... seven Ninety\nWe're here with Tony pen president and CEO of the United way talking about the military ball which will be on and those that pretense at the DCCC you can get tickets the day of lock up where you can plan in advance good at Tucson YMCA dot org slash events\nTo to get the tickets are getting eight people at the table this ceremony up front then there's dinner there's dancing there's there's all kinds of great stuff I'm a great music some rivalries going on between the branch in the military and there's going to be more there as well um you you're expecting over nine hundred people yes\nWorld War two vets is Korean War vets yes Holocaust survivor is yes this is history it is I mean this is humanity right there in the flesh it is that's incredible stuff\nThat is so uh and so uh this is a multigenerational\nEvent also to uh Garrett and that's what's also another thing that's great about that\nOr is that I'm I'm as I've shared with you or my service in the military was uh\nI'm almost forty years ago now\nBut ah do you think about the fact that the ... the ... people right here in our community whose service goes back to uh to be a dumb um and we all know that I'm One of the things that uh we continue to ah try to make up for is the\nThe fact that our Vietnam vets didn't receive the kind of recognition they should have yup often times and and so here's a opportunity to do a little makeup Tucson southern Arizona\nBut also going back to the Korean War and and as we know are there are very very few of those uh veterans who are left who served in the in the world war two imagined being able to sit at a table but we do have a we do have some uh right here\nLike imagine being able to sit at that table and talk to these heroes as that were that that that fought in World War two even the Korean War because I mean it's amazing it's two thousand Eighteen I think the Korean War Vietnam not too long ago in his long time ago like you were saying I Can't it's amazing it's been almost Twenty years\nSince since since we started did you know the long wars in Afghanistan Iraq and I mean it really is incredible um ... again you can actually do this you can get\nA seats at a table and you can be sitting with\nAny of these veterans any of these service members ah from all different generations and and I you know just to hear the story of my my my grandfather one grandfather served in World War two another one of the Korean War skirt and uh yeah yeah God Bless them and and some of the ... they didn't like to talk about it a lot so\nUm but they did share certain therapists they did share certain things\nAre wars their business or ... or the ... the\nThing that I was very aware of when I hit by opportunity is or was that a a there is a actually some peace in strength yes\nI Do enjoy having a strong nations military or being able to defend it or any moment a can also be a um a something that helps to uh maintain the peace yes and that's what that's worth a strong military does for us here\nUm and certainly what are my service was all about was being able to make sure that we maintain that\nBut at the same time are willing to be able to uh make the ultimate sacrifice if necessary for my friends my family and my cup\nI cut from a different ... different collect the peace through strength built uh it it it is true so you have those the um\n[noise] these great veterans and military members in the top of the Holocaust survivors in which the stories and I've talked to several Holocaust survivors and while they're still here I mean it's just in it it it's heartbreaking and it's incredible just to hear these things we need to know that says\nI'm an advantage of living in Tucson and so then Arizona or the and I can see this year because I'm not old is your way a good partner with or or YMCA were also a good partner with the um our local or Jewish or getting\nA federation or when the uh local Jewish foundation and the and the\nThe day as you mentioned it does so we've got a very vibrant a Jewish community here\nUh and uh so it's an advantage for\nFor two so yep yep that we do\nAnd as you mentioned uh I'm there will be some people who will attend to see that a big and also I'm a share stories about why this freedom is so important Oh yes and why are being able to recognize\nOur

want them to have had a good night's sleep\nWe want the surgeon to not be drinking caffeinated coffee we want them to I'm kidding but we want them to be at their best and first responders\nThink about this they have that obligation inherently they're saying when we roll up on an accident a scene where there's chaos and people's lives are at stake whether you're a police officer an ambulance person an EMT a surgeon\nOr your fighting a war across the country in a in a different country they have to be at their very very best they have to be on cue and so I wanted to say thank you to those

may get a phone call he's been injured he's been hurt we don't want that but you know what when you stop and you think about it so do you think those individuals you see them just take a little five seconds out every day to say thank you to them\nAnd that's what we do it more financial I mean we don't ah you know we're not physically saving lives maybe emotionally and financially we are and

a gentleman come in last week and he said mark I heard your show and oh my goodness that's why we're here you you make sense you're talking about stuff that matters you know it's not talking about products or interest rates and you know we do eventually get to that whether it's on this show or in a meeting but the point is\nWhat's the message what's the truth well here's an article that says the nets crash will be worse than the great depression show of hands as to how many were alive during the great depression while there was nobody so many people think well how can I even relate to that\nWell you can because this is what the article says it says ten years ago it was too easy credit that brought financial markets to their knees today it could be a global debt folks are you sitting down global debt of two hundred and forty seven trillion\nYes trillion that causes the next crash after a decade of escalating us household debt brought on by low wages and the national debt more than doubling over the same time period to Twenty one trillion\nDebt could sued put the brakes on this economic recovery the analysts warn\nThis gentleman says we think the major economies are on the cost\nOf this turning into the worst recession we have seen in ten years this is what is happening I ran over these numbers last week they bear repeating us household debt of Thirteen point three trillion\nNow exceeds the two thousand and eight Pete\nStudent loans sky rocketed from six hundred and eleven billion to now today one point five trillion so they've doubled auto loans one point two

I'd rather be in Disneyland well yeah exactly I'd rather be in the happiest place on earth\nDisney Land\nYou know I had to bring this a couple of things before we talk about long term care and so forth but thanks again if you're a first time listener appreciate you listening a sticking with us through the break if you are a regular if you're one who's been with us from the very start thank you\nWe like to think that the show has its own kind of culture its own dynamic a way of presenting things and not to scare you but to warn yet and say look\nWe can talk about stuff that really doesn't matter in the long run or we can talk about stuff that really makes a difference you know I I'm a huge proponent of owning permanent life insurance I Am in fact I think one of the only ones certainly on the airwaves let alone\nWhen it comes to talking to people in the office about this I could be wrong on that second one but certainly over the airwaves nobody I I don't think is made the stance that we have made it more on why you want to own whole life insurance\nYeah there's that ... an index that equity indexed often there's term insurance and there is variable life and so forth but permanent whole life insurance\nWe recently delivered a death benefit check and I and I tell people look\nLife insurance is not an investment I don't know if I mentioned this last week or not trust and you can remind me or say Markey already talked about that\nBut nobody has ever asked me when I handed them a death benefit check I go here's a check for five hundred thousand dollars as we did recently nobody has ever asked me nor does did this this wife asked me what the internal rate of return was on the premiums that her husband is paid\nShe she didn't ask me that I've never had anybody asked me that Well Mark I'm trying to really now now that my husband has gone my wife has gone I'm trying to run some numbers to see if actually this was a good purchase\nLet me see premiums paid rate of return cost benefit analysis nobody's ever asked me that they are just so grateful there in tears they're hugging us are going you will never completely understand what this money is going to do and I you know in my heart of hearts on going all I Know exactly what it's going to do it just saved your family from financial ruin\nWhen everybody else is asking for money no of course I don't tell them that but when people are asking everybody else in the world now is asking for money I'm the one we're the ones delivering the tax free death benefit check and holding them and saying you're going to be okay financially\nYes you've just lost your significant other or whoever there is a grieving process but part of that you can now rest assured you now can have peace and confidence knowing that you're OK you are going to be just fine financially\nThat's what permanent whole life insurance does for a family it's not about rate of return now if people want to argue with that comment of will argue with me about what I just said happy to do that you know the really good companies that we work with\nHow does a five percent internal rate of return over the life of a policy sound Well Mark I can get well now this is tax free so you're going to have to add your bracket to that so are you earning between six and a half and seven percent\nIn something that I can guarantee you and I can show you the benefits and the thirty different attributes that a good whole life policy will bring to the table\nThat your other investments maybe have one or two benefits so I'm up for that challenge\nIf you are as well give me a call two nine six four four six four throw the gauntlet down there is there is a challenge that is the weekend challenge mark will go face to face with whatever you're currently in\nAnd I'll compared to permanent whole life insurance\nWhy can I make that claim think about that because I point nine percent of the time I win why\nBecause our planning revolves around the ... of life\nI was listening to an ad on a one of our local stations about another from here in town and they were just talking about rates of return and I go well that's really not a plan and I had a gentleman a actually a husband and wife come in and they and I said so where's your plan I said well here it is and they handed me a brokerage statement and I said well\nSo this is your plan yeah that's our financial advisor this is what he's doing I said well now we don't do wills and trust I I went through the whole gamut a checklist wheels and trust well he doesn't do that life insurance never talked about that disability coverage critical illness long term care we've never discuss any of that so I said\nHe's your financial planner so what we yeah I don't want to be like the politicians and so I'm not going to do that but what I'm going to say is\nWhat we do it more as we take that forty thousand foot view we will put together for you a fully integrated holistic\nComprehensive financial plan we will look at everything affect\nPrior to or even coming in a to do today show I had somebody call me can you believe at this time of day calling me hey I've got this stuff for yet tax returns current long term care policies when I look any happened that he actually stopped by the office I was there to hear upload this I did and I looked\nAt as long term care policy he just got a and this is a great great great company\nUntil I said you know you just gotta rate increase letter here thirty percent the premiums going up by thirty percent\nSo we can help him you know under she gets that so it's not about ready to return it's about do you have a fully integrated comprehensive\nHolistic plan put together so do you live too long die too soon we are the experts at covering the five boroughs of life death disability retirement\nLong term care I'm going to talk about that here and then as well as tax efficiency so he brought his returns as well so when we are done analyzing things we are going to save him a\nA bunch of money and put them in a much better position you know it's great to say yes they do a bunch of money but yeah look at the new the new benefits is like there will down to almost no he's going to walk away he and his wife are going to say oh my goodness you position does better and gave us more benefit for less money\nI go yeah isn't isn't that what we're supposed to be doing and more financial that's that's why we're in business we are here to put you in a better position to position you so when this stuff happens that were just talking about and I had this conversation with him there Bob and their heads of an ongoing yeah we got we got to be prepared for this and you do\nSo please give us a call two nine six four four
