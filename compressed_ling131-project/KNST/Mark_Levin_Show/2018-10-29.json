three one two three eight one one what's an honor to have the ambassador\nTo the United states from Israel with us unfortunately under these circumstances run drummer first I'd like your general take on or what has taken place here and secondly I Know you've been in Pittsburgh who did you meet with and what did you see there's there\nWhile it's you know a horrific act or worse than a Semitic attack and us history that climate eleven lives I I was in Pittsburgh yesterday\nThat to meet with are members of the community you got to meet with the mayor with the county executive\nI'm with Senator Casey was there we had a congressman Republicans and Democrats and talked to a lot of people I have to tell you mark it's a very very strong community and I think a special community and squirrel hill a Pittsburgh they're they're very very tight it\nIt's not just by it among the Jewish community but also the Dodgers community supporting them and I went for the event last night\nUh that really brought out the entire community faith leaders that Christians are Jewish faith leaders of most from leader who actually spoke there as well and spoke very well and uh I think the whole community is just trying to support 'em the Jewish community there and everyone told me the same thing we never thought it was going to happen here\nAnd I think they were just shocked and stuff on a and what I wanted to do with Israel's ambassador to the United states is just tell them that Israel stance with them that they're not alone\nAnd in Israel yesterday morning our government meets on Sunday 'cause some days like Monday Israel the first day of the week and the government meets every Sunday and there was a moment of silence for the entire\nGovernment of Israel ... because we are the one and only Jewish state so we feel a special sense of solidarity with Jewish communities around the world and that's why I was for me to be in Pittsburgh yesterday\nYou were born in Miami I just want people to know this you're born in Miami your father was the mayor of Miami your brother was the mayor Miami\nMiami Beach Miami Beach was about that yeah we're the ones with the speech that that's true um\nSo you know the United states very very well obviously you were an Israeli citizen and you are you\nVery close to the prime minister of Israel so when you look at this we see grueling anti Semitism throughout your him or the FBI put out a report to the latest report you see growing anti Semitism or hate crimes as I called in the United states what do you make of this\nOr we can ... it is as you say a growing problem or many people want to say that it began in two thousand sixteen with President Trump's election that's simply not true and you should look at the FBI statistics that you mentioned\nAh in two thousand fourteen and two thousand Fifteen\nA hate crimes against Jews accounted for over half of hate crimes against religious groups and the United states it was only two percent of the population mark and their\nAccounting for over half and by the way there were periods over the last Fifteen Years was about Seventy five percent of the number of uh\nUh attack the crimes against Jews were actually much bigger than I was in two thousand fourteen of two thousand Fifteen [noise] I really think what you have mark is is the rise of anti Semitism over the last couple of decades what you had was about a half century after the Holocaust\nWhere it was politically incorrect to attack choose\nAnd I think what you've seen happen over the last two decades\nIs that it once again become fashionable or to attack juice and it's no longer politically incorrect to go after Jews now most of the attacks actually hide themselves\nBehind the mask of hatred towards Israel to one and only Jewish state but at the singling out of Israel is very much like they used to single out the Jews for special treatment so I think you've seen this on the rise it's not just in America\nIt's all around the world you've seen attacks against Jews in Paris attacks against choosing ... attack against Jews in Copenhagen attacks against Jews in Brussels and in London and even in the United states uh this is not the first attack\nThere was an attack in two thousand six hundred you federation in Seattle\nWas an attack in two thousand fourteen Jewish community center a added outside of Kansas Kansas City which I think claim three lives and this is just the worst attack but this is a growing problem and I think one of the issues is social media\nBecause you know you can have a very very small fraction of the population that are these are you know these crazy I don't know if I'd call them crazy but evil people um you\nCould have a a one one hundredth of one percent could be thirty thousand Americans um and there's a stream is saying I can be people like David Duke it could be neo Nazis it could be white nationalist all sorts of people but online they can actually\nBuild communities of hate in a way that they couldn't do before so I think as you get more and more people going into social media as you have this rise of abuse online hate groups I think it's extremely dangerous Senate dangerous and it it has given\nThem a sense of community of haters and I think it's important to take action against that I Will tell you marketed in Israel\nWe monitor the Internet now we're a different country and you have constitutional protections here I Know that you're\nYou're a great defender of them we don't have a First Amendment Second Amendment Fourth Amendment but hopefully your law enforcement authorities can figure out a way within your in laws constitutional rights that Americans have to figure out a way to monitor this so they can see when sort of this kind of hate pops up\nAnd then be able to take action before the crime takes place that's what we have in Israel\nUm and it's been very effective at preventing a lot of these types of attacks I mean I Would love to believe that this was going to be the last attack but I think given that these all these haters are communicating with each other I ... I think it's important for your forties to see what they can do to\nNot just calling it when it's on the other side but calling it on your outside whether it's David Duke whether it was fair con wherever cops or it's not a college campus with people trying to think about Israel and the same and the human eyes is to make all these charges that Israel's apartheid state of racist state a perpetrator of Canada\nWhich I think triggers a lot of people put a level of hatred towards Israel but you don't see of any other country this demonization wherever it is people have to stand up to it and I think in protecting the terms I think they're going to be protecting\nAlright and bashing Iran drummer of Israel we appreciate your time God Bless them thank you sir thanks\n[noise] he's really good okay I've laid out he's laid it out any objective news organization should be ... but they're not going to cause they're not objective when they're really no news organizations anymore not many of them\nYou know falls officially here temperatures across the country are dropping certainly are where I live after a long summer of running your air condition the time is quickly approaching the start running your heater is temperatures Trump and most of the country\nThe national weather center saying the north and central part of the U.S will experience a cold or October than years passed now is the perfect time to consider servicing your system and replacing your age ... filters\nWe have the perfect company to help you make your life that much easier filter by dot com America's leading provider of H ... for homes and small businesses\nChoose for over six hundred sizes including custom options that ship free within twenty four hours plus they support working Americans manufacturing all their filters right here in America say five percent when\nYou subscribe pro auto replacement so you'll never forget to change your filters ever again filtered by will save you time money and help you breathe better that's filtered DUI dot com filtered by dot com and tell them more accent you\nLook we need to spend a lot of time on this election that's coming up too and we have approximately ten candidates that are coming on this program in the course of this week\nI Will also be doing an appearance on Hannity or at some point this week and we're going to commit my Sunday show to the pre election as well it's just way too important he's got some very very close races and what's at stake here is enormous\nAs I say it's Americanism versus socialism it really is for those of you really know what's Americanism versus progressive isn't to talk to you know the media in this country and they don't want to be called the enemy of the people there are certainly not the friend of the people gone long ago a is the day\nWhen CNN and MSNBC and these these used to be reputable organization really focused on reporting the news rather than driving the news and creating the news these news conferences now at the White House\nYou clean nothing that's newsworthy nothing I'll be right back [noise] month\nThanks for listening to me on K n empty am seven Ninety\nIf your financial planners even slightly out of tune you may be paying too much for taxes exposing yourself to too much risk before retiring was a sound income bland most of the money talks with CJ house of triple age financial group every Saturday at three PM to get your financial future into\nOnly on cayenne S.
