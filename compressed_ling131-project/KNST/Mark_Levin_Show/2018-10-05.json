there's been a lot of pushback across the country or what took place in the Senate Judiciary committee and what's taking place in the media is because not all Americans but most Americans have common sense most Americans are good people\nMost Americans know and set up job when they see one\n\nThey saw the Senate Judiciary committee that apparently hates men\nThat promotes lies a mob rule that plays dirty tricks rejects fundamental due process right now declares a person guilty without justice without evidence without any\nAnd as I said yesterday the American people saw a federal judge a

them\nAnd they came to hate Kevin all the way they've come to hate the president because he fought back does he spoke up because he challenged his accusers\nThe Democrats and the radical left wing nut

though that they got the FBI report that they want it\nEven though two of them said it was full some or even now they're playing games and so these are very very principled individuals in those

how the lid media treat them Jacques\nPepin though that if they don't their their careers are pretty much over 'cause I don't think the Republicans I used to live with what Paul um and it just like

F. A. Y. go\nWhat's up my brother what up come on down to south picture you're a great a cherry William Fulbright you know the guy\nThat you know and I turned down that statue you\nKnow now you know black people ... Democrat Bill corners love you're only ... oh yeah Clinton's ... listen mark you know I'm going to say something real quick I get off a makeup I listen to these senators who say\nOh it's a lifetime position I look you've been on the on the spending fifty years they were tired of hearing you to here's the thing mark\nHere's the thing about you're talking about lay he in his lifetime position\nBack like listen here in America you're always call were already calling landmark or like\nI tell you what we do mark in November we poke your small town in middle America coming after you because those ... and the ... code they want your America it's like they are in their state and the ... the founder or such named mark you all the time when\nThe electoral college because it wasn't that those people would be running our country they try they try to this week\nNow during the confirmation process I met was sixty five senators and explain my approach to the law I participated in more than thirty hours of hearings before the Senate Judiciary committee and I submitted written answers to nearly Thirteen hundred additional questions I was grateful for the opportunity\nAfter all those meetings and after my initial hearing concluded I was subjected to wrongful and sometimes vicious allegations my time in high school and college more than Thirty years ago has been ridiculously distorted my wife and daughters have faced vile and violent threats\nAgainst that backdrop I testified before the Judiciary Committee last Thursday to defend my family my good name in my lifetime of public service\nMy hearing testimony was forceful and passionate\nThat is because I forcefully and passionately denied the allegation against me at times my testimony both of my opening statement in response to questions reflected my overwhelming frustration at being wrongly accused without corroboration of horrible conduct completely contrary to my record in character\nMy statement and the answer is also reflected my deep distress at the unfairness of how this allegation has been handled\nIt was very emotional last Thursday more so than I've ever been I might have been too emotional at times I don't know that might tone was sharp and I said a few things I should not have said I Hope everyone can understand that I was there is a son has been in that\nI testified with five people for most of my mind my mom my dad and my wife and most of all my daughter's\nGoing forward you can count on me to be the same kind of judge a person I had been for my entire twenty eight year legal career hardworking even killed open minded independent and dedicated to the constitution and the public good\nAs a judge I've always treated colleagues and lead against with the utmost respect I've been known for my courtesy on and off the bench I have not changed and will continue to be the same kind of judge I been for the last twelve years and I will continue to contribute to our country as a coach volunteer and teacher\nEvery day I Will try to be the best husband died and friend I can be I Will remain optimistic on the sunrise side of them out and I will continue to see the day that is coming not the day that has gone\nI reviewed the constitution I Believe that an independent and impartial judicious raised a central direct constitutional republic if confirmed by the Senate to serve on the Supreme Court I Will keep an open mind in every case and always strive to preserve the constitution of the United states\nAnd the American rule of law Brett Kavanaugh to beautiful up it won't matter one with the Democrats or the media\nAnd the three Republican stooges are really wanting their own careers and positioning themselves and don't give a wet about judge Kavanaugh his wife his kids or as parents\n\nOf several times the judge mentions in this op ed the constitution and therein lies his problem\n\nThe reason he's hated by the left the reason is under attack by the Democrats the reason the media went would gossip and rumor\nAnd really defamation is because his declared support for the constitution they do not support it they do not support the constitution except protect the free press part because they think it protects them\nBut when it comes to the constitution they trash constitutional originalists ... worth throwback stops you know\nUnless we embrace the progressive agenda and and trying it as a constitutional matter there by rewriting the constitution with nearly five justices\nThan we justice Kavanaugh must be destroyed it is the constitution that gets in the way of the progressive agenda don't you say it's the constitution that they despise\nThey make no sense whatsoever when they talk about the constitution when they talked about precedent\nWhen they talk about precedent we know I suppose that they must embrace Dred Scott they must ... plus it and you must embrace Korematsu that's precedent\nIt's precedent that was rejected as precedent the case the Dred Scott it took a civil war to undo in case of plus it took fifty eight years to undo it\nCase Korematsu it still hasn't been done\nThose were activists judges who did not follow the constitution of the United states\nThat's why this is an important debate\nThey insist on abortion it's not in the constitution so they demand precedent they insist on their entire social agenda there environmental agenda it's not in the constitution but they demand they insist on all powerful centralized government to advance their agenda\nThat's not in the constitution either and they insist that the individual in states\nWell that they accept this new rewritten constitution despite the fact that you and I have never participated in amending it\nIt's because judge Kavanaugh reviews the constitution not just the name but an action as he declares and he used despise and he is hate it because it's a threat to the progressive agenda\nSo the more he talks about reverence for the constitution the more he talks about following the constitution the more he is despised I'll be right back [noise] month\nHim this is my great new home in Tucson came in as dean am seven

that's oh yeah and you can find that the market and the saddest thing about mark in Montgomery is that it it went down during the recession was that was maybe one of the saddest\nMoments during the entire great recession anyway are now in this great economy we can have new flea market Montgomery and there'll be a there'll be bigger there'll be beautiful or they will have doors in the in the wall I just\nOh by the way I Am bright mud and for the great one ... and uh\nGet to some of your calls here and just a moment by the way the the phone lines are not to be confused with the uh\nThe Chuck Schumer sexual assault allegation blind which also has been known to have the exact same phone number so just to please do not share your Chuck Schumer sexual assault allegations on the Marco then show just to go straight to the FBI place\nNow um right before the break\nMentioned persuading people how to persuade somebody politically or over the course of my career is the single most common question I have a receipt\nAnd the easiest way to tell you how to persuade someone to tell you who you shouldn't be attempting to persuade people are closed minded\nIf somebody is genuinely not open to information odds are you're not going to get anywhere\nAnd that's the problem the most people in this is true conservatives to by the way it's it's not like this is unique to liberals are a lot of close minded conservatives too but you got to be open a new information and you need to identify who those people are in your life\nYou know I mentioned the Kavanaugh polling firm Gallup that start to finish everything that's happened over the past three months everything\nPublic sentiment I'm Brett Kavanaugh only shifted by seven points the entire time but that in other words at most seven percent of this country was even persuadable a brick Kavanaugh\nSo what does that tell you you just go to the average person in that opposes your thought process and expect to get some way somewhere now you did it all you're doing is banging your head against\nThe wall and you're going to make yourself on happy so if you want to be persuasive the first thing find the right people people are open to information not the loudest people who will fight with you politically and the next thing is credibility\nOne of the biggest mistakes people make just by lack in it because once you give up your credibility why is anybody going to listen to you\nFor that reason operate with facts operate with information if you just operate with opinions independent of the facts and the information somebody who is otherwise open to that information\nThey're just going to view you as someone who was highly political trying to can communicate I your your emotion rather than principal a because typically what you'll find for those that are truly persuadable or is that they are analytical\nAnd that they genuinely are inquisitive looking for more information and by the way\nThis surprises a lot of people but I find that common link there the millennials are a number of reasons and it starts with the economy\nA lot of folks have given up on the millennial generation which by the way the youngest millennials are I closing in on the legal to drink the youngest one's my oldest one's like thirty five thirty six now\nAnd I have not blame that ride along because when was it that they came of age they came of age and the great recession right so here they went through the education establishment they were fed a bill of whatever the education establishment beats them\nAnd then they come out and the economy's terrible\nAnd they weren't able to get opportunity\nAnd so it made sense to them yeah you know what capitalism this economy doesn't work we need change that Obama probably made sense because hey that\nWas what our teachers told us in here we are and things are working they had never seen a good economy never seen a good economy we finally have it right now is one of the most important windows of talk we have two really good opportunities to reach\nEspecially younger adults that now do have opportunities three point seven percent unemployment are you kidding me right

has been an emotional time and no doubt or we're gonna have must see a TV going on about five o'clock eastern time tomorrow as the final vote or should take place approximately\nAround that period of time but at this point\nGiven that Susan Collins made her speech made it clear that she is going to be voting to conform Brett Kavanaugh and then shortly after that Joe Manchin Democrat West Virginia who is a Republican and waiting at this point I mean it's\nA ... it seems like it's inevitable at at this point the mansion is going to go ahead and make the move maybe I after the election of but he is a he said that he is also an board so it it absolutely appears that there are the boats and in fact\nSomething interesting that developed out of Alaska\nLisa Murkowski voted no Republican Lisa Murkowski voted no she didn't want to end debate and again if debate did not end today basically Gavin I would've been dead that've been it right there at the procedural vote today absolutely critical to with her voting no\nUh you know she has come under heat\nFrom her constituents on the right\nAnd what's interesting I when you take a look at that in context is the ways they've been going about it not screaming not protesting not people they're chasing her down in elevators but there have been a lot of folks\nThat had been to lighten up her office or with phone calls them know how can certainly are there have been some pretty good pieces put out including one by the wall Street Journal that was amazing pointing out that hey you know if Lisa Murkowski or to have an ... year the ninth\nCircuit court of appeals\nWould be kind of the final say if you end up having basically this split court and you had significant decisions that would impact Alaskans the Ninth Circuit rulings ultimately if there weren't a decisive decision at the Supreme Court that would stand for all Africans seems like Lisa might now actually be reconsidering\nWhen I was taking a look at the most likely outcome here are you looked like it might be in that fifty to vote range and I we might end up there even though we were fifty one forty nine today now something that I have tried to lean on from a point of optimism throughout this process\nIs the positive that can be gained from all this\nHow many people knew how many folks were on the Senate Judiciary committee until the last couple of weeks\nHaven't known many I I mean even you and the student listener somebody who cares and is engaged in you know that they were Twenty one members well I mean okay so twenty in Spartacus but did you know how many members of the Senate Judiciary committee there were\nWe learn that right I mean one small detail but for many folks because we don't teach civics in school this has been an opportunity and cabin on the ...\nOr ... that man when he has been through and and having a backbone of steel so see this thing through holy cow incredible person definitely a role model a role model that we could all point to\nThat's ultimately what I think Brett Kavanaugh's role is two fold one\nI think he taught history by what he went through during this process and having a whole new generation of people engaged in pain detention\nSecond thing is I think we have a new role model that we can point to one of the concerns of course has been well you know Trump's going to Trump Donald Trump has been an incredibly effective president the United states not necessarily the best role model right\nBut if you want to introduce their kids to somebody that seems to have all the ripe for priorities in the right places is the right way doesn't back down when he's faced with adversity you absolutely can point to Brett Kavanaugh now\nHow many folks necessarily knew how many Supreme Court justices their war before all this I'm sure you did but a lot of folks have learned that\nA lot of folks have learned about how this than it actually works and that's important from a point of civic says well how delivered is the process is by design all these procedural votes and everything that's happening now including the thirty our window that we're in as we wait until\nApproximately five o'clock tomorrow afternoon for the final vote\nYou know there are a lot of things about our government we complained about", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Tucson", "day": "05"}
