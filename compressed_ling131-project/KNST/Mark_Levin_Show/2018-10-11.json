informed me that that is a a load of of of steaming dog do\nAre generally speaking then uh I I go with my instincts and I and I disregard the study this one though\nI find to be fascinating and I think that it makes sense but what I'd like you to tell me is why why do you think this is true American men actually favor female politicians\nMayo politicians midterm elections are just around the corner and so it could be a potential turn the tide in American politics when it comes to gender says this skewed article from studying science work\nA record number of women are running for Congress and there may never be a better time for such a breakthrough a new study finds that both men and women prefer\nFemale politicians over males a survey of fourteen hundred American men and women over Eighteen connected by researchers in the Steven's Institute of technology and I won't bogged down in a lot of the of various analyses that they do here but I I Will point out this because I find those to be a sort of the most important part\nUh when it breaks it down between a Republicans and\nDemocrats or this is fascinating ah Democrats Democrat men specifically tend to favor a female politician mailed Democrats\nWill favor a female politician but when it comes to Republicans\nRepublicans can go either way Republican men and women are fifty fifty they don't have a preference one way or the other you know now me\nIf I'm looking at two Republican candidates and they're pretty much on paper the exact same in and in terms of their their a resume their track record it it's it's ...

after Hurricane Katrina came out on national TV at a fundraiser and said George Bush hates black people no one said that he was not reading then there wasn't a black Democrat in America when he said that that would have said this afterwards\nTell you what is what happens when negroes don't read\nThink about that Kanye West is what happens when negroes don't read I Would argue that as an incredibly racist statement I Would argue that's a perfect example of modern day slavery from the car sellers\nNow in ... west said this after Hurricane Katrina listen to it\nThe most tragic loss of all George Bush doesn't care about black people\nGeorge Bush doesn't care about black people did you hear the car sellers say this is what happens when they grow don't\nRead nope you didn't hear it you want to know why because that was okay to be said on the liberal plantation of owning African Americans like modern day slaves\n\nYou look at what modern day slavery is in this country what is it\nIt is a party that controls the thoughts and the minds of African Americans it is a party that demands that African Americans don't succeed but fail so they're dependent on their government aid and they keep them in those poverty at high poverty high crime failing\nSchools and when you bring up that you want these kids to be out of failing schools what do they say\nThey say no\nBecause we've got employees that are black working in those schools and where unions as teachers and you can't destroy public ... education I Would agree with that you can you've already done\nSo impossible for me as a white Republican destroyed public education you guys have already taken care of that on the left I Would argue that the left doesn't mind that young African American kids are in failing

running the Democratic party who are telling them that no no no no you need to stay in poverty because well take care of you there I don't know you don't need to think for yourself no no you can't

maybe they're the ones with the mental handicap\n... just look at the last couple of weeks of the Democratic party and what they've been saying I mean\n... is what happens when negroes don't read Tanya is a token eager the Trump Administration black folks are about to trade Kanye West and the racial draft Conyers attention or like the president then you have ... and it gets better than that Maxine Waters says she threatens Trump supporters all the time\nEric Holder said it's OK to kick Republicans\nHillary says not to show civility to Republicans\nI mean ... at what point is is incitement to violence and then they say you can't say that there's mob rule here you because it's unfair to Democrats who say that they're acting like mobs while they're screaming in surrounding people like Ted Cruz at dinner with his wife\nWhen they're banging on the doors the Supreme Court after they don't get their way while they say they want and pizza president nine states America if you vote for them and they're ready to impeach\nBrett Kavanaugh from the Supreme Court if you give them ... control of the house for the Senate\nThat's what they're saying and don't forget\nNow Taylor Swift the beautiful white woman is a role model and a brave woman because she came out and supported Democrats ...

everything they've done to all the ... the peaceful Republican rallies there to\n... they were directing traffic this last week is screaming at white people they didn't take their owners you saw that on TV\nIt's it's nuts and and my question to the American people is at what point are we going to say enough is enough let's stop this must be done and let's wipe this recon slate clean\nWell I I'm waiting for the the the Democrats to say that socialist Alexander Cortez um\nWho claimed the electoral college is an institution that has its roots in slavery\nAnd by the way the Democratic party has its roots in slavery so\nTo you here's my question to you for interrupting regret what we do conservatives and especially if African Americans in your opinion to try to stem the tide track I said\nWell it wasn't the Democrats Democrats I Do believe would have taken control of the Senate if it wasn't for them overplay their hand with Brett Kavanaugh and I think Democrats are angry they're inspired\nFurious and they realize that another four years of a Donald Trump being president\nCould destroy the Democratic party as we know it because if you have an economy that's doing this well and it keeps doing well and you have trade agreements or being change and you have American Jobs coming back and you have what when in point in numbers it's extremely hard to beat that person\nThey are terrified of but what what I Will say is is that we have to go out there and vote and not sit at home and be passive and I think the Brett Kavanaugh as what's going to wake up a lot of Republicans to say that character assassination\nThat character assassination of a good man trying to turn them into the worst thing you can call a man with there's only there's only one thing you could do that would have been worse\nSaid he's a child rapist that's it right it's child rapist and rapist\nAnd they went all in against Brett Kavanaugh and ... and he was collateral damage it wasn't about it it wasn't about honesty wasn't about fairness it was about a true investigation wasn't it was about trying to destroy a man keep them all\nThe Supreme Court to inspire democratic voters and I think they ever played it I think will hold the Senate and house I really do if we go out and vote and I appreciate the phone call thank you sir it's nice to talk to you by the way I just got back from a small
