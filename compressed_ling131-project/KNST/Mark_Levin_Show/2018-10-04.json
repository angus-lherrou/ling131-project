why is she going to change your opinion of the FBI that can be perjury I don't think she'll do that and I didn't even interview judge Kavanaugh well why should they is he going to change his opinion I don't think so\n\nAll we need to get to the truth no all they do is interview people and ask them questions to write it up and handed over it's only been said four billion times that that's what a background check is\n\nSo what is it that the FBI needs to find out now if they really didn't interview\nDr Ford then they should take with them\nProsecutor Rachel metros memo and as well as several the part time and raising and then have Dr Ford square the circle\nThat would be a real criminal investigation\nAnd they could do the same with Kavanaugh but I don't see any contradictions in his

of civil rights when it's the Republican Party\nThat oppose slavery and oppose segregation those were not Republican governor standing in the door house and then the Democrats trying to rewrite history well you know the old Democrats or the new Republicans no they're not\nNo they're not in the least the old Democrats are gone\n\nThey didn't turn into young Republicans\n\nBut this mindset\nOf nullification you can see it was signed trace cities secession you can see it in California with the radical left\n\nThe mindset about destroying individual human beings the mindset about old white men and phrases like that it's the Democratic party\n\nThey just change their approach it's all about power the Democrat Party cannot survive if the nation is United what is the Democrat Party the Democratic party is an entity a political entity\nThat is\nMade up of disparate parts based on race based on religion or no religion based on income based on age\nAnd so forth and so it is the party a balkanization as the party of tribalism\n\nAnd so when you and I when we try to discuss the constitution of the declaration these are very quaint ideas to the Democrats but they really have nothing to do with anything\n\nThere objective is always how to get power and how to keep it had to advance their cause whether they win elections or lose elections why do you think we have this massive administrative state the really progressive tell you why because elections come and go Franklin Roosevelt tells you why\nThat we will only have temporary control over the instruments how these of government but but we need to make permanent our policies\nAnd so they have bastard dies the federal judiciary they've created a fourth branch of government and this massive administrator state so even when they lose elections from their perspective they're supposed to win\nWhen they win elections they tell you they have a mandate so they never lose what an Obama said when they lost the when he lost the mid term during his presidency\nThat all those people didn't vote he represents them and the ones who voted Democrat so in his mind he had a perverse idea that he represented the vast majority the American people including those who didn't vote and the Democrats who did vote\n\nLook yesterday and now today the New York times a massive story Fifteen thousand words that's like three chapters in a typical book\nOn Fred Trump's taxes and tax returns going back to the early to thousands what did they get that information where did they get that information\nIs is a civil liberties union we are forced to file federal income taxes were forced to file their taxes we have no choice we have to give it to the IRS and state authorities\n\nThe New York times said it had a one hundred thousand pages they went through to be more accurate went through one hundred thousand pages that boxes and boxes of material if it were you know hard copy as opposed\nTo a a electronically provided well they got it from the government obviously\nThe question is which part of the government the U.S attorney's office the attorney general's office in New York\nBob Mueller's office\nThe Internal Revenue so what did they get this information from does anybody care notice anybody even raise it\nNow and half of the article\nIs an attack on Trump effectively as a failed businessman that but for his father he could never have achieved great well you've never seen that peace like that written about the Kennedys ever and you never will\n\nOr any of these multi billionaire families with a father and grandfather created the initial wealth\n\nMost of Europe for a million New York city aren't you all those buildings with the president's name on he created this even in areas where it used to be warehouses and so forth along the Hudson River he rebuilt that entire area\nThey want you to believe that Donald Trump is a lousy businessman as a lousy developer and buzz for his father he couldn't succeed there's some concern about that and they go on about how he he's a tax ...\nFirst of all as I understood it these were his father's tax returns but\nWhy is he attacks cheat has he been adjudicated attacks cheap now has he been adjudicated attacks street administratively or traditionally no\nNo he has\nNow what is the president's supposed to do now you know full well when you have these kinds of holdings you can't actually follow your own tax returns you hire professionals and you sign the tax return and you submit it\n\nAnd of course the goal is to pay as little taxes as possible\n\nI asked Bill Clinton that I seem to recall one year he deducted as used underwear member that Mr but it isn't\n\nBut there's never been a New York times investigation into the Clintons' like this the wheeling and dealing they haven't build the damn thing is there a single building in New York or any other part of the country with the Clintons name on it now what do they do to make a hundred and fifty million dollars\nDid they pay their taxes\nHow about all these foreign speeches that they influenced the Clintons particularly when she was secretary of state or a senator\n\nIn New York Times doesn't care anymore than the New York times doesn't care that Hillary Clinton violated the Espionage Act multiple times or Bill Clinton rape Juanita Broderick and an molested so many other women now it's the me too movement\nIt's interesting isn't it it's the me too movement except when it comes to Keith Ellison and John Conyers remember Joe Scarborough defending John Conyers despite what was coming up\n\nSort of this big article and everybody just keeps regurgitate it everybody just keeps repeating out of the New York times because the New York times is always right don't you know\nThe New York times is never wrong\nWe have the ... the mayor of a New York city they want to recoup any money that Donald Trump owes the people of New York that's what he says Donald Trump created thousands and thousands of jobs in New York\nBoth directly and his buildings and indirectly through suppliers that's not the way communists like it's not the way they think at all\nSo which Trump supposed to do go through a Fifteen thousand word document and respond if one after another after another of course not and the New York times knows he's not going to do it\n\nBut who you're
