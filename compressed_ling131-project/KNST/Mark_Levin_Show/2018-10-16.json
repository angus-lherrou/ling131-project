try out a lot of experience um in liberal states Marilyn specifically where I did run\nAnd what are the things I've always not liked what respected about the Democrats is their ability to almost ruthlessly stay on message\nFollow me here whether it was Obamacare the Obama tax hikes\nYou know bomb a regulatory assault in red tape on our businesses they are on message no matter what Obama cares about we got to get more coverage the tax cuts we got to make people pay their fair share about regulations we got to protect the environment and you fill in the black\nThey are almost ruthlessly good at staying on message\nDonald Trump has them so fragile so frazzled that just and it's why am I Try to be a target this why no you're wrong that just weeks before a midterm election a major party representative for their party Elizabeth Warren\nReleases and ancestry or whatever a DNA thing showing she's one one thousand uh twenty fourth Native American and even Jim Messina who was an Obama big

was a genius political move and I'm not a golden calf worship or of any politician I think it was a genius move to entirely get the Democrat Party to not talk about anything of substance and to focus on what Trump wants to focus on their fraudulent nature\nRather than what they want to focus on so I got to take a break on I'm Sorry thanks for the call I see your point but I totally totally

been gone for\nThe Donald Trump people's spied on by the United states government there were Pfizer warrants issued to spy on the Trump TV may miss some of that but that is what happened in the FBI is given conflicting accounts repeatedly of how exactly this investigation started that sit in a nutshell it's a very wonky case\nMy book as extensive footnotes audit even buy a use liberal footnotes that way to liberals camera phew what they said in the\nPast on it but the case is very simple in its essence\nA opposition political party from Donald Trump Brock Obama's White House weaponized the intelligence community and in some cases law enforcement community in case the FBI the upper levels in their management chain\nTo go after the Trump team that's it now why am I bring that up now not to give you the go well what's great what else is there are lots to\nTalk about them bringing this up so the break this weekend makes sense [noise]\nRatcliffe unleash the just the port of information to Maria barn Romo show on Fox News and that that Arizona on the weekends\nAnd he said that there is some potentially exculpatory material hanging out there about George Papadopoulos why does this matter folks and what the heck is going on remember the FBI's reasons for starting this investigation the most critical counterintelligence investigation possibly in modern us history\nAgainst a suit to be president Donald Trump at the time a presidential candidate the explanation as to why they did it has changed so many times that they cannot seem to wrap their arms around why they did it themselves\nIt started as a whole is all about Carter Page that it was all about George Papadopoulos then as I explained in a ... show which is all about alpha bank that's in my book and lays it out alpha bank oh you haven't even heard that story and I'm sure you\nI promise you\nFolks the reason the story keeps changing is because they were constantly looking for new reasons to spy on the Trump team because the ovaries kept falling apart [laughter] this is what's going on they tried to ... for bank law that didn't work let's try Carter Page oh there's no evidence she's a spy either let's try George Papadopoulos all man up is working out there\nDo shocks what do we do now\nThat's the reason the story keeps changing now here's the problem here is the problem they're having the last story they settled on that was advanced by the New York times back in December of last year\nAnd that they've stuck to since you hear the liberals parrot this too\nIs you know George Papadopoulos did George Papadopoulos is low level Trump advisor met with Alexander down or this Australian diplomat in the United kingdom talked about this Russian dirt and that's what did he passed on the information that there you go bingo we got\nWell thanks gentlemen what's the problem with is\nThe problem is when you go into a Pfizer court there's a verification process for the information he supposed to present\nExculpatory information to at some point if it indicates that the the target let me give you an easier example this but sometimes a little complicated be every bit of federal agent\nIf I Walk into court and swear in front of a judge for a search warrant then I Believe there's probable cause at a prime a crime has been committed that there's evidence of this location and I fail to put out there evidence that indicates that the person I'm targeting in the house we're looking to get a warrant on\nIs in fact not the place and I I felt to include evidence that that person may not be guilty of the crime\nLadies and gentlemen the chances of losing their job if not being put up on criminal charges yourself depending on the severity of it\nThe allegation or significant\nIt's becoming clear as day now that the FBI according to multiple members of Congress you've seen misinformation had information that George Papadopoulos was completely innocent of is that this Russian collusion thing was a fairy tale is made up but the information they presented to the Pfizer court was not\nThat folks was not that\nIt was only this stuff alleged basically in the ...\nAnd here say based items that

friends still lives here in in South Florida as I've been talking about this and the noise continues to be allowed out there and social media and it is fascinating the dearth of knowledge on this particular subject that seemingly the average left just want to be a socialist\nActually has about Elizabeth Warren commonly received the question will why is it why is it that this is even an issue

the United states at a rally back in July she don't test so she's the one who put it back out there and you you have to wonder\nYou have to think that the president prompting her like that you think she was like I'd rather take the test\nAnd then he or she supposed to be Ivy League educated right when you actually like try to figure out exactly what the results of your test would mean before you go out there and say yeah you know I'm a I'm jerky here it is and then there's ...\nActually no you are a wider than the average white folk here in the United states just saying oh by the way but that wasn't the best smack down to ball now in the end the grand scheme of of entertainment and uh the the full fledged W W E version kind of smack down here\nThat came from none other than the Cherokee

South America\nSovereign tribal nations set their own legal requirements for citizenship and while DNA tests can be used to determine lineage such as fraternity to an individual it's not evidence for tribal affiliations oh by the way\nUsing the DNA tests to lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation even vaguely\nIs inappropriate and wrong\nIt makes a mockery out of DNA test and it's a legitimate use as well also this honoring legitimate tribal governments and their citizens whose ancestors are well documented and who's heritage is proven\nSenator Warren is undermining tribal interest with her continued claims of tribal heritage\nAnd once again boom goes the dynamite any questions\nYeah you can have the the president the United states were forward to Elizabeth Warren a bad book on us as he might say as a fraud but really only have to do\nIs listen to the secretary of the Cherokee Nation that she claims to be born up\nGoogle or a broad\nOh by the way I mean details you know these little things so part of the the liberal argument that I've heard of and throughout the day is well I mean what difference does it make any way in Trump's tax returns
