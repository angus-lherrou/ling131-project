there's not a single accuser whose filed a criminal complaint not one\n\nBecause if you file false criminal complaint you can be charged with a felony\n\nOr maybe they're afraid at a case will be taken or they'll go to court and the lows\n\nWhy haven't they filed a criminal complaint and then they talk about we want an FBI\nInvestigation you know why they do that to you so you think there's actually a criminal investigation going on here against Kavanaugh that those are real live criminal investigation now there's not\nThis has nothing to do with a criminal investigation I Will be honest with you I suggested to two senators on the Senate Judiciary committee that ask\nDr Ford why she doesn't walk into the Montgomery County police department and file a criminal complaint you know what those senators said to me Mr producer nothing they ignored me\n\nWell what if she does not what a busy Ramirez does go instead we get reporters we get people giving their opinions we get this I started the show with a real lot prosecutor\n\nWho sent a memo to the Republican senators laying out a huge list of in discrepancies of memory lapses of contradictions respecting Dr Ford crickets nobody gives a damn\nBefore that she would try Mahler grilled cheese and incompetent incompetent my but she was great\nThese are facts\nSo why why didn't\nMiss Ford's Dianne Feinstein hand picked lawyer\nDebbie Katz\nTake her clients hand and walk into the Montgomery County police department in Maryland\nThey dare not do it they dare not do it\nOr ms ... lawyer they dare not do it\nOr the rat\nThey dare not do it instead just keep them we need an FBI investigation isn't it interesting that the Three Stooges of the Republican Party Collins Murkowski\nAnd flight not one of them\nSaid you know I feel a lot better if she'd actually saw a you know filed a criminal complaint I Would have felt a lot better how come they didn't say\nBecause they're afraid that's why\nYou'll hear this now on Fox I'm short tonight somebody will bring it up some former prosecutor or whatever that's OK I'm used to this\nBut it's an important point\nHe said because in a court of law there's the cabinet does have the presumption of innocence and a quarter law there is due process and a quarter law that's a criminal case\nIt's beyond a reasonable doubt but as a prosecutor Rachel Mitchell set in her paper there's not even a preponderance of evidence here and I would add there's no evidence\n\nSo we have a circus we have the Roman Colosseum and everybody's gathered because now the lines are going to kill the Christian just throw Kavanaugh in their in their everybody's excited everybody cheering\nWhat do you mean due process due process she's up against the law and what the hell do we care\nWhat do we care\nThese phrases innocent till proven guilty apparently they only applied to a al ... terrorists and mass murders\nNot to a federal judge not the federal judge you got\nFrank Rich that pots

retrospect Kavanaugh using a girls' basketball team as a prop during his confirmation hearing doesn't seem like a coincidence really jot now they're sick go\n\nWell they're sick and go down the list are so called free media not a free media on free media\nThe way they cherry pick their stories they're partisanship it's obvious to everybody even if people who watch these these carbon footprint says CNN and MSNBC they know they're part is and that's why they watch 'em all twelve people\n\nBut I go back to my point I always have to say these things five times or so just to make sure even the media here me not a single accuser has filed a criminal complaint with the statute of limitations\nWould not have run and has not run in Montgomery County Maryland not one and I'll tell you something else one of the reasons\nThey think they can continue to say the most outrageous sickening insane things about Kavanaugh is they know he's a federal judge and they know he seeks to be on the Supreme Court so they know he will not sue them for defamation\n\nAnd if he sued Dr Ford for defamation she would lose\n\nEven on a public person standard she would lose she has no evidence if he sued ms Ramirez she would lose if he sued ... and his crime they would lose\nYou can accuse people of the most vital things with no evidence with no witnesses and no ...\nIt's a slam dunk know it might take a few years but they know he won't they know he can't given his interest instilled being a Supreme Court justice and eventually if not returning to the uh staying on the DC circuit\n\nThese accusers and
