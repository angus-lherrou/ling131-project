nightmare continues call in a gym and seven three one two three one one\nPatrick Morrisey is the attorney general of West Virginia he is a conservative views the constitution list he doesn't have to wait for the Democrats to vote to figure out the way you should vote he will not vote for Chuck Schumer to be the Democrat leader in the United States Senate how are you Patrick Marcy\nI'm doing great work of and thanks for having me on your show I'm a big fan and I'm really excited to be on line and talking about the big issues and the U.S Senate race is going to be a lot of fun\nWell it's my pleasure go ahead and tell us the big issues where you stand and where your opponent stance\nAbsolutely well I think as many people are beginning to really follow the U.S Senate race in West Virginia they're seeing that there couldn't be a bigger contrast between the Republican and the Democratic candidates that let's start at the base it\nI'm a conservative fighter mark you know I took on the Obama administration I sued them we had big victories in court it was West Virginia that led the way to defeat the Obama power plants that\nWas just this amazing power grab over the United states\nEnergy supply we lead the way built the twenty seventh state coalition we stopped Rocco bomb at the U.S Supreme Court fact it was the last major decision\nOf Justice Scalia's light that was the big deal we've let on many other big issue is taking on the federal government in their own lawful unless I'm strongly pro life endorsed by all the pro life groups because not only check a box on the issue of why\nI Believe in the sanctity of life and I'm actually in part responsible for a lot of the changes which have evolved in West Virginia so we have protections for the unborn\nI'm also strongly in support of the second amendment in our gun rights and we're working tirelessly to help President Trump we think President Trump has been doing incredible things for the country\nAnd for West Virginia and I'm proud to stand with them or running a campaign partnering up with this president because he's helping turn us around now\nThe flip side of that is you're dishonest Washington liberal Joe mansion\nAnd he's just another one of these Washington politicians he went to Washington he drank the water and now he's in cahoots with Chuck Schumer Nancy Pelosi and all the radical liberals including Hillary Clinton on the issue of why\nHe sold out west Virginia values he actually literally had signs saying that he supports Planned Parenthood and also that he stood with life\nOn the issue of life that's not a multiple choice questions you need someone who's ... who opposes taxpayer funding of abortion who wants to stop the government funding a Planned Parenthood on the issue is Second Amendment we need someone who's going to stand against the gun grabbers matching\nIs best known for offering a big gun control bill and on the issue of coal\nOh as to say is this he doubled down on his support for Hillary Clinton even after she said we're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of work big differences between dishonest Washington liberal Joe mansion and conservative fighter Patrick Morsi and that's why we're going to win an election day in West Virginia\nYou know Patrick Morrisey there's a reason why Donald Trump keeps coming back to West Virginia to support you just because he not only support you he doesn't trust Joe mansion and I noticed throughout his career in the Senate he waits and wait and wait to see if he can throw a safe vote\nThat isn't with his party he doesn't lead on anything am I right about that is\nYou're right and I think vice president Mike Pence said it very well he said quote Joe ... is always there when you don't need him\nAnd your great live off that terrific line and and really accurate about match ...\nNow what are your priorities among you you mentioned a number of them I suppose you supported the president's tax cuts you reject this caravan you want a wall on the southern border\nRight man well absolutely so let's START I agree with all the above the Trump's tax cuts are good for West Virginia\nNot only doubling the standard deduction which helps a lot of hardworking families and our state the lowering of the rates are but we also have other changes here they're really hoping lift our economy up to levels we haven't seen before when you combined the Trump tax cuts more with the deregulatory approach\nI mean let's face it under the ... Obama era they tried to put a lot of organized for profit businesses out of work and certainly they went after fossil fuels I stood up and I said no to that not SATs when I found those lawsuits and President Trump well\nHe's just finishing the job I was basically the bridge to President Trump who's done so many great things for our economy and for energy jobs\nIn West Virginia we need to continue that approach of lowering our taxes and then ultimately be regulating so the regulations fulfill a more basic purpose\nMarkets you know were meant to be a free people that means we should try to solve most of our problems either individually or within our communities on the local level\nWhen you have federal regulations in place there has to be a very compelling health safety well for aspect to it and it obviously must comply with the constitution and that's part of the problem with the ... Obama era\nOr they went so far beyond the pale President Trump is doing it right and we know unfortunately Joe mansion his first vote and the U.S Senate would have power Schumer and that radical team that was on full display of obstruction and resistance during the judge Kavanaugh nomination\nParenting in your home printing your sample ballot provide that information from Montgomery County board of elections\nAccording to the department of energy the most expensive utility for most Americans is their electricity bill adding to your financial misery this allergy season has been one of the wars in years so now is the perfect time to order a new set of HPV vaccine through spring filter by dot com with over six hundred scientists to choose from including custom options\nYou'll find the perfect it ships free within twenty four hours with filtered by dot com they're made in America that still to be ... dot com\nEmail phishing attacks cost businesses billions annually in real cash data loss and brain damage fishing emails are hard to detect it gives the messages appear to be legitimate to unsuspecting employees\nIntroducing barracuda fish line a groundbreaking cloud based solution designed to help employees recognized sophisticated emailed phishing attacks through interacted training reinforced by continuous simulation transform your employees from the liability into a line of defense good there\n... pm to learn more\n[noise] ...

the same with me I Know I'm blessed with you\nAnd the common thread and all this is our love of country\nThat's where you were taught that is what you believe that's what I was taught that's what I Believe there's some people in this country who don't love it who attack it who rip it apart who choose their fellow citizens are being like Hitler and Nazis and racist and so for\nThese are the forces these are the people we must defeat\nNo we can't right now the feed them in our public school\nWhat was in college campuses we can't night right now defeat them in Hollywood in Beverly Hills in the entertainment industry we can't right now defeat them in the media the ladies in general we can defeat them at the ballot box\nIt's up to you\nAnd I'm Serious when I say I think about the power we have if we make sure three four five six seven people who we know and who will vote the right way get out and vote I think of what election idle really looked like\n\nIt is in my view particularly in this election you're patriotic duty to take care of business here\nI really believe that\nTeacher patriotic duty this is not just another election if we lose their grave consequences\n\nAnd so rather than have anxiety and frustration put your energy to work\nPut your energy into it you don't need people to tell you what to do you know what to do you know how to get other people involved in voting and so forth as your own precinct worker get out the vote I brought a number of candidates to you there are still up on my Facebook and Twitter sites who need your help in close races\nA number of Kennedy\nAs I told you I don't believe in giving to the party bureaucracy I Believe in giving the candidates [noise] so\nI Would encourage you to look at them and support them and hopefully most of them will win on Tuesday but some of them won't but\nThe goal is to make sure most of them don't lose but most of them do it and I can't get down into every house fight that we have like forty

one of those four or five districts in New York\nThey're all over the country\nYou may you live in one of those districts\nVery very important\nThat you get involved even in your own life that you get involved with a handful of people and make sure they vote and imagine if you do that and then a few others do that and so forth and so it would be a big deal it really would is there a silent majority and if they\nWere about to find out are the poles right or the polls wrong we're about to find out\n\nBut we should be focused like a laser forget about the static we should be focused like a laser\n\nYou know you love this country and you know there are candidates out there who do not\nTheir candidates out there who want to fundamentally change America I don't want to fundamentally change America I Love America\n\nYou know Hollywood Bloomberg\nSty or Soros another as many others multi millionaires\nYou know that they they support a strongly centralized government because they know is multi millionaires they have enormous influence of the future this society and they want more influence over the future of this aside their ego maniacal their narcissistic\nWe have to fight this you\nShouldn't be on the fence right now my fellow conservatives in Arizona you shouldn't be on the fence\n\nMy fellow conservatives in the ... district of Virginia where Barbara Comstock as you should be on the fence anymore\n\nMy fellow conservatives in the state of Nevada you shouldn't be on the fence anymore\n\nAnd we can go through all the states where the Republicans running or not necessarily that conservative but they still love the country they're not trying to tear it apart and it seems and that's the kind of race we have right now folks\nI Know you did test the media and you have every reason to test the media\n\nThere not defending the first amendment there not defending freedom of the press we've talked about this before they're advancing a a radical ideological
