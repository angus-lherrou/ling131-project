up eight or ten of them\nAnd I pointed out holy mackerel look what they've done the Trump look what they're trying to do look what the FBI's doing look what the intelligence services are doing and it helped trigger what became these investigations into what the FBI and the others were doing\n\nI didn't make up the stories they wrote these stories I just put them together they wrote these stories because now we know senior people the FBI were leaking to the media\nSenior people in the intelligence services were leaking to the media and the media as to knock her first\nWere writing what the Lakers were saying I just happened to notice it and put it all together what they were trying to do is take out Trump takeout individuals in the Trump campaign take on individuals in Trump world do
