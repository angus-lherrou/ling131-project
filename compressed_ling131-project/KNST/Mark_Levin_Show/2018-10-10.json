them what they want to do is raise money to use and hearty Hi camps race in North Dakota for example or Joe Donnelly in Indiana that is what they want to do they are threatening to impeach when they're never going to do that because it wouldn't fly you need fifty one percent of of the house and two thirds of the Senate it would never happen\nAnd if if there's a God and having the Republicans

you bring up that an excellent point you know that the party of the confederacy\nIs and was the Democratic party they're the ones who declared civil war on my country and killed about six hundred thousand total soldiers so that Democratic Party is the part of the Ku Klux Klan is the party of Jim Crow Democratic Party is the party of lynchings\nThe Democratic party's the party of the destruction of public education currently and the welfare system itself responsible for most of the criminal disasters as say like in the city of Chicago the Democratic party from reconstruction the Ku Klux Klan Jim Crow lynchings\nCollapse of public education in fact about eight percent of Detroit or Chicago public school students\nThat are African American read at the appropriate level\nAnd so you're talking about a massive dumbing down of the population to keep them on the modern plantation which is the Democratic party so Sonny ... behavior you're seeing from Democrats\nHas been repeat it for the past hundred and fifty or something called than the demon rats they're not Democrats or the demon rats and what what we're seeing the restaurants and the and the airports in the elevators today it's mild compared to what the Democrats did in the Nineteen sixties burning down about a hundred Americans so I wouldn't put a lot past them\nBecause Democrats are now shooting US Congressman

the far left we see what's going on in the schools we see the crime you see on TV for this is the result of liberalism now let me give me some quotes from the communist training manuals the communist right\nUse the system to destroy the system the communists right the best way to help the cause of communism is through the liberal wing of the Democratic party\nThe communist right yesterday's left this today center today's left will be tomorrow center that talking about the whole American political system more to the left\nSo they have a highly organized well trained group with in the Democratic party that the strategist a tactician there are a lot of our professors there are a lot of our teachers there are a lot of our congressmen and senators so when\nYou see the Kavanaugh hearings you see the Russian probe you see the violence and Ryan ... for all this stuff that's part of the left movement which is anti American it's Marxist and it's also largely anti white\nJimmy let me explain there's the also in the beginning you might recall the first few weeks the Trump Administration it was traditional tip telephone calls with world leaders\nAnd so the organized left inside the federal government would release transcripts\nOf the president's private telephone calls with world leaders in order to debase him diminish him and to marginalize our new president he never had a chance to get his feet on the ground to do the traditional things that were presidents had done because the radical left inside the federal government worked against them from day one\nRight and that helps that helps Iran North Korea Russia and China in fact the senator from Beijing which is what Dianne Feinstein known as in New York by the Chinese here the senator from Beijing this is foreign influence in our government\nA foreign agent of red China like Congress when Dianne Feinstein she's the one that started this big hoopla about a a judge Kavanaugh's judge Kavanaugh allegedly raping and all that stuff\nSo they influence is more than than numbers and we're actually I think a very big trouble and out of nowhere comes Trump\nYou know it is like Chris ... give me an update on the committee chairs\nOkay so are you were talking about what happens if the Democrats win and and one thing that I've heard and I wanted to point out is we can't let them have how even know how to speak\nBecause uh the committee heads have subpoena powers and they'll just continue these investigations on and on and on with these broad powers\nHow 'bout that fat slob Jerry ... taken over the house Judiciary Committee can you imagine that\nIt would be terrible\nI mean what I mean what legislation would pass what what activities on our behalf whatever occur if jury never learn Nancy Pelosi

I Want to encourage everybody to donate all you can do it if it came out and tear volunteer all you can if you can't donate then get they're not the worse if you see a sign for you know the the other side the Democrat\nBe as nice as you can pull out as you can try to ... wow why you've just curious why you vote for for this person\nBecause the reason yeah because you know there's you know there's plenty of reasons not to vote for him and just being as nice as in about it but in a gym and try to get him to talk a lot of people you know they they're bandwagon fans or whatever they don't really know what they're voting for they're just you know want to be part of the crowd so ...\n... talk to me about ... even ... is that close could Ted Cruz actually lose at Texas Senate seat to a clown like beta or is that possible\nOr it is possible I don't think it's going to happen though because you know the betas got this Kennedy esque vibe about him you know ... young and you know he's\nA you know some people I guess finding physically attractive or eight different strokes for different folks whatever but um there's been a lot because Texas economy is so strong we've had so many people moving in from out of Texas\nAnd yeah there there's obviously some liberal natives here you know in the Austin area and some other Houston Dallas\nA but most most of the Texas has you know pretty normal solidly conservative normal there are no yeah yeah but ah yeah we've got people moving in her changing the demographics and so\nUh it's important for everyone to get every vote here in Texas we cannot let cruise blues we've not we've got to have him when\nSee what's happened in Florida is too many New Yorkers have moved to Florida and they're taking their virus in their cancers ideas with him from New York from the Empire State to the sunshine state they're taking too many New Yorkers are moving in New Jersey I Can't stand the place anymore and moving to Florida so Florida I think is kind of like a purple state at this point\nIs going to be hard for the for the governor and when the U.S Senate seat but you know Scott ... is pretty good governor but\nNonetheless you bring up a good point that the goal of if they flip a Texas or Florida then the country's done if we lose those twenty nine to thirty five electoral votes either one it's over with a ... and Trump can't get reelected heck a Republican and can get elected if in Florida and\nNew York uh begin to be as one in uh Texas looks the same elect ... New York then we're done because Texas in Florida will tip this thing\nPermanently well I'll leave you with some good news or play I I I was not a Trump fan okay I was a pretty hardcore and for Ted Cruz for president\nAnd I have to admit I was dismayed by what happened and you know not that I just I wasn't a fan of Trump because I wasn't sure that he was going to be conservative you know and I was sure that it was so\nAnd I look at it this way I I thought when Trump got elected he would run toward the center and kind of be a New York Republican and I supported Ted Cruz in the beginning 'cause I thought he was a real Bible believing conservative from Texas who was bright and smart and knew what he was going to do but\nDonald J Trump has done governance what Ted Cruz would have done and you have the star factory is going to be in Cincinnati on friday and I'm going to be what\nI'm a little bit on friday and I've been in his presence at these rallies\nTrump is a rock star it's like Elvis it's the Beatles it's Michael Jackson and Ted Cruz Lindsey wherever you want to say\nDoesn't have the rock star status of forty five Trump is a rock star and there's the animal magnetism that I see president I think is an Iowa denied he hopefully it will be out every day between now and election day\nAnd when he comes to town and in Des Moines Iowa eleven thousand on the inside and ten thousand on the outside and this Friday there was like an eight thousand feet facility he's going to speak on friday north of Cincinnati and Warren County it's already sold out\nAnd there's going to be twenty thousand people show up those guys the messiah a conservative politics\nHe's done exactly what Ted Cruz would have done but crews doesn't add the magnetism doesn't have the charisma\nDoesn't have the charm or whatever you want to call it but Trump is a rock star and if you have a shot Chris getting his presence go to one of his rallies and will back the Beatles circa Nineteen sixty five or Michael Jackson circuit twenty over for or Whitney Houston circuit twenty three this guy's a rock star\nAnd when he shows up in your town it's a wonderful thing to watch and when you got that magic in a bottle that you catch with Trump you got to ride that baby for all it's worth and this guy makes Ronald Reagan looked like a liberal\n[laughter] well you know if if it would have been up to me I still would have had cruising there but my eyes were opened and here's what my eyes are open to that God is in control not me and he knows what he's doing and I think\nNow that I've seen it happen that my faith is behind Trump as a president\nOr not because he's the most godly man but because I I Believe that this is the ... because I don't think it could have pulled off\nWhat and I loved it but I don't think you get pulled off things away Donald did know and nobody I've got a plan and so we need to take comfort in that have confidence fake and just do what we need to do individually to

Fox News the worst of hurricane Michael has already passed Florida governor Rick Scott warned knock it out on the roads\nAs I laid out for you and explain exactly how we got here from there and why the left is doing this why they're trying to stop us from calling these thugs of the mob that they are I Want to hear from you\nAt eight seven seven three at one three eight one one what are you now ready to do\nTo keep the mob from taking power because make no mistake this is all about political power\nWe heard from Hillary Clinton yesterday in her interview with Chris you and I'm a poor where she said we can only regain stability if the Democrats win the house and the Senate she's basically saying no justice no peace no victory in November no peace nice little town you got there\nBe a shame if anything happened to it you better vote for the Democrats or we're going to burn this thing\nDown so what are you willing to do\nTo stop the mob from taking power eight seven seven three one three I wasn't one because we have an incredibly important election coming up in twenty seven days for weeks from today for weeks from right now this moment when you tune in to hear the great one mark would have been on the market within show he will be discussing\nWhether we are about to embark upon two years of a Democrat controlled house of representatives which will inevitably mean a investigations impeachment of not just President Trump a probably justice Kavanaugh\nOr if a mark within might be talking about the remarkable historic victory of the Republican Party\nIn maintaining majorities in the house and the Senate\nWhich story what we hear for weeks from tonight\nIt really depends on you and it depends on what you were willing to do because right now I have seen Republican voters\nIn my town of Washington DC and yes there are Republicans in Washington and then the greater Washington area but all across this country I assume Republicans motivated an energized and ready to walk across broken glass to get to the ballot box and that's important but it's not everything\nThe only way that Hillary Clinton lost the election and twenty sixteen\nIs because people not just voted but they told their friends to vote they told their family members to vote they made sure that they became part of the message and they said we can't let her when\nWe can't let her pick Supreme Court justices we can't let her be the commander in chief look at who she is look at what she thinks of us look at her history\nThat's what happened two years ago next month\nThat's how you win elections when you're up against the mainstream media when you're up against Hollywood when you're up against television and music and the universities and the news media that's how you when you have to tell your friends and your family we can't let this happen so are you ready now\nAre you ready because they just showed you over the weekend and over the past two weeks how they're going to govern the Democrats want all of those people who were screaming in the streets and screaming disrupting the operations of the United States Senate\nWant to take them from the streets they want to take them from the gallery screaming at vice president Pence trying to conduct a vote in the United States Senate and they want to put them down on the floor of the Senate down on the floor of the house they want to hand the gavel to them and let them be in charge for the next two years\nWhat are you willing to do to stop at age seven seven three one\nThree eight one one it started yesterday on CNN well actually forgive me it started\nEarly in the morning yesterday in the Washington Post these things happened and they're all coordinated have you noticed that the Washington Post writes an op ed talking about how Trump is using coded language when he refers to Democrats as the mob\nTalking about how this is a dog whistle how the mob isn't really a mob and then Matt Lewis a writer at the Daily Beast he's never Trump consider the republic\nI was about ... Republican but he actually I think is no longer identify as Republican but he has to be a Republican he used to read the Daily Caller now he switched to the Daily Beast I think that's what happens when you go from being a Republican to a non Republican you switch Daily Caller the Daily Beast\nAnd ... he's a good guy and I've known that for a while he's on with Brooke Baldwin Mary Catherine ... friend of mine also in never Trump Republican she has not renounced the Republican name she writes the federalist she's also um they're both paid CNN contributors\nAnd they're talking about the instability that we're seeing in this country and we're talking about the violent protests that we saw in the streets after the Kavanaugh hearing but frankly the violence we've seen for the last two years since the middle of the twenty sixteen election\nThe things that we saw against Trump voters at Trump rallies there were instigated by the left the things that we saw remember the antifa people following the Trump motorcade into a hotel and happened over the freeway barricades to get into the hotel where he was having a fundraiser\nDo you remember the mobs on the campuses have UC Berkeley and other places across this country when Ben Shapiro of all people shows up to give a speech you know little mild mannered Ben Shapiro is causing a bonfire\nAnd the bonfire bunch of parents ever been around involved marshmallows in small wars\n\nIn the immortal words of Billy Joel we didn't start this fire\nThe left has been doing this for the last two years and now they're disrupting us when we go to dinner we've got Maxine Waters telling people to get in our faces and disrupt us wherever we go so Brooke Baldwin host these two never Trump hers to talk about what's going on and listen to how it went\nWhen you see people like Ted Cruz getting chased out or restaurants by a mob is and I were totally a mock it is without\nA doubt that there's no other word it's put a stop what ... what we saw in Charlottesville, Virginia to August they go\nOh isn't that the life when she was so ready for that by the way did you hear how she jumped right on it you know when you go on television you often delivery you're talking points ahead of time you say yeah you know I go on a Fox a lot I'm Tucker Carlson Shannon Bream a lot a steward Varney and they always say you know what your point of view give us a couple of lines as the host knows what's gonna happen\nAnd she was ready for the mob word right you jump right on it and then she had a rich joined her she had her one rejoined or\nWhat we saw a mob in Charlottesville I mean honestly if if I had been a little less politically correct he could have easily immediately said well now which is that are you talking about the white nationalist racist mob which was a mob or the antifa mob which was also a mob I remember two mobs in Charlottesville\nA but he did not do that the way the media reports on these things though you know they all whenever there's a protest from the left or my friend Chris plants who was also a radio host national radio host\nHe uh he pointed out that uh they always report these has mostly peaceful in the mostly peaceful protests it's always a a left wing protest is described as mostly peaceful in the mostly peaceful protests abducted at the end the mostly peaceful protests on the campus of UC Berkeley in the mostly peaceful protests following the inauguration of Donald Trump in the ...\nIf they're mostly peaceful that means there are a little bit violent right\nRight I mean that just\nBy definition if you're mostly peaceful means you're not entirely peaceful and that means you're actually a little bit non peaceful or violent so I mean maybe Matt Louis would have said well yeah we did have that poor woman lose her life down in Charlottesville but you know the protests were mostly peaceful that was mostly peaceful mob\nIn Charlottesville but I don't think pro ball one would have taken at the right way because listen to how the conversation continue\nOn what we saw chasing right what about the people\nWho were at the Supreme Court banging on the wall what do you call that civil protest or that a lot I think it's easily in law\nYeah and if there was a party or as we call it um out for sure come out like they serious\nYeah so that's Mary under and ham jumping in there and and by the way at this point it's a visual Brooklyn actually puts her head down because she can't respond because she didn't say she didn't think she was going to get pushed back she didn't have another originally under the only one she had prepared was the Charlottesville side of what a and then she goes on to say if you can play that are real fast Richard\nLet me let me let me let me look past the N. word because I Do feel like that as part of the weaponization of what's happening now ah the\nN. word and the weaponization of it that's right the N. word is mob and he ... she says and she's not the only one says that Republicans people on the right Trump is weaponized saying that word\nAgainst Democrats against the law you know by calling a mob mob that's weaponized saying the word mob well she's partly right actually in a moment I'm going to actually play some audio from President Trump at a rally\nWhere he first raised this issue and uh and and she's probably right in the sense\nThe word is being weaponized in so far that it is properly describing exactly what's happening in American politics today\nAnd it's being weaponized in such a way that it is ... devastatingly effective\nAgainst the Democrats that's why CNN doesn't want the word used that's why the Washington Post doesn't want the word used that's why the next thing we know Facebook will start a silencing

they really the leadership of the Democratic party actually do believe that you are the most dangerous people in this country because you're calling them out on their agenda you're actually keeping them from power and now they think that they could intimidate you\nThey actually think that they can bully their way into office by letting you know\nThat if they don't when you were going to see more

society the Senate cannot function this way our government can't function this way our country can't function the way they could have done that\nBut they didn't\nThey actually encourage it ... this is their base they have decided that there was more power aligning themselves with the mob right now than in condemning the mob that's how all those protesters that were in the gallery of the Senate screaming during the vote or jumping up and creating their demonstrations during the committee hearing they got there because members of the Senate\nThem tickets to get in they knew what was going to happen they\nAre accessories to the crime\nThat we're seeing going on right now and and to make it even worse instead\nOf condemning the mob there condemning you for calling it a mob\nThat you're using coded language the your weaponize in the word against them well hell yes we are you're lucky that's the only weapon than it's being used\nWe will weaponize that word we will paint your party as
