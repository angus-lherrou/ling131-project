deputy White House counsel before Trump tapped him for the powerful D.C court of appeals last year\nGoes on\nA spokesman for Mueller's office Peter car declined to comment on the litigation\nLawyers for Trump said the mystery grand jury subpoena fight moving through the DC circuit had nothing to do with the president know ideas said Trump's personal attorney Jay Sekulow when shown the docket for the case\nAttorneys for Roger Stone said they didn't know of anyone challenging a mile a subpoena beyond Miller Miller's lawyers agreed with Mueller's prosecutors to make many aspects of the dispute public\nNo such agreement appears to have been struck in the other fight although Mueller's team and the mystery witness did file a joint motion earlier this month the asking the appeals court to expedite resolution of the dispute\nSeveral other lawyers who represent witnesses Mahler investigation also said they were unaware of who's crossing legal swords with the special counsel's team and the largely secret case a few barebones details about the dispute are available in the public record while all records about the litigation and the district quarter sealed\nDC circuit stock it shows that the case was brought in the D.C court on August sixteen and how ruled on September at Nineteen initial appeal was filed five days later\nStay with me on this because we'll try to make sense of this it's actually very very fascinating\nThe bottom line is most likely scenario someone filed a motion to quash or otherwise resisted a grand jury subpoena\nAnd the judge issued an order denying that and saying the witness needs to testify said Ted Boudreau so I Know a Gibson Dunn and crush or attorney who is handled grand jury related litigation for journalists and media organizations\nSo unclear whether the case the appeals court has agreed to hear and December involves an assertion of attorney client privilege or some other privilege is framed as a broader attack on most of the party or perhaps advances both sets of arguments very hard to tell from the stock and well I'll tell you\nIt's not hard to tell at all\nMr Miller ... challenged we know from a few months back the constitutionality the appointment of Mahler or the appointments clause of the constitution the same argument I've been making\nAnd professor caliber ISI has made\nI don't know exactly what kind of argument there making obviously I'm not privy to this sort of thing but it's the same person Miller and I assume it's the same lawyers who are making this argument probably challenging the subpoenas by challenging the constitutionality of Mahler and his operation in the first instance\nI suspect I Believe strongly that that's what's taking place again I because I have first hand knowledge but because remember what took place a few months ago\nThe grand jury cases pose a threat the mullahs investigation because they can serve as vehicles to get questions of its authority and legal legitimacy before ... judges relatively quickly and I believe that's what's taking place here such questions have also been raised by defendants and some of his criminal cases but\nAll the human defendants who set foot in a courtroom and ultimately decided to plead guilty and drop any challenges to the special counsel's authority or tactics\n\nMystery cases moving through the courts and Robin grand jury matters and independent counsel matters or aren't uncommon in Nineteen Ninety seven conflict of interest investigation into America or chief Eli seagulls fundraising activities was conducted under steal from its star\nIn the final report remains at a public view involving another Clinton era pro the labor secretary Alexis Herman and influence peddling accusations\n\nThis can't this can get a step or two weirder than it already is set an attorney representing a senior Trump staffer and the Russian inquiry Tiller recall the case from a previous investigation where you couldn't even get to see a judge's opinion because there was under steal All right\n\nI'm fairly confident that this is the case that was originally brought involving Miller I counsel as I said the question the appointment of Mahler or the appointments clause and the DC circuit has been packed\nA wood left is an Obama appointee so who knows what'll happen there perhaps they're building the foundation also to take it to the United States Supreme court\nAnd despite what you've heard by senior judicial analyst than others this is not the Martian versus Olson case of Thirty years ago and robbing the independent counsel\nThe elements in that court decision appear to have been violated in my opinion and professor calories his opinion respecting Mahler and this is why these two questions are important stay with me 'cause you're smart and you'll know you'll be able to follow all this we've talked about it before\nIs Mr Mahler a principal officer of the federal government\nOr\nIs he an inferior office\nFor purposes of a challenge\nTo the appointments clause of the constitution I have no doubt that he insists that he's in fear officer who reports to deputy attorney general Rosen steam\nThat he did not have to be nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate he's nothing more than an inferior office official like some assistant United States attorney or jeopardy\nTo an assistant attorney general now you know that's not true he's got more power than a U.S attorney\nAnd the reason among other reasons that he has more power than a U.S attorneys because his initial\nAppointment was enormously brought it didn't provide any criminal basis for his investigation we've talked about that so this isn't like Morrison versus also know the court may conclude that it is but on the facts that is not\nIt's a legitimate challenge I visit sorry I don't know where it will go but I'm Glad it's being done\nAnd ice more than ... suspect I Believe strongly that that's the ping pong that's going on between the trial court the district court in the appellate court back and forth and that's why the appellate court is uh is going to hear the case and again as I said that court\nIs heavily loaded with a a leftist activists so the the final case will have to be made to the Supreme Court if they'll accept it will be right back [noise] month\nHim this is my great new

play Hamilton when people hear about the camel to take advantage of by going to be a movie the tickets were at least a thousand dollars at that time um and so he\nGave it to Andrew Andrew knew that injures lied about that but now there's been evidence that shows that\nBut then those same lobbyist also arranged a luxury for night stay in this Costa Rica villa which ended up costs and about a thousand dollars a free Andrew and his wife or an addition to some other folks and again Andrew didn't pay for that and then what happens after\nAll this mark lo and behold mayor Andrew Gillum turns around and he gives those lobbyists to two million dollar deal that they were looking for and\nSo Andrew is getting things that that he shouldn't have had that did violate Florida ethics laws\nAnd then the lobby it's got a exactly what they were paying for and so that's really the way the government runs its corrupt\nIt's wrong I'm Andrew has you know he lied to the country on Sunday night when I confronted him about this but then documents came out almost immediately that refuted is denial showed he was lying\nUm and he's basically tried to blame everyone he can cause he just refuses to take responsibility but at the bottom line the ... the older that day tries to say he's not under investigation but mark you are very smart in the law you understand about\nWhat an FBI agent ever act undercover and give somebody a potential drive like that if they weren't investigating the public official that now the reason you would do such a thing\nOf course nobody knows if he's in the clear now are not nobody knows if this is an ongoing investigation of among other people in him\nOh it's it's it's definitely an ongoing investigation and be that bad that\nMight just for your um it's interesting we re ran an ad or basically talking about all this problem\nAnd his attorney wrote a cease and desist letter to the station and then the letter the attorney said a public reports have said that Andrew is not the subject\nOf the investigation but as you know mark some of these bugs words you can be a subject of an investigation you can also be a target of the investigation his own campaign attorney\nDid not put in that letter that Andrew is not a target he just said he ... not a subject so that to me is is a is an interesting er mission or because the bottom line is\nWhy would they be investigating corruption in city hall if it had nothing to do with the mayor you wouldn't have had those FBI agents around him on these trips like they were on\nEnron descent as he immediately tried to racialized decision that the reason you were bringing it up and for that matter I guess a local media is bringing up is because of his race\nNow last time I checked it has nothing to do with somebody's race when there's an undercover agent giving somebody I'm a value to try and see if they'll take it and he took it has nothing to do with race and I notice he tried to do this over and over and over again in this campaign let me ask you a question your running mate who is your running mate\nYou know here we have even criminal aliens in the case of of your son grant or how long was the murder of your son in jail before he was let out and not to hand it over the ice\n[laughter] well actually the American voter grant never served a day in jail or prison for his his prior conviction\n... never served a day and and you see this all the time with a lot of these illegal immigrants they played it down or they use their ... status or you know their children they use their children I mean I've got anchor babies I don't have anybody to take care of them you know they use this all the time and\nWe really want to talk about child separation edits and its finality um and the president was the one that fixed it even though it existed in the Obama and Bush years you're experiencing child separation forever there's no hope your son was murdered ... we can't bring him back from the dead\nNo shot him and it's like I told people I spend Christmas we put up a Christmas tree and grapes grave I spent just birthdays and most of the other holidays we spend with him at his great I mean we we don't\nThat's the only way we have to be with him\nObviously you know everybody believes in God it believes in ... she's with us all the ... ... you need a place to go visit him and that's likely place\nAnd so you have all these angel families that that is what they do this is what they have we're never going to see that they get the illegals that are bringing their children are using other children and screaming about separation\nThey're going to get to see their children to get there going to be reunited by law within seven to twelve day that's by law\nI don't know I I just want to thank you for what you're doing your you know I listen to your when your strength and\nAnd obviously you're trying to prevent this from happening all we're really asking for nobody is against immigration we just want it to be legal we want to be able to vet the people that come into this country they've got to be able to take care of themselves and we want to know that they have the best interests of this country and love of this country that we have\nAnd I'm not going to be a burden or a threat to any of our our citizens that are here and we don't have control of it now but anyway
