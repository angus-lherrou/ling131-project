it surely influenced the judgment of other news providers\nWhile a few publications newspapers like the post a and PM in New York in magazines like the nation and the New Republic showed more conspicuous concern\nThe New York times is coverage generally took the view that the atrocities inflicted upon Europe's Jews while horrific were not significantly different from those visited about other war victims more and more noteworthy\nOnly six times in nearly six years did the times front page mentioned Jews as Hitler's unique target for a total annihilation only once was there said the subject of elite editorial once only twice stood there rescue inspired passionate\nCry prize in the Sunday magazine\nAnd it goes on\nThis is the history of the New York times which is completely ignored just as the history of the Democratic party in slavery\nIt's connection with the Klan segregation bull\nConnor George Wallace literacy tests poll taxes just as the Democratic party's connection with all of that\nIs whitewashed out of our history so too\nIs the media's cover up about Holocaust during World War two\nCNN MSNBC CBS NBC ABC that New York\nTimes the Washington Post they've never come to grips with this and they never intended\n\nWhat exactly is it that Donald Trump has done to the news media has a rounded up reporters since the shutdown newspapers as he picked the FBI on them like Obama did he's done none of these things\nHe dares to call them out by name\n\nBoth the outlets\nAny individual he dares to speak the truth about what's happening in this country when it comes to the media and the growth thing and the agenda\n\nWe know from their own reporting that the vast majority of them are Democrats not independence Democrats we know from their own reporting that the vast majority of them are liberal\n\nAnd that they claim to be professionals what makes Jim Acosta professional what other standards what makes Don Lemon a professional what other standard\n\nThis Trump painting on top of very horrific tragedy that occurs\nIn this country is absolutely insane and sickening\nThat's why this election in eight days is so important they are trying to drive you\nAnd Dr people who are on the fence away from this president\nThere trying to reverse the outcome of the twenty sixteen election\n\nThey're trying to bring down this administration\n\nThere is no other explanation for this none\n\nThey believe that they are power on to themselves I don't mean to hear from these modern reporter so called\nAbout freedom of the press and the history of freedom of the press they have no idea about the history of freedom and the press in this country\nNone whatsoever that the press\nAlways so free in this country\nAnd yet\nHad great patriots\nBefore the revolution during the revolution after the revolution during the constitutional period great\nPatriots\nWho not only reported news who supported the founding principles of this country\nIs that what Jake Tapper supports\n\nThe founding principles of this country\n\nIs that what Rachel Maddow supports the founding principles of this country as an institution is that what CNN support for the New York times is that with the Washington Post support and all the rest of them the founding principles of this country you bring up the founding principles of this country your mom your attack as they right winger\n\nThat's a throwback\n\nIf you don't embrace the progressive agenda abortion on demand\n\nOr undefined genitalia of massive spending massive debt open borders then you're attacked\nWe have people trying to get into this country organized by leftist spoke on the other side of the border and in this border\nWe know from some serious reporting from Fox and some others that it does in fact include criminals former criminals and gang members but even that aside\nThousands and thousands of people marching toward our border and the president United States says no he's voted fifty two hundred and the military to block their entrance and for the seats are racist\n\nPresent the United states is no to people coming here claiming a refugee status from some of the\nDangerous parts of the world breeding terrorism whether it's\nCivil war six countries there are a Muslim majority countries and yet the vast majority of Muslim countries\nWhere the vast majority of Muslims live are not on the list for them is trying to protect the American people as Obama try as Franklin Roosevelt would try as others would try to pass\nThey tried to characterize it as a racist and yet the Supreme Court in the United states pal this decision\n\nHe speaks the truth you know when Harry Truman would speak the truth they would call them planes speaking\nHiring but they don't call Trump planes speaking Donald do they he's been compared to Hitler for what\nHe's been called a racist for what Charlottesville they tell us did he support the neo Nazis and the clan in Charlottesville did I miss something did I miss something of course he didn't\nOf course he didn't he supports law enforcement\n\nAnd yet look at the paint the picture they pay\nOn the immigration

the air and bizarrely defended the use of blackface\nHalloween causes which he then he should've pretty full some apology that was not enough for NBC which are just a year and a half ago is sixty nine million dollar deal after she had made her career and her name of course\nAt Fox News it's clear now there was a lot of tension behind the scenes Megan Kelly didn't feel she was supported by the brass at NBC NBC was leaning against or made clear that\nNews chairman Andrew lack was condemning her remarks the staff was in ... but if the ratings were higher ratings have been a disappointment this might have been into day controversy NBC might have accepted the apology and moved on and said it became the final straw leaving a Megan Kelly decide what she's going to do next\nShe was such a store here in Fox in the morning she didn't prove to be such a great fit with uranium in and how we are as Fox News\nThe renovations presents\nChampionship cybersecurity\nJoins ... renovations cocktails in

looking out for you or Martin live in ... in Ninety two sons most any leaning dogs [laughter]\n\nMore logical lousy by law that Martin live on a show\nNow that have seven seven three one two three a one one one of the key Senate races in this country is in the show me state Missouri\nAnd a and an excellent Republican Kennedy Josh Hawley versus Claire McCaskill Josh Hawley how are you sir\nI'm doing great thanks so much for having me\nWell it's my pleasure every election cycle Claire McCaskill tries to remake herself into some kind of a moderate I just solar interviewed on Fox where she says hey look with Trump half the time and I left post Kavanaugh because of his views on foreign money in campaigns and\nNow are the people in misery going to buy this trick one more time\nNo they're not you know Senator McCaskill is trailing in the polls that she's a she's a little desperate to be honest with you\nMark and uh as you should be because listen I mean she is out of step with the voters of the state it's just that simple I mean they told her that they wanted her to get with the program they voted for two thousand sixteen by twenty points by the way President Trump won the state by twenty\nAt dinner McCaskill turns around to vote no on Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme Court no one justice Kavanaugh no on the tax cuts no on border security no on rebuilding the military I mean it's just as she could not be we're out of step\nWhat does she running a New Yorker Missouri\nYeah exactly well most of her money comes from New York and California that she'd be a great senator from one of those places but for this state hardly and that is that's our big problem and that's why she's down in the poll or she is just out of touch with the people of our good state\nI mean she really is a left us to be perfectly honest with you or votes really are not much different from a Bernie Sanders or a Chuck Schumer and of course she will vote to make Chuck Schumer the leader of her up of the uh the Democrats in the Senate and she does that every time right\nAbsolutely she votes with him about Ninety percent of the time she has accepted twenty six million dollars and expenditures are from Chuck Schumer he has spent more money in Missouri than anywhere else in the country\nTrying to prop up but Senator McCaskill ended up by her seat and you know that's the kind of thing that Missouri's just don't take too well I mean they they don't want anybody coming in and tell them how to vote and they have Chuck Schumer come into our state and try to buy the seat it just isn't flying\nThe the top three issues in Missouri or as far as you see them what are they in one of your positions on\nWhile I Would start with pro constitution judges and what happened to justice Cavanaugh is a big big issue in this race it really exposed I think the left thirst for power\nThe radical nature of their agenda and the fact that they have not accepted\nAnd are not willing to accept the results of the two thousand sixteen election and the rule of we the people you know they want to do everything they can to try to get their hands on power to undo what we the people have said and that is a huge issue in this race\nImmigration is a huge issue in this race border security especially with this caravan as it continues to master the move towards the border Claire McCaskill is sponsoring and open borders bill in Congress\nThe most radical open borders bill ever introduced and that that is a huge huge issue and then I think a a economic growth wage growth Senator McCaskill voted against\nThe middle class tax cuts she's voted over two hundred times to raise taxes in Congress and that people want somebody's going to be a fighter for\nThe middle class and workers and not just another big government liberal\nBut you know these big government liberals think they found an issue you know that's pre existing conditions on health care and they keep running around the country and every state by the way including your state with McCaskill saying you will oppose us a message of protecting people with pre existing conditions is that your position and she just trying to make that your position\nOh she's just trying to make that my ... at the total and ridiculous faucet and she knows it and I called her out on many times in our debates\nI support of forcing insurance companies to cover folks with preexisting conditions on the same terms everybody else here's the difference mark I don't think we need Obamacare to do it and I think that we should stop holding hostage\nPatients who have pre existing conditions and everybody else too by the way holding them all hostage to Obamacare in my state income health care prices have increased a hundred and forty five percent\nOn those health care exchanges that at the national average things a hundred and two percent which is terrible but in Missouri it's a hundred and forty five percent families just can't afford their insurance\nThat's because of Obamacare it's because of Claire McCaskill she won't support any plan isn't Obamacare because she's a she's a big government liberal\nNow is she going on about Medicare for all or is she duct that one\nWell she she tries to duck because he says he's open to it you know she's open to of course we all know that that's\nWhere this is headed and we all know that that this she'll never vote against her party I mean she never does on edge any major issue an issue consequences and you know my worry is look they cut seven hundred and sixty billion dollars out of Medicare in order to pay for Obamacare imagine what they'll do\nTo pay for their government run health care scheme so you know it it is just a ... it will devastate folks who are or who have paid into the system that will devastate families who are just barely making it now and and trying to get a hold of private insurance and that this is part of the radical Democrat agenda Claire McCaskill's on board with\nThat you make a good point Medicare for all his Medicare for nobody because they have to abolish Medicare they have to abolish every employer based private plan they have to abolish all private insurance and basically turning us into one ... right\nControl of the house and the Senate or at stake in the midterms and it's up to us to find the most qualified candidates for

posting that for ... China has done that\nShe has ordered his generals to prepare for war with the west that saw Jim Acosta didn't ask a single question that he's the White House correspondent for CNN\nGo ahead\nAnd

behalf of millions of people I'm sure\nYou're ... you're not a journal your book you're a self promoting punk that's what you are we learn nothing from your series of self serving idiotic questions nothing\nLaw that's going on in the world you didn't ask a single question during that round anyway about what took place in Pittsburgh did you notice so carrying his of the people who were murdered didn't ask a single question about any president says we're the enemy to nothing\nAbout John Carl ABC News they're White House correspondent cut a go\nAnd look for someone who\nWe drove rallies somebody on a man covered with ah\nAttacks on the reviews phrase for for the president\nOn on the shooter days for somebody who was of seeing by the caravan\nFrozen with so much time for oh\nHe may have been provoked by the Caribbean but the president didn't create the care of him he didn't like the president because he was surrounded by Jews why why John called the leave that out\nAs for the

attack sloth in Pittsburgh and in the pipe bomb the very first thing the media did was blame the\nPresident and make him responsible for these ridiculous [laughter]\nAccent is outrageous that that would be the very first reaction was so many people across the country I'm not finished the only person responsible\nFor carrying out either these heinous acts were the individuals who carried them out it's not the president no more than it was Bernie Sanders fault individual who shot up a baseball field of congressional Republicans\nYou can't start putting the responsibility of individuals on anybody but the individual who carries out across Germany\nJohn ... where are you concerned about the uh the rice and that was sent the Susan Collins\nOr to the president or to the secretary of defense for the head of the navy or how about the president's children\nWere you concerned about that did you talk about the Democrats and their tone did you go to Maxine Waters did you go to Adam Schiff how about you guys do you ever look in the mirror I mean I Know it's painful trust me we have to look at you guys did you ever look in the ...\nDid you ever think you guys your tone\nCalling a president Hitler calling him a racist calling a mentally unhinged calling for the twenty Fifth Amendment or giving people a voice who call these things to say these things you ever think that you're not only contribute to this tone but you lead it because you're the media twenty four seven\nAnd not only in this country all over the world\nGo ahead\nPlease forgive me do the process to one sleazy claim here the president on what is\nThe news media all step in here thank you it is you guys\nDid you even hear yourself just now John Carl did you hear your buddy Jim Acosta\nIf you guys you don't stop and the president has critique you correctly\nHe's critique you correctly and you say that is a danger to freedom of the press why while it causes fake nose while you are fakes in many respects you're already a lot\nNow how he Jackson of NBC News let's hear what she had to say cut Penn go\n... of course of history than either of us can lead to send in\nBalance system in terms of coming up to look at what point does the White House how\nBecause of the terms I think that the president I've defended the president fighting back when he was regularly attack there's a difference does it matter if there's a mid term or not the president's going to defend himself and he's going to fight back\nFrom a political for say right if you're making that from any perspective what point does a national tragedy take precedence over the president needs to punch fat is ... that's a fascinating\nQuestion let me ask you something Halley Jackson at one point to the media stopped creating scenarios where the president feels he needs to punch back\nWhy have you drag Donald Trump\nInto what a deranged Jew hating mass murder did you know he has no responsibility for whatsoever any more than ... Obama had any responsibility for the fourteen mass murders that took place on his watch anymore than Bernie Sanders has responsibility\nFor the killer though what the killer who was shooting at least in the others\nWhat kind of reporting is this\nGo ahead\nYou saw the president I Do exactly that in the wake of the national tragedy not just this week uh but every time our country has experienced the type of heartache and pain that we have over the last week\nThis is a president who's risen to that occasion a and works and bring our country together in a number of occasions whether it's the hurricanes weather you know let me let me\nLet me show Haley Jackson Jim Acosta drunk car I mean I Know that these three stooges won't get it but let's try anyway let me show you exactly what the president means\nAbout how you people conduct yourself Rob by Jeffrey Mars\nIs the rabbi the synagogue right Mr producer he's dealing with this horrific tragedy that took place in his congregation eleven congregants murdered in cold blood most of them senior citizens all of them uh fifty four years old or older\nYes slaughter you're the head of public safety in Pittsburgh and the uh and they had to the FBI that region say it was the most horrible scene they've ever seen in their careers is horrific this rabbi\nOn the ground needs to deal with it needs to deal with what took place in a synagogue needs to deal with his congregants and no doubt he knew these wonderful eleven people intimately and I want you to listen\nAnd Allison ... at CNN\nThis is really diabolical stuff this guy's really a ...\nBalance of nature's fruits and veggies in a capsule\nI care once in\nWhile ago I was walking and find that site right right and I don't know what happened I had the actor that stuff that my aunt and my great and I notice that I accept that it I don't have that war\nIs one thing that I Am very happy when I don't feel any that he in Asia them but like it's like my kids are getting killed it's just wonderful I I'm very very ... of this product\nFor a little bit of time used discount code mark to receive a fifty percent discount on your first preferred whole health system an avid shipped to you free call one eight hundred two four six eight seven five one or go on line to balance of nature dot com again use discount code mark\nBrand is coming over them and smack dab in the middle of the\nTerrible\nThank you for your voice\nIs going to be a restaurant\nGemini dogs know relating talk\nNow\nAbout a year and rock bottom line [noise] Nineteen Seventy three delete their first album how do you want to the U.S and the u._k. and you want to die or make her\n[noise]\nWe run\nAn ad in the long train running in China rose\nLaunching in and out by the\nWay it would reduce Harrison Ford the ones we love them when I'm living in the world goes to them and it's just you and me and\n\nDown to watch one summer jam lauded run every all\nAnd in August the same on their\nOwn leaders rambling\nListening to her radio\nI think of it at ... election is Amr here ...\nFollow these practical tonight as yourself with the voting systems review your sample ballot and bring it with the news and the guy he must be registered to vote on election day\nOn my phone in your home printing your sample ballot provide that information\nFrom like I'm a county board of elections when\nWe are cayenne as the\n[noise]\nYou\nWere afternoons are now more simulated Mars limit on CNN the AMC even Ninety two songs most stimulating talk\n[noise] some people told me about the Tea Party we are the Tea Party calling now ...

then we'll get an all the rest of the\nPaul Ryan said something today that I thought it was quite interesting being the constitutional scholars ideas and here's what he said about birthright citizenship and the president by the way the president didn't bring it up\nI heard one of the miscreants on on cable say the president brings this stuff up the divide than they first of all he was asked about it he didn't bring it up secondly it's not about dividing the nation it's about upholding the constitution okay\nNobody really knows how birthright citizenship was instituted we've investigated this\nIt started in the sixties you're chronically the old ins started doing triggered it that way as the bureaucracy does this all the time there's been no law passed that conveys birthright citizenship on to illegal aliens\nThere's been no Supreme Court decision that definitively confirmed birthright citizenship onto illegal alien children\nNobody's a hundred percent certain how this came to be\n\nBut everybody seems to be a hundred percent certain that the president can't fix it so the executive branch unilaterally somehow somewhere in the bureaucracy decided to interpret this as it's being interpreted today nobody knows exactly who exactly what office but there it is and so when the president is asked\nAbout it and says how did you find out about this yeah we're working on an executive no you can't\nChange the constitution by executive order well does the constitution confer birthright citizenship on the children of illegal aliens\nOf course it doesn't which all explaining a minute that here's the\nCurrent speaker of the house Paul Ryan ... silent for months but now he feels compelled to speak yeah go ahead\nWell you obviously cannot do that um you cannot in birthright citizenship with an executive order we didn't\nLike it when Obama tried changing immigration laws the executive action and obviously as conservatives um you know we believe in in in the constitution [noise] you know the conservative I'm a believer and following the plain text of the constitution and I think in this case the fourteenth amendment ... pretty clear [laughter] um and that would involve a very very laying the constitutional process\nThe ignorance on this subject like so many others is unbelievable the speaker of the house who cares not one ... about the history of the fourteenth amendment not one where\nYou have so called experts constitutional experts professors former trial judges in New Jersey who say the same exact same ignorant beyond belief illiterate when they come to the fourteenth amendment\nSo I decided let's play a little piece that I did in twenty Fifteen\nOver three years ago we can go back further but that's long enough to provide a basic foundation of understanding of what those who wrote the fourteenth amendment and ratified the fourteenth amendment actually meant that's got to cut Eighteen go\nAnd yet nobody did a better job of explaining this then professor Edward earlier who I've talked about over the years\nAnd he's a professor at California State University who was also at the er Claremont Institute senior fellow there are more than a evidence to me right\nAnd he testified before a subcommittee a Congress many years ago almost Twenty years ago and he set forth the case now he's not the only one professor Thomas west has a you know ... has professor at the University of Texas law school maybe more than them the framers of the constitution\n\nOr set forth that is a primary the fourteenth amendment go have after the civil war three amendments to the constitution the Thirteen fourteen Fifteen called the civil war amendments and we know pretty much what occurred\nProfessor earlier was testifying you said it's my considered opinion Congress has the authority under section five of the Fourth Amendment\nTo define the jurisdiction of the United states of the fourteenth amendment accords and did it as my contention that Congress has exercise that power on many occasions and most recently and immigration reform of control lack of Nineteen eighty six and I would say they also exercise that\nWith the illegal immigration reform an immigrant responsibility act ... Ninety six\nHe points out senator Jacob how're you are now going to know more than anybody else ladies and gentlemen you know one of the things I find when I signed books and it's good to do it because I get to talk to so many of you people say mark\nYour show is different because you really get into the substance now we have fun don't get me wrong we do our thing too but we do really get into the substance it's one thing to say yeah yeah yeah obviously the constitution doesn't provide that's not enough\n\nThat's not enough so when you were in a debate format or political format or a classroom format or this format you need to back it up and that's what we do here we\nBack it up senator Jacob Howard the author of the citizenship clause in the fourteenth amendment he spoke he told us what he meant\nHe defined who would fall within the quote jurisdiction of the United states unquote ready quote\nEvery person born within the limits of the United states and subject to their ... meaning the states there just is\nIs by virtue of natural law national law a citizen of the United states this well not of course include persons born in the United states or foreigners\nAliens who belong to the families have been ... foreign ministers credited or the government of the United states\nBut will include every other class a person's it settles the great question of citizenship and removes all doubt as to what persons are or are not citizens of the United states this has long been a great issue in the ... prudence and legislation of this country\nWhich the call screener Mr producer you understand that right\nIs it not plain English is he not as clear as can be that it does not include alliums that does not include foreigners that does not include families are within bachelors or foreign ministers\nSo the author of citizenship clause intended to count foreigners aliens or those born to a bachelor's foreign ministers as outside the jurisdiction of the United states that senator Jacob Howard he knew as just referenced the natural law indicates\nThat the Republican base is little are Republican basis for citizenship\nIs consent\nEight hundred three nine o nine

Ninety two sons most stimulating talk [noise]\nOur love and making conservatism grazing dial in age seven seven three one two three a one one [noise]\nSo in the Nineteen sixties Nineteen seventies\nSomehow somewhere the bureaucracy began\nNot even interpreting the constitution just conveying citizenship on the children of illegal aliens there's absolutely no historical basis for this there's no constitutional basis for this there's no statutory basis for this\n[noise] my buddy Andy McCarthy wrote a brilliant piece of national news he's wanted to do and he said well the fourteenth amendment has been codified was in Nineteen fifty two I think he said well that doesn't really in my humble opinion address the issue\nCato find the constitution as a way of describing an aspect of a statute is really\nPretty a pretty frequent practice it doesn't really lend anything to the interpretation but we know what the authors of the fourteenth amendment meant because they told us we have no real Supreme Court decision\nAre conveying a citizenship on the children of illegal aliens\nAnd then we have Paul Ryan let's play cuts six again Mr boost and Paul Ryan saying that you can't change the constitution with an executive order who is changing the constitution it's the executive branch the president of the United states who is the executive branch checking back being Saudi do interpret and enforce the fourteenth amendment go ahead\nWell you obviously cannot do that um you cannot in birthright citizenship with an executive order we didn't like it when Obama tried changing immigration laws the executive action and obviously\nElectrons who's changing immigration laws you know I brought\nAs a guest here Daniel Horwitz who's an expert in this area as he is in many incredibly intelligent you write so very conservative review a and a Daniel Horwitz what is Speaker Ryan even talking about\nOh great to be with you mark and first of all condolences on the last year patriot dead he's a he's in a better place thank you um you know this is constitutional constitutionally illiterate I cannot relate to what these people are saying let's put this in plain English here basically\nThey're saying mark I could break into your home kicked down the door drop the kid there and he has the right to live there for the remainder of his life and there's not a darn thing you could do about it even henceforth that's what they're basically saying it's nothing to do with the president there arguing we can't even do this through Congress or the reality is\nThat even if we agree to the notion of birthright citizenship that there is a legal mandate a floor requiring\nA Congress and the executive branch to issue a citizenship to any child of any legal immigrant under any circumstance as the court did in ... a very activist decision but let's agree to that\nThere is no way you could extrapolate that to people who came here without consent the key words are consent and sovereignty nothing ever supersede that nobody could unilaterally assert jurisdiction\nAnd uh make it that there's nothing we can do to stop this and I think mark more broadly speaking what the disturbing trend we're seeing is that throughout the last number of decades past administrations have actually use the executive power to subvert sovereignty\nIt looks like Trump is doing a lot of things executive late but the details matter and what he's doing is actually pursuing the law and as you mentioned there is nothing in statute requiring this and it all actually happened by accident through laziness and lack of enforcement\nExplain that because people are under the impression including the current speaker of the house who's taken an oath to uphold the constitution and some of these fools on TV who pretend they're experts they seem to think\nThat the fourteenth amendment says what they say it says now were originally this and that includes ... lists and you look at the language as intended as written at the time and they tell us exactly what they meant and nowhere do they mean affirmatively giving citizenship to children of illegal aliens\nI think this is where some of our colleagues go awry ... doesn't mean Amelia Delia style liberalism right on even if it didn't say and subject to the jurisdiction thereof if it's just that anyone born in the U.S is a citizen I got news for them\nFor a hundred and Thirty years there's an uninterrupted stream of case law including cases written by the one Kim arc justice Horace Gray saying that if you come here without consent\nAnd you do not have legal status it is in the most literal and physical sense as if you were standing outside of our boundaries in terms of access\nTo the court in terms of rights in terms of everything so literally you are not on our soil and and that is settled law so when Congress nearly cut and paste the text of the fourteenth amendment in Nineteen fifty two they could've never fathom such an egregious argument\nThat the cars in Nineteen fifty to the constitution was not interpret it as giving citizenship to the children of illegal aliens\nExactly it's like saying proved to me that the fourteenth amendment didn't mean to mandate gay marriage will I mean no one would have thought that and and and that's the thing here what are the best I could see from my research is that\nFor most of our history we didn't have too many illegal aliens in the early part of the twentieth century it was in the sixties and seventies and eighties it started to grow", "show_name": "Mark Levin
