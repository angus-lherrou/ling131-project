F.\nAnd what ... said today can we can we play that this is what ... said in the White House we played it in the first hour I'm not afraid of it I don't think the Kanye West a rapper who drops M. F. word a lot was going to somehow changes tune with the president here's what he had to say today\nThat's not worrying about the future all we really have is today we just have the day over and over and over again the eternal return the hero's journey and proper his on his hero's journey\nRight now and he might not have expected to have a crazy movie like kind of a west run up and a\nSupport\nDon't ... don't forget Kanye West also as a uneducated black man now because he's supporting Trump\nScalia was what happens when negroes don't read 'em and then we have this now and now Donald Trump is going to use it in perverted and he's going to have somebody who can stand with him and take pictures\n[laughter] God [laughter] I must say black\nFolks are about to train Kanye West and the racial draft okay they've had it with him and he's an attention more like the president he's all of a sudden now that that the model spokes person he's he's the token negro of the of the Trump Administration\nThis is ridiculous and no one should be taking Kanye West seriously he's clearly has issues he's already been hospitalized he's already been hospitalized\nHospitalized he's already been hospitalized so we're going to slander do because he doesn't agree with that one at eight seven seven three eight one thirty eight eleven once you get to your phone calls on this one Madeline you are on the marquee event show than Ferguson filling in an eye hello\nAnd thank you so much and I get an excellent job throwing in for mark\nThank you I appreciate that\nThank you um I had two comments one I Want to let you know first of all that I suffer from depression and I had a suicide attempt the number of years ago I Am doing somewhat better but I'm a couple of years ago I realized that I was probably living a little bit ahead of my time and that society was dying in this direction as a whole\nUm even though I had depression I didn't have any kind of psychosis or thoughts disturbances when I started winning and mental health housing and they spoke out\nAbout somebody abuses that were going on\nAnd from the you know quake nut rolls and what have you all of a sudden I seem to have like thoughts disturbances although no one could that explain to me what it was prior to that no one ever thought it had anything but you know mental illness from depression\nAnd uh then they made up story that I was violent and I got kicked out at two places even up to the age of forty four years old I never had any kind of history of anything on a new homeless twice I Lived in my car but it's also suicide prevention month\nAnd I think by making it sound as though ... some kind of mental illness whether he ... is not even the issue because as you said they had nothing to say that about him the four of them spoke out about Bush\nIt makes it very difficult I think the young men in particular\nWasn't it wasn't emailed her day was it yesterday if I'm not mistaken mental health awareness day\nIt's a whole month you know how it is unfortunately a lot of there's a month every now and they must be honest you know but it's supposed to be\nHis technically we're just it just so people know that we were when we make it\nClear what it yesterday was world mental health day two dozen Eighteen World Health a world mental health day uh it's it's on October the tent that's the reason I say this is where's the compassion and and I\nSay this first of all thank you for your sharing your story and I'm I'm so thankful that you were unsuccessful when your attempt to take your life ah I ... my best friend in college um took his own life and it is something that sticks with me in an all of our close friend group ever since and I have\nGreat compassion for\nThose that suffer with mental health and it's something that we shouldn't make fun of but to to score political points with Kanye West as the left is doing saying you know we're clearly and again they say that the president's taking advantage of a man who clearly has mental health issues as a token\nOr a black man uh and and there and he's taking advantage abusing him by putting them out there today no one said any of that\nWhen Kanye West came out and said George Bush doesn't like black people\nBecause it was a narrative they wanted to be out there it was the narrative that they want it they they they were OK with that narrative then you are on the more ... than we did not go ahead\nStole my thunder but the uh uh President Bush hates black people man I was like I was part of it that um they check this out so now Herschel Walker is going to be the next soaking negro because he said that Don Lemon should be fired\nThat he has done in ... and he didn't get all the other dictating\nHow have you has not said

Fox News pastor Andrew runs in the American being held in Turkey on terror charges on route to the U.S he was free this morning by Turkish officials and preserving two years of house arrest on terrorism charges President Trump on his way to a rally in Cincinnati happy with any of these\nIt says sliding scale of morality and all told we only had our public opinion changed by seven percent that entire process that was at seven percent in other words most people are pretty stuck in their basic morality\nTimes people will go you know how is it the best friend I've had over a year turned around and stab me in the back\nWell that's all part of the sliding scale morality\nAnd I'll tell you how it's playing out you've seen in your own life no doubt maybe with your friends certainly with anybody you discuss politics whether you might disagree with and just the overall frustration Jew might have about politics in this country let alone\nThe moral outrage but moral outrage by the media on back of ... a visiting President Trump here's how the sliding scale morality\nUnless you're potentially this bond is Satan you're probably not evil so how hold out the possibility I dunno Chuck Schumer I've you'd be so maybe you know as long as you're not the the sponsor saying or or maybe Chuck Schumer you're not pure evil and none of us are perfect\nSo out of steel wants to say that one is evil ten is perfection we're all Tuesday nights\nAnd therefore at our best were really having a good day and where our best versions of ourself we're going to be at the upper end up whatever our morality is let's say you have a really honest in decent person really honest a decent person might be an eight\nMaybe on their worst day there are five now what does that mean well means that\nI'm not going to hurt you even when I'm at my worst I'm not gonna hurt you because I'm a decent person more than not well let's say that you start out and on that sliding scale morality your sex and so you're a\nDecent person throughout much of your your life\nBut when adversity strikes when something goes south what happens you slide back three not just suddenly were three oh sure you're going to hurt somebody if it means taking care of yourself if it means putting you arrange for his first you will take others down\nThat's how the sliding scale morality wars that's how people will stab others in the back when you have thought they were your friends are right kind of get the idea here so let's talk about the sliding scale of morality a little bit\nSo many people so many people have been reaching out been frustrated how is it still\nThat you have people that defend Christine foreign how is it that you still have people that will say that Brett Kavanaugh's rapists when he wasn't even accused of rape by the way\nWell I mean by anybody other than I have an idea I guess\nThe answer comes down to the sliding scale of morality if you don't have a real moral compass you don't start out in a high place the morality to begin with\n... you can make it up as you go every day you view of things through the prism that you create\nA little bit later in the show I'm going to talk about UN's climate science and what frauds they are along with Medicare and the fraud that is Medicare for all its financial fraud the conversation\nThe reality it's fraud bunch of people lying to you\nBut it's all part of our morality today to where I can lie to you\nIf it suits me and when politicians do it and it works you're going to get more of it and people will embrace it to the extent that it makes them feel good or to the extent that it justifies their existence and I'll give you an example\nI've always had this rule that if somebody reaches out to me and they don't use profanity I'll get around and respond to them this was a listener talking about Christine for\nAnd I mentioned that hey she committed perjury\nAnd she I Believe should ultimately be tried for it now\nI had somebody saying well her witnesses the ones that ended up refuting her claims maybe maybe they were the ones who weren't being honest and this list there said there may be many reasons why they refuted the claims one of which could be they didn't remember\nAnother might be that they didn't want the death threats to their families oh okay cool cool so you can committed felonies\nWhenever you feel like as long as your reasons are good enough\nIf a sliding scale of morality\nAnd when we're talking about the sliding scale morality and we're talking about Kanye West and the moral outrage by the media are you kidding me are you kidding me Twenty years ago today\nWhat were we talking about and what do you think of when you heard Oval Office\nCertainly wasn't about the president of the United states it has something to do with what was on that blue dress\nAnd so for the very media that sucked up to William Jefferson Clinton to have moral outrage over profanity being utilized by Kanye West in the oval office that is one heck of a sliding scale of morality and that is the world we live in today and so more\nThan ever before it's important to know where your moral compass happens to be\nOr you five or six or seven and eight where are you where when you're at your best where are you when you're at your worst when you are inviting people into your life who are they knew where they\nAre they six is not a good day and three is not a bad day\n\nYou know last week I was talking a bit about beating your head against the wall a lot of folks want to know how do you become more persuasive how can you convince people of things politically\nAnd I mentioned the unfortunate reality which is you have to find people who are open to uh to information the first place and the problem is you don't have a lot of open minded people out there as I pointed out with a cabinet deal there were only seven percent of folks top to bottom they ever had their opinion changed about him seven percent through everything that's it\nSo you've got to find people that are open minded and open to information as the pointed out a lot of them happened to be younger\nBut at the same is true when we're talking about who are engaging in in our lives if you don't want to be frustrated if you don't want to be stabbed in the back\nIf you want to find people that can make you feel better about yourself and add something positive to your life you got to figure out where their morality is because anymore\nA morality is on display each and every day and it's being perpetuated by a political party each and every day including by a former attorney general who happens to now be saying well go ahead and kick the opposition that's the world we now live in\nSo ... and well look at how far we've come and just Thirteen Years\nRemember the last time we were talking about Kanye West and the president well that was a little bit of a different story\nAnd over the past Thirteen Years a few things have changed and ... who is working right now and a few things about this economy and that's where we're going to pick up next right here it is Brian mud filling in for the great one month\nHim more greatness as

Bush was a racist no [laughter] I did I Do want\nDuring the country in the relief effort when we did have the ... George Bush doesn't like black people yes was I miss memorized by Michael Meyers in what his reaction was as that entire thing was taking place yes\nIn fact I actually went back in and watch that but a lot of uh the the little series there earlier today and it's amazing it's as entertaining today is that was the moment it happened\nIt made me more so because that just came out of left field so you didn't necessarily understand what was happening until it happened because the George Bush doesn't like black people that was the culmination of everything that had been building up for about two minutes and Michael Meyers the entire time\nHe's looking he'll look it gone you know look at the teleprompter ill or get gun yet and then at one point during Tanya is kind of ran\nHe said Red Cross and Michael Meyers nuts\n[laughter] but yeah\nIt is bad you know we got George Bush doesn't like black people and Michael Meyers picks up starts reading the teleprompter\nAnd all the time moment anyway no I don't think George Bush was is a racist but what I Do think that he and many establishment Republicans engaged in is the belief that you know what we can't win there\nAnd if you don't try hard if you don't try to Institute policies that make that big of a difference if you aren't willing to have the politically incorrect conversations well guess what\nMaybe you're not going to have the success you need and I'm not talking about politically because again if you want to have political success with somebody what do you have to do you have to prove to them\nThat you can make a difference and as we're talking about record low minority unemployment rates\nEspecially with the black community that's a Donald Trump story so you can sit there and you can say Donald Trump is is a raises Donald Trump is or whatever but you know what Donald Trump is responsible for an economy that has more black adults at work than ever before\nIt has hundreds of thousands of your families on welfare it's providing a passing in American Dream for people who didn't think it was possible and told you had to sit here and collect government assistance that's what Donald Trump is doing\nNever forget I've lived many lives even though I'm I'm not all that old I a pack a lot into a given day [laughter] [noise] it's an understatement given that I Do to morning shows and you know keep going\nBe

was being told that she was going to end up losing some of her government assistance unless she worked less because she was making too much money\nThey were actually telling her to earn less and she was telling them that she wanted to make something out of her life now we're going back nearly Twenty years ago now what do you think takes place in today's environment\nThat's why it took a sea change that's why it took a catalyst it at a gang James like Donald Trump in so many different respects to break through how many good economies have we had we had a great economy in the eighties into the nineties\nWhy didn't we have record low black unemployment back then\nThe economy was good and the early part of the two thousands why didn't we have a record low black unemployment then\nBronco bomb I mean come on now\nWell of course open change when it was a bunch of bull crap\nBut I mean he he cares about black people right I mean come on look at them\nWell yeah he he cares about having their vote which means you need to keep 'em on government assistance keeping the economy that's mediocre keeping economy that will not allow people to have a word my building boom gum right where you need all okay so now we have Donald Trump we have record low minority unemployment rates across the board but what do you say you\nSee somebody like Tania who obviously is not an ideologue ... not a
