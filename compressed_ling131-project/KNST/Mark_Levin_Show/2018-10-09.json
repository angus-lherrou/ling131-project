pass through think about it now\nI'm not saying they haven't had big wins they had they had the stimulus Obamacare let's not put her head in the sand to pretend that didn't happen but the big ticket items the liberals on abortion on demand\nBob ... a basic income Medicare for all these are big ticket big monstrous platinum and gold winning items for the liberals they have no national mandate

Kevin ... on the U.S Supreme Court number one the biggest winner I think is due process in fairness the\nPrincipal and old fashioned principle that the mob does not rule and not the presumption of innocence supplies and that some sort of substantive and procedural due process must apply the second big winner is my president Donald\nJohn Trump not ching one more victory and his first what a twenty two months in office the trumps scored a hundred and Democrats have scored zero the economy is percolating like crazy the Mexico Canadian trade battle\nIs won by Trump including South Korea\nNext fall will be the goddess havens in Beijing and communist red China that takes about five hundred billion dollars a year so it in the last ten years they've taken out something like five trillion dollars to build their country and at the end of the day they need us\nA lot more than we need them so when Trump gets done with the Chinese is going to be the same thing that happened with Canada Mexico and South Korea\nAnd now according harassment and they came out today that Trump's approval rating is sort of fifty one percent\nSo whether it's the economy immigration are federal judges I could not think\nOf a better president than Donald John Trump he makes Reagan almost looked like a liberal because unlike Reagan and the bushes who were pinned cushions this guy fights back when Trump is hit\nIts back Carter what he did on a Monday Night last night with the Supreme Court saying that I hereby find you not guilty judge Kavanaugh you are an innocent man\nAnd he went after the Democrats with the other eight members of the Supreme Court sitting there and the Republicans to me it was beautiful it was wonderful this guy's got no backup and them only has stack up it continues to teach all of us about winning in Trump's world it's about the fight and you're fighting spirit and your ability to be bare knuckle and think about this\nKavanaugh was a Yale middle aged judge who are educated and yell undergraduate and Moscow spend about twelve years on the second circuit court of appeals\nHe's not the kind of guy to fight like Trump but when they push Kevin off further and further and further cabin all kind of local looked over Trump and said that's my model that's the guy I Want to be they\nNever imagined that they will be middle aged judge from Yale\nHeaded in him to fight back and no holds barred straight broiler fashion bigger But Kevin all studied Trump he learned from Trump so all of his brilliance and eloquence all of his ah all of his grade school girls' basketball coach\nIs she at Harvard would not helping ball to win this fight us people like Chris Wallace of Fox News\nSaid after the testimony of that liar and she was a liar Christine for she lied about what happened at a maximum she was mistaken at a minimum we might go over that later\nBut Chris Wallace of Fox News said after she testified that it's over for the Republicans the Republicans had a bad day I'm a trial attorney I see it all the time a witness testifies and and you buy and hook line and sinker and then the other witness testifies and you say you know what\nI don't know what to believe now Kevin all he in a sense hypnotic laid took on Trump's personality any thought no holds barred bare knuckles and guess what Kevin all one by Trump rules he knows that if you want something in your life bad enough you gotta fight for justice Trump proved\nAnd ah he won the Supreme Court after Christine\nForward testified about the second front door and about afraid to fly and about the claustrophobia and how it changed her life\nAnd I thought okay that's under refuted evidence Kevin I'll get up and spoke and you know what I thought I cannot believe cabinet and then I waited for the next week to transpire and it did and the next week clearly demonstrated that Christine forward was not telling the truth what was she lied or not it's a different matter\nBecause she said there were four witnesses in every one of her witnesses refuted a story or had no memory of the gathering question whatsoever the therapist notes were critical to this\nThat she released to the Washington Post but not to the U.S Senate committee she said for boys tried to rape her when she was in her late teens and the time was in the Nineteen eighties now she says it was one boy\nAnd it was a in at the age of Fifteen not or late teens and it was Nineteen eighty two not the Nineteen eighties and she flipped on that because in the Nineteen eighties Brett Kavanaugh was not even in Maryland He was in Connecticut\nSo everything she said that the therapist was probably accurate because she said at six years ago before politics entered the fracas\nSo when she said for boys tried to rape her she she was in her late teens what Eighteen or Nineteen years old and the Nineteen eighties what Nineteen eighty four eighty five eighty six\nThat didn't fit the scenario of Brett Kavanaugh\nSo she flipped and change what she was saying in order to try to take Kevin all down and it didn't work\nAnd the second front door was put in and twenty overweight and twenty nine because she wanted her psychologist slash therapist to have an office and a direct entry into her house into a room so the second front door was put in not because she was scared of only one exit but because a person she wanted to run out some of her house\nTo a small business owner a psychologist to have a direct entry way and of course the other thing was she was afraid to get on planes or boyfriend many years testify they took single propeller planes all over Hawaii that she traveled to Tahiti travel do ally travel to Central America travel to South America travel to Israel and travel to Europe\nHow is the disease swim all of these places hell no she flew everywhere including on single propeller planes which are quite claustrophobic if she was so nothing she said at any relationship to reality and over the week delay brought about by Jeff Flake\nWhose last name by adjective describes his character refuted what she said and that's why Susan Collins put up on Saturday about three o'clock and gave that great speech I never thought I Would say this\nSusan Collins is a profile in courage as is Lindsey Graham Mitch McConnell Brett Kavanaugh and of course the president Donald John Trump those are the big winners and now today Brett Kavanaugh his first day on the U.S Supreme Court I'm sure he's going to do great\nBut do not think for a moment to the fight is now over it's only just begun you fool we've got four more weeks to go\nI cannot imagine and America\nWhen Nancy Pelosi in charge of the house and Chuck Schumer in charge of the Senate and the investigations that would be launched and all the problems that arise so tonight I Want to get your perspective mark Levin is off until Monday he'll be back then it was some well deserved time off the great American

unreality guess what Ariel doom is pray Kevin O's life is not ruined\nHis name is not ruined his name is associate justice Brett Kavanaugh because he sat today this morning on the United States Supreme court where it's going to be for the next thirty to forty years but that's the mentality that we're fighting with\nPlus I Want to take up the cause and what's happening in Portland, Oregon did
