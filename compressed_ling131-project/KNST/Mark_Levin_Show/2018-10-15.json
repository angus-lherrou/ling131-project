Fox News President Trump and the first lady touring Aires to Florida and Georgia torn apart by hurricane Michael\nAnd they are used to doing this and winning because what happens they ask the questions the Republicans panic\nYou know listen there's this tax cuts and wealthy people are going to do well on to these types of of course they are they're wealthy they pay a lot of money in patches of course they're going to do well under a tax cut that's not the question the question is are middle class Americans working Americans going to do well to what is the economy going to grow\nBut instead of a Republican just answering like that oh yeah oh they have been a hawk and they're terrified and they'd backtrack and they let people like Leslie stall run the table\nBy framing framing the question to advance a narrative they are not looking for an answer they're looking to put you in a corner\nWhat Trump did in that interview was just beautiful and it is a PHD course in owning the lips completely it is a PHD course in how to handle the liberal media\nDoes not accept the premise of the question and turns the question to an answer he wants to answer not\nAnd the answer that's already a you know that they they think they're going to get out of abide by a pre existing narrative and trying to advance she re frames it\nIn his way\nPerfect example was the question about the Washington DC with Trump starts talking about how bad the media is this is eight eight is is Trump's narrative it's a narrative that is true by the way that the media is biased against the American people\nWere weapon to be conservative or even moderate Republicans\nThis is a that's a that's a almost total logical Trump knows that\nTrump is comfortable with that territory talking about the media and they're biased towards working class Americans and others right\nSo what does he do we re frames it Lesley Stahl who's smart\nShe's listened she's not dumb she's very bright she's just the liberal liberal you know pretending to be a journalist right\nShe automatically census Trump's getting into this media war she knows that works for him and she tries to stop him she cuts them off by the way she interviewed him I I saw something on Twitter the sixty four times and when they interviewed Obama they interrupted him four times\nBut we figured that because that's what they do right\nShe get the rub some to stop 'em because she knows she's now playing on on on the way a basketball court here she knows she's playing and his territory she tries to stop him\nHe doesn't have it he doesn't have it he keeps going and going because Trump knows that authenticity cells and he's going to be authentic\nEven if it comes with battle scars at all that's Trump's MO he is not going to talk and focus group tested talking points he's going to talk like Donald Trump talks period and the story right\nSo the takeaways here\nFor anybody thinking about or ... or interested at all in running for office becoming a conservative activists takeaway number one is you re framed the question to reframe the arguments went answer you want to get not to the pre existing narrative they want to advance\nTrump does it all the time watch you know folks\nThey sell this guy short constantly constantly the liberal media page this guy as some kind of a buffoon yet he is constantly having them back on their heels\nSo it makes no sense\nNow he did something else that's important not just that he turned around and reframe this thing\n\nHe got the last word and this is critical he would not let Leslie stall that sixty minutes and if you get the last word he gets the last word he did it constantly and he did it one time and what happened what's the benefit of getting the last word and they come on this is simple this is really easy\nTo benefit of getting the last word in is Utah class then that's what everybody remembers\nStole tries\nTo stop 'em on when he goes on this uh when he goes on attack with the media right and he keeps going and then he says at the end and you know Leslie and then that's why I'm president and you are not and boom that's what everybody remembers at the end\n\nFolks that's what I think this is the tough time the media is having with this guy\nThey don't understand that it's the sense of again a battle scars and all and authentic natural way of conversations sometimes it's sometimes it's heated sometimes it's not there are hills and valleys there are the natural\nVicissitudes of the ... the conversation he goes up he goes down but when he hits hits hard that people are attracted to that authenticity\nSo he understands he has to reframe it number one and secondly\nHe understands fully that he needs to get that last word in and he did and that's what everybody remembered\nBecause I'm president and you are not\nNow\nThe reason I bring this up is not to just you know law does performance at the point out what he did but to show you how that performance contrast what's what's going on in the Democratic party right now which is a just a litany of frauds in and out of the people who are completely inauthentic who they're they\nBased their entire campaigns around identity politics in class warfare and it's collapsing everywhere exhibit number one Elizabeth Warren today\n... ... I mean who\nWhat other presidents other than Donald Trump what other forget about president what other Republican anywhere\nAnywhere in the in the entire movement\nCould have gotten a ... a major party presidential candidate twenty or twenty twenty which everybody knows Elizabeth Warren's going to be to actually released a press release indicating that she's possibly one\nOne thousand and twenty fours Native American who else could have gotten so much to do something so stupid folks who ever is running the PR shop in Elizabeth Warren staff\nShould resign for a felony level political malpractice immediately I have no idea what you think you were getting out of a press release indicating that your great\nGreat great is it for grades or I'm not even sure for three great grandmothers back may have possibly been Native American I don't know what you think you were getting at is but it was quite possibly the dumbest press release in political history\nWho else could have done that\n\nTrump has a unique ability I'm telling you to constantly owned the lives by driving them to win Saturday\n\nThis is entirely inauthentic Elizabeth Warren will not let this go I didn't go let aces embarrassing do you understand how this plays\nTo the average working class Americans sitting there toiling for a living at a whatever kind of a job you're working hanging sheet rock driving trucks\nPlumbing electric work you're an architect you got to sit here and listen to a woman who put down on her form to gain some kind of advantage that she had Native American a Native American heritage wrote an entry in a cookbook about powwow chow\nThat's real by the way\nIt is and and as possibly one one thousand and twenty fourth American\nThis is I'm not give it a Democratic Party a vise I'll just say you constantly wonder gosh how did Trump beat us how did Trump beat us because he's just a normal guy\nBattle scars and all your people are fakes you got this guy in Texas all battle but always skateboard you so cool who cares who cares you got Bernie Sanders for rich they're the worst part he says if I got is like third house now Bernie Sanders\nHe makes a fortune the richer than what you are the rich he is the one percent\nDonald Trump's like yeah bread subscriber base pretty sound just like oh the tax paying their fair share they're all ...\nAnd you wonder you wonder why Trump continues continues to win and every single or or I forgot to take a break come back on Gino in from work with and give us a call eight seven seven three one three at one one that's eight seven seven three one two three one we'll be right back [noise] [noise]\nHim more greatness as coming up on ... am seven Ninety made\nYour data is everywhere data breaches Facebook breaches big companies mining and sharing your information these are legitimate companies but they're putting you at risk and now you add in all the crux since ... cameras and the risk of ID theft it's insane look the best thing you can do is protect yourself and your family it's why I switched to my\nId care for identity protection they're the best in the business would plant starting from less than ten dollars a month and only my\nId care offers a one hundred percent money back recovery guarantee you can sign up at my id cared dot com slash mark my id care has taken care of fortune five hundred companies for years but now they're protection is available to people like you and me and you my listeners also get Fifteen Percent off at my\nId cared dot com slash mark ... marked learn more and then let my id care take care of you my id care dot com slash mark ... mark that's my id care dot com slash marks enter ...\nHome is my ... with labor is why we've\nEveryone's talking about like the fantasy football or soccer\nJoe Rogan experience all your music all your favorite stations\nContractor lectures to ...\n... ...

for governor in Florida he's got their socialist they don't want your money they want the whole economy\nAnd they try to frame it in this off of rich people the rich people are getting over they're not paying their fair share really\nBecause I saw a fascinating piece today I got a lot to cover today but I saw a fascinating piece in Bloomberg of all plan not a big\nHuge fan of the ... but once in a while they have good articles on economic and Bloomberg of all places talking about the actual percentages the rich and the very rich of our income tax they actually pay these numbers\nAre going to blow your mind\nHere's the first\nItself have let me just say through something numbers so much it's the comparison\nYou'll see what I mean I'm In the top one percent of earners that's right earners people earn money top one percent of earners pay an astonishing thirty seven point three percent of the income tax load in this country\nI think about that one out of a hundred people\nPay thirty seven cents of every dollar in taxes in\nThis country chew on that one for a minute you may say okay well\nYou know that one out of a hundred people at the top one\nPercent they're very rich folks the bottom Ninety percent meaning Ninety out of a hundred taxpayers the bottom Ninety percent view liberals who have a tough time with this kind of stuff pays only thirty point five percent of the income tax look\nTo pick up about this for a second this is why I I this is what I Love about Trump it's not just that he doesn't accept it out of the liberal ... they don't pay that much I don't pay your fair share of the ... thing right\nYou don't pay your fair share you don't pay your fair share it's not the Trump just doesn't accept that he turns around and just throws it right out of the guard right out in the garbage that narrative and he starts\nOver with a you know what they pay a lot they actually pay I think they pay to watch let's cut their taxes [noise] gone job\n\nThe top one percent of earners pay seven percentage points more of the income tax load\nThan the bottom Ninety what the hell's a fair share of that's not you hear what I'm ...\nThere's more by this isn't just that there's more of these comparisons in this this was at a Bloomberg peace again not some right wing website here\nLet me to sign a negative way but I'm sure the liberal listening will be like nah you got that from uh some right wing slanted Web site there that was just trying to manipulate\nThe fact this is from ... okay\nThe top one percent pay thirty seven cents of every thirty seven percent income tax load the bottom line the only pay thirty\n\nWhy is is so sensitive to make us liberals are frauds they keep talking about this fair share stuff as John Kerry doctors boat in Rhode Island to avoid paying taxes would have had Al Sharpton and his tax debacle we have a you know Bernie Sanders what do we find out he pays less than twenty percent of his income in taxes\nTo lead by example we buy sample if you believe in what you're saying there's no hypocrisy here for Republicans we think taxes shock\nA man of fire but at the same if you want to give us a call it's seven seven three one
