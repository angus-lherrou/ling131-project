Cory Booker Spartacus who who went to Iowa you imagine what that's like by the way\nYou imagine if someone like Cory Booker marching into Iowa\nI mean ... the first thing is just think about how much your elitist leftist load since the beach center part of the kind of ... country in Ninety six percent of the land mass of the United states of America is rent\nYou start taking a look at where some majority that is so you here you have Spartacus marching into I wanted to test the waters over the weekend I mean seriously Kamala Harris holding her nose in leaving California to go to the south she went to South Carolina\nI imagine how painful that is for her\nAnd of course why do we have the test the Native American ancestry test by one\nRefer to occasionally as Elizabeth Warren really bad Pocahontas or it's ultimately because she's also running right now for twenty twenty she might have just taken herself out of it we we shall see although who knows when in democratic ranks just might be around legal\nBut because all this is going on and you even have the president of the United states being asked about twenty twenty on a near daily basis I feel the need to tell you this president Donald Trump will likely be reelected\nOr go ... ... ... ... he's reelected now\nBefore you just said they're going after it was pretty baseball is no way you say anything to do with the economy is not anything to do with all of the record improvements that we've been saying\nHere's the first reason why the odds are in this paper he's an incumbent president running for reelection so let's start their sixty five percent of presidents who run for reelection when and\nIn order not to when you have to be as lame was kept in the night before mentioned Jimmy Carter or you have to do something like read my lips no new\nTaxes and then raise taxes they get yourself Ross Perot and it splits the boat\nComing up I Will give you a little bit of the background about that sixty five percent and we'll get into some what's going on Saudi Arabia as well it is a it's festive we we have a lot to talk about we're just getting warmed up I Am Brian mud in for the great one mark a little bit [noise]\nThis week's top Stevie stream\nHere's what you've been watching on TV this week the much anticipated final season of the walking dead has premiered episode one called a new beginning starts our countdown

apocalypse once again the boy wonder episode is your number one TV stream\nThat's so sweet top TV streamed on our radio [noise]\nI've never seen a ... more fashion district back I don't even like with

region will studio your local produce shearing region will dot com is fantasy instead of annoying and I are radio station\nAnd giving them the benefit of the doubt I'm Lisa let's narrow Fox News the president saying he spoke with the Saudi king crown prince and they continue to deny any involvement in the disappearance of journalist your mouth to show ...\nSo when you put this in context you think about why because for folks on the left there just beside themselves they can't figure out how in the world I mean on and not your ration day I had to listen to pin heads around their\nHours ... he's he's out after that I mean well first is going to be a beach but who would never be reelected when people already seen the mistake to me like you you really just do not get it\nThe first thing is when you're putting down in context you have to take a look at what it would take for someone who voted for that President not to vote for them again\nI mean yes you can have new voters that come about over the course of four years and if all those new voters linked heavily in one direction maybe just maybe you could move the needle by the way I keep track of that and I'm going to give you a little piece of a a story I'm actually working out for my local shows your tomorrow\nJust wrapped up the research on this little while ago chicken in the state's voter registration it broke into your interested to know how Florida has gone over the past couple of years since the twenty sixteen presidential election well yes up or did break for\nDonald Trump beyond that at\nSince the twenty sixteen presidential election through today there are thirty thousand fewer Democrats registered to vote\nYeah thirty thousand fewer registered Democrats in Florida for the past few years we have fifty one thousand additional Republicans registered to vote\nOh by the way\nProbably not going to make the news anywhere even stateside\nAnd do we do have quite a few independents that have registered to vote over a hundred thousand there\nMy point being even to the extent that we've seen people from a point of partisanship registered to vote like they're all Democrats even though you would think that every young person you hear all the time all the young people to go out registering to vote and then they're all Democrats well we heard from Joshua\nTwenty two years old Washington DC in biology you left our\nWho's a thoughtful conservative job that can happen in DC well it can happen other places too and so don't be surprised that's part of the story beyond it you've got to think about what's happening here and ... is a lot a lot to feel good about\nFirst ... you you take a look at the economy we have the best economy in a generation I never faulted millennials for buying into the hope and change bull crap they didn't know better they went through school here\nIn from a bunch of people who didn't get in the education establishment they get out there and go yeah this really does suck they hear Obama and they go with I guess he's right until they actually are given an opportunity to see what the US Economy is capable of and then you got some lines that are up and\nThat's the gun in the in the generation\nBut we have two Supreme Court justice is tax reform the end of the Affordable CARE Act mandate Lewis unemployment rate in forty nine years and by the way record unemployment for all demographics except Asian and white men yeah remember our do about the white men white men\nAnd Asia and the only ... only demos out there that are not at a record low unemployment right out oh by the way\nBut you also have the biggest increase in that take home pay in thirty two years by the way I mentioned that I Believe on friday and I receive some notes from some angry folks on the left always happy to try to deal with them but I Want to\nLay the groundwork for that one once again because not hard to get there is a little math and it's easier than calculating the Pocahontas math if you're the Boston Globe listening\nIt works like this you take the overall salary than the average person was making last year you take a look at what it is today by the way it pays about two point eight percent base salary a year over year\nOkay All right then you take a look at the average bonus that has been paid out so far this year when\nYou do that it gives you a little bit over three percent\nAnd then you take a look at the average net benefit of the tax cuts which happens to be for the average fulltime employed person about Eighteen hundred bucks this year you put all that together and boom you get six point seven percent\nAnd complicated suicides histories one side of the facts Israel and by the way in the event that you're the angry left as that goes yeah but I I haven't seen a benefit for the tax cuts well\nThat's because you know where your employer probably David about it which by the way personally thirty million people who are in that situation where employers that make it adjustments you didn't make adjustments if you're not seeing it it'll be reconciled when you file your taxes and congratulations you'll have likely given the government in interest free one but\nIt's still there because well over Ninety percent of people do benefit for the new tax law\nBut that's all the cool stuff right I mean old that progress that I decided\nTo ask yourself well if you voted for Donald Trump why would you vote against that in two years answer is if anything he probably is attracted more votes ... if he didn't nothing else no other accomplishments they always status quo from here until twenty twenty he probably gets re elected\nAnd again sixty five percent of presidents who run for re election in so if he were less successful than he is he would still likely be reelected and twenty twenty but here's the the next point and this is the under stated point\nI'm going to work on something conceptually before I give you some facts will do that in a little bit\nHow often we're we talk about domestic terrorism thing about that how often did we have radicalized domestic homegrown terrorism in the United states\nPrior to Donald Trump becoming president\nThat was a fairly regular occurrence wasn't it now you take a look at not having that problem you take a look at not having Tea Party and and white people specifically\nAll these angry white men that are singled out by the Obama administration as the number one focus on the watch list and instead you have people that do fit the profile or potential Islamic terrorism that had been number one domestically under the Trump Administration and guess what\nDoes it make the news if they stop it before it happens which happens a lot\nWhich happens a lot\nAnd be foreign policy success I'm not just talking about North Korea\nAnd the fact that to date we've released cat to Russia at bay or that Syria as much of a mess as it is\nHas been dealt with about as peacefully and with as little damage to the United states in our interest as we could have hoped for despite not even talking about all that might even talking about the trade deals that had been worked out this far to our benefit that are often under Scott\nI'm Talking about the new eradication of ISIS but also the implications for other parts of the middle east now one of the amazing turnabout and all this had been Saudi Arabia\nWe actually had Saudi Arabia under the Trump Administration said that they are with us with Israel a Middle Eastern country\nSaying there with Israel against Iran\nThat's holy cow material now that's where this whole situation with hey we got this journalist who by the way you know has a interesting history of his own that goes into a consulate in Turkey we have some ah folks from uh the the Saudi regime that dinner\nAnd a few hours later they leave and you know probably not putting his foot beat up by eating bought bond so we we have a missing journals okay\nThat's where this whole situation gets complicated because we've made some progress with Saudi Arabia but the problem is back to my sliding scale morality if you are\nNot there anymore all at the started your compass you can become pretty evil at the root of it\nAnd it's important to know who in what these people are that we're still dealing with and I'll bring you the rest of the story as the late great one would have said uh I'm going to bring it back them up you're on the other side I Am Brian mud in for the great one month\nHim now you're afternoons stimulated on cayenne S.

I are best friends\nSave it goes all responsible are held to account\nAnswers are good and I'm Guy\nRaz at my parents they're on ah the mysterious case of a not Benjamin Button but the ... who has gone missing two weeks ago today and at this point\nIt's rather obvious that we've heard the rumors that have come out with Saudi Arabia or the other day I mean like we know the crazy thing yeah there's a little interrogation and yeah you know I mean that it would just\nI just really hated when when we accidentally kill I I'm Sorry sorry we won't do it again really\nThat apparently is what we're actually going to get or at least that's the rumor of what we are going to get out of Saudi Arabia while also having the assertion that uh hey the king this young and and hip king who's the women could draw right now I mean come\nOn I mean isn't he like yeah when they get dry\nSo he's so did that guy he doesn't know anything and and he's not supposed to do anything so that's where we we are in this process\nBy the the way the president was even talking about that today he said that for the record I have no financial interest in Saudi Arabia but he also said that he spoke with the gang and hey he denies everything denies eyes everything so\nThis is typical this is typical for a lottery\nWe don't know the exact where it was obviously\nAnd you had a lot of folks who say yeah you know wage shoot sanctions bring it on I mean let's just whatever it was Saudi Arabia the first thing is one be thankful that we were very close very close to energy independence in this country by the way did he know that we are now\nThe world's largest producer of oil and not Saudi Arabia\nRussia us us\nNot a great we're actually facing the get there in January we got there a little bit earlier it's also good about now because if Saudi Arabia and the influence they had 'em in a pack a day decided hey you know like we don't like putting pressure on us and they go ahead and dramatically reduce production you could see a spike in prices obviously that could hurt the economy boom he's you know what happens there\nSo that's one thing we got to consider in this entire process but the bigger one again as you do have this new younger hip king in Saudi Arabia\nWho is like yeah women can can drive now I mean look how progressive I Am and and equal rights and all that\nHe's on board with us against Iran and with Israel where you can get that in the middle east you take it for sure that's what complicates this deal but the problem is still is mentioned three law it's evil wherever it's it's ... there's nothing good about it\nWe have had\nOne thousand five hundred and eighty nine Islamic terror attacks around the world so far this year\nWe've had Ninety four hundred and eighty three people killed in additional Ninety six hundred injured\nOh by the way so Islamic terror still alive and well it's real law and are the folks that govern underage still sponsor terrorism and the least of which is ... Iran but here's the problem the dirty little secret about sharia law in Islam in governments predominantly in the middle east\nThere are still over forty of them that carry the tenants of sharia\nIncluding by the way Saudi Arabia now\nWe haven't necessarily had on track record to see how long that's going to remain part of the government the bigger problem is\nIf you're on board with shrimp your moral compass really sucks and if you were saying that you can like ah you know kill people and will because I don't know there are a woman they were rights or you're homosexual what else are you willing to do like this journalists thing for example so that's where this becomes the tangled Web\nAnd so it's it's easy to quarterback this thing it's much different to to be pragmatic with

makes me not just the the\nIdea of just say Janelle Adam okay well what happens for example of Saudi Arabia is isn't it\nSo we're kind of been with you on Israel and against Iran but uh you know\nWe aren't feeling quite as as cordial as we had previously\nWhat happens to them and what happens if they say you know what\nWe're just gonna go ahead and turn off this big to do back and see what happens to oil prices and see if we can do something that a wreck the economy a little bit there for you know Presidents Day and things that that could happen any number of different applications so I think it's\nEasy for a Lindsey Graham who's out there and loving every\nOf it enjoying this newfound freedom maybe being the person you always wanted to be that he finally feel that at the speed is kinda fascinating if you think about it and I digress here you have Lindsey Graham is like I came out maybe said things that it would that have always meant to be sane\nAnd people did\nYou know you're talking about the Trump effect me take a look at it and the Republican Party Mitch McConnell got an incredible reception in Kentucky the other night I mean what does that ever happened\n[laughter] I mean\nIt's an interesting day these people clearly enjoying this this newfound freedom of the Trump effect that has come for them\nBut it's complicated it's complicated so I don't know but let's just go sanctioned the hell out of all that's the best answer and I'm not sure that we're necessarily going to find our our friend who uh is mysteriously ... where exactly Jamal soggy\nLet's go to Aaron in Kansas Erin go\nOh just a quick question if the king denies any knowledge of it ... it was a body ah it's obviously is not in the consulate anymore give us a body this poor guys in a hole somewhere still being torture\nYou know it's an interesting thought a if you were going to be really uh I don't know a ... if you're going to engage in in a war game I mean I I suppose you could end up putting up any number of Syria ... scenarios that at least of which would be well maybe when you ... the study officials leave\nThe consulate they left with them\nYou know if you are ... there there are any number of things that can happen I'm not sure that it would make sense for him to remain there and be tortured because when you're gonna have many more potential witnesses add a lot more difficult situation for even turkey to account for at that point so\nOf all the scenarios that two weeks later he's still there would be tortured I think would be among the least likely but hey see your point anything could be possible for the call\nNow I've been talking about the oddities the oddities politically in in some of the assumptions that often or not wise\nFor the first time such twenty fourteen

Fox News President Trump warning of a rush to judgment it when it comes to the disappearance of journalist you mall 'cause she'll be at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul it's evidence now that the Saudis had something to do with it\nWhen I ended up writing this was a headline I Believe it was on Sunday on CNBC how Taylor Swift political adores men could become the biggest red\nEver at the polls ... ever as the polls [laughter] I mean that OK okay maybe just maybe not how you thought\nHere's an actor last way pop star Taylor Swift made waves by breaking or stands up political neutrality and backing democratic congressional candidates in her home state of Tennessee\nThe effect of sweat surprise endorsement which was made the on Instagram post were felt right away as thousands of people between the ages of Eighteen and twenty nine registered to vote according to vote dot org\n[noise] okay now I'm\nGonna get straight to the point about the Taylor Swift the fact that some of the media as recently as a couple of days ago were still like oh my gosh it's happening I think it's quieted down a little bit over the past year or so because I think more of them are like being pointed to the polls and going hey\nSo he was up in Tennessee or see I'm Taylor ... specific endorsement of the Democrat so Britain and tendencies US Senate race you see at the time of the endorsement Marsha Blackburn the Republican challenger in this race\nShe was averaging three point lead and the three most recent polls in Tennessee alright Blackburn three point lead in the three most recent polls prior to the Taylor Swift effect\nWhere is she today and the three most recent polls in that particular race or lead is now nine points\nSo oh\nNot exactly what you probably thought would happen here so the Taylor Swift effect in the immediate aftermath of the race that she finally weighed in on is negative six percent in a week so I like to say you got two sides histories and one side the facts but here's the deal\nYou got a lot of folks are if you buy the millionaire the concept that for every action got the equal and opposite reaction I enter science guy on earlier in the show\nHere's the thing that I'm In in the south in particular\nYou have a lot of folks that will end up getting energized about the moment you got celebrities that are weighing in and specifically when she ended up outing herself pretty much immediately or her lack of understanding of pretty much\nEverything including the person she was endorsing seat if you're in Tennessee and you're fine politics you might have noticed that she was a bit of an obvious hypocrites for a few reasons among others now\nShe said that Marsha Blackburn doesn't represent her tendency values but you see here is that the the dirty little details Taylor isn't actually from Tennessee she's from\nPennsylvania Pennsylvania\nAnd she happened only moved to Tennessee to pursue her music career high school oh by the way she's lived there less than half her life\nYou know in the you know Taylor Swift is to Tennessee values as say a Elizabeth Warren is due to Cherokee Indians you know the the person sometimes referred to as Elizabeth Warren better known as the bad Pocahontas that one now\nShe spoke of supporting el ... writes\nGB T rights as part of her Tennessee values by the white [noise] just what the Democrats the she endorsed\nBill Britain's and he doesn't support gay marriage and a bunch of other issues he's on the right for it as much [laughter] so it's clear that she's never even looked into what he believes in they'll go\n\nAnd then you got the optics you see for maybe you could activate some of those young folks in Nashville that are yeah\nBut here's the thing anybody noticed that you got Taylor Swift endorsing an old white guy who\nDoes not support gay marriage and host of other old GB T rights that Taylor says are part of her tendency values from Pennsylvania so she's endorsing in the old white guy bat evil these days and leftist politics right over a younger woman\nHa ha interesting\n[laughter] I mean and there's a lot more we we can continue\nDown that rabbit hole but it's not necessary but you see those into the the they pretty much get the point to and yellow and get a lot\nIn terms of Tennessee values I'm from suburban Georgia lived in Knoxville for a time when I was small and I'm pretty familiar with tendency values and they take a look at these celebrity in in Hollywood endorsements and ah well\nNot often impressed so it probably is going to continue to have the opposite of the effect that they weren't as a painting I mean come on\nAll these celebrity endorsements worked right Katy Perry holding up Hillary Clinton's arm either way it wasn't an awkward moment I mean I did the trick always does\nAnd so here's the funny thing if you're taking a look at when celebrity endorsements actually matter well she kind of Mr moment you see if she actually wanted somebody with her Pennsylvania\nTend to the algae beats he writes values she couldn't actually weighed in in the primary because Columbia University actually did prove that\nSome Democrats are impressed by celebrities for example Columbia University they did show pretty empirically that in the two thousand eight democratic presidential primary\nOprah Winfrey's endorsement really did

thought of something an extension to what I Want to talk about with what you were just touching on but um this is Taylor Swift thing could be\nEven a larger on a larger scale where people are just rejecting a Hollywood talking heads as being anybody of any value or lack of value whatsoever that's number one\nNumber two I don't know if you recall but on the night of nine eleven you remember they had that music vigil of ... a vigil with\nSpringsteen and Tom Petty were they were pounding the war drums you recall that\nNot really to be honest with you\nThey all came on and Tom Petty song is we won't back down um it was all a\nIt was all in a kind of aggressive music or that hinted towards we're coming at you but they're the same they recover from the same cloth especially Springsteen were they were anti war or if they they are just so hypocritical I'm hoping that God that people are just not taken serious anymore\nWell I can take I tell you this much in in Tennessee in particular there are some places where this celebrity is going to play if you're in California I have no doubt that it plays in fact there is research that did show\nUp from Columbia University back to two thousand eight\nA presidential primary to where there are Democrats or a percentage of them that are activated by celebrity but you've got to you know somebody's got to be open to the message is what I talked about when a I'll describe being politically persuasive one of the most common questions I get how is it that I find somebody who I can uh you know convince of of what's right\nWell the the first thing is you've got to find somebody who's open to the information if you find somebody who's close minded\nWell it doesn't matter how hard to try their not to the information so when the case of the celebrities when you're talking about what's going on in Tennessee oh well you've got a large swath of that population that is not\nNot going to be turned on\nBy a celebrity endorsement but what's worse and this is the most offensive thing and I say there's not really a true southerner in the sense that I'm from suburban Atlanta\nAnd to be honest with you I didn't even know what the the saying get out of the judgment until I was sixteen that kinda thing didn't come up where where it was from but I Do understand a lot of southern culture and\nYou know when you say that you have tendency now use\nAnd you're not only not from Tennessee where you're from Pennsylvania [laughter] name they drew many of the folks in Tennessee that those people\nAnd so it's kinda like a no offense to you and in in Jersey job but I mean in Tennessee you know Jersey\nNot not the best reputation so anyway it's a good point states\nAll jerseys kind of cut in half you know ah almost at the center of the state um for the most part I'm and I'm Down in the you know\nThe more conservative area but I just ... hoping to God that these numbers who who who rely on these celebrities for their political opinions are shrinking more and more and more\nThat's my hope\nYeah I I think the only celebrity that are necessary have to worry about in terms of this cycle\nIs the president of the United states\nI mean there is an irony there are certain extent you know he's obviously successful independent of the celebrity but you know I just a\nWedding out with somebody otherwise probably will as I don't appreciate uh Joe and Menendez I mean come on really ... you got some work to New Jersey oh let's go to a liberal land in Arizona not happy with what's going on in North Dakota ailing\nOh I'm a liberal I have

B. S. that MPs is somehow\nConsulting with Trump did decide what to do at a time which is a bunch of crap\nNobody's in favor of this we have a western mine are Judeo Christian ethic we believe in due process at least Republicans do so what we believe in fairness\nAnd and so whatever happened to a Saudi Arabian bought a Saudi Arabian government in a Saudi Arabian consulates\nIn Turkey is interesting but hell we got ten thousand murders in this country every year not being investigated by CNN or obsessing by the New York times in the Washington Post where he worked as a contributor\n... then we let it go a little bit and see what happened and when it comes out\nThat the M. B. S. directly or indirectly heck a show gave murdered in a horrible way because he was a dissident and ... and offer regime and Saudi Arabia that's what's going to come out I guess Trump's responsible for that to\nIt never stops it never ends I Can't take it anymore it's awful and so can we move on from that the answer of course is no\nThis is the ah the event there's your the event this week and next week they keep coming up whether it's Kavanaugh or Julie sweating ache or Deborah Ramirez or a bunch of other incidents that have arisen in the past several months that Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump how can we use this event\nHow can we take Christina for how can we use this event that didn't involve Trump at all\nAnd somehow wash this upon him\nAnd stain or smear him with some news event\nThat Trump is nothing to do with doing nothing zero zilch nada didn't happen now is that possible but it goes on and on I I tried to watch for hours\nWolf Blitzer and others on CNN it's impossible to watch it as if MPs his own speed dial with ... and Trump taking orders assuming he did it what does that mean what might be behind it is is\nThere are many in this country and in the media\nWho thinks the Iranian deal was wonderful for our country and that Brock Hussein Obama delivered one point eight billion dollars in cash on governmental pilots to use for terrorism by Iran man that was a great idea we ought to do more of that and so because Saudi Arabia\nIs the pitch enemy of Iran\nMaybe those in the media wants to get back to the Iranian deal and weak in Saudi Arabia in the middle east\nSo that Iran takes over larger chunks of the middle east Iraq and Syria not being enough maybe that's what's behind it plus as you may know if you've been paying attention Israel and Saudi Arabia have become brothers they become sisters they become friendly with each other because their enemy is Iran\nThe ... the enemy of my enemy is my friend so because Israel and Iran are enemies and because Saudi Arabia and Iran are enemies now Israel and Saudi Arabia are working together and lots of areas so there may be parts of America that wants to get rid of that uh that budding\nFriendship between Israel and Saudi Arabia by weakening the Saudis\nBut whatever it is we don't have a dog in this fight\nYou may want to strengthen Iran and the media does or weaken Israel which the media does\nBut by doing that were hurting our country after nine eleven which I think Fifteen of the Nineteen hijackers came from Saudi Arabia we got a little sideways with Saudi Arabia for a while but now we're back together and they're spending\nI think the president said the other day something in the range of a hundred and ten billion with a total cost the five hundred billion dollars\nA of taking our military hardware to upgrade their military to fight Iran\nOur enemy they'd been our enemy since ... since we help get rid of the shah of Iran look what happened there\nAnd so whatever happen happen it occurred let the Saudi Arabians deal with it if the government ordered the killing of someone which by the way America itself has done on a regular basis\nCountries do these kinds of things if Saudi Arabian government decided to murder Jamal ... show gig and stupidly they decided to pick a consulate in Turkey to do the Daschle deed and if that's a\nViolation of some criminal law somewhere to the Turks are the odds you\nKnow what I say have at it but according to diplomatic law the consulate Israeli Saudi Arabian territory and so what happened there stays in Saudi Arabia so whatever happens happens it is what it is can we move on absolutely not you see\nThe mid term so now only about what twenty days away twenty days from now the midterms and so things are heading toward\nThe Republican way in many states especially in Arizona Nevada and a Montana president it's going to make a greater parents there in North Dakota Heitkamp that allows the thing with the disclosing the names of sexual assault victims so the red wave appears to be building and the Senate\nAnd that was the big news story so the last several days the news media said wait a minute this thing is heading toward the Republicans to help Trump we can't have that so they started this other thing about Jamal ...\nWho was killed in Turkey and he's a Saudi now as we speak the last several days there have been hundreds of Americans who have been killed a few dozen by illegal aliens\nThere was a horde of some two or three thousand Central Americans making their way up to America paying their passage MS Thirteen with are girls being raped and men being killed it's happening right now\nAnd so there's other news stories going on in the world and because it was kind of going toward Trump's direction and his resume and prove all rating was up to fifty one percent the media might have said you know what\nThis is going the wrong direction\nIf we can go after some out the sides and you and in their place put Jared Kushner and Trump somehow responsible for the murder of cars shaggy maybe that'll be a good thing maybe we can stop the building red wave in the Senate what's going to happen in the house I have no idea\nSo so let's continue with more than ... line becomes available which it never\nIce Karen Lewis\nState Mike Pompeo checking out this weekend tissue

the great when Mark Sullivan way of case and Chris and Josh and many others to lines are open\nTo you know the ... ... if you'd desire to join his eight seven seven three one two three one one last thing before I go to you\nI keep babbling but that's a good look at it this way Tony days from now\nAnd uh I met with the president or two or three days ago we are going to share with you some of his thoughts later on\nThat uh it appears to me\nThat the number one issue right now is the court system is I just told you\nSeventy percent of the judges are appointed by Democrats great majority of the cases Ninety nine point nine nine percent never get U.S Supreme court and so if in twenty days the Senate flips through the Democratic party Chuck Schumer will hold back and not confirm any\nAny of the White House's judicial nominees through twenty twenty which really is January of twenty Twenty one\nAnd then at that point and Trump is reelected which most of us believe he will\nDo this and that stays democratic is not going to be twenty Twenty one it'll be twenty twenty three he will not stop\nThey will not nominate you could nominate but they will not confirmed one judge so what's on the ballot and twenty days is the court system and whether the destruction of our constitutional several more rights than traditional values will continue\nOn or else we can make the turn some out back to the mental\nSecondly all the investigations\nThat the house of becomes democratic which is appears to be very likely the investigations of every aspect of Trump's life his wife's life\nJared Kushner's life everyone's life for the White House will be laid bare and the next two years will not be about legislation but rather investigation so if you want the mob rule that you've seen the past several months\nWhere Republicans are shot run off the street cars blown up and beaten than incentivize the mob by giving the mob power by putting their house back in Georgia Nancy Pelosi and watch what happens it's going to be unbridled is going to be unbelievable another\nAspect to courses foreign policy right now\nDespite the efforts of CNN and others to destroy our relationship with the sides things are pretty good\nNorth Korea's not shooting missiles anywhere right now Iran and Iraq are somewhat quiet right now Syria is heading toward a conclusion I've got a horrible war incentivized by the Russians by the Iranians and vibrant Hussein Obama who allowed the Russians and the Iranians to come into Syria\nForeign policy wise things are pretty good that's on the ballot the economy\nAccording to some national international experts the American economy right now is the greatest it's ever been in American history how were the stock market react if Nancy Pelosi begins investigations\nEvery aspect of the executive branch of government it won't be good plus you got the impeachment issue is there any doubt in your mind that the Democrats who wants to eliminate Trump from office so if you went the next two years not to be about judges\nNot to be about a and only about investigations and impeachments in a hurt the economy then that's what's on the ballot\nSo when Trump comes to one of these states and he came to Cincinnati a few days ago I spent some time with them and and play some of his thoughts later on if that happens\nDo they're just don't talk which is all we do go they're physically in confront and say yes I Am here as as testimony to what this country can be and should be do I like all the tweets do I like the horse ed comment about the strip or no\nBut the policies the procedures what's happening with the court system what's happening with the economy what's happening with Foreign Relations you know is damn good it's really good\nAnd so think about what's on the ballot and twenty days because the Democrats are as incentivize is they've ever been and it's going to get more ridiculous they're going to more incentivize and if you incentivize the mob\nBy buying them off or paying them off is going to be nothing but difficulties so let's go to your calls now we have are keeping a Los Angeles than Chris in Atlanta line becomes available you know the routine let's continue with more Keith in Los Angeles welcome to the ... show hosted by the great American bill Cunningham please go ahead\n[noise] hey bill thank you for taking my call you asked a question if the U.S has complicit\nWith the job market show um\nMurder I Would say a hundred percent yes and ran and won fame that because I've been looking at al Jazeera English and they've been reporting from day one that us and tell I don't know if the deep state but the league that they had conversations with\nAuthority ... and his entourage arranged a kitten that this guy though and if you look and recently um John Brennan the laugh test today and they say he confirmed that his operative so I think\nUm yeah we are complex and even though we didn't have involvement in the murder and we did not warn him and that's what a big issue in the final point\nOut on the on that point do you believe al Jazeera any more than you believe CBS\nWhy why why do you rely upon al Jazeera which is an arm of the extreme Muslim Palestinian Authority why do you believe al Jazeera out a cutter why do you believe them I wouldn't believe one word they said\nOkay I hear what you're saying but when they're right there at the same for twenty four seven\nYou don't fathom factual information all doing that record and went on to the cloud though I don't know how come against them because they're there when the when the member you cannot deny what you're saying what your own eyes and a lot of going\nIn this whole uh precisely scandal was something that I Hope is not up to his eyeballs in it from uh South America and I hope he's clean but do what he did with ... what he did with the world didn't excite me too much and um\nAnd I I just hope there is no there there were Chris
