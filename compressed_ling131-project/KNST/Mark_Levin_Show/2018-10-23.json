just give you some perspective here this so called national emergency actually really represents about point zero six percent of all the undocumented people already in this country so we're talking about a very small fraction of people here are the president is hoping that this isn't winning strategy at the same strategy this\nWas a news reporter this is the White House correspondent the senior White House correspondent for ABC News good morning America\nGo ahead\nAnd the White House for help Republicans an engine them in terms of that strategy is stoking fears about immigration\nThere you go this is also an attack on New Year's eve because you're so stupid that the president is able to cause you to be fearful and scared\nYou're so stupid you can't process what's actually taking place\nAnd besides it's only zero point zero six percent of all undocumented people already in this country the irony is that there's so many illegal aliens in this country seven thousand or whatever the numbers marching to our southern border to this reporter simply no big deal\nPeter Alexander\nAnother White House correspondent this time on the today show that would be NBC had to news busters cut three go\nYes you're right I mean what's striking here as the economy is strong unemployment is low but instead of talking about his achievements these days the president really is leaning into this message of free\nAnd I'll just fear stop this was another journalist\nSo instead of talking about the economy which of course the media never talk about\nInstead of talking about the economy which the media could care less about the president is stoking he's a he's leaning into his message of fear not law and order remind you of course it is law and order but it's fear you see ahead\nArgument focuses on stoking fears of illegal immigration MS Thirteen shadowy Middle Eastern\nSide just wait a minute I happen to live in a community where MS Thirteen is a huge problem\nMaybe these people don't\nBut MS Thirteen is a huge and going ... in a lot of states in metropolitan areas it's no joke\n\nIt's him is Thirteen that stokes fear not the president of the United states\nGo ahead\nIt's what he's been trying to do recently to try to motivate his base of support his voters now some\nSay it's all about motivating you because you see ladies and gentlemen unless you are absolutely\nEmotionally out of your mind you're not going to vote\nYou're not going to vote\nAnd yet is not immigration a key issue is not an important issue it may not be an important issue\nTo phony journalists to phony anchors to phony host a phony reporters but it is an important issue to men and women who go to work every day try to raise their families and live in communities that are exposed to this\nIt is the people who break their ass everyday paying their property taxes and in some states where we have income taxes most states and so much of that money goes to individuals who are here illegally\n\nIt matters to people who are construction workers it matters to people who are truck drivers in taxi drivers it managed to people who work with their hands many people who work with their hands none of these reporters work with their hands at least not above the table\n\nGo ahead I'm across from winning back the house or the Senate or both obviously what's crucial that circumstance here is that the president recognizes that he is up against the wall right here this is a reporter\n\nNow Gloria borders on CNN Today utterly and completely predictable\nBut we need to hear from
