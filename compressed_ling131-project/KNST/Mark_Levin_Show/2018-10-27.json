about it you can have a guy here who is under investigation for his entire governorship if you'll elect\nHim as your governor because this guy was taken freebies left and right you know about the Costa Rica trip you know about the Hamilton ticket you know about the hotel in New York City these things are worth thousands of dollars\nBut here's the breaking story tonight by the Tallahassee Democrat and undercover FBI agent\nPosing as an Atlanta developer seeking to do business with the city of Tallahassee where he was mayor Gillum\nPicked up the catering bill for eight twenty sixteen fundraiser for mayor Andrew Gillum nascent political action committee forward Florida\nThe pack would eventually become the war chest of gallons gubernatorial campaign it is the first piece of evidence linking the ongoing FBI pro to Gillum broader campaign for statewide office and this stuff's trickling out trickling out not due to the ... campaign or the Republicans\nBut due to one of the people whose caught up in this lobby\n\nThe emails and receipts released friday today as part of a supplemental records requests from the Florida commission on ethics\nShows that the agent the undercover FBI agent Mike Miller was in voice four thousand three hundred and eighty six dollars by one oh one restaurant in ... lounge a restaurant owned by lobbyists Adam Corey at the time to this guy Korea's buddies\nOr was would Gillum\nAnd email exchange shows that Miller paid the bill and Gillum sent him a personal thank you I didn't say thank you note or for the food now Gillum has been a line through his teeth all along about the extent of this investigation and he knows the extent of the ... investigation\nIt's been lying about the extent of the FBI investigation he's been lying about his involvement and corruption in the city\nOf Tallahassee and it is corrupt and today again is trashing police officers police officers that are forced to to to draw a weapon even a taser well then they blown it according to him\nMonth after meeting Mike Miller this is the FBI undercover agent for breakfast that the power plant cafe or at the Edison\nCorey that's the lobbyists and lifted the undercover agent to help foot the bill for a fundraising dinner at Korea's house on behalf of columns gubernatorial campaign I'll keep in mind or Cory the lobbyist than buddy of a Gillum didn't

email Barnes described it as the first kick up a event for his campaign so tend to buy roughly forty Tallahassee notable\nIncluding this one in that one we've passed way with the outstanding to get to thirty seven thousand eight hundred and fifty whatever we can push to get us over that forty thousand dollar mark would be amazing Barnes wrote the Corey thank you again for all your work to make it successful event last\nMinimum donation for the dinner was five thousand dollars a person\nCory the lobbyist embodied Gillum arranged an alternative donations from Miller the undercover FBI agent quote in ...\nIs helping to underwrite the cost of the meals and drinks we enjoyed quarter road to Barnes\n\nA year before he announced his candidacy in two months before the fundraiser Gillum and Daniels flew to Tampa to meet leach senior vice president of south port financial services and affordable housing developer and democratic fundraiser\n\nThere was no federal government there was no

and Franklin Roosevelt stood he knows all about John ... and\nAnd Henry crawly and all the rest that I've written about at some length\n\nHe knows mark swelling angles well and Hagel well\nAnd he knows that in order to create this utopia which is really hell on earth you have to destroy these institutions\n\nYou have to destroy the institutions unalienable rights has nothing to do with the progressive agenda\nPro union anti union minimum wage no minimum wage health care no health has nothing to do with that it is a recognition that we are human beings that we're individuals and we have the right to be free\n\nAnd we're supposed to be treated equally under the law\n\nNothing to do with economic outcomes are minimum wage or the laundry list of or the left wing agenda and Obama in this just so you understand modern history Obama in this\nIs a regurgitate in things that have been said by Theodore Roosevelt and his new nationalism speech\n\nWoodrow Wilson and multiple speeches that he gave and all of them attack the declaration of independence or turn it inside out as Obama did what he's doing here isn't particularly smart you just stealing the propaganda the past hundred years old more\nThey wrap themselves in the declaration of independence\nBy\nRewriting by rewriting\nI don't have enough time to get into this again if you read or rediscovering Americanism and the tyranny of progressive ism you'll know exactly what's going on here as I said when I wrote it over a year old I'm not talking and I'm just saying if you want to understand that it's right there he wasn't done ... Seventeen go\nFor\nOne [noise]\nI don't know what that means first of all let's use English to keep what they've got you mean to keep what they have the powerful in the privileged fight hard to keep what they they got\nWhat does it mean\n\nWho are the powerful corporate\nExecutives or senators and congressmen professors who indoctrinate their students\nMedia personalities who who are the powerful exactly\nGeorge Soros style they want to keep what they got what does that\nMean they want to keep what they got\nIf you weren't something legitimately by your smarts by your hard work whatever of course you want to see what you got why shouldn't the most powerful people in this country or the people who run government\nBecause they have something that you do not have in the private sector you know what that is Mr producer\nThe law the law they control the law\nThey can punish people they can find people they can penalize people they can put people in prison\nThat's why the communist socialist the fascist they want to control the government they don't want to control this company or that company or this building that building they want the government they want to control the government your constitution which he claims to support and does not\nDoesn't control the individual it doesn't control business it doesn't control the private sector doesn't the Trump private property it's intended they controlled government\n\nBecause governments where the power is\nGovernments where the power it\nGo ahead\nAnd the first\nOne [noise]\nAnd by the way is is to visit rhetoric if somebody really believes what Obama said that this is what's going on that these people are privileged they're powerful they've taken they get to keep what they've got\nOr if they believe what ... says and the others saying compared Trump the Hitler and everything\nDoesn't that incite people go ahead\nGo and [noise]\nA whiz who does that here we have that demagogue pointing fingers at others and that's what demagogues do go ahead\nOh say see this is real hate speech is that what people say\nThis really is digging in the hatred and animosity and jealousies he says let's not they'll use history and racial ... look at the full\nUse racial division or ethnic division or religious division what did he just do\nIt's incredible\nHe's talking to a largely African American audience he knows exactly what he's done you won't hear CNN or MSNBC all those host and anchors all their gas you won't hear them play this and condemn Obama for his race baiting hey hey dating you won't hear a damn thing about this\nOther than the fact you listen to my program go ahead\nBut the main thing\nThey going to listen to this emphasize they will say whatever it takes to keep their stuff to maintain their privileges even if it's not fair especially if it's not fair\n\nThis is the man more than any man was held the presidency in recent times was undermined the unity of this country not Trump\nObama not Trump Obama go ahead [noise]\nIt's a cynical kind of money frankly sometimes it works\nIncredible incredible\nThe guy with airs Dorn ...\n\nThe guy who led the terrorists that are prison the guy who put an embassy in Cuba\n\nThe guy who gave tens of billions of dollars to the terrorist regime in Iran\n\nUnbelievable the things he says about this country the things he says about his fellow citizens\nThis is nothing short a Marxist propaganda while\nHe's raking in tens of millions and by the way did you see all the conflict going on about his library how he's trying to impose his library on a a a lower middle class neighborhood and they've taken him to court you seen any stories on that I bet you've seen damn phew\nBut Obama was truly trashing cops and law enforcement and holder was too and they're nationalizing these uh these local police departments and some of the really reckless things that they said whether it was ... center Baltimore both towns by the way ... which has not recovered from what took place a\nYou're not allowed to say that stuff you're not allowed to say that stuff and yet the fact\nIs their rhetoric was outrageous again I don't consider it being the reason that these are\nThese cops were murdered the guy was an absolute not and so forth and so on\nBut the media will never be consistent because the media are of Obama's ilk they are
