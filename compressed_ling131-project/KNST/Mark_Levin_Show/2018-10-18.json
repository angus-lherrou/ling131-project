times over the years\nNormally when it was selling a book or doing a business deal\nAnd we've established a bit of a friendship I'm happy to defend that great man and ABC News George Stephanopoulos or on CNN I have a lot of feeling for the president top forty five Donald J dropping\nA Mr President before we get too deep into this ... playing a little bit difficulty and is doing quite well so instead of dealing with that let's talk about ... trip to Africa how did things go\nWell she's a terrific first lady and a great human being and she wanted to go and see for herself Africa because we've heard so much about it some very good step but some very tough stuff in the sense of the way people live\nAnd she made for substance you also went to the pyramids and Egypt and that was quite something special but uh and the poverty is incredible you know the level of poverty a it was very sad a beautiful in one way and very sad and I know the kids were beautiful they loved her\nAnd she came back and she said I Hope you're going to continue to give a lot of money because they needed it's not a question of it's not a question of defense it's not a question of it it's just it's on the human race as they need it and she had a big impact on me I Will tell you a bill she really had a big impact\nOn me and the other thing the mid west I looked at Canada Mexico and South Korea\nMillions of jobs have been credit and you were told a year or two ago by Gary Cohn and others that you know the candidate deal is probably not going to happen Mexico's too tough NAFTA is ingrained what'd you do that caused Canada may not be real happy right now in Mexico may not be happy and then South Korea\nTo kind of play because we're the big dog in the kennel but they don't treat it that way what did you do with the\nTrade deal and we're also the piggy bank that everybody wants to come in and Rob\nAnd uh Mexico we made a deal and we told them look otherwise we're going to have to just to actually car industry which would have been bad for them and\nFrankly I wouldn't have wanted to do it but we were going to do it and we made a deal with Mexico we could not make a deal with Canada they just wouldn't make a deal that was fair for us because NAFTA was a total and complete disaster you know that better than all of that you saw what happened over here with you still have building's empty with just everybody moved out\nI don't know what they were thinking so that's why I refused to call it NAFTA I said the deal with making I refused so we call it the U.S MCA and its works good but we made a great deal is with everybody what happened then is Kennedy came along in the end\nWe weren't able to make it I said we're going to tax you cars coming in and then what happened and they made a deal they made a deal they made a deal and it's a deal that we're very happy with I Hope they're very happy with I Hope everybody is but it's a fair deal for us and\nWe have now we just had to deal with South Korea which is fabulous much a much improved approved deal you know improved I Will say that Hillary Clinton you remember she made that deal and she said it's two hundred and fifty thousand jobs and she was right for South Korea so they got two hundred and fifty we didn't get two hundred and fifty\nIt was a terrible deal so essentially we terminated that deal and we made a new deal with South Korea so\nMany jobs and talking to my Everytime I Can't I'm actually talking about a million\nWell you're talking about millions of jobs which don't forget we've opened up countries that were just totally close to right if you look at Canada we couldn't sell our dairy products are there and if we did it was a three hundred percent tariff people don't talk about that you know if I put on a ten percent or twenty percent Arab they make a big deal and they have three hundred\nActually three hundred percent two hundred and Seventy five percent two hundred and eighty five percent of the terrorists they charge so essentially that's a wall because if you have to pay a tariff like that you can't sell the product is expensive so we've opened up Canada\nWe have a very good relationship now I think they respect us more than they did before\nBut now at least it's fair enough farmers are in love with it you see what's going on it's beautiful now we're working on China and we're working on the European Union which of absolutely taken advantage of our country and the European Union has been brutal and the way they took advantage of the United states for many years\nI mean they were formed to take advantage of the United states so it was a reason they were formed how can we\nHow can we take from the United states so the European Union they formed and they uh they're very unfair to us they have barriers where we can sell into their into into their countries\nThey have a tremendous tariffs that make it impossible\nAnd yet they show Mercedes Benz and BMWs by the millions they come in there and Indians and we charge him essentially no tax it's two and a half percent but for the most part they don't even I liked it\nSo we charge them virtually nothing and they send millions and millions of cars if we want to send a a piece of grain okay we want to send a piece of grain we can't do it and to the European Union so it's unfair uh we met with them I told them I'm going to start\nTaxing because because Obama they wouldn't even talk to them right they said we're very happy the way we are and that's that was that Obama just went away and then a with us I said look we want to talk I didn't hear from them I said we want to talk I didn't hear third time I said listen we're not call me back but I'm going to give you one more chance and in ...\nDuring early voting from ...

same ideology\nThat that they have today about um you know bringing out here to the country\nAnd he works for the Saudi royal family for years as an editor on one of their papers so he has a history with the family and I think in that a turkey doesn't like\nPresident Trump anyway so\nThat I like I like to see that uh that stuff they keep saying that they have and I really don't know if I Would even trust the information and it happened at the Saudi conflict in Turkey so it should be their investigation\nRight and it hurt the ... and early the consulate in Saudi Arabia territory really are and so but I I talk about Christopher Stevens was US ambassador\nTo Libya murdered Sean Smith Tyrone Woods in Glen Dougherty we're all American citizens they weren't didn't have a green card and the media largely ignored that in twenty twelve because it was so injurious to Obama's reelection\nIf they would have focused on that for the last eight weeks Mitt Romney would have won but the media couldn't do that because they wanted to make sure their guy one\nExactly and I think Americans because they need to stop watching what's going on and frankly I don't want to think anybody murdered I don't care or from Saudi Arabia turkey wherever or that in the usa [noise]\nUh that I really think that they need to let this play out let the investigation happened what Saudi presented the

responsibilities to use objectivity and reporting to the American people the information upon which they cast ballots that's why it's there so that the press in a free press can objectively informed electorate as to ...\n... over which they have no control to know or understand\nTogether that information to objectively present it\nSo that we can change government we'd go some other direction we can say you know what that's not right but I Can't trust ABC NBC CBS the Washington Post the New York times Hollywood I Can't trust universities colleges late night TV shows\nTo give me objective

that\nBoston Globe her hometown newspaper quote Warren reveals test confirming ancestry NBC News nobody but Clinton network NBC News quote Elizabeth Warren releases DNA results indicating she is Native American heritage when you break down the numbers\nThe testing that this person did involve samples from Columbia in Peru not from America\nAnd that she is something less than point one percent

does know what a normal mother or father would do to protect their house or a normal person would do to protect their business I mean this is no different than\nPutting a lock on your door having a fence around your house having a ... a alarm system if you know that people are coming for you what do you do your gear up\nIf I Know that someone's coming to break into my house I Am going to get ready and I'm going to warn them that if they break into my house I Will shoot them I'm going to I'm going to gear up\nTo protect my property which is exactly what the president's doing is protecting the United states of America our property as citizens\n\nNow all of this I said to go back to court point here I don't hate people that come to this country illegally I've said this filling in for mark before or many of you know me I I play tennis in college I was almost every one of my roommates in college was someone from a foreign country\n\nMy best friend is from another nation one of my other best friend just from a another nation they both came to this country is a student with a student visa legally\nThey didn't break in and they didn't come in a caravan they didn't chant they didn't yell\nThey love America and the both of them are still here and both of them love this country and respect our laws and make sure that all their visas and everything are in order they did it the right way\nI have no problem with anybody from any part of the world coming into America as long as you do it the appropriate and the right way and you wait in line and you do it the way it's supposed to be done I have a big problem with people that just say I'm going to break into your house 'cause I Want your TV I'm not going to go buy my own\n\nThe president's tweet today was what a strong advocate\nFor a civilized nation sets\nYou you know you look at what the media has done the last twenty four hours Donald Trump is standing\nWith an evil nation in Saudi Arabia again he hasn't\nStood with them he said we're investigating we're taking the time he said the day before he got on to that helicopter go into a campaign rally ... it seems that he was killed and if that's what the facts they're out\nThere will be a very strong response from this country to Saudi Arabia more than words remember don't terms amount of actions not words when it comes to stuff\nAnd of course they say where's the outrage from Donald Trump it's one of the most irritating things about all of this story with with with Saudi Arabia and I'm using as a compare and contrast to what we're talking about with the with how the media is treating him with this caravan of of ... of illegal immigrants coming to America\nYou have a president that they say must be outrage and is an outrage enough to on this one story but then they say this president being outrage over the immigrants coming here legally shows that he's on hand she's a terrible person should calm down it should be loving which one is it\nTo the media which one is if you want a president that defends his country and fights this country's interests like he's doing with these illegal immigrants care of adding to the United states and then when he does that you criticize him for doing its thing he's ... he's crazy and he's mean and evil and he's so many of these poor little people meanwhile he says about Saudi Arabia which again\nI hate that this journalist was murdered\nI also hate that the media acts\nLike journalists are somehow more important than average people I'm In the media I don't think my life has any more important than anybody else listening I don't think my life has any more unique than any other person listening I don't think that my job is it makes me any more significant in society\nOr should make me any more significant in society compared to someone else is just doing a normal hard day's work in something else that maybe doesn't get you quote famer or notoriety or whatever you want to call it the media is so self righteous that if one of their own gets tack they all come and defend and they all freaked out and they all go into overdrive over it\nAnd and the fake outrageous have you know I've been paying attention to the human rights abuses with Saudi Arabia do you not realize that they have killed women because the women were raped\nThey they give lashing to women who were raped because they were sexually and pure but they just allow women to drive and the only reason when they limited drive in Saudi Arabia is because they were taking so much heat for human rights abuses against women they're like All right screw it let's give them a license that will shut up the world\nEvery president in my entire lifetime has had a relationship with Saudi Arabia\nI didn't ... and Saudi Arabia has been brutal you still in Saudi Arabia they ... they were literally take off a limb they will cut off fingers they will cut off risk they will cut off arms they will cut off legs they will cut off ... ... feet\nAs part of punishment\nThey will give lashing to old people and young people in the hundreds and hundreds of lashing they will throw people in prison who are dissidents or do criticize the government they been doing that for as long as I've been on this earth\nAnd I didn't see any of this fake outrage from the media when Bill Clinton was having relations with Saudi Arabia and I'm not talking about sexually I Know we have to clarify with Bill Clinton\n\nNo one was freaking out when Obama had relations with Saudi Arabia\nThey weren't riding these articles they weren't they weren't demanding more out of ... Brock Obama with\nHuman rights my point is the only reason why this one has gotten headlines and has taken a life of its own because it was a member of the media and it's horrific what happened to him\nBut his ... but the media who's acting like this is something we must were I mean the media saying we we demand sanctions basically because of what Saudi Arabia did to this guy that's been happening to other people in Saudi Arabia for as long as they've been alive who are writing these articles it's fake outrage\n\nI don't like how Saudi Arabia does things I also know why we are an ally with them because they're extremely tough on terrorism in that part of the world and they do things that we don't do\nWe also need a place that we can land we also need a place that we can fire we also have it for oil interests whether you like it or not Democrats or Republicans have agreed that a relationship with Saudi Arabia is incredibly important\n\nAgreed that it's important they've all said it's important Obama agrees with Trump and ...\nAnd Obama agrees with Bush Bush grades with Clinton and Clinton agrees with the other Bush and the other parts of grades that Reagan Reagan agrees with\nJimmy Carter we've always had these relations with them\nAnd so now because they do something they've been doing my entire life and it was ... towards a member of the media now we're supposed to put in sanctions and change American foreign policy\nWhen we've known that this this year we've been dealing with all along\n\nSo I gave you that compare and contrast so now how Donald trumps the villain because he threatened to send US military to protect America's border and they say this is too strong it's there's two main meanwhile they're saying we want you to be mean and we want to be strong with Saudi Arabia 'cause we demand at because one of our own was ... was murdered which one is it\n\nHow is it the same demeanor from the same guy can be one eighty from one another all based on your perspective of I'm a journalist and I'm going to be bigger and better than you are and most journalists believe that they are better that their life is more important than your whole life\nI ...
