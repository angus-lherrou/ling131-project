before we were done he said you know I Want to say one more thing can cut all the ladies stand up\nBecause the women in the room stand up and it was more than half of the room\nAnd it was so great that he did that and and and I love having there's still a bunch of women on the line wanting to get in\nBecause there's this there's this fake phony despicable myth\nPerpetuated about talk radio about what we do here when we when we discuss big important ideas and conservative principles and values and we have this free flow of information and exchange of perspectives they will\nLie to you wouldn't say it's just angry white men angry white men angry white men it's always angry white man I'm not angry or are you angry I mean there are some things in this country that if you're not angry

what we do here because they're ... they don't want a new generation of listeners the last thing they want is for a men and women in their twenties that's when people start listening to talk radio when they're done with the idiots who play music and and\nUh blow the the a bicycle horn and ring the cowbell and make jokes about a body parts and they've they've started to get real jobs and have to wear long pants and have bills and are making money and they see how much is getting taken out of their paycheck\nAnd they're trying to settle down and actually be a grown up that's when they start exploring other parts of the radio dial and that's when they hear talk radio because they want to know what's going on out there\nAnd it usually happens in your late twenties early thirties that certainly when it started with me in a serious way\nAnd it terrifies but the mainstream media it terrifies big gate keepers in the media who used to be in charge of all of these outlets radio television newspapers they're still in charge of newspapers but they're not in charge of the Internet\nWhen was the last time you actually bought a newspaper I mean unless you ride the subway in New
