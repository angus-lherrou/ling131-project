{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KNST", "content": "Donald Trump said I'm going to get jobs back in this country and he's done it going to get better trade deals he's done it\nI'm going to get rid of regulations have destroyed American Jobs he's done it I'm going to give incentives for companies to work in America and not keep their money offshore and build factories that Americans have building them overseas and I'm going to fight back on tariffs which he has done\nI'm going to get back to the American people more of their own money which he has done with the ... with the Trump tax cuts\nI'm going to have a country that has aggressively growing\nThat is better for everybody where where the water rises and ... ships\nInsert\nHardcore leftist Democrat who has I Would argue virtually no soul and the reason why I say that is based on facts and the way that she tried to destroy Brett Kavanaugh with no facts\nWhere she did everything in her power to destroy a good man and his family name all because in the name of politics\n\nShe has now come out with an idea that many Democrats are very excited about\nShe says that American families that are making less than a hundred thousand dollars a year should be eligible for a monthly tax credit a five hundred dollars that six thousand a year\nUnder new legislation they announced today by the Democratic party the Democratic US Senator Kamala Harris of California she then went on to say that individuals making less than fifty thousand dollars a year\nShould be eligible for up to two hundred and fifty dollars a month that would be three thousand a year\nNow she said quote Americans are working harder than ever but stagnant wages mean they can't keep up with the cost of living increases that is ally\nAmericans are working harder than ever before right now because of jobs are good and the and the economy's good and many people went from part time employment to full time employment and wages are increasing\nEverything she said that sense is is is nothing but a ... a lie and for all the people that I ever are obsessed with the fact checking every Republican and everything that Donald Trump says why aren't you fact checking her on that because that statement in our own words is ally\nI'm not going to focus on that for for that it's almost like a technicality like compared to what I'm about to tell you\nHarris's office as she rolled out this plan today sided aid to thousands Seventeen survey from the website bank rate dot com that found that more than half of Americans cannot afford a five hundred dollar\nUnexpected expense such as it rent increase a medical bill or childcare\nNow bank rates survey came out and it said their headline of this phone survey went and found the article says just four and ten Americans have savings savings aid rely on in an emergency\nSo what you have is you have\nCome out of hairs are saying okay Obama phones aren't enough anymore to get somebody to vote for me\nBecause people can actually pay for their own darned phone bill now\nFood stamps or not enough because people are walking away from food stamps where we are seeing record numbers of people fall off of food stamps because they're actually getting good jobs where they're being employed in a great economy and they're providing for themselves government aid to keep people in poverty is not enough so now I got to do something new I got to tell you that you still need more help from the government\nAnd I'm going to do it because of a website called bank great dot com that found that more than half of Americans cannot afford a five hundred dollar unexpected expense\nLet me just explain to you how warped this logic is this idea is\nI'll go back to her first part of our proposal she said American families making Ninety nine thousand nine hundred nine dollars a year\nCould be eligible for a monthly tax credit of up to five hundred dollars or six thousand dollars a year and the reason why she wants to give you that money every month this because she says you don't have you haven't saved a five hundred dollars for an unexpected bill that could come in with the rent increase of medical bill or child care\nSo she wants to give you a government subsidized money\nSo that you making nine hundred nine thousand nine dollars a year have an extra five hundred dollars so that she can pay for your unexpected expense\nNow my my quick question for you is this\nWhat makes you think that if you give somebody who's making nine hundred or Ninety nine thousand\nLet me make sure I say this summer correctly because I said it wrong a moment ago so people on the left will freak out so that said it wrong so I'll correct it right now calm down\nYou're making Ninety nine thousand nine hundred nine dollars a year\nAnd you can't save for a five hundred dollar unexpected expense you're an idiot\n\nWhat makes you think that idiot who's making that much money\nIs going to take your government money and then go Oh thank you you just said me for my unexpected next expense of five hundred dollars I'm going to say that money because that same dumb a hasn't saved five hundred dollars of is Ninety nine thousand dollar a year job\n\nRemember when we had the tax credit that came out the Bush tax credit member that what happened everybody took their tax money and they would they do with it they went out and bought a ton of crap and boost the economy and George Bush and those economists around them are right people to save that money they got extra money and they went out and spin it right away\nGo look at the stats\nComing airs she knows that they're not going to say this money for five hundred dollar unexpected expense they're going to take this money immediately just spend every dime of every single month\nOn average\nThe idea that someone making fifty thousand dollars a year if you give them an extra two hundred and fifty dollars a month of the government's money which is our taxpayers' dollars subsidizing people to make under a hundred thousand dollars a year that they're now going to save that money every month for an unexpected medical bill or child care you're an idiot\n\nTwo hundred and fifty dollars a month is not going to save someone's life it means that they don't know how to budget\n\nThis is nothing more than buying votes this is not about ... and the fact that you're doing this under the under a survey from bank great dot com is a reason why we need legislation in this country which she announced today\nThat is going to save America's middle class by giving them extra money among subsides from the government that now they're going to save that money and not spend it on whatever the craft or spend their money on now that they're going to become more responsible with that money compared to the other a hundred thousand or making year she is just liberal and competency at its\nBiggest form you can make\nBring this to a ... a family level if I'm making Ninety nine\nThousand dollars a year and I called my dad and said dad I man I had a flat tire this morning can you can you let me borrow two hundred bucks I don't have it\nMy dad would tell me to drive on the darn fair and get my house in order in my life in order and stop being a screw up\nWould not loaned me the money because if I'm making Ninety nine thousand dollars a year he would say you're an idiot for not saving any of that I Am thousand dollars a year if I was making fifty thousand dollars a year to use her other example\nAnd I had a flat tire and I call my dad or my mom and I said hey mom look I'm only making fifty grand\n\n\n\n\n\nOr December Bob Marley and the ... there live out in record to concerts in London in July I had Paul

I Know puppy that there's been a lot of discussion about this will be more discussion on CNN and all the other networks today [noise] let me get to the point that I think is most disturbing right now\nThe reporting that Jared Kushner may have with U.S intelligence delivered a hit with an enemies with to the crown prince the NBA or Saudi Arabia and that the print that may have acted on that\nOne of the people that he took action against Mr ... soldiers getting killed as they're not that we have to find me\nThere for our view or we do not have that reporting I'm not sure where you're\nGetting there had been reporting to that effect or not a recording to that effect sure\nNow here's where you have to understand why this matters more than just you know some sort of gap for some sort of outraged the outrage of the day a Democrat is accusing Jerry cushion or a ring that hit on this guy and working in concert colluding if you will with the Saudi Arabian government and the crown prince\nA ... that's certainly all valid and true but here's the most important thing you need to understand about this he's one of their stars\n... the Democrats win the house\nTwo and a half weeks from today and he is in the leadership I mean he's he's he's a rising star he\nThey're going to give him power more power than he has right now this guy who was peddling a conspiracy theory that is completely be bumped unfounded and atrocious he goes on CNN in turn national television\nAnd accuses Jared Kushner the president's son in law and a White House advisor\nOf delivering U.S intelligence to Saudi Arabia so that this is a columnist the ... could be killed\nAnd and they're going to give him power\nNow at this may not be the most important election of your lifetime but if you care about the direction of ...\nOur country for the next two years if you care about anything positive getting done if you care if if you are sick and tired and fed up\nOf the ongoing drama the UC play out and cable and broadcast news on a daily basis with regard to the Democrats are acting hysterical about this president and about this administration than this is a no brainer\nThis really is a no brainer you cannot give Joaquin Castro\nAny more power than he already has in the house of representatives frankly he has too much as it is\nAs a junior congressman from Texas He shouldn't be on that committee with that kind of irresponsible behavior with that kind of irresponsible language by the way he he came out later this is this is amazing he came out later and said I didn't intend\nTo a accused Jared Kushner of any illegal behavior and I didn't intend to accused you're a Christian or could you\nMay have with U.S intelligence delivered a hit list an enemies with to the crown prince the NBA or Saudi Arabia and that the president may have acted on that\nOne of the people that he took action again [noise] circus OJ did\nI did he did you hear what he just said and now he claims after the fact via Twitter is how they do it these days that I didn't I didn't intend to accused Jared Kushner\nOf calling a hit or doing anything untoward are delivering this information well here's the problem with these Twitter denials these cowards who won't go on television he's fine going on international television on CNN and making this charge\nThe recording that Jared Kushner may have with U.S intelligence delivered a hit with an enemies with to the crown prince the NBA or Saudi Arabia\nHe goes on international TV and delivers that and then when everyone starts screaming ... and I'm Talking about liberals I'm Talking about the Daily Beast website which is which is a left leaning left complete total left the site\nSays I Can't believe that Joaquin Castro did that he doesn't then go on television and has an exchange with anyone no no no no he puts out his apology non apology denial non denial walk back on Twitter\nWhere he says I did not intend to say that Jared Kushner blah blah blah blah blah and of course there's no reporter not that there would\nBe but maybe poppy Harlow over there at CNN would actually a raise their hand and say okay congressman Castro uh I understand your statements saying that you didn't intend can you tell us what you did intend to say because it seems pretty dang clear what she said\nAnd and and here's the best part of his denial\nThat never got any follow up and never got any challenging has just accept it oh well he's ... he says he didn't intend to do that so let's just take him in his word they didn't do it he said all I said was there was reporting\nTo the effect that Jared Kushner may have done that and Congress needs to investigate I you see\nAnd now and now that's\nThat's the crux of it because you see everything that happens in this town Washington DC everything that's happening down at the border right now everything that you're seeing on cable news night after night after night all of it\nHas to do with the mid term election that Kavanaugh hearings that was all about the mid term elections\nThe the the the way the media and the Democrats and some Republicans are reacting to this story of this a columnist for the Washington Post who apparently was killed\nA by officials with the Saudi Government the way they are all react that has everything to do\nWith the mid term elections the caravan as they're calling it of thousands of Hondurans Salvadorans Guatemalans waving their flags and marching across Mexico to illegally across our border and stay here in this country because they believe they deserve to be here\nAnd we can't do anything about it that has everything to do with the midterm elections\nAnd I in Joaquin Castro's non denial denial via Twitter he revealed something that you need to understand because this is the next two years of our lives\nIf the Democrats when he said\nIt's being reporting it's being reported that Jared Kushner did this and therefore Congress needs to investigate\nDr Christine Blasey Ford comes forward with an allegation that has no corroboration any witness that she names refugees her story\nAnd certainly can't confirm her story it's thirty five years old and nothing anything close to the allegations she made against now justice Kavanaugh had ever been made up until this point but why did the Democrats say well\nThe allegation is out there and it's very serious so it needs to be investigated in fact we need an FBI investigation and it needs to take weeks\nAnd weeks and not liking cast your eye out with and it's being reported so it needs to be investigated and that's\nThe next two years of your life well the New York times is reporting this so it needs to be investigated the Huffington Post is not reported this I don't know if it's true or not but it's very serious it needs to be investigated\n[noise]\nI think Republicans if they're smart and ... let's be clear the jury is out on that they need to start telling voters\nIn key states and key districts exactly what the next two years are going to be like there should be a picture of representative Maxine Waters holding a gavel\nAs chairwoman of the financial services committee making banking laws and regulations and financial regulations for our nation for our economy\nMaxine Waters chairwoman of the financial services committee you want that for the next two years because that's what you get they need to show Joaquin Castro heck he could be the next chairperson chairman of the intelligence committee\nYou want that is that what you want for the next two years President Trump had a great line in his rally last night here it is\nTheir choice to not pay more clear Democrats put his mom [noise]\nRepublicans for the job [noise]\n\nRight and it's a great way to put it and uh and it rhymes and they do like their rhymes uh and and I think that that has residents but I think it goes beyond that listen it's true that we produce jobs it's true that we've
