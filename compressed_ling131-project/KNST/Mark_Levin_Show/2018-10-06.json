go to Nettie in Anchorage, Alaska and I understand that uh you're you're a little higher on Lindsey than non Susan at this point\nWell from the standpoint Ryan I'm an attorney oh moment because I think quite Lindsey there last week it wound up for the Senate didn't have all the trappings but when they may do that every member on that Judiciary Committee\nOr spinning\nExactly what they need to hear I don't think they pay no attention to that but he took a stand in the heat of battle he didn't wait to\nSee which way the wind was blowing that kind of way I look at it and I think and I'm going

I've lost count he was like Energizer\nBunny [laughter] thing they and enthusiasm in those rallies when President Trump would mention cabin I now I Am sure you heard\nThat too um and so I just I I was

I'm like eastern time the Lindsey Graham a week ago yesterday ended up by having that particular moment where he sped up now\nRespectfully disagree with you just in terms of him influencing in this particular case Susan Collins she was so principled and detailed as she laid out I don't think there was anything that she was going to be swayed by by virtue of simply be\nPragmatic yet emotional

going down this path\nWell I Wish I Know they can figure that Brian judging from the a very popular radio show in the afternoon for three to fix up here I rest and not every day and believe me the

what happens there I actually think there's an outside chance that she ends up becoming a boat in the affirmative tomorrow or I Know that the earlier today or in the afternoon after she started getting some of the response in so\nShe'll be an interesting one to watch tomorrow although it should the likely be a formality which gives recovered by the way because after noon after she started getting some of the response in so\nUh she'll be an interesting one to watch tomorrow although we should the likely be a formality which gives recovered by the way because you can go ahead and you're

that\nBut it is really easy to information early and empirically tell you who in what John Paul Stevens is because anytime you can find a Republican in this case a lifelong Republican\nWouldn't give you an idea about John Paul Stevens former Supreme Court justice he is to the Republican Party\nWhat Steven briar is the ... to the Republican Party you'll see the briar how liberal from San Francisco on the ... yes thing go Steven briar now why\nThey are heading Danny little check of the Washington University school of law Supreme Court database went back and compared the voting records of one John Paul Stevens to other Supreme Court just\nBest convicted gets\nBut what you don't hear about\nFolks that sacrifice everything and there was something that happened here yesterday that crystallized says this perfectly for the entire country now the sun sentinel to give you an idea of just in the grand scheme of awful where they stand\nOne of their a major endorsements today was the glowing endorsement of Debbie Wasserman Schultz so on the grand scheme of of of sucking they are all the way they're okay they're the people that hold the Baghdad that make the case for Debbie Wasserman Schultz\nSo it is the consider the source thing but I I Want to illustrate some points here\nThis is an excerpt from an article yesterday police union endorses Republican Ron dissent is for governor for years after endorsing Democrat right\nAway from the story a major union for police officers to Florida police benevolent association is endorsing Republican Ron disadvantages for governor four years ago the Florida PBA endorsed the Democratic nominee for governor Charlie Crist\nAnyways a lot of people's Charlie Crist Charlie Crist are literally has been everything politically in in our state if you're not familiar he currently has a Democrat but as a serving now the saint Pete area but ah anyway what's the last time he actually it was a Republican governor in in Florida\nRubio ran him out of the ... what happened anyway I'm continuing\nAnd Wednesdays endorsement at the same answers the PBA president said dissent is would be the kind of governor who would stand up for what he asserted are unfair efforts to malign bullies\nQuote the men and women of law enforcement want to tell for audience that Iran did say that this has our backs that's why I'm proud to announce that we have his back said the for the PBA president\nAnd his endorsement of this and this is started that police had been treated unfairly in recent years some of the quote\nFrom the president of the or the police benevolent association as we've seen in the past few years police have been scrutinized for doing their job and kicked to the curb by special interest groups media\nAnd politicians which have resulted in the rise of law enforcement officers being killed or assaulted and the line of duty he said and the my blood boils boils here but the be whatever you want to refer to\nThis hose or\nPretends to be an objective journalist I wrote this garbage for the sun's dental he ended the article with this he didn't offer examples of how scrutiny of police has resulted in police being killed or assaulted\nI call myself down\nA morning show yesterday I think at one point I was actually yelling not had any mothers that their children in the car but you know what this is that big of a deal because if we don't have good cops what happens in this country it's game over its came over\nAnd part of what made me so upset I noticed what was going on\nNot long after the whole Kaepernick thing broke was taking a look and and I was\nTracking violence towards police officers remember before the whole capper Nick thing even if you had the Dallas Cowboys and they wanted to honor you know the the cops that were murdered the NFL wouldn't let them and all that and I started being more aware of what was happening to police officers in this country and I noticed that there had been escalating violence I actually started a weekly series that I Do\nHere in South Florida that tracks the violence against police officers and here you have someone posing as a journalist\nWho has the audacity to say he didn't offer examples have ... scrutiny of police as a result of the police being killed or assaulted\n[noise] well I got it for you you might suck at what you do might not do any homework might not want to because it would just prove the nonsense narrative the advanced\nBut here's what's real\nIn this story remember this is before the police benevolent association and about politics is it they endorsed the Democrat four years ago for governor endorsing Rhonda saying is the Republican this year\nSo obviously it's because it matters more now right now they fill in the blanks here since twenty Fifteen\nFive hundred and Seventy three police officers died in the line of duty five hundred and Seventy three to say last made a political endorsement of those five hundred and Seventy three officers three hundred and forty were killed\nThree forty killed and until this week\nWe had and and this is the audacity of this person writing this article and forget about the ... for the police benevolent association with more officers die on the line Judy afforded than any other state in the country but this is how bad it is and yes this is specific to Florida but this is what's going on across the country\nAnd he has the audacity that he didn't offer examples of how scrutiny and police as a result in a place being killed or assaulted\nNow\nIronically it is exactly exactly what the president of the Florida police benevolent association was saying when he made the endorsement with being kicked to the curb by special interest groups\nBy media by politicians and it's exactly why I started this theory that I did a couple of years ago and in the grand scheme of choosing sides we've now been put in that position\nYeah every now and then you're going to have a bad cop get ... get hundreds of thousands of people from any background in any profession together and tell me you're not going to find a bad apple\nBut almost every one of them\nGood people to put their lives on the line every single day for us and it is our responsibility now more than ever to back the badge and spread the word\nIs not getting better it's getting worse we had this kind of crap that's going on and media if we don't have good folks do want to be police officers that put on the badge to leave their families and by the way just this year\nWe had Seventy widows Seventy widows Seventy people that have lost their spouse\nAnd the line of duty we've got more than a hundred children that have lost a parent\nIn the line of duty stories are never told\nBut if we don't have great folks to pick up that badge put it on the field that helped hold that fill that void the rest of the matter\nAnd that's the other way the left is systematically chewing through our society to support your police back them it's about a hell of a lot more than politics I'm Brian mud in for the great one month\nThis is my great new home in Tucson pay and as dean am seven Ninety\nListen to what David
