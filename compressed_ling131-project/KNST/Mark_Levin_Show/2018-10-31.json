little differently on that show I'm going to uh do a monologue and I'm not going to do it normally but I'm going to do it in this case because it's an extraordinarily important time in our history and I'm also going to have an expert on the program to go through a number of races that are very close and I consider very important\n\nWe're truly battling a very bleak force they very dark force in this country that do not share our values and principles they lecture us while they attack us they tell us the tone it down why they call our president Hitler\n\nAnd there's many big it's among them many like Don limit of CNN the thing he said the other day is a fireball offense or Steve Schmidt on MSNBC another big it\nAnd the things he has said and I've gone through and look these are firing offense is but\nThe executives the corporate executives on the boards of directors\nOf these companies Comcast Time Warner and the rest they obviously want this they want a divided country they want the race baiting they want the anti Semitism coming out of the media\n\nThey don't want a United Nation a United Nation they don't want people having civil substantive serious debates\nThey want centralized power\nWith these corporations in these executives believe they can ah they control outcomes in this society\n\nOr we're going to talk more about this is the program goes on but I Want to hit this issue again the birthright citizenship\n\nYou are hearing people who make absolutely no sense on this issue saying that the president cannot use an executive order to address birthright citizenship again my caviar it is that I Know the courts are going to be hostile to any effort\nTo curb birthright citizenship statutory or by executive order\nBut I hear people say a statue will be stronger first of all they're not going to get a statue because it'll be filibustered in the Senate so it's a non issue the Democrats aren't going to allow it they want birthright citizenship\nSome of the filibuster rule in the Senate there will be no statute the president as aware that\nThe commentators on TV even some conservatives they pretend they're not aware of it but we're all aware of it or would have been done already these are the same people in Congress refused to build physical barriers on our southern border to protect this country and to enforce immigration laws suddenly they're going to pass a statute\nOutlawing birthright citizenship but why passed a statute if in fact as the left says and some of these conservatives say 'cause they're known that things\nThat birthright citizenship is in the fourteenth amendment which is what Paul\nRyan said preposterous\n\nIf that's the case that house a statue gonna fix statue won't fix it because they're saying you have to amend the constitution\nWhen's the last time we actually amend the constitution the old fashioned way or want it to the old fashioned ways but a long time why because the left changes the constitution all the time and now when we want to address something that they did\nOutside the constitution now we're told we have to pass a constitutional amendment helps her\nAs we discuss the other day as I\nDiscuss this Daniel Horowitz from conservative review discussed with me\nBirthright citizenship was\nNot actually implemented in this country into the sixties and seventies the Nineteen sixties and early Nineteen seventies by the bureaucracy\nBy the bureaucracy\n\nIt wasn't in the constitution no court ordered it and those statute was passed so why do we have to amend the constitution or pass a statute while while the better chance in front of the Supreme Court if that's the case we have no chance in front of the Supreme Court\n\nAnd as much as this battle of Kavanaugh was so crucial\nHe's not Clarence Thomas he's not Antonin Scalia and neither is John Roberts it's just what it is\n\nThe president happens to be right about this the president happens to be right about the constitution the president happens to be right about an executive order however it turns out and all of his critics happened to be wrong he knows more than they do\nAs Daniel Horowitz put up there on the conservative review today leftist concocted an ingenious game of judicial sir premises and that creates a one way rach it for their policy outcomes heads they win tails they when you have the so called conservative legal community chooses to play the game\nNo where is this more evident than in the debate over so called birthright citizenship with a left\nCherry picks one non binding footnote of a terrible decision misrepresenting another bad decision that violates previous president that plane meaning and purpose of the fourteenth amendment sovereignty and the social Compaq while collectively ignoring enlist I'm interrupted case law indicating the opposite\nOffer the political outcome of giving our sacred birthright to illegal aliens\n\nThe fourteenth amendment representative James F Wilson Republican Iowa the chairman of the house Judiciary Committee back in the Eighteen sixties who helped draft the fourteenth amendment spoke in fat ugly that it was quote\nEstablishments no new right declaring no no principle on quote\nQuote it is not the object to this bill to establish new rights but to protect and enforce those which belonged to every citizen unquote that's what he declared a Nineteen sixty six I Want you to think about it how many states ratify this amendment\nIf they believed it will be applied to illegal alien babies\nKnown as birthright citizenship not a one\n\nThere's a madman west pastor bread tech African American former slaves not foreigners yet to be born who have no right to come into this country illegally\nPeriod\nNotion that an amendment designed a grand freed slaves who lived here for centuries and had no allegiance to any other jurisdiction the basic rights of American citizens will be used as a tool to prevent Congress from
