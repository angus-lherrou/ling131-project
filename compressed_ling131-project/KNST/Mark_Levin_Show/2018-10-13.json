{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KNST", "content": "Is it from and that remains the gates as we are a little more than three weeks away from the general election if you take a look at an average of various different pulling out there you'll see that among adult only samples President Trump's approval rating about forty three percent\nAmong registered voters at pretty much around the same but among likely voters we've continued to see it rise\nYou'll see some pulling rats was at one point as we got to fifty one percent and an average of all likely voters the president's been averaging around forty six forty seven percent now that might not sound great but let me put things in perspective for for a moment\nDonald Trump's approval rating at this point in his presidency compared to bronco bombers among likely voters his approval rating happens to me right now three points higher than Brock Obama's three points higher\nNow imagine this for about a president with Ninety two percent negative coverage compared to a president with forty six percent negative coverage\nAnd yet\nThe one with Ninety two percent negative coverage among people who are likely to vote does that are most informed those that are most engaged\n... it's a rather incredible story that's often emitted and here's the bigger point I've always said that you can lie to people about what they don't know\nBut you can't lie to them about what is ... and in their wallet this was true of Obamacare\nAll of the lives that were thrown out there were perpetuated wild that whole deal was going down\nIt was guaranteed not to work it was guaranteed to fail but hey we've got a bunch of people don't want it to believe they bought into the hope and change okay so Obamacare is going to be great okay and here we are in eight years later or the same insurance coverage you have\nMedicare for all its financial fraud what the president was pointing out there the eight hundred billion over ten years that's diverted\nHere is what actually happened to Medicare he's a hundred percent right it's not a political talking point it's a fact\nIf you go back a few years ago Medicare was projected to begin to hit insolvency in the twenties thirties kind of like Social Security but what you've seen over recent years is increasingly we're going to reach insolvency sooner now you don't have to be a financial genius to pick up on a couple of\nPoints real quickly and here's the first one if\nWe already are pacing insolvency with Medicare as we know it was going to happen if we put everybody on it\nNow here's the deal corn into the federal trust the Medicare we hit insolvency in twenty twenty six as it is twenty twenty six eight years from now now what happens in year one nine percent of Medicare benefits to party\nGone first year nine percent Medicare part C\nAnd it gets worse every year from there that currently you got Fifteen Percent of Americans that are on Medicare Fifteen Percent that's it\nYou got a hundred percent of the workforce contributing to it but you do the math on this one real quick Fifteen Percent on Medicare insolvency in eight years what happens when we put the other eighty five percent of the population on it\n[laughter] I mean it is financial fraud is bigger than Bernie Madoff yeah you have a political party that's perpetuating it in Florida we've got the Democratic ... a gubernatorial candidate that is running on it\nFinancial fraud running on a platform of financial fraud\nAnd by the way\nIf you're not paying attention to board has given the joy of race and you're not in Florida that's okay\nThat's okay but guess what if Andrew Gillum if the socialist when's\nWhere we've gotten much bigger problems because it's coming to a state near you\nOne of the most important elections in the entire country this year is what's happening right here in my home state of Florida where we have run this and this was the Trump candidate who is running as the Republicans will replace Rick Scott who was term limited and running for the Senate\nAndrew Gillum is the Bernie Sanders candidate\nI Want you to think about this for a moment because you're used to for being the purple state the swing state we tend to have you know fairly moderate politicians ... no\nYou won't have the most liberal and leftist governor and the entire country if Andrew Gillum whims and he got well that sucks to be you and for to know it sucks to be you everywhere because here is what will happen\nWe've already seen it start start to take place Andrew Gillum was not backed by the Democrats in our state\nHe was one of the five candidates running the establishment on the left ended up backing Gwen Graham\nWithin the daughter of former governor of Bob Graham in our state she finished second to Andrew Gillum Andrew Gillum rode the wave of the Bernie Sanders support he ended up winning the Democratic nomination which is thirty four percent of the vote that was enough to get through\nWhat's happened is\nThey now consolidated around him of course the Democrats the party Soros came in here with his money Michael Bloomberg\nJust came out to South Florida held an event for Andrew Gillum cut him a check to a ... year Michael Bloomberg felt like he uses the populist the sensible guy he's backing somebody who is a democratic socialist for governor and the state of Florida\nBut what's happening now that they're getting behind him and that he's running at this point a race to where he is a slight favorite to win\nThere watching closely and they're saying hey he's getting the young people young people typically don't vote in mid term elections\nAnd so what happens in Florida rarely stays in Florida but this race ... is critical and again there is one platform piece in particular\nThat is really important to watch and it is the Medicare for all which by the way is all that much more ironic what you're talking about the governor's race because Medicare federal program that doesn't really matter Andrew Gillum has also run on impeach him President Trump a kid you not\nThat's part of what's going on here\nNow this is why it's important to educate is why it's important to inform simple\nConcepts like this if Medicare is already set to fail in just eight years\nAnd benefits will be cut and you've only got Fifteen Percent on it it is impossible it is a financial fraud is out and out this honest is that you could put everybody on it and it's going to get better there is no way without massive tax increases massive benefit cuts to be able to achieve what they're talking about\nBut if it wins politically than what we've gotten much\nIn hiding your IP address the app takes Ninety seconds to set up on your computer or phone you

you use which job zeroes [laughter] so anyway that was a that was an interesting moment ... but again you know when you've got\nThe the dragon energy and you've got your mega Superman ad on things happen you know it's really hard to get a channel all of that and and you gotta you know every now and that you're going to have a hydrogen I I play\nAnd that the president well the president [laughter]\nI was talking earlier you one of my one of my all time favorite reactions Michael Meyers\nWatching ... da du the Katrina really like where\nIs the exit button on this stage right now how can I get off of here now please\nAnd ah you know one of those moments but President Trump is like okay what do I do hear you talking about role reversal because he's usually the people may person making people dumped trouble but uh you got to got to be on that but once you got a dose of his own kind of thing there\nAnyway are talking about some of the financial fraud that's been perpetuated Medicare for all is a financial fraud again if you miss what I had to say about a half hour ago it's not complicated and this is the way the shutdown drop the Mike argument you have\nA Fifteen Percent of Americans on Medicare right now it's patient insolvency an eight years\nFifteen Percent ... percent of folks do work Iran are contributing to Medicare insolvency in eight years what happens\nWhen you but the other eighty five percent on back to you okay so that is the greatest financial fraud that would ever be perpetuated on this country and it is a disingenuous dishonest argument that is\nPerpetuated up people by virtue of the average adult being financially illiterate and again now my opinion\nProven by the NRA sixty percent of adults are financially illiterate it's all part of the problem that we've got to overcome informational here but here's something else\nThat is a fraud that is perpetuated on people I talked about the benefit of the\nTax cuts and how the average person that take home pay this year\nUp six point seven percent which by the way when you run into somebody well I haven't seen any benefit from it well that's just because you probably haven't done anything about it most recently we've seen in a report that came out showing that about thirty million Americans never made any adjustments either their employers didn't they didn't put the tax cuts\nSo it's all going to be reconciled when they file their taxes but they wouldn't be saying that money right now if they had actually made the adjustments with their employer so that's what's going on with almost everybody that I haven't seen it well it's because you haven't done anything now\nThe next part that fraud comes in with companies you\nHear how awful the tax cuts are because evil corporations you know they're the ones we worked for the evil corporations they're using it to buy back all the stock and you know do what rich corporate back cats do to screw the little guy\nYou know that that stuff except that that's a fraud as well it's dishonest to its ally the a C B say you know the the vast right wing media CNBC [noise] bad the CFO council and they get research from them constantly\nOn what's going on with any number of different issues and so on the tax cuts\nCNBC what their CFO council\nHave found a few things that are interesting for example what is the the most common way what's been the biggest beneficiary\nOf the corporate corporate not the person on the corporate tax cuts\nThe share buybacks right this horrible shareholders of which you probably are one\nActually the employees get this according to the CFO council CNBC is now thirty five percent thirty five percent\nOf all tax cuts savings has gone to a combination of bonuses an employee raises thirty five percent twenty percent has gone to a debt reduction which makes sense we've seen interest rates rise companies that have dead they should paid off that helps the company become more stable essence their debt burden with rights rising\nFifteen Percent Fifteen Percent on share buybacks ten percent upgrading software five percent upgrading ... uh upgrading equipment and five percent have increased evidence so all in the combination of share about buybacks in David in payouts twenty percent that's it\nAnd even then you probably benefit because once again something that is not perpetuated information only by our friends and media generally\nFifty two percent of Americans own stocks and by the way despite the volatility of the past few days way with the greatest wealth creation machine the history of the world is your United States stock market so I don't apologize for that anyway but the biggest beneficiary is you\nThey complete thorough background in credit checks

who made\n... favorite superhero no no no\nWe're going to be on it however you want to do it [laughter]\n\nYou know some of the things that you didn't necessarily know specifically we're going to happen with Donald Trump is president but hey you know there would be the moment so it'd be a little bit different you know uh and yes you have the fame to outrage the the moral folks in the media that are\nOh my gosh the profanity Twenty years Twenty years removed\nFrom the oval office equally a blue dress sow Kanye West using profanity and the oval office is somehow or another Twenty years later oh just reprehensible but the president's you know\nDoing a little Lewinsky thing I mean that yeah that was okay oh that was\nActually part of the Nineteen Ninety eight midterm election at all and beach minute effort which is interesting because they're on the number of different comparisons you can actually make between that mid term cycle in this one but are they talking about some of the\nMisinformation out there the fraud that is Medicare for all talked about how much more money we're really making that take home pay up six point seven percent year over year\nAnd then you get into this recent study that was really just mind numbing it's why we have the broad being perpetuated that is Medicare for all survey\nRepublicans believe us economic system is fair to most Americans Democrats do came out earlier this week Republicans believe us economic system is fair to most Democrats do\nHere's the irony of all this success not exactly being partisan getting Kanye West not exactly you're right wing Republican conservative type\nBut guess who else isn't like all of your riches self made people in this country in a flood a few names of the richest Americans for a moment Jeff Bezos\nWarren Buffett Mark Zuckerberg Bill Gates you happened to notice a trend here they all happen to be left to ease once again to science histories one side effects so why is it\nThat with the rich is the most successful the wealthiest individuals in this country actually bean left to use that most Democrats feel the euro us economic system isn't fair\nAs gets back to what I pointed out earlier this hour sixty percent of adults being financially illiterate\nBut here's the more important point and this is another shutdown argument if you want it you'll have people talk about how much more fair it is elsewhere well guess what the median world per capita income\nIs ten thousand two hundred Ninety eight bucks\nAnd the United states you can even legally work fulltime and earn less than sixteen thousand dollars a year\nSince the minimum wage in the United states which as I pointed out a little bit ago\nOnly point six percent of the population orange is approximately sixty percent higher than the median income around the world so to all the folks who said that our economic system isn't fair nobody's keeping you hear\nA lot to let's go to Ryan in California Ryan go\nHey uh as soon as the tax uh thing went through I paid attention to my paychecks\nRight when it went through I notice thirty dollars more and I went to all of my co workers where I work at a Bush and all those guys they're like well I've got thirty\nIt so it was like thirty to thirty five bucks that the federal government wasn't taking away from me so those crumbs that Nancy Pelosi was talking about actually makes a difference\nShe wants she comes back man [laughter] she wants to come back but I have a fight\n[laughter] good stuff British in the rye once again you can lie to people\nBut you can't lie to people about what is more isn't in their wallet as Ryan just pointed out\nThat will provide some price transparency part is the importance in breaking the back of this model\nIf we did then you would have everybody that would have\nTo compete on a service and outcome type of model just like we do with everything else that's why you know I I make the analogy to all of their insurance products in our lives if you end up having a you know a a minor\nIssue with your car you go to a mechanic he get it fixed you can shop around you can\nSee what mechanics or reliable which ones you feel good about the what things cost and make that decision if you get into a significant accident\nYou end up filing an insurance claim probably just looking for a good body shop at your insurance company will go and work with right you're not do it as much shopping there so the first thing you know even if we can get to this place are going to be some exceptions\nBut don't imagine they'll ever be a good time to be shopping for the best price when you're having to go to the emergency room for some major medical a bit right uh so that would be in a moment where it wouldn't necessarily apply there might be\nSome other major surgeries to where it wouldn't necessarily apply I mean they were talking major surgeries you have complications that you don't even know about it until you get in there are so like you know there are some of these things will never be solved a by being able to say oh okay well this has everything I Need medically and here's the price\nBut again for all the basics\nIt would provide that level of transparency and that's kind of the the more important point generally but to your specific situation\nAgain I I feel for you and and I wish you the best and I hope that you can find a some providers nearby that would be able to assist you they can't provide some level of transparency what I have done and I'll tell you that it's not always the most popular thing\nAnd it's not necessarily a something that always comes with an answer\nBut I Will ask people in my wife's got good at this to ask you how much is this going to cost\nAnd it can lead to the health care provider\nKinda running in circles and every now and then you won't get an answer I have actually not obtained healthcare and in some instances because they couldn't tell me how much something was going to cost\nI won't necessarily just signed a piece of paper that says hey whatever happens in here I'm going to pay for I don't provide any of them my Social Security number because they don't have a right to it\nSo in that context you can ask hey here's my situation what am I looking at and hopefully there are some providers that might be able to provide you with the least some guidance on that type of information\nBut again not God Bless and best wishes to you and if anybody comes through some specific information make sure that uh your your information there uh we uh we have it and I can get in touch with you I'm\nAll right so switch gears here for a moment away from health care over to another major fraud by the way\nAs we are getting into this climate talk you're going to hold on who is this guy it's clearly not the gray one now you're right and I'm more like the little one I Am [laughter] I'm Brian mud I'm yourself for different\nI I Do a morning show W. J. you know in West Palm Beach and humid morning show on W. I. O. D. in Miami and are always a pleasure and an honor to be here with you and filling in for the gray one\nAnd or you can catch me I Twitter had probably ... radio\nAnd I live on some principals suicides histories one side effects\nI operate on the premise I Will never accept a false one and I will sir than anything that's built upon the false premise is destined to fail\nAnd also tonight I've talked about the sliding scale morality I think it helps explain a lot of what goes on in our everyday life how some people can seem like they're good people in good times and then turn around and stab us in the back\nOr in this particular case how we now have a political party that's basically embraced or a lack of morality to where they are willing to be dishonest and lie about major issues that would impact every American Life the fraud that is Medicare for all for example\nAnd then have people buy into it the political party that will perpetuate a series of of lies and deceit like Christine Ford in I Believe her\nAs Chuck Schumer Dianne Feinstein and many Democrats did because then their constituents believe them creating a whole major segment of this country that embraces a lack of morality and a lack of honesty lack of integrity and decency but we also have that with climate stuff\nAnd the un ah the the blessing un by the way Nikki Haley was about the only thing good at the un\nAnd now she's handing out\n... [noise] how many people I wouldn't necessarily miss it if we we did just go ahead and say well I got to subsidize the Oregon subsidize the UN and man that has some fine real estate in Manhattan and we happen to have a president knows a thing or two about Manhattan real estate anything\nAnyway er here is a headline and the specter that was brilliantly done\nGood news we now have until twenty thirty to save the earth\nIs there's an excerpt from the specter story according to the I. P. C. C. report we now have twelve years to avert climate catastrophe\nThat might not sound long but it means we're good deal further away from doomed and we were in two thousand seven when the WWF said we have five years to save the world the doomsday clock hadn't moved in two thousand eleven when the international Energy Agency ward now we would have five years\nTo start slashing carbon emissions or lose their chance for ever\nBy last year it had shortly to three years\nAccording to Christina figures the executive secretary of the un framework convention on climate change but now it's right up at twelve years presumably meaning that we can pretty much ... ... or or thumbs until twenty thirty a whole Eighteen years after the WWF\nTold us the world would come to an end if we didn't slash carbon emissions\nTheir tongue in cheek approach to pointing out how disingenuous dishonest and wrong the United nations has been year after year after year with their doomsday report but what happens year after year after year\nYou have the same folks in the media the same folks on the left saying votes in education\nAnd raise it all my single again this could you imagine I I you know I I've always taken a look at meteorologists and then gone man\nI could not imagine getting up every day being wrong more than half of the time getting a paycheck and feeling good about home life these people are worse than that\nEvery year they keep jobs there well respected they go on this speaking surrogate it's\nFascinating to watch so the question is when will credibility matter and I'm going to break

tornado so you'd be spots where [noise] you know everything was down and you see you know it's like a tornado weather [noise]\nBut he is Florida's governor Rick Scott who is term\nLimited and actually running against Bill Nelson for the United States Senate one of the most important races in the country because Rick has a chance to any Republican pickup Bill Nelson has not faced a tough competition pretty much at any point he's won his election in Florida by five twenty two\nAnd Eighteen points and Rick Scott right now is in a statistical tie a it's kind of unfortunate he he's even in the ... been a easily a top three governor during his seven plus years\nAnd he has been rock solid remarkable dealing with disasters like well we've been dealing with with hurricane Michael here which which by the way\nAh I'm Brian mud informed more club in by the way and I'm In south eastern Florida quite fortunate to be virtually missed entirely by the storm we got a little bit of weather but nothing of of significance here but for the folks in the panhandle\nWhat you why what you see is is very real for one specific community Mexico beach and to a certain extent the surrounding areas they give you an idea in a comparison real quick a lot of folks\nAre familiar with Hurricane Andrew even if you're not anywhere near South Florida course Hurricane Andrew the devastation you might even have some of those images in your\nHead in one of the things that I ended up noticing\nWhen we're taking a look at some of the imagery come back from Mexico beach ground zero for hurricane Michael a lot of pictures that looked an awful lot like what we saw with Hurricane Andrew you heard a Rick Scott say there's like a tornado\nWell it is you know in hurricanes a lot of people but to focus on the category and the tops of St when\nVery rarely is the wind the issue and hurricanes and I know that sounds weird if you're not used to have having to deal with them ... about almost anything but the wind just says you solve with boards and the Carolinas just as you saw with Harvey\nIn Houston last year it's the flooding storm surge and flooding is responsible for the overwhelming majority of damage in death and hurricanes\nRarely is it about the when now Hurricane Andrew was about the wind\nWhen you get to a certain level you're not just talking about a tornado you're talking about a hurricane that around its core is a tornado to give me an idea you got that scale you know you've got the F. one through the five tornadoes go right\nWith top sustained winds at a hundred and fifty five miles an hour\nHurricane Michael was three miles per hour away from being an F three tornado I'm very for Jim I got my my family has been trying to ah\nTo give me a heart attack I think I got my parents and my sister and my brother in law veteran Naples last year or ma I hit them directly they ended up being alright ironically and I'm On the other coast um southeastern Florida\nUm I was without power for five days we had a little tornado came through tore up some of the power lines near us\nThey were without power for like going to say actually fared better where Hurricane Irma struck directly than than we did go figure\nBut I got a brother and Panama City beach you sold the reporters through Michael that were on PC beach give me an idea and he has a\n... about ten miles from ground zero and really about four to six miles outside never lost power and bill without cell service pretty much for the past couple of days boat in the marina\nBasically fine\nRight they are back close just a matter of miles and that's because we are talking about a hurricane that went through as Governor Scott said like a tornado\nThere's something else that is kind of a an important and the cons contacts in the conversation and this is a a meeting you for anybody who could be on any coastline you'd be in the northeast could be anywhere between you could be on the Gulf and take a look what happened to Mexico beach\nI ah I had an idea\nOne silver lining that came out a Hurricane Andrew was building codes we have what's called the Miami Dade code that is walk solid you don't do anything but concrete anymore\nAnd affected areas and it makes a difference every now and then you see the pictures of Mexico beach you'll see structures that are still standing right next to whole areas that are just completely wiped down nothing but to break you'll what's the difference there\nHad an idea that all those homes were built well before we had the Miami Dade standards after Hurricane Andrew in Ninety two went back and took a look the average home that was built Mexico beach is Nineteen eighty three Nineteen eighty three\nWell before the standards would framed homes and so the media you is your in one of those types of homes and you're at a point to where you could be impacted by a hurricane", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show", "city": "Tucson", "day":
