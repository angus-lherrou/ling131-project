dollar minimum wage which we know what that does Seattle tried and it was a big failure\nHe's insisting\nFlorida law enforcement must not and will not turned over criminals who served their terms in state prisons to the federal government to be deported instead he would have been released into your neighborhood that's the only alternative\nAnd Jake Tapper did a lousy job of explaining that he didn't explain it at all\nHe wants to Medicare for all which means eliminate Medicare eliminate every private insurance program eliminate employer private insurance programs eliminate insurance

more people\n\nSays relieving six billion dollars on the table with the fed when he doesn't tell us twenty five cents out of every dollar spent in Florida goes to medicate as it is today\nAnd you're not leaving six billion dollars on the table because under Obamacare the first few years that medicate the subsidies are we're a hundred percent but they're not always going to be a hundred percent they could be fifty percent they will be thirty percent who\nKnows but you in Florida will pick up the bill\nFor all of it\n\nThe reason you of growth in Florida is because you have people moving to

mode\n\nThey didn't blame Donald Trump port incidentally 'cause how could they because the Trump family was receiving some of these things\nThe president was sent to the president and he gets death threats all the time\n\nSo there's something odd about how the reporting takes place on so much of this now that said\nI told you yesterday that I could see and together we could see how the media we're moving to attacking\nTrump for what's taking place and now it's fully open\nIt's fully open\nThat Trump's words in Trump's rallies and Trump's\nTweets are encouraging this sort of thing\nAnd I took a stand yesterday at least for the first to the program and I explained well actually the media say many more hatred vile disgusting things and the president does that any politician does\nNational Cuba's radio NPR contacted Westwood One and asked them if I Would submit to a twenty minute interview\nI said why would I submit to a twenty minute interview just spend an hour talking about it\nYou can download it so you can do your little cherry picking in your set up job and I don't know why there is a National Public radio it's unnecessary we have thousands of radio stations

media are out there trying to determine\nWho politically should benefit and who politically should be punished it's the damage thing it's the most grotesque thing\n\nAnd of course it's Trump Trump's to blame about Trump's not to blame for any of it he didn't do anything now I Want to um play a montage for you\nOn this pathetic program on MSL us the the morning show and Mr ... you're going to hear

rhetoric we've had this guy over and over again\nThis is a price on that is called the media the enemy at people and right now\nSo the president calls the media the enemy of the people and their ten bombs I don't know if they're fake bombs real bombs whatever they are but they are obviously a terrorism threats as far as I'm concerned\nAnd that you see is what triggers everything I remember when Gabby Giffords was shot the federal judge was murdered I remember that since ... that assassination attempt on her\nAnd it turns out the guy was a psycho and I remember how they tried to blame Sarah
