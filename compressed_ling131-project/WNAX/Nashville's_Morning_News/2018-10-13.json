right at the doctor I'm more concerned about the muscles that you don't feel\nSuch as the muscles get an artery snow up and the mother's heart is a giant myself over and the muscles in and around your digestive tract mhm because these are the things that are resulting in in a heart disease digestive difficulties\nAnd I want to talk a little bit and your show today about nutrition because there are two nutrients that completely handle the body in terms of stress okay now according to the research that I've been involved with his it's as simple as calcium and magnesium\nCalcium and magnesium right okay\nWhen you're deficient in calcium and magnesium a lot of things can happen counting magnesium for example\nIs needed in order to go to sleep at night and how many people you know they just don't sleep while you wake up tired your body hurt more\nPretty soon it starts to wear you down and pretty soon you get sick and you have a condition that people are suffering for pain and osteoporosis and fibromyalgia and Cranston their legs and weird illnesses so there's something wrong with this picture and it has to do it not how much calcium someone taking in their diet or how many calcium supplement their\nHow many in Athens you chew it has to do with simple absorption is that calcium getting absorbed into your body\nWith calcium being something to do with stress season calcium

affecting twenty five million Americans right now which is called osteoporosis right which is a weakening of adult\nNow and that's due to the body deriving the calcium from the bones instead of from the nitrogen yep\nOkay and so we have to do is we have to find a way to put calcium back in the diet now you think that would be really easy\nIssue or district milk\nJust drink milk or you know eat a lot of green leafy vegetables and that sort of thing but first of all people don't do that right\nAnd second of all the the quality of the couch and that comes from our diet has been decreasing in the last fifty years really because things like pastures Asian food they're irradiated hum the calcium as leach from the soil and\nPeople are taking medications that block it so\nThe actual calcium is that being absorbed in the body okay and then you see people taking toms and calcium supplements you know they buy the health food store drug writer right but these things don't absorb and the body for a couple of reasons\nOne uh when you take a let's say an antacid that had the ... like a dumb [noise] first of all calcium does not absorb in the body unless it's an anesthetic environment but see what happens when you take a Tom antacid oh oh okay so you're in if you're getting calcium in the in\nThe ... that itself is\nThat being absorbed icy because it has to be an Internet an environment

started going on and it took about seven maybe a day is the pain went away wow crazy isn't it\nAnd that's how you know something's working right if you stop in the health issues come back well there's your answer\nSo that's the best that anyone can listen to especially if you're on the fence\nYou go I Wonder if this is really for me and for it I Would do the next time you give up the number to have people orders is go ahead and order and I know you mentioned it's a risk free off her and go ahead and try yourself and stay on it for five six weeks and then you're still doubt it then go off of it and see if anything gets worse\nAnd again folks don't want to take a moment here to let you listeners know that if you want to try Dr ... vitamin D three formula there's a special toll free number for

call is one eight hundred\nFor six seven zero to nine eight and I'll give it to you again it's one eight hundred for six seven zero to nine eight [noise]\nSo what do you think folks are you one of the Seventy percent of people listening most likely taking the wrong type of vitamin D supplements joining us today is our good friend Dr Michael Pincus and we've been talking about his fast melt vitamin D three formula\nAnd Dr biggest what you're saying is that most of us are deficient in vitamin D\nAnd because of that deficiency it's causing health issues like pain muscle weakness immune problems and the most vitamin D supplements are not the best form and more importantly is not the right amount of vitamin D to really make an impact is that what you're saying\nExactly what I'm saying it's a multifaceted problem where one for not getting enough vitamin D three in our system\nVitamin D the trees are responsible for activating two thousand different genes in the body controlling everything from diabetes to hormone production to\nMuscle strength of eating correctly digestion immune system\nIt's a really long list and honestly surprised me because in medical school we learned that vitamin D was necessary for the bombs we get enough being outside and in our milk and end of story right down for the first twenty\nSome years I practice I never prescribe vitamin D I just didn't think it was necessary and then in the early to thousands of the study started coming out and now there is over twenty three hundred studies\nThat just show the vitamin D is absolutely necessary it's not just a good idea it's absolutely necessary and it's a hormone\nThat should be in the body and it's not there\nAnd you share some of that research Dr ... and more importantly what conclusion of the research related to vitamin D\nWell one of the biggest studies ever on vitamin D for from the U.S navy okay\nSo I think it was like a hundred and forty five thousand men and women were studied and they found that the number one non combat the reason that people died in the navy was due to melanoma so skin cancer so I'm\nReading study you know I I kind of plot is right there I went yeah makes sense you know people are out on the decks of shift in the equator and all over the world and they're getting the harmful you know you're young raise and and they're developing skin cancer\nBut then I read on and it said most of the victims were office workers like clerks and people in hangers on inside and out all night it was a link going back to vitamin D deficiency in the body\nWhat about muscle and bone stream ... three formula help with that\nCritical like if you're someone that's over fifty especially here seeing a progression of the core muscles in your body is starting to slow down\nFor us it's kind of a common thing is that people kind of feel like they're getting clumsy physically and then at the lack of flexibility you start to stiffen up and you feel at night especially if you're in bed\nFor all in from side to side you wake up with your knees are hurting your legs are restless your shoulders her set this set in the end that's associated with a lack of vitamin D three and my formula so if you're someone listening right now and you're having a lot of the joint pain ball and pain muscle pain\nFibromyalgia I Would say on my formula like immediately and start taking one or two of my ... three's a day for the first week or two to get your doses up quickly\nSo let me ask you about these gummy vitamins does that work can you put enough vitamin D into a little gummy bear and is that the best way to get it in your body\nOf course Chris you know they'll go to any type of lengths to try to market things that theme good but you're taking a lot of sugar and gelatin wax and my thing is it's not what you what your body absorb\nWhen I Want to talk more about what happens when people start taking your fast smell the three formula\nBoy that's a really good question because the first area that vitamin D seems to affect your energy\nYour sleep your outlook your mood and then after being on it for a while here core strengths will come back so for those of you who have slowed down you're going to feel more energy like physically so it's kind of like the only in a little bit younger crashed", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Nashville's Morning News", "city": "Yankton",
