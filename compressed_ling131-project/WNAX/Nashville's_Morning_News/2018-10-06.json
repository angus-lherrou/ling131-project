about stress and\nGive us some great information on things that we can do to reduce or even eliminate the negative effect the daily stress has on our bodies for those that may not know Dr ... he is a nationally recognized authority on natural an alternative health he's\nWorked with top Hollywood celebrities professional and Olympic athletes and he continues to be involved in the latest research into today's top health concerns and Dr biggest thanks so much for being with us today\nThanks Chris great to be with you\nSo let's get right into this whole stress issue you know stress is such a normal part of our daily routine these days but why should we be concerned about it and more specifically what's going on in our bodies and one of the warning signs that we should be looking for\nUp you know there's two ways to look at stress on is what we call mental stress on the other the other is how stress affects your body as a doctor I'm more interested in how it affects your body sure so the way stress affects the body as this I'm going to persons under stress the body transpose as the stress into tension\nAnd your muscles end up contract and everyone feels that in there in the upper back in ... right as a doctor I'm more concerned about the muscles that you don't feel\nSuch as the muscles get an artery oh that guy up and the ... those are the heart is a giant myself over and the muscles in and around your digestive tract mhm because these are the things that are resulting in\nIn a heart disease digestive difficulties and I want to talk a little bit in your show today about nutrition because there are two nutrients\nThat it's completely handle the body in terms of stress okay now according to the research that I've been involved with the simplest calcium and magnesium\nCalcium and magnesium right okay\nWhen you're deficient in calcium and magnesium a lot of things can happen\nCounting magnesium for example is needed in order to go to sleep at night and how many people you know they just don't sleep well you wake up tired your body hurt more\nPretty soon it starts to wear you down and pretty soon you get sick and you have a condition that people are suffering for pain and I still roses and fibromyalgia and cramps and their legs and we're illnesses\nSo there's something wrong with this picture and it has to do it not how much calcium someone taking in their diet or how many calcium supplement their how many in Athens you chew it has to do with simple absorption is that calcium getting absorbed into your body\nWith calcium being something to do with stress season calcium for building bones\nWell yeah OK yeah and it does build your teeth but he's the one percent of the calcium actually circulates in your blood\nSo in that one percent starts to drop it could affect your heart your brain your kidneys your organs and your body shutdown actually died\nWow this one percent of the calcium always has to be in your system and either two sources of calcium one isn't the diet you know and to is from the bones themselves\nThe body will exist ... absorb it back from the bones if ...\nThat's right but I say and what you just discussed right now leads to one of the major causes of a condition that's affecting twenty five million Americans right now which is called osteoporosis right which is a weakening of a ball\nAnd that's due to the bunny deriving the calcium from the bones instead of from the ... tradition\nYep okay and so we have to do is we have to find a way to put calcium back in the diet do you think that would be really easy\nTo just drink milk just drink milk or you know eat a lot of green leafy vegetables and that sort of thing but first of all people don't do that right\nAnd second of all the the quality of the calcium that comes from our diet has been decreasing in the last fifty years really because things like pastures Asian irradiated hum the calcium as we turn the soil and\nPeople are taking medications that block it so\nThe actual calcium is that being absorbed in the body okay and then you see people taking toms and calcium supplements you know they buy the health food store drug writer right but these things don't absorbing the body topic for a couple of reasons\nOne uh when you take a let's say on antacid that had the calcium in like a first of all calcium does not absorb in the body unless it's an anesthetic environment but see what happens when you take a Tom is an aunt at that oh oh okay so even if you're getting calcium in the\nThe ... that itself is that being absorbed\nIcy because it has to be an Internet that environment for it to be absorbed\nExactly okay now we have a product called the ... formula\nBut comics formula it's natural and the differences that powder and what happens as he put it in hot water and you mix it up and you drink it don't do it in a liquid instead of a pill\nAnd it absorbed into your system\nWow so that's a problem that\nWell yeah because I wouldn't count the magnesium earn a liquid state it absorbs ten times better than in any other state\nWell that's great matter of fact yes I'm I'm reading the can right now says the fans absorbing calcium and magnesium beverage powder\nIt comes down to ... one of the ways to tell if you're not observing calcium is take a look at what drugs they're taking are you on high

the health issues come back well there's your answer\nThat's the best that anyone can listen to especially if you're on the fence\nYou go I Wonder if this is really for me and what I Would do it the

eight hundred for six seven zero to nine eight and I'll give it to you again it's one eight hundred\nFor six seven zero to nine eight [noise]\nSo what do you think folks are you one of the Seventy percent of people listening most likely taking the wrong type of vitamin D supplements joining us today is our good friend Dr Michael ... and we've been talking about his fast melt vitamin D three formula\nAnd documenting is what you're saying is that most of us are deficient in vitamin D\nAnd because of that deficiency it's causing health issues like pain muscle weakness immune problems and the most vitamin D supplements are not the best form and more importantly is not the right amount of vitamin D to really make an impact is that what you're saying\nThe same criticism multifaceted\nProblem where one for not getting enough vitamin D three in our system ... vitamin D the trees are responsible for activating two thousand different genes in the body controlling everything from diabetes to hormone production to\nMuscle strength heart beating correctly digestion immune system\nIt's a really long list and honestly as surprise me because in medical school we learned that vitamin D was necessary for the phone\nWe get enough being outside and in our milk and end of story right and for the first twenty some years I practice I never prescribe vitamin D I just didn't think it was necessary and then in the early to thousands of the study started coming out and now there is over twenty three hundred studies\nShow that vitamin D is absolutely necessary is a good idea it's absolutely necessary and it's a hormone\nThat should be in the body and it's not there\nAnd you share some of that research Dr ... and more importantly what the conclusion of the research related to vitamin D\nWell one of the biggest studies ever on vitamin D for from the U.S navy okay so I think it was like a hundred and forty five thousand men and women were studied and they found that the number one and a non combat\nReason that people died in the navy was due to the melanoma so skin cancer so I'm reading this study you know I I kind of pot is right there and I went yeah makes sense you know people are out on the deck shifts\nIn the equator and all over the world and they're getting the harmful you know you're young raise and and they're developing skin cancer\nBut that I read on and it said most of the victims were office workers like clerks and people in hangers an inside and I went home it was a link going back to vitamin D deficiency in the body\nWhat about muscle and bone stream ... three formula help with that\nYeah it's like if you're someone that's over fifty especially here seeing a progression of the core muscles in your body is starting to slow down\nFor this kind of a call on the thing is that people kind of feel like they're getting the physically and then at the lack of flexibility you start to step up and you feel at night especially if you're in bed\nRoiling from side to side you wake up with your knees hurt in your legs are restless your shoulders hurt that said this Saturday and then that's associated with a lack of the vitamin D three my formula so here's someone let's say right now and you're having a lot of joint pain ball muscle pain\nFibromyalgia I Would say start on my formula like immediately and start taking one or two of my ... three's a day for the first week or two to get your doses up quickly\nSo let me ask you about these gummy vitamins does that work can you put enough vitamin D into a little gummy bear in is that the best way to get it in your body\nOf course that ... you know they'll go to any type of lengths to try to market thing that theme good but you're taking a lot of sugar and gelatin wax and my thing is it's not what you take it for what your body absorb\nWhen I Want to talk more about what happens when people start taking your fast smell the three formula\nBoy that's a really good question because the first area that vitamin D seems to affect as your energy\nYour sleep your outlook your mood and then after being on it for a while here core strengths will come back so for those who have slowed down you're going to feel more energy like physically and so it's kind of like a little bit younger Chris", "show_name": "Nashville's Morning News", "year": "2018", "city": "Yankton", "day":
