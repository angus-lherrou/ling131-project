causing all kinds of health concerns but the issue is even\nIf you're trying to get vitamin D back in your body you're most likely taking the wrong type or the wrong form of vitamin D the wrong way and maybe not even getting enough of it\nAnd Dr biggest why don't we start here by talking about why is this deficiency such an epidemic despite all the awareness and the products that you see on the store shelves containing vitamin D\nBoy that's a good point Seventy percent of us in this country are the fishing and vitamin D the fact is is that your body needs vitamin D this is a hormone that

comes down to here as we're not getting the right form\nOr enough vitamin D delivered the right way which is why we have so many of these health concerns that you probably can't put your finger on and Dr biggest I Want to start just re camping here that there are a couple of different forms of vitamin D and maybe explain\nWhy the typical form that you would find in most off the shelf the formula is different from what you put together here\nWhile there's vitamin D to vitamin D three and the two is the title of vitamin D that has to be activated by your body so three converted into vitamin D three vitamin D three is\nThe activated form so it's ready to go to work now the vitamin D three that I use my formula I think it's the best because I've seen the best results with myself and my family with my patients\nPlus I've worked with a lab where the people in the lab of taking this and they they test their blood every day to see how the deal is going to end up going up and out through the roof where should be\nWhile so Dr biggest I mean who should consider taking your fast melts vitamin D formula\nWhile I Would definitely start with kids developments and the humidity obviously young adults in their twenties need vitamin D to keep their immune system strong men and women in their thirties you're talking about higher health immunity\nCardiovascular problems start to turn on but it's also the child rearing years and vitamin D for pregnant women is very very important people in their forties so I you know you start taking more of those aches and pains like you've never felt before you think you're getting older and again it's important for your\nHormones and to keep yourself physically active and when you're in your fifties you start telling her you can't golfing can't play tennis you know you start becoming aware of your body not functioning ...\nAnd then people over ... the I just wish that every senior citizen would go on a formula\nImagine living in your senior years where you have confidence in your balance and you're you're able to have the energy to get things done Anna is clarity you know this is more and more important as we go along because

us I've got Dr Michael Pincus on the phone today and we're talking about something that we're all too familiar with these days and that stress\nAnd we're finding out about the damage that every day stress can do to our bodies the warning signs that we should be aware of and what we can do to alleviate and even eliminate the effects of stress and Dr ... you were talking earlier about calcium and magnesium and\nHow we need these nutrients in our bodies to fight the effects of stress in your ... formula can help us in this battle against stress\nI'd like to talk for a minute about how the magnesium\nFactors in I mean uh I'm starting to understand about the calcium but what does magnesium\nOr we're talking about stress and we're talking about stress affects the body and first of all in order to function at all your body needs magnesium is probably of all the vitamins I could list magnesium is probably the most important vitamin on the planet right now\nI've not heard a whole lot about magnesium and why is magnesium so important\nThere's over three hundred and twenty five bio chemical reactions that magnesium is involved with it it's almost like a hormone wow and a very simple if there was a low level of magnesium\nYour heart won't be very important factor in life you would say so\nIn fact let me just read a list of some of the conditions are associated with magnesium deficiencies okay um you have attention deficit disorder Alzheimer's or anxiety asthma autism\nChronic fatigue syndrome congestive heart disease caused the patient diabetes fiber at my job my blood pressure insomnia migraine headaches multiple sclerosis muscle cramps Parkinson's Bastille Perot's is getting a list just goes on and on and on\nDonnie a migraine headaches multiple sclerosis muscle cramps Parkinson's Bastille pearls is getting a list just goes on and on and on\nAnd this is this is associated with a a lack of magnesium and the money\nSimply a lack of magnesium bully too so I think that really mess around with no what happens is that we need the magnesium and your body in order for the calcium to be absorbed\nSo it's it's a necessary thing in order to get the first component which has calcium\nThat's right they work in combination with each other about there's many more practical applications of this ... formula mhm first of all like I said you drink it so it gets into your system and one of the first things we use it for in our clinic is for people who are under a lot of stress\nAnd they can't sleep well at night it works better than anything I've ever seen for people that have trouble sleeping rarely because it relaxes you do actually fill the relaxation after you drink the deaf you drink a cup of the comics formula\nInteresting\nNow the other thing that is really really good for our people who are in pain\nOkay and I have a whole bunch of stories to tell you and and that case studies of people actually take into account max formula and getting rid of pain and this is included arthritic Taipei\nFibromyalgia which is a form of arthritis back pain muscle spasms migraine headaches there's a whole category of of areas I'd like to discuss with you\nWhile that's fantastic some of those things that you name seemed to be age related or or things that we experience as we grow older [noise] is there a link there\nYeah there's a vicious circle that I'd like to discuss what happened is that when a person has\nA magnesium deficiency spending the gleaming museum they don't absorb their food as well\nSo they go into what we call mal absorption syndrome which millions and millions of Americans have and it's not like you feel sick or you know this that use it might be over time just starting to feel more tired and tired and tired mhm and that's just a real graduate overtime type of thing and a lot of people justify that they're getting old and they just need more\nGrass or whatever right that that's what I Would think that what happens is that when when you get less absorption you actually increase the efficiency in your system of museums\nAnd that and that started to take the calcium out of the bones to start getting on life you start getting 'em all muscle loss because it also reduces the muscle mass and pretty soon before you know you are feeling old yeah in your body that actually starting to manifest at\nWell all due to a simple lack of these nutrients\nAnd let me tell you and it is simple\nThe problem in being a doctor researchers how do you get this end of the system the formula we have the ... formula is fantastic because he had a powder form\nYou take hot water and you make if you put it in a cop take a taste of this powder and mix it in any drink is cut down the ... is really a incredible because it actually goes right into your blood stream\n... this was probably a good time folks if you want to get a free book about calcium and magnesium and try Dr ... formula there is a special toll free number to call\nIt's one eight hundred eight two three eight to one nine ... is a unique blend up calcium and magnesium that gets absorbed into your bloodstream so you can replace those vital nutrients that your body burns up when you experienced stress\nThey don't want to let you know the doctor Pincus has arranged a very special introductory offer it's only available to your listeners so when you call the shirt and mentioned this program and you'll get a risk free trial of ... again this was only available to your listeners and only if you call this toll free number\nIt's one eight

today and he's telling us about stress and how important it is to ensure that you've got the proper nutrients in your system specifically calcium and magnesium\nAnd how much of an impact that has on our overall health so I guess one of the things that people should really be aware of is because this isn't an instant thing that triggers you to say oh I'm sick but you know instead happens gradually over time\nIt's very possible that people might not even be aware that there is a deficiency of calcium and magnesium and thereby\nWell that's the thing is that a deficiency is or not like I'm a water main break in or you have a real noticeable thing the right to their little trips a little leaks here and there and so what we have is a cumulative effect\nWhere a person starts to go downhill a little bit at a time the up to the point where they don't realize how bad they've actually gotten before it's too late\nDr bank is you'd mentioned insomnia we talked about that a little bit what about back pain\nCal than many of them is excellent for back pain because the calcium goes into the muscles museum actually helps the translators and the nerve\nAnd when you take this comics formula many times they will calm your back pain wow I Know I I have a couple of years ago I heard he ate at a desk in my back ... and I was trying to everything and I took out the comics formula\nAnd I drank it and I couldn't believe that difference within about a half hour functional again\nNot wasn't completely gone but I I drink it over a ten day period it completely leaving the problem\nNow what about heart disease\nHeart disease is something you have to watch out for both dietary and going down the genetic line yeah and if anyone had any history of ...\nAnd heart disease is something you have to watch out for both dietary early and going down the genetic line yeah and if anyone had any history of heart disease or even even had bypass surgery you should be on this count acts formula and I can't say that without enough emphasis because it's something that will completely give you a new lease on life\nIsn't that amazing um we talked about arthritis what about joint pain\nWell they arthritic joints really respond to this and I recently gave a candidate to lady who was suffering from fibromyalgia where she was having pain in just about every join her body being hernia could be in her neck it could be in her elbow\nAnd um and I gave it to her one week and I saw or the next week and I swear Chris I did not recognize her really just that the lady that was sixty four years old and
