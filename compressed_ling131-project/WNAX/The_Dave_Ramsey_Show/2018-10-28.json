first with the federal government was very eager to step in and say this was a hate crime\nAnd justice the Pennsylvania authorities have said and there seems to be very little doubt that for three reasons basically one is that social media postings months and months of a ... a vial anti Semitic comments secondly the fact that he singled out a synagogue is speaks for itself and thirdly the police in Pittsburgh say\nAs he was being transported to the hospital as he was being treated for his wounds he said all Jews must must die because they are committing genocide against my

his power bills at one point on the other hand Bowers seems to have absolutely no contact with law enforcement they said he was never on their radar before he was a loner neighbor say he never got out much he seemed to have his life seems to have been led on line and I think one question is\nHow did he ever visited that synagogue before did he know the lay out of it because you know ultimately it ends on the third floor that's worth a shootout with police as he's he's trying to hide from\nThem and ... a is there any indication that he purchased any of his guns illegally or when they purchased legally\nThere's no indication that he bought anything illegally and I think one question about his weapons is this is that many of the witnesses said they thought there was automatic weapons fire well you have to assume that these are people who don't spend a lotta time listening to gunfire for police say it sounded like automatic weapons fire so I think the question is\nDid he modify that semi automatic rifle is possible to do it it's illegal but then he modified in a way that would shoot automatically or was it using a bump stock like was used in the Las Vegas shooting let's move to\nA Caesar say are as of friday he was not talking a\nIs a is there any update on whether he is yet to cooperate with a with official\nNow and their ability to question him now ah is is reduced he's

moment with President Trump\nSeems to be struggling with it\nThis is the modes that he's been in since he was a candidate\nPolitics has never about nuance that says there are some game when you are campaigning it's us or them binary but when you become an elected official especially in the ... states campaigning is supposed to stop for a while and you go into the mode of unifying\nThis is the president has never been interested in unifying he has been interested in keeping his base engaged and enraged and he's done an amazing job of that but at\nAny moment he believes that it still in the middle of the campaign the other thing I Want to bring up just with all of this rent large is you know flip\nThat country's long history of division losing American who's not think they need the time that we're in right now what I feel like as a new one is taking any responsibility for any of that\nI Would not it's not our fault with guns don't kill people killed right it's not our fault who posts on social media don't blame us in social media like hey that plane blame someone else\nIt's not us political leaders ... you know people are doing these things with out they they just have a history of mental instability it's not about what we're saying to them no one at all is raising their hand to say you know\nWe played some role in this and we have to be able to fix it so it's always somebody else's fault and when that's the world we live in is never going to get better or walk or\nI I Know everybody everybody but when you go to the president says what about this what about what what about this and I would say there's only one president that's right there is a day and said that\nThey don't that response within the White House and I spoke to a number of officials is look everyone berets responsibility\nAnd when you put that question to them squarely look he is the president he has the loudest microphones doesn't he bear the largest responsibility they say well he has changed some of his rhetoric has struck unify no but we're number on friday he was asked if he's going to tone down the rhetoric he said no he thinks he can actually turn it up now that was prior to\nYesterday's tragic shooting but I think Amy really hit the nail on the head which is that White House officials say this yes he feels like he needs to have\nA unifying notes at the same time we are ten days out from the mid terms and so he knows what he needs to say to fire up his base and a lot of that rhetoric is divisive that's the bottom line\nTurks and David French wrote this and said you know what they'll call this person crazy referring to seize or say Iraq he's an anger angry obsessive and that there's a difference and that the language did matter and he writes about all listening years sober minded are entirely rational and when they hear a public figure they admire thunder against his political opponents for the same language\nSometimes they they'll take extreme action in response to the French putting some of this burden on the\nPart I I think so um I probably have ... putting the burden on the president is how much do you put on him I think a lot of people want to put a lot of the burden on him where it really does belong on the American people as a whole\nI'm the president is the American comments section of the White House and he is the president who does this we're not going to change this president what can we knew the changes that people if we're not going to change the president I think aims right no one wants to change but the fact of the matter is this was larger than the president society is crumbling around us\nPolitics has amplified it the president was able to find it but there's something going on in society as a whole ah that is translating into politics and the president's up the cause he's a symptom is the president Joshua\nHe is only one true that the president bears part of the responsibility a significant part of the authority for the tone of the country but I Will say I do have a fair amount of hope coming out of this and I know it seems very bleak but I find a lot of hope in the younger people\nThat montage he played in the first one of the
