I was walking with my uh keys between my fingers\nStarted me now is Republican Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee Senator Alexander welcome back to meet the press ... let me start by playing something Dr Ford senator testimony\nHer basic initial fear about coming forward and get you to react to it here it is\nThat is calculating daily that that risk benefit for me of coming forward and wondering whether I Would just be something in front of a train that was headed to where it was headed anyway\nThat feeling that she was essentially now being mowed down by ... ...\nWell I you know I Can't put myself in her shoes but I can imagine\nAnd he believes they were a victim of sexual assault first has to have to live within seconds the difficulty of coming before a public audience particularly one that large must be terrifying and she said I Believe that [noise]\nI thought she was credible\nBut I had what does that mean to you what that meant was if if you're listening to her\nWas all I had to do um I would've said she's she seems to believe what she believes but that's not all I had to do for example this week I went down in the secure place where we could read\nThe FBI reports I read six FBI reports between Nineteen Ninety three and twenty Eighteen hundred and fifty people interview about judge Kavanaugh\nIn every case the interviewee was asked do you know of any instance of alcohol abuse and the answer in every case was no\nThere was no evidence by any of these people of behavior that had anything to do with sexual impropriety so\nYou have to consider that mhm\nAnd you also have to consider the\nThat the only person who remembers the alleged incident the doctor for describes his doctor for the other four said under penalty of perjury that is either didn't happen or they didn't remember it\nIn a very difficult case you have to consider that as well as her testimony when you think ended up happening\nWhy is it then you think should remember this when you think she's just [noise]\nI I don't know the she said a hundred percent\nThat she was a hundred percent whether it was ...\nBut I'm sure that every sexual assault cases usually she said she said\nExcept in this case it she said she said they said they were the witnesses that she said were there all said it either didn't happen or they didn't remember it one of whom is one of her best friends\nWant to play something one of your colleagues Senator Murkowski who she ended up voting now here's what she said\nCape May be\nWe need to be thinking\nLA and the integrity of our hands\nAnd this is the I think the larger concern I think a lot of us are wondering about now and she also had her for speech talked about\nUm the issue of public confidence and the concern that she had that justice Kavanaugh does not have public confidence\nThere are a lot of people that here that go oh\nWait a minute right so I'm guilty until they say that right\nLet me speak to that Chuck if I can ... this is a confirmation hearing no one is entitled to his seat on the Supreme Court\nIt's not a criminal trial it's more like a job or hearing it's more like a job interview the president has a whole series of credentialed unqualified conservative judges I'm ... from among whom he could choose to put someone forward to the to the Senate or the United states\nFor confirmation so if there are credible allegations against this particular nominee and if this particular nominee in his confirmation process conducts himself\nIn ways that they are real questions about candor partisanship fitness then I think it's appropriate for the committee or the Senate to say perhaps\nA different nominees the right one if you're considering someone to be said president of the university CEO of a company I'm the host of a Sunday show and there are credible allegations against them\nIt would make sense to step back and try and investigate them to see if you can resolve them that's why I was thankful that my friend Senator Flake took a tough step last friday and asked for an FBI investigation\nLet me get you to respond to something Senator Kennedy said to me earlier this week about when he believed things changed in this whole cabinet debate take a listen\nI think this process changed dramatically [noise]\nUh when Mr ... entering the picture\nI think a lot of people including many of my democratic colleagues felt like ... at that point\nWe had gotten into the foothills for ... [noise]\nHe was referring to a lawyer Michael ... who is a\nThinking about running for president who ended up representing somebody who's allegations\nBeen seen as credible as the other two allegations new agree with the political assessment there that that the ... entrance into this side show sort of a diluted everything\nI certainly like a Senator Kennedy said turns of phrase the foothills of the preposterous it's going to end up being a memorable phrase\nUm he's correct that there was a widespread a response or certainly on the Republican side that these were not credible allegations\nUm I tried to focus my questioning of judge Kavanaugh on issues that were directly related uh first to his judicial philosophy his extreme views on presidential power and individual liberty and ways in which I'm convinced till overturned Justice Kennedy's most important in recent decisions\nAre and then to focus on issues that fitness and candor um so I Do think what was important about the last few weeks was trying to find a bipartisan focus on facts and the larger question Chuck Harris yeah how do we move forward how do we heal the divisions in the Senate\nSo I take it if you're talking that way or the house Democrats are talking about ... they get control of the house possibly looking at impeachment\nUh what do you make of those pledges coming from some House Democrats\nI I think that's premature I think you know frankly we are just less than a month away from an election of folks who feel very strongly a one way or the other uh about the issues in front of us should get out and vote and participate\nUm there's only ever been one justice that's been impeached and I think talking about it at this point I'm isn't necessarily killing us and moving forward okay check the Senate's role in our in our politics is not to just reflect the country but to help heal and leave the country and that's the course we should\nBe on All right senator Coontz

quote from Christine Blasey Ford where she talked about our fear of coming out and simply stepping in front of a train that was already headed to its destination um\nWhat are the repercussions of that [noise]\nI mean the repercussions on will be will remain thing but I think her bank out was something that we needed to have happened in the movement it's been largely focused on Hollywood and on individual bad actors\nAnd I think her coming forward railing things quite survivors to have a different role in this movement than we've seen over the last year a\nLot of the journalist Sally Quinn wrote in her memoir last year about an attempted rape\nBy a now deceased Senator John tower when she was a college student in the sixties when John Tower was nominated to be that defense secretary and in Nineteen eighty nine she was asked about it and she declined to talk about it with the FBI or a reporter for New Yorker Susan Glasser asked her about it and let me play\nA let me show you what I'm Susan Glasser wrote she said I called Sally Quinn the night before Christine Blasey Ford's testimony to ask what she thought about our own experience all these years later and she goes I could have been Anita Hill she pointed out but I didn't want to I didn't want to ruin my life [noise]\nNothing has changed since Anita Hill not a damn thing she right [noise]\nI think a lot has changed but I also think a lot has been changed and yesterday we we may have lost a political battle but I Do think we are winning a cultural battle and often I don't fight for that when I'm fighting so that generations\nI don't have to deal with the abuses of power that that we've had to deal with kind of an editor respect I think she is right but then I Do think that there's a lot going on and I think this this this cultural shift that we're feeling\nThis collective pain that we're feeling from survivors coming forward and it's going to be able to be translated into a collective power I can say that we're not going to be silenced any longer\nTrying to work you know Susan Collins said that she was really angry at the leaker about this story that it put it forced Dr Ford into the public square and maybe she wasn't ready or maybe it wasn't handled right um do you think the United States Senate and in particular Senator Feinstein\nDid didn't handle this correctly from the outset in and made Dr Ford more vulnerable than necessary\nI wouldn't say she didn't handle it right to follow the leadership on the survivor people shouldn't have to be forced out of and how their story and so she asked for privacy I understand why\nSenator Feinstein decided to respect that privacy is really indicative of how we don't understand in this country the life cycle of survivor and what it takes to actually mount up the courage to come forward particular situation like this I think it was handled fine\nI think I Wish that it was revealed an ad that wasn't me it was handled that a\nModel and it gets you to respond to what Emily Yoffe wrote in the Atlantic this week the problem with belief survivors she writes this even as we must treat accusers upstairs with seriousness and dignity we must hear out the accused fairly and respectfully and recognize the potential lifetime\nBring it believing the woman is the beginning and the end of a search for truth\nThan we have left the realm of justice for religion\nThat's not what the news 'cause I was\nOkay what do you what would what what what is that mean that Ron yeah\nWhen we say believe survivor it's not believe them without investigating send believed and without interrogation we have set a precedent in a country of not believing up thinking that women in particular are lying when it comes to part with the allegation when people come forward an allegation\nSold it to the macho believe survivor it's about can we start with the premise that people do not often lie about the pain and the ... of sexual violence\nIf we start with that premise that me believe that is to that and you can have an investigation you can have an interrogation at the facts and that kind of thing is is not that they believe people blanket and don't investigate and don't do any um anything\nElse but that would lead them\nGo headache I I I also think that right now we are defining what due process looks like and this type of situation because we've never really defined it before because women haven't come forward and we do need to have due process what does it mean to have a fair investigation and these processes\nThat we can move forward to that we can change the cultural and societal systemic instead to shine station institutionalization of sexual abuse an assault\nWell let me get you a look let me get you to react to something Brad Stevens wrote in the times\nHe said this I'd rather be accused of murder or friends said then of sexual assault and then he writes I feel the same way one can think of excuses for killing a man known for assaulting a woman but if that's true so is this falsely accusing a person of sexual assault\nIs nearly as despicable as sexual assault itself because it inflicts psychic the nearly all reputational unprofessional harms that can last a lifetime unless I'll let you answer that first respond first\nThese these numbers are so low as far as false\nAccusations and winning coming forward there from two to eight percent and that's not taking into account that Seventy to eighty percent of sexual assault and actually not report it at all so what we're looking at is very very small numbers also there's not there's no grey area with murder right you don't like maybe ... you know\nCommitting murder or maybe not you know there is very distinct lines that are drawn so what we're trying to do and defined what those lines are so that you know we can move forward or in a way that is not hurtful and not\n[noise] I'm more in support of people that abuse their power then those that are being abused\nAll right I'm going to leave it there for now but a ... a lot of thank you both for coming on and uh once in a while I don't know you had to get up extra\nEarly on the west coast so I appreciate that cat\nThanks very much and we ask why Democrats\nHave to win a lot more than fifty percent of the vote in November\nPay to download time Democrats support object opposite November and if they do they're gonna have to overcome the advantage that Republicans have created for themselves through\nThe process of gerrymandering which of course is drawing congressional district lines to create a partisan advantage because a couple of ways to do it districts can be created by packing the opposing parties voters in a smaller number of districts or by fracturing\nThem into many districts to weaken their collective power in any one district side of this play itself out\nTake the twenty sixth in congressional elections the votes cast by major party candidates Republicans have less than a one point at age fifty points for to forty nine point by that is pretty close must have been divided house right but an election night Republicans walked away with two hundred and forty one seats\nTo the Democrats butter Ninety foresee Saturday forty seven seed advantage despite a only a one point or actually technically less than one point edge in the house popular vote\nNow here's how that dynamic unfolded in the state of Pennsylvania and twenty six to eight\nRepublicans had fifty four percent of the overall congressional popular vote and ended up with Thirteen of Eighteen the the winner of the popular vote still capture the majority of seats in Pennsylvania but neuter gerrymandered\nTo twenty twelve in Pennsylvania\nDemocrats actually held an edge in the popular house vote statewide\nOne forty nine over Republican and yet because of gerrymandering Republicans were still able to capture the same number of states Thirteen to be exact in this day\nBut earlier this year this map was blown out by the state Supreme Court\nWith a new nap in place for the survivors election the cook Political Report rape seventeenth currently held by Republicans in Pennsylvania competitive rooting for the the rate as actually leaning towards the Democrats right now ... the Pennsylvania delegation becomes more evenly split and something that's

twenty tennis tsunami election they held the reins of many state capitals around the country and they got to draw most of the law that is why we should keep an eye on the elections for state houses in
