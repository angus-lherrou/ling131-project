[noise]\nUh well did you record emerges spring and what can you do to make next year's crop perform even better how dare and have to have to bring corn\nSo much go to the core or something and this is something I've heard from several doctors man this is very frustrating to them with the with the ads for these pharmaceuticals on TV because they all have patients come in and they're already pre sold die\nI Want you to write me a script for blah blah blah because I saw it it's going to do all these miraculous things suddenly I'm going to look like those people on the TV and the dish into curing white males me\nAnd so the perspective I've gotten from position is that we're the problem more than anything else and they were allowing ourselves to be too influenced by these ads running on TV\nYou know I've heard the same but it's also it's important to remember that at this point in the U.S health care system it's all about turnover or Catholic Haitian in healthcare terms which means they got to get you into the office and out of the office as fast as possible so if a patient is digging in his or her heels and said\nI Want drug X Y Z and I'm not gonna take no for an answer a lot of doctors will simply write the script just to get things moving along and that's\nKind of why the drug industry now puts more money into marketing does into research because they know what's affective get everybody\nDemanding a prescription med or a brand name at what they need to get it's just a significant number to make it defensible and justifiable and keep you in the brand name fold and that's where part of the problem is\nThat let's also underline this point Clark and that is there are only two nations in the entire world that allows so called direct to consumer advertising prescription drugs in that stops\nAnd New Zealand and that's it every other country especially developed countries like us that looked at that practice and said no we see that is doing more harm than good because let's face it these decisions are meant to be made by trained a license to health care professionals and not\nAmateurs like you and me and everybody listening and therefore it doesn't serve the public interest to do that in fact the American Medical Association has called for an end of his practice because they've seen is just to inflating drug prices steering people into expensive treatment regimens there would be much cheaper alternatives for\nSo is it best what you and I can do is we can't change that a momentum we're not that powerful sorry\nI Can't change that momentum so we've got to grow back to basics and that is at the core most of us are going to do just fine with the generic mad that already exists for a condition that ails us\nI think that's absolutely true I think also\nPeople need to be more open minded to the idea that their doctor when they come back at you with the idea that well there is a generic or there was an alternative drug you might want to explore the cheaper or covered by your insurance you certainly want to listen to because this is somebody who's read all of the academic papers\nAnd on all of the research that you haven't done so yeah you want to listen to that person and I would also encourage people to write to their elected representatives because indeed if we do want to try\nTo bring the drug industry focused once again on curing ailments as opposed to moving product getting rid of\nThese direct to consumer ads would be a big step in the right direction because that's\nBillions of dollars that would therefore be redirected back into useful endeavors such as basic research\nCap in the right direction because that's billions of dollars that would therefore be redirected back into useful endeavors such as basic research and wouldn't require me to explain to my son ... is what all watching sports together on TV\n[laughter]\nBest thing you said was that [laughter] was gosh I Can't get\nPast few having to explain that to your side anyway the best thing you said is that there are now spending more money on this marketing than they're spending on are indeed to actually make drugs that will improve people's lives and that is a real miss direction a national wealth\nTo have all that money go into the ads and so don't let them change your mind don't let those ads influence what you are going to consult with your doctor about\nInjecting even pay attention to those ads because let's face it they're importing fishing amount of information for you to make an informed decision and therefore they're not worth your time\nFor David Lazarus from the Los Angeles times thank you so much for joining us and you keep that passion and by the way how did you explain to your son when he Diaz says family radio\nI Would say the things that lasts for four hours probably aren't good under any circumstances [laughter]\n[laughter]\nOkay\nCorey easily this on the car coward show oh Corey how you doing\nA clerk I'm good how are you a great thank you [laughter] Corey you've got something that happened in your wife is not a laughing matter\nIt's a good matter I mean we we were able to acquire a car but unfortunately or so after my wife says ... dad passed away so\nI'm very sorry about her loss hello thank you [noise] how can I be of service and the situation\nBut cause us to take a look at our a auto insurance because we ah we added another car we had really looked at it in a while to realize we might be paying too much for auto insurance and we started looking at our policy and what kind of trying to figure out where we can save money put store everything set out as far as our coverage so\nWe're going to be adding a\nSix sixteen and Seventeen year old son onto the policy within the next six months oh oh\nOh oh I just add your wallet just take that and I even stab your wallet a lot 'cause that's what happens when you get a team driver on your insurance\nYes we're lucky enough so that we didn't have to buy a car\nTrue so or saving money there any of the cars you\nHave old enough that you can avoid taking a coalition and comprehensive on that vehicle\nYeah so that's a you know trying to sell that to my wife but that was a form of the first thoughts had along with um raising our deductibles\nYeah I'm a ... man and raising the doctor balls okay and try to raise those two thousand that's usually if you're going to have any vehicle you have has alone that may be the max here allowed to raise it to\nOkay but if that helps and you were\nFive hundred miles so\nThe I sort of raise it to the thousand because you don't want to make a five hundred a claim on something between five hundred thousand dollars anyway now because the insurer will just eat you up\nIn premiums so you want to avoid that and then\nHow old are your vehicles\nOur oldest vehicle is a ... for\nYou only want to have liability on that one\nYeah that's okay I thought so sticking to the other two are newer we have a two thousand Fifteen in the car we just got his uh two thousand at fourteen [noise] so\nYou're a teenager needs to be driving the four if your wife will permit that\nYes I don't know how much longer we're going to have the four but yes that's going to be the one that is going to spend the most violent for sure\nSo as you in this case there may be an advantage and talking with an independent agent okay so you know something people really don't do any more but there are ... agents that are like free agents and they quote various insurance companies\nAnd they'd been there done that for a long time most of them are older 'cause a lot of young people I have no interest in becoming\nAn insurance agent and they're very experience and can tell you based on how rates are set in your state and situations they've done with the new drivers with teenagers what's going to be the thing that will get you the best overall total premium\nOkay great sometimes depending on the state and how rapes tend to be set in the state it may be a\nAdvantageous to have your son is the owner of that vehicle or and be on a separate policy and then and other places it may be better for him to only be named in additional driver with no specific vehicle assigned to have\nPerfect that's where the independent agent becomes so valuable because they know\nHow best to quote it and they can quote from many different companies there are some what are known as direct writer companies\nAre ones that you probably see pretty heavily advertised on TV they will not commission and independent agent and so the agent will not be able to quote those but don't have enough\nDifferent companies they can quote to you\nThat they'll be able to guide you best\nPerfect perfect yeah we've got some numbers already from friends that have gone down that path and it seems like it'd be very helpful to help somebody specific to us to help us send\nYou gotta make sure they're not what it's called the captive agent for\nExample State Farm and all state the agents that right for them or what are known as captives they only write for those companies and independent agent is not assigned to a specific company and they can quote many different ones\nGreat so independent agent okay\nYou're listening to the Clark Howard show [noise]", "show_name": "Mike Slater Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Yankton", "day": "28"}
