Iraq Wagner [noise]\nThe John ... professor Richard Epstein teaches law at NYU and the university\n... we are talking about living creature that doesn't have a happy habitat in Mississippi where it's named and what has been profiting for many hundreds of thousands of years but right now the fish and Wildlife Service have fads found Fifteen hundred and forty four privately held ... acres in Louisiana\nWhich is kind of next door and they have designated those acres so they're privately held habitat what does that mean what is the power of habitat and Richard I go to the all arguments\nYou preview this by saying Justice Kagan introduced the hypothetical of landowners and the designation of critical habitat and she asked whether a job making a slight improvement that's the quote you get a would be adequate Justice Roberts on the other hand um\nIt I read it mocking lady asked the question can you build a giant greenhouse and plant long leaf pine in Alaska and call that a habitat now both seemed to be making fun of fish and Wildlife Service Sarah have I have I misunderstood the sobriety at the court [noise]\nI mean but they're all trying to do is to figure out how something relates to the key statutory term that is the Supreme Court when it took this case was not interested in for his principles there is a statute which says that the fish and Wildlife Service\nCan designate essential critical habitat up a conservation purposes and the actual disputed in the court was a semantic one is what does it mean to be essential\nAnd what justice Kagan's hypothetical was designed to establish is that you can have an essential habitats which is not currently occupied by any members of the species that is in some sense ... done because the statute actually anticipate sat\nAnd does have procedures for an occupied habitat the chief justice coming at this from the other end says this term\nAre essential makeup of some cases but it's not infinitely elastic and certainly would not say that habitat\nIs going to be essential if you pick some random part of the forest up there in Alaska decide to cover it up with some kind of a dome and then put some pine trees in it and do it you could not designate that land and the answer that Justice Kagan would give is\nWe want to sound the frog of this particular sort of this area so we are closer to the situation of\nNot being an arbitrary selection which is true I don't think you could say this was all betray capricious but what it is is it's highly remote and so the question then becomes is\nHow essential is essential is the question they're debating and he would never have to debate this question if the issue was put to the fish and Wildlife Service if you want to designate this land is habitat\nCondemn at which point you can do whatever you want with it in the ... off\nBut the sweet home case that you referred to was bad but\nBut that can damage at which point you can do whatever you want within ... some of it off\nBut the sweet home case that you referred to was bad but\nSaid essentially when the government does engaging in habitat designation\nIs prevent the animals from being harmed by the destruction of habitats and that is something which they can do as of right under the statute which says you're not allowed to take endangered species and the terms of listed there you're not allowed to\nCapture you're not allowed to produce you're not allowed to hundred not allowed to slaughter one form or another and then the issue is whether or not the word home which is kind of defuse covered habitat destruction as opposed to something that's not going to sit on that list by\nPoisoning an animal and there was a\nBig argument about it and Justice Stevens said look as far as I'm concerned the government may think it's more efficient to designate a habitat than it is to buy it and who am I to tell them given the deficit we give to administrative agencies that there is wrong so habitat\nOr preservation is now essentially a regarded as an anti harm measure rather than as a provision that\nBut I did that mean you know ... that means the government doesn't even have to deal with the controversy of taking any more you can just dancing or something like Central Park a habitat and nothing will ever happened to it you don't have a ...\nAnd the question is do you meet the essential test and if you read essential narrowly then they can't succeed because it's not critical because it's not as central to centrally broadly you can do it the takings problem just eliminates that problem because you know you want to take it didn't take it whether it's essential or not and you figure it out\nDo you have to do you have to compensate if you'd takings as opposed to have had yes yes you do so because the fish and Wildlife Service money if they said take money at\nToday for gains tomorrow what they do when governments typically condemn property for sites they sell part of it off in order to recoup ... right\nYou know because what happened the way the Supreme Court works is once a president is decided I'm In the course of oral arguments you're not allowed to reopen that particular point\nSo the only thing they could do is to look at a dictionary and similar sources most of them when they use the word essential or talking about indispensable viable without which something can't worry going to the core of the essence of things and I would think as a straight linguistic matter a future use of\nProperty which is going to require future payments which are not yet made which may never happen could hardly be regarded as essential but Justice Kagan is trying to say look I get these guys that for instance if I get these guys deference\nThey know more about the environment than we do we know they did this extremely careful study which they didn't do it was exactly the study would want to do if you're going to condemn the land the differences if you can buy and fuzzy euro as you can with designation you'll take it but\nIf you have to pay thirty four million dollars is not a very likely chance that they would put their money up for that so the takings clause is designed to do is to establish a market as against the government\nUh which will reduce its appetite and if I keep stressing when you teach that so you talk about it is the greatest importance of the takings clause is not that it gives compensation when property is taken\nWhich is nice the really important thing is you put a price up there and all of a sudden some hair brain scheme to some dubious games are not worth the price that you have to have so you don't do it there was a famous case called Lucas and which the government designated certain land\nHum as being essential to keep it empty even though it was worth five hundred thousand dollars and Justice Scalia wrote an opinion saying that he would designate this so it can't be used for anything it's\nTaking what the government was then required to do is to buy land pay Mr Lucas five hundred thousand dollars now and it's titled the land which cost at five hundred thousand dollars and what do you think they promptly did\nThey sold it because it wasn't worth five hundred thousand dollars to\nA neighbor offered them to pay three hundred and fifty thousand dollars is that where am I going to get the rest of the money for this so essentially what they did is they put it up to auction and that's what it is if you actually have to take possession of the\nProperty you don't want that what you do as you say it might be better off selling off this thing and taking the money and using it for real habitat preservation or doing preservation or do I want to keep the Susannah\nRichard you introduce the possibility of wiggle room here when the court decides this it turns on the word essential how can they fish and Wildlife Service make a rational argument that inventing something in Louisiana that might in fifty years satisfy the ducks could go for Prague is the central habitat how do they make that\nArgument they make is there money multiple reasons to return and essential as far as they're concerned means appropriate for conducive\nTo an administrator has the first right to interpret the statute so this gets back to the famous chef ... and if you regard the term is ambiguous you've given to the agency I Do not regard this term is ambiguous\nBut what essentially happens is the liberal wing of the court is much more willing to regard terms is ambiguous and the conservative turned\nJustice Kavanaugh was not present on the bench when this case was argued so it's quite possible to go for for which point that would be argued and I think one of the things that's likely to happen as you get a consistent intellectually conservative majority\nIs that they're going to be less willing to sort of find the ambiguities which allow administrators the discretion I think this is a pretty good case I have never seen the word essentially used in the way in which it was used by the court below which says that doesn't matter when it doesn't matter how\nIt doesn't matter how much it costs it's essential that the government thinks that it's essential as the statutory constrained is read out and I don't think that this particular\nCourt will tolerate this how it is that the fall liberal judges will go I don't know nobody quite knows the basic opinion after the ...\nThe oral argument to places that it can go any which way\nThey do indeed be really good golfer frog can jump any which way Richard abstain we will return to that's why he kept the decision in the spring Richard Epstein although Hoover Institution of the ... go for a frog formerly of Mississippi I'm John bachelor this is the John bachelor show [noise]\nGot to wait to see what happens\nOpportunity or the storm has weakened any indication of opportunity\nDogs pretty much gone at this point but there's no word repetition veiled listening on a regular basis we're still not into the dust storms seasonal November and that theory is that uh the even though they they they can communicate with the rover the rover has\nProbably got it's solar panels cup of dust from the storm\nAnd therefore can't get enough power and run need is a dust devils to clean it off and the dust devils season doesn't start until November and so we were really waiting that's the way they're going to keep listening but then they're not expecting anything to significantly change until at least know\nThem they're a timeline that runs out an opportunity we count and you are January\nThat's what they said that they might listen a little longer than that but they basically they they think\nThat if they haven't heard anything by January it means that that they they never it was never able to get enough power to come back to life and so I wouldn't completely dismiss the possibility because at any time if\nIt does ... finally arrives and clears off the rover might send a signal back but at the moment that's going to be that's the deadline they're looking at they will stop looking very hard after\nJanuary ... said to no problems with the main space crap but they're looking for a landing site what's the status Bob\nWhat is the deal is this they've done a full survey or are you grew and it's a very it's above the surface they had hoped to see a flap spot about Fifteen meters ... hundred and fifty feet across and they and they've only found one place that's about twenty meat is sixty feet across\nAnd the problem is that the ... the space craft doesn't really have the capability\nPrecision capability they planned to have the capability of hitting such a small spot it's the only place they can land and so they had decided to do the lay the landing till January ... they did in October and they've done at least one rehearsal they have not yet on the second ... Herschel but they're they're going to do or tour in October they've done one\nAnd then the sun moves between us and higher boost her in November and December\nWe moved to a success for a cue that what is the cube that Bob and what's the success\nWill keep sets are tiny a standardized a square satellites you can hold one in the palm of your hand I think that like a\nFour centimeters across to centimeters I mean this is matrix metric so I'm not that good with it but you can hold them in the palm of your hand they designed initially for students to teach students how to make a satellites but they did they have the technology has gotten sophisticated enough that you see Cuba's has launched for all kinds of real purpose is not just\nThe teaching and so when they launched the insight Mars lander earlier this year to go to Mars um they also launched waited to secondary cube SATs called Marco\nThere's two of them ... to and these cube SATs basically do a flyby of Mars and they're going to be used kind of as a communication ... satellite wall and such insight is going down to land but they're also a technology experiment to see if cube SATs can be used the interplanetary missions and here's the success\nOne of the ... cube SATs this week excessively took the first interplanetary picture by huge sad and I got a picture of laws now it's not as spectacular image Mars just looks like a little red dot but with key about this is they were able to point this\nCube set accurately they've been able to have it has solar panels to maintain power and in interplanetary space that's unusual\nAnd so this is telling us that we're gonna sock shifting I think in interplanetary travel from\nA big expensive and rarely launched space craft liking set insight and like curiosity to small very inexpensive cube SATs\nThat you can launch frequently and in large numbers to do a lot of different things and so this is a this is a groundbreaking or a technological success John\nAnd keep that because they're cheap by that means that interplanetary study can be done by private institutions private individual there were no longer depending upon big space to deliver a good sign\nYes it's very possible and I think we're gonna talk about this later on in the second segment but it's been going to be very possible for private companies to build small cube SATs at a reasonable cost and sell the at fault interplanetary travel and send sell that capability to conch countries scientists you know the whole world\nA research scientist with say a good plot for the discovery of the end of the world now we go to another success\nMisses the launch of a mercury mission we've had very few mercury mission the last one I remember a gave us the possibility of water rights at the polls because it's perpetually blocked by the ... what does this mission\nAll right well this the first mission was mess that first mission was America I think [noise] ten ... flew by mercury and the second one was American a mission messenger that orbited mercury that's the one that's\nFound as you said John possible uh actually dark craters that might have water in them um this mission is a joint Japanese European mission it's called the ... the whole mission is called ...

Khan complain that the idea of a last battalion was incorrect they will no it wasn't a battalion of course they wouldn't have already lost the Americans always knew where they where they just couldn't get to them because of course it was surrounded by Jim troops\nUm but it becomes a sort of symbol of ... those are the sort of\nA legend in a in a battle which seems to be inconclusive and difficulty here is an example of good old fashioned heroism as a limited it or a very small number of American troops hold out against vastly superior opponents\nAnd we know thanks to professor Lloyd that the Germans were not vastly superior at any point at this point they were breaking down there ... there are rumors there's panic there are people who are accused of being war pro longer if they fought stay and fight some Germans run some German stay and fight to the end\nThe ... a middle of the month the exchanges continue Wilson second note by note here to the German government it's on the sixteenth of October flags is\nJust make sure we get it in on the thirteenth of October a runner for the sixteenth reserve battalion of the six but very in division is hit with a mustard gas attack his name is Adolf Hitler as he evacuated at this point I'm\n... I'm seems to be the case um seems to have been evacuated suffering from those symptoms you must have ... a pain in the eyes all that sort of temporary blindness and blisters scar on on our hands and feet I'm kind of course this is um\nThis is what Hitler right to mine camp ... I'm suffering from this horrible pain and they sort of agony of being hit by mustard gas Nicholson than when he's recovering hostility or the head of the news of the the negotiations with the\nRats were telling that story thanks to Nick because\nThe mess that the army was betrayed becomes Hitler's opening arguments to the veterans in the Nineteen twenties ... leading up to the depression and the collapse in the Nineteen thirties that forms the document the or just a legend\nFor the third Reich in these weeks is the the are the seeds of the catastrophe of later in the century but we'll stay now with Wilson second no [noise]\nAh the charge here is that Wilson must make them stop submarine warfare must make them stop stop destroying as they were trained to do the does the German government listen are they ready to listen neck [noise]\nUh not really the the gym and government certainly prints max and his colleagues horrified when they got the second night because they\nUm and then they ah they realized that he and the Americans are serious and they're not going to be able to get what they want to see some action that the realization that the Americans are not going to be able to be placed in that sense so that the Americans are\nAll why he's a a than they had anticipated um and they sent me a ... it's a very sort of shocking ... from them that actually what I'm saying stop to this crisis they just not going to end well for them and they're not going to be able to control it in the way that they would lie because of course they go for Wilson because they think he's going to be assault touch\nLloyd George and a climate so are they worry that Wilson will give them more than they deserve\nOh absolutely this is a real fair or the British and French ... Wilson is is going to give it all the way a Wilson's going to negotiate behind their backs\nOn on a ... Wilson is not going to be as I said to him and don't Jim and surrender or it would seem so um oh they say that it will soon as I mean it's hard on Germany that's certainly the French were like so I mean this is a very um\n[noise] this is you can see the the ... the British and French that they're not going to be up to control than the Americans are doing\nIt is beyond the reach of Nick's book except for the fact that these are the predicates for what goes wrong at the ... peace treaty because Clemens so and lower jaw\nIt's book except for the fact these are the predicates\nFor what goes wrong at the ... peace treaty because Clemens so and Lloyd George will lead the demands for reparations and for revenge\nOn the Germans that will be pumped come part of the legend that Hitler tells all Germany tells the Nineteen twenties the Nineteen thirties when we come back we come to the council of war Seventeen October ... days the campaign that end of World War one Nick Lloyd is the author I'm John ...\nYour chance in a brand new Ford F. one fifty as close as participating in Oakland for dealer stopping put your name in the box\nUm this is actually ... went and met with some of the um the clans and tribes north of it that the Chechen tribes in North to the north of dares or and organized for them to um to to do to do the slaughter of the Armenians\nHe brought in killers and they weren't experience colors and they were using swords and clubs\nAnd and weapons as well but they they they would separate people the twelve year old boys\nThe males above twelve years old the women they would strip them of their clothes and either they were so exhausted they die or they called in and by the river and push them in the river is that what your grandfather rides [noise]\nUm there were there were a different you know there are different massacre sites and so my grandfather would be for his his caravan was slaughtered he would the you know Armenians floating past him on the harbor you know several of them tied together\nAnd um I'm from my grandfather you know the the massacre took place behind a hill which is ... and when I was there\nIn two thousand Seventy thousand nine there was a small memorial I'm asked us\nRight that's up from where you first came up on the ... river there is actually for the ... on the ... we have to tell the escape because we have to get him all the way to America would accept the New York okay\nAnd had his burial in Hollywood yeah go ahead of us that wrote the deer daughter's part of it [noise]\nI he escaped by thinking through how to get through the show them that the Chechen lives and then he walked for five or six days with no food and very little water there's crowds up some survive some don't they walked and walked and walked the captured again he walked and walked and walked\nAnd then he comes to outside of rock\nAnd Arabs shake shake all ... and what does the shake do for your grandfather\nSo this this shake it shake hallowed I'm so glad he was this I'm very powerful ... along the ... the um during the war and my grandfather heard about him and my grandfather\nUm at first my grandfather described himself as you know a a Muslim Arab of the area and changed his clothes and and and went to the shake but the shake wasn't fooled by my grandfather's parents any new\nMy grant whom my grandfather was that he wasn't Armenian and the ... except him and accepted him and\nTook him in and ended up you know treating him like a son and my grandfather stayed with a shack\nAnd what resonates with me is just this this shake ignored the propaganda of the time that these Armenians were dangerous people and I'm couldn't be trusted instead did the opposite and check my grandfather and\nThey just had this and and saved his life and so to me that was one of the most important parts of the story and\nA close circle you return there and two thousand seven and again in two thousand nine and your ... they they make a meal for you you were the honored guest and you sit down and use your hands because you dip into\nI've never done this dog to help me you dip into the pot that has the laminate and you pull it out

then they told me that um the Potter we're eating on was um\nOn them and it was just incredible one of us incredible moments in my life and and then they told me that um the Potter we're eating on was um that that my grandfather would have eaten off that Potter ... class\nThat they had kept it it was one of their prized possessions in the in the village and so it was just incredible you know you're kind of stepping through time and you're able to think these people who are just as beautiful as that I write\nAbout Ninety One years later that's what the ... still there and they connect layer mother\nNow I understand I had a mother just like this they never throw anything away you come from the heart of the world [laughter] you have it all you know I mean you never know when you might need it and besides the plate is good for Ninety One years if you care for it\nYes yeah there was a beautiful big platter and um and and it was\nIt was absolutely it was just such a special moment to be with them and to thank them and I'm One of the\nThe things that I remember the most is that when they had heard that I was coming there it was after we found them they had thought that I Would need like my grandfather and said they were ready to give me refuge and so you think about the people of this area and now they're in need of refuge\nYet they're under the bomb that's important to establish where we're done was that it is now a war zone the Syrian Army is to the west a at Palmyra this is the ... river valley and that's a no co that's ISIS and\nUh the American army the American

to me because he just he just keeps his his will and his faith that he's going to get home one day to see his family\nAt that point in going to get back to his family\nYes yes and that the timeline
