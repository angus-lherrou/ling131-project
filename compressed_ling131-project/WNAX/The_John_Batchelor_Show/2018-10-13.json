a time but here it is the twenty first century and ... the way of talking about not just airplanes and warplanes and how America learns that the skies dominated the ground\nDawn of the age of speed by John Ross hey Rick ... define how automobiles came just to win the hearts of America\nRacing automobiles first and then the family automobile\nJohn a very good evening to you and congratulations for your extremely careful work over a ... a period of time in which everything was inventing itself the automobiles inventing itself the airplane was inventing it they'll air combat was inventing itself and America fell in love with going fast let's begin\nIn Nineteen fourteen in Des Moines at the Iowa State fair August September Nineteen fourteen men by Eddie reckon Packer at this point is twenty four years old\nMatches up against a man named beach and they're going to have an unusual race quotas tips\nWell John thanks for having me on it's such an exciting period and you kept up with that example Lincoln be she was a daredevil flyer who was up by plane and this was of course your airplane so he was out like he was playing a beyond a piano right out in front of repel her was behind him\nAnd Eddie reckon backer who was a famous race car driver just at the moment there\nWas asked to compete in a\nRace around a circuit in front of a huge crowd a just and so that the crowd could see what an airplane could do and bought a car could do and then it was like\nA bear against a lie and I was like a circus these things where it this technology these technologies were so new and so explosive was taking people's breath so way\nThis is August September\nNineteen fourteen\nExactly the time the world's plunged into catastrophe we're still living with which was the comes August that is where we're headed with that you've written bunker but we need we need to recover his racing car period because that's the first time he invented himself in Nineteen fifty\nA beach she dies in another stunt with his aircraft he drowns I Believe after racing in San Francisco but in Nineteen Fifteen Eddie reckon bunkers one of the most famous racing car drives us in America he's racing for\nRun by the Maxwell Sammy battling his old firm run by the ... shows and they're the do some birds as well but he's not working for the ... and he's racing men who are extremely famous in America all the boys in America knew their names Dario rest a and a another man by the name of eight and\nThat this automobile the future he learned as an engineer learn with his hands what does that\nMean [noise] well you know white than the you know he was they were nobody knew that the car everybody had an idea that the car was the future but they didn't know it was going to be electric if it was going to be gasoline um if it was going to be a electric you know a steam so [noise]\nWhat they did is they had to work things out and listen to it less and how they action play they had they were in his attitude as they went along\nWith that reminds me Eddie is an engine which for gas that takes skill into this guy's ... what was the hearing\nHe could tell he learned\nThat if a at an engine running to rich there was too much fuel you could tell that if it was running to lean he could tell that he could tell the sounds when something was wrong and by that he\nHe had a relationship with machines where he would know how to push it harder\nBack off what was wrong with it had to tweak it can't just remembered that that the engine the internal combustion engine was built but then the next generation of people came along\nTo tweak it tend to play with it and ... these things to learn what it was all about him he was a prominent [noise] you know not an inventor as much as a tweak\nHer and he could drive the machine and these days they were committed to race thing because it was a novelty\nHe meets a man named leaf fryer and he's going to be\nBy Lee fire to become what is known as a Mac and mission what does that mean well it's a crazy\nThing in back in the early car racing days in the early early Indianapolis five hundred there was not just a race car driver by next to him sat in that condition and the conditions job was a couple of things one was to pump\nThe oil pop because they didn't have a mechanized oil pop to keep the oil pressure up at speeds but the big thing was to look behind and because they hadn't figure it out there\nThat the driver could look back so the ... would look back and see if a car was coming up and then tap the knee up the driver to tell him to get out of it away or to speed up or whatever was was needed this was in a day of course with no\nNo windshields no hard helmets\nSo the condition who actually often got the worst of it was only just holding onto a little strap on the side of his uh\nHis chair so when they hit if they hit a fence or they hit a pocket of something often the both of them would go airborne were more likely the machinations go airborne because he didn't have the wheel in front of him\nLeave fryer got up to sixty miles per hour and that was considered fast he runs in the first twenty four hour raise this important to mention that they were inventing the whole idea of racing going around the track about this time the Indy five hundred gets put together by a man named Carl Fisher who will become important to us we'll get to him at the moment\nBut money is the motive here any money he's very close to his mother his mother depends on him winning money and there is a thing called the Vanderbilt Cup for ten thousand dollars which even sounds like a lot of money today I have the Nineteen oh six Vanderbilt cut and that becomes a magic\nWhat what did it mean to them and I understand the cash but what else\nYou got to remember too that Eddie grow up in a place so poor and his experience was watching\nMen going to factories day in day out and anonymity that he just didn't want and racing which is extremely dangerous and the Vanderbilt Cup on a road was a road race so wasn't within the confines of everything out of a ...\nYou know the Indy five hundred for instance [noise]\nWould give him an opportunity if he won\nIf he made some money if he got a ranking no one could ever take that away from\nThere's a man named Barney Oldfield\nIt's gone now but it means everything to add to what is what it who is Barney old Barney\nOld field is one of the original bass I Love terror alert and saw that you had a best picture of him is he has a big cigar and in the middle of the race he would be true and he would chew that and it would often go out but actually what he used it for\nWhat it said that his teeth wouldn't because the rocking the shocks were terrible the road surfaces were terrible shake you up so badly would not people's teeth out so he kept a cigar clamped\nBut he had this big burly go at it a hundred miles an hour speed he was the first to go a mile a sixty miles an hour\nAnd a he just had to he just to exude at this new brought ... Barbara\nThis new sense of possibility and macho and extraordinary\nIt was something to shoot for it to be admired by ... unlike yes absolutely no there are other men young men who are coming into this business\nAnd their ... their names are everywhere they're legion in in John's book we're not going to cause for them but it's so rich part of the book and sat alone and had been ... would have been exhausting because they're invading the whole idea and the crowds are inventing the idea of watching races\nThe NASCAR today which is on the shoulders of what they were doing a hundred years ago October first Nineteen ten a written that day down because of Vanderbilt ... took place in New York\nBought it was banned by the governor of New York because it killed what twenty to ... to ... ah watchers which they would only part as the car came through them it was some kind of it was some kind of what daredevils tree or the police and nobody was taking charge of that\nThey had police lined up they had census oh this was out in Long Island on roe try so it's kind of like the Tour de France everybody kind of kept on and they have picnics and everything the crazy thing John is that nobody had seen anything terrestrial go so fast\nAnd they and the noise of it and the smell of oil and gas and the excitement of it this could these crowds would just come right into the road right in front\nOf you know all these cars that just part at the Paris last second they had no understanding of what speed was like and a lot of these guys as you mentioned got hit and thrown then finally I was saying yes to finally the governor said you know we just can't go on I mean this is just awful and these for law by\nBinding citizens it gives you a sense of how exciting it was how knew this was\nA the woman in his life we've got to get to her in the season Nineteen fifty and it was going to be a great one for Karl Fischer and this is going to be the ... Indianapolis five hundred the brick yard sweet\nBricks and Thirteen cents each and water and what a bumpy ride that must have been on the tires they had to practice it in one time that he tried to cheat and got caught but we don't have time to get on to Carl Fisher who will become a force in the future\nAnd Eddie and ... sister because by now he's putting together as a teen\nHowever there is a woman and we've got to get to hurt her name is Adelaide her maiden name is pedal aid fraud so I have here she's of vaudeville singer Eddie only took up with Roman ... why is that important\nWell cliff was the son of the founder of a a General Motors and it was a playboy um and he gravitated as many Playboy's generally uh to racing and that's how eddy met him and how and he met Adelaide but the secret on the\nUh the unspoken secret on the track was that a\nCliff was beating Adelaide and he was not a nice guy and there was an ad he was a nobody and he walked into clips big playboy kind of a stage and where and cliff was cheating on Adelaide on I think they struck up something there that they were not pick up until later\nNineteen Fifteen 'cause there's a war I had a scan ... estimates men in Glen Martin who use an old Methodist Church to build an airplane factory in California where you most known as Martin Marietta what is that he learned from Martin what ... what did you learn about himself\nWell he this is the first time he goes up in a play and a\n... I don't take really get into that had seen airplanes but I never had bought\nThis poor kid from Columbus who could drive cars pretty well but he never thought he was one for the air and he got up\nUh with Martin and went over the and thought he was going to be seen sick and uh you know Nazi era than he was dead and gone Martin said yeah because it's a different thing when you get up and you look over there and you know and he was bitten by a bug and they would never look back\nThe book is enduring courage we're about to go to war\nTasted pilot Eddie ... John Ross is the author I'm John ... or this is the John ... show\n\nMm if your company is lowering\nOver by up to ... percent over the course of the next year I'm much more profitable would you be interested in the more profitable future Lenin attending a two hour seminar on Tuesday October twenty for\nThe Saudis rocket and the last two years I'm Sorry for failures\nBut either way that's a lot and so they're paranoid right now and even little culturally that normally somewhat power line the Russians you know the whole statement just because your parent it does not mean someone isn't out the at you and it could be very well the case here that there is\nThere could be great dissatisfaction within the engineering crews that build these things because they don't get paid much they're paid a pittance compared to engineers the rest of the world and the management is not great\nAnd detectives generally been poor and so Russia's around happy country right now so I wouldn't be surprised if the criminal investigation\nAnd let's go to the U.S side how can we get a base crap ready to do routine back and forth and the IOC says to operate as if it was so you\n[laughter] well right now our schedule is that uh the space X is going to do is unmanned test sometime in January and then five months later it's first manned mission that that's not that's not an operational mission that's still a test mission and Boeing is going to go in April with unmanned and then in August\nManned so that sometime next year and those are still the test flights I'm One of the reasons the January the January unmanned test flight of safe sex was delayed was because there was scheduling conflicts I assess I say they should take advantage of the situation and push\nThe stay sex long shot but then it might not make sense better to get the Russians in shape first um there is problems at the bureaucracy at NASA\nThat's his safety panel which would would get upset if if I had a paper cut 'em is talking about how well they haven't really handle all the factors that need to be handled and we don't see these launches happening as scheduled well I think the safety panel is going to be told to shut up\nAnd not interfere with the need for getting\nThese another twist here Bob I don't trust the cosmos I don't think I I ... a an investigation and report is going to satisfy the doubt that are now a demented about Ross how close is quality control and their ability to be successful\nI think that's what I'll give it a slightly different perspective John which is like NASA I actually trust that they will investigate this early pinned down with the problem was and fix and make sure that problem doesn't exist on later missions\nLike NASA with less program which has had numerous Ga oh an inspector general reports over the last eight years telling us how badly it's managed I Would expect them to fix the more systemic underlying\nProblems that are causing this\nBut the problem is just like in ... not really fixing its management problems they fix each individual ... specific thing and don't fix the overall issue and you can't do it when you've got a government run system you don't have competition to force you to fix the problems and so\nI think all that means is I think they will get this particular problem fixed that they will be able to launch again soon but I think it just it's just more ammunition we've got to stop depending on them because they do not have a good system\nAnd and what we're switching to is private enterprise in competition increases the chance that we won't have similar problems upper commercial launches\nBob in detail here NAFTA has not fail with protons and to use its NASA has not been the target of criminal investigations fraud and and I and improper construction and\nOver to see John I have to interrupt\nSo Iran costs and\nOrion that this ... this is inspector general report this week outlined almost identical kind of incompetent shouting is quality control it\nBob we're dealing with malfeasance when we're dealing with rock cause most fast fraud misrepresentation quality control and a central government the trends parents they're not an allergy by where\nI you know what I don't I don't entirely agree with you for example we feel is\nThe G the inspector general report pointed out how NASA contracting officials were keeping\n... authorizing the contract of bowing to spend more money and do things that contracting authority they are going to be authority to make those authorizations and they went ahead and did it anyway that's downright criminal actually I have to tell you\nThis mob was not criminal lessons brought before the bar of justice I cannot accept a trusting routes cause most that there there's no transparency about there's no reason to go back to them for anything\nUnless you're looking for more trouble because there's no expectation that they can they they can solve what has been creating these failures\nIn that context John we are in a hundred percent agreement this is why I think we should be accelerating our own man programs as fast as possible we should we should really try to get out from our line than I Am in total agreement the U.S I pointed out\nThey might fix this particular problem but as you just said they're not going to be fixing the underlying problem just isn't that that doesn't fix the underlying problems that have felt less government agencies don't do that\nI sat on manned possibly not the worst thing so let's go to is I think that ... that's here Bob rocket science is a good one a rocket science what is it rocket lab\nIs that the American slash New Zealand company they launched a New Zealand that built an electron rocket it's a small rocket designed to small or large small sets and they did was successful launch back in January\nThey were going to do another another operational lost at first operation washing June and I had to cancel it because of a problem with a motor control they said\nThat the lake keep getting an extended until finally about a month and a half called they announced that going to do a a that next launching November and follow up with a launch in December um\nToday's day and now they unveiled their new rocket production facility in New Zealand and what's really interesting about this facility is it's designed to mass produce the rockets they want to be able to turn out a rocket electron rocket\nOnce a week at this facility that's a significant thing because that's a complete change in how rockets built I mean it's basic has tried to make it this way but nobody has ever built rockets would that I my idea in mind mass producing them and get in on ... what this implies is that um\nThey've announced this ... this um the factory because I think what they're thinking they incorporated into corrections that they had to do to the motor controller and they purposely\nDelayed for the last you know they got that exactly right so they could also put it into the facility that's going to mass produce these rockets and so when they get these next two launches off in November and December this tells the I think what that means is they're going to hit the ground running in twenty Nineteen and we'll be aiming for fall frequent\nMore frequent launches maybe as many as one a wink for weeks the entire year it'll be just a matter of how many customers they got to have contracted by the way they can just keep\nPutting them on the planet I'm going to be quite exciting on them and it keeps the website\nBeyond the
