Obama where\nHe and the early days of his career was so associated with anti American radicals anti Israel radicals on them ones for president on on suddenly a centrist platform and it's the same here with him\nHe's made statements against moving the embassy the U.S embassy to Jerusalem isolated very strange statements about the Gaza Strip and claims that Israel was using rocketing from Gaza to justify attacks against the Palestinians\nAre and now we finally he go I'm training and the founder of dream defenders which boycotts Israel and he's claiming on the other hand that he doesn't support the boycott of Israel and that he is pro Israel\nAnd he's giving speeches and synagogues and these ones that are dog wearing a yarmulke I keep awe and talking about how much he loves Israel so a lot of questions about who is the real Andrew Gillum here is he the centrist or is he the founder which I found he is of this organization\nAaron Aaron how did you how did he how did this happen why wasn't he vetted why didn't he sanitized his background it does I Can't explain this I mean I'm reading some of these statements from their mission he worked on this still twenty Seventeen he didn't win the nomination for twenty Eighteen but gee they had some time here\nHe talks about community safety police brutality in prison abolition\nThey're working toward quote ending the cars the real thing first time I've ever seen the word ... means car some of the prison state is a translation and challenging the ... position that our communities are made safer when our fellow human beings are locked in cages\nThis is nonsense Aaron and why didn't they wipe it out do art do they do they not care that sticks with him\nYou know I'm Wondering the exact same thing because the videos are still up there on the audio there including a conference call we're going through right now about ... the promotion of black lives matter the Web archives as there are there so it could very well be that that Gillum used\nA let's say the far left of the progressive movement in order to build his base and won the ... and win the primary\nAnd he's in a very strange position because he's taking money from them and they're all this group that we're describing here is on the ground now in Florida are trying to get out the vote so I don't think he can\nDisavow them or even removed the activism given that he's not just too closely associated with them they formed the backbone of his campaign\nAnd this is nonsense that is just nonsense and there are people in Florida who are Democrats who run

I won't read it but is there a radical faction of\nNative Americans that are working who are working for him I mean what is not as this rhetoric come the progressives that doesn't have any connection to reality\nYou know I don't know that it's for Native Americans I can tell you from being on the ground here in America by the way over this last year a and in New York I was actually in I'm In California the bay area just a few weeks ago and here in Florida\nI I've been with the young college age crowd and there is an element that truly believes in the stuff they died I think that's how you originally was targeting now he's trying to balance that uh with this and the base here on the left in Israel which is in Florida which is more\nTo the center and and I do think that that that's why this race is so defining if he ends up taking Florida with these radical background ... what that says about the Democrat Party is very telling and also I I Know that\nSomebody like Kirsten Gillibrand a mainstream Democrat is going around with some of these same cast of characters and she's also associating herself\nThat somebody like Christian brat a mainstream Democrat is going around with some of these same cast of characters and she's also associating herself with\nThis kind of ideology and so it says a lot of the Democratic party as a whole is now I think that's often this direction pretty much openly while the media is sort of ignoring it so let's\nSee if he takes Florida and it's just part of why I'm here and why I've been paying so careful attention to Florida to this particular race and it's just not just about today this is about the future right the ... party and then also if Trump can carry Florida and twenty twenty\nAaron Klein of Breitbart Jerusalem I'm John bachelor this is the John bachelor show\nThe Russians have hacked our elections are infrastructure our government at the United states has a master hackers to\nThe best one of the CIA cyber age who defies all notions of the deadly violence\nFormer intelligence agent Eric Anderson page turning knew from\nThe table to turn in big power cyberwarfare\n... new novel from done books is by\nThe Y.

Nineteen sixteen and it starts in the oddest places the bureau of mines and the men they manning why why did manning take it up what is his opinion of gas warfare good evening to\nThank you thank you well a van manning is a fascinating character as you say a he was the director of the bureau of mind which is a civilian agency it was a an agency within the department of interior\nAnd its goal it was set up to save lives in a U.S mine specifically coal mines all around the country thousands of miners were dying and terrible accidents all over the country every year\nAnd the bureau of mines was set up as a a life saving agency or to help prevent many of those deaths that were happening\nThat also turned it into the only federal agency that had the scientific prowess and the scientific know how\nTo be able to tackle the problem of gas warfare or which the U.S or was not in any way shape or form prepared for even though it had\nA gun in Nineteen Fifteen and as Nineteen sixteen went on and turned it in Nineteen Seventeen it appeared that US involvement was now inevitable and yet it was very little preparation for chemical warfare\nOr leading up to the U.S entry into the war [noise]\nSo uh in the very early ah weeks of Nineteen Seventeen the head of the department of interior went to all of his uh department heads and said what can you do to help in the war effort tens and manning\nThe Army National guard and gets you started in in a\nWay of them related career fields such as information technology communication system rational forces engineered technical engineering air traffic control and chemical and biological radiological nuclear science to head start on your career and exciting new field wild earning money to pay for college\nAll while serving in your own community\nLaws on the national guard dot com or talk to recruit or injure areas and learn about all of them [laughter] we're opportunities available for use in the Army National\nGuard sponsored by the south Dakota Army National guard near by the south Dakota broadcasters association at this station\nYou are the kind of person who's always ready to get a dog in most I'm forty two jobs done so much you need on the drugs form of mercury needs the foreman superior haunted me to get the performance of our own the Ruben fuel injected fiberglass engine\nWas drunk Jesse offers a launch looks especially for veterans smooth ride and when the work is done the woman is the perfect ATV to get you to your fingers on the spot as occurred cycles and I know the ... to sixty five to Chamberlain for great service advice you got all your DVDs on DVDs sixteen years older than results like six or\nWhether it's small or large John Deere Aggie equipment compact utility crackers or long trackers CNBC operations has what you're looking for in New and used John Deere equipment seeing be operations is also your source for parts am service of any make or model equipment\nLet their expert staff help you keep your equipment running at peak performance during harvest season there your job your experts\nOn line that theory equipment dot com\nThat's deep double E.

E. S. for example in July of Seventeen to twenty thousand casualties wounded in action by the gas attacks by the German system ... this\nIs not just mustard gas has also Fox gene and they're still using ... uh Cory ... beans so while there were ... volunteers into the gas service at no point C O did I get the sense that the volunteers understood their risk and what would happen to them the rest of their lives\n[noise] hit it's not entirely clear to me to be honest with you I think there was a sense of um [noise] a kind of excitement to be on the part of this cutting edge effort the way that it was talked about in the press with often\nUsing terms like fighting fire with fire with very little that really describes the um the the actual reality of what he was like to be on a battlefield\nOr with chemical weapons instead there was a little bit of a a kind of gee whiz uh a new kind of weapon um and and these soldiers were kind of\nPulled in by the attraction of being on the cutting edge kind of weaponry without honestly like a real understanding of what that actually meant I think\n[noise] meanwhile back at American University the first effort is defensive they want to develop a gas mask that is useful they can that they can sell or provide to the British and the French remember for a long period of time\nThe U.S has been making a great deal of money on the first war before it gets involved but it's now in the war and they fail as their first gas mask which tells me that despite all the chemistry that they've gathered together they really do not understand the risks Theo\nI think that's true and it was also something else did they did not understand with it you know that these are first few are men and they were all men who were brought into this effort to create the first gas mask these are scientists their academic\nOr they deal with a theoretical uh problems in class just what they don't deal with something like industrial production\nAnd so what they did is they set out to ah create a kind of theoretical that gas mask without really understanding what it would mean to have to make millions and millions of them in a very very fast paced\nAnd so the the scientists really had these very inflated expectations of how quickly they could do this and how well they could do it\nAnd the very first Mac it was created which was meant to be an American mass\nAs distinct from the French a math and the British math\nUm were as you said they they were failures or they failed and a number of ways on and it was considered it's a great embarrassment for these soldiers who excuse me for the scientists who are at the top of their fields and some of the top research universities institutions around the country\nThey believe that it should be very easy and it turned out to be much much more difficult than they thought and it took them a great deal longer to come up with a a ... the first American mask that could actually put into mass production\nA month September of Seventeen there's a headline in the U.S papers following this story is they have here we go to war us prepared for barbaric the on unquote what the army does is very carefully look for who can manufacture gases and gas masks and\nCEOs reporting is exhaustive the Dow Chemical gets involved of course old Barry electric chemical of not now falls no longer there Americans instead of color company in Stanford Connecticut or they find a proven ground gunpowder neck in the in the Chesapeake uh Chesapeake Bay or\nThey are setting up a chemical production facilities across the east coast and into the mid west of the United states this is the war department spending money\nBut the whole time the oh I got the sense again that they wanted an American stamp on their gases they didn't just want to imitate the British because if they did they would've just gone completely into mustard gas\nI that's true that's\nTrue I'm One of the features of the uh chemical weapons arms race that essentially the Germans were always one step ahead\nUm and so just when the British and the French had a created a gas mask that would a counter or the newest German gases they would unleash a new weapon and so the uh the the allies the British\nAnd the French and then eventually the American uh we're always one step behind the German so the American you're right they wanted to they wanted to find a new weapon and they wanted to find something\nThat they could use a that the Germans and their allies did not have a that would be as much of a surprise for the Germans as the types of weapons that the German had been using on the allies [noise]\nUm so yeah the ... immediately it as part of this enterprise at American University and it all the satellite labs all around the United states it was this effort underway to find new kinds of chemical weapons or that hadn't yet been used\nThey do find one that they eventually called Lou a site for the inventor in Illinois campus ... chemists who invented at a on American University Catholic university in Washington it will go to Cleveland to be produced and we'll follow that story when we come back because they're feeling their way through this we know now it's a horror\nBut they did not just as the Manhattan Project in the second war we know now they were creating the atomic weapons that are uh Har\nHowever the the creation
