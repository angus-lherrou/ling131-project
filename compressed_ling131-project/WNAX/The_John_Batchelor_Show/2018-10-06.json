from the point of view of a cosmologist the enigma cars how few stars are are in this boy are there's speculation as to why that happened do we have theories cap\n[noise] well the question is are there in fact additional galaxies in the local boy that we don't know about the answers and we don't but no one knows the answer to that but perhaps amateur astronomers based supply that answer\nLet me explain the problem that the local void maybe present that now as I mentioned earlier as the universe expand she'd do expect that the under ... going to get more and more under dense\nAnd so the voids are perfectly compatible with standard cosmology and theory predicts that a void should have about ten percent from Maine density of the universe\nBut in fact when we look at the galaxies that we know of and the local boy\nThen calculate what is their number relative to the mean in the universe it's only about one percent so there's a factor of ten shortfall in the local boy and that leads to the question was where all the galaxies and where are the stars\nIs it possible that there are galaxies in the local boy that we don't know about and the answer is a definite maybe and it's terrible that amateur astronomers working at very dark site very far from city lights\nArmed with good telescopes could perhaps discovered new galaxy scandal local voice\nSimply because the nearest parts of the local Boyd are fairly nearby so there's a potential here for astronomers especially amateur astronomers to make discoveries that would help cosmologist reconcile theory with observation now on the other hand there are other people\nWho say well this problem actually isn't that much of a problem because\nIn a void you expect that the material\nMay not have been able to create starts so that in other words the matter is still there you still have this ten percent mattered that the of the universe void in including and the local boy\nBut it just hasn't been able to converts itself into stars and so that's the reason we don't see these galaxies so you might have a very dark galaxies out there that consists basically of dark matter maybe a little bit of\nGas but no stars so the reason we haven't discovered those galaxies has to play because they met no radiation\nSo right now it's a it's a mystery it's a question and we we do not know the answer we do not know if there are more galaxies to be seen here by in the local boy or whether the local boy does actually pose a problem for standard ...\nKen how how recent is this discovery of the local board and the local sheet and the questions that you just ... about where are all the stars is this something that's been going on for Twenty years Thirty years [laughter] how how recent\nLittle local boy was discovered by Britain totally\nAnd Richard Fisher in Nineteen eighty seven they they were measuring dismissive of nearby galaxies what she used to be a much more difficult thing\nThat is today with you know the very large telescopes we have today and it you know you can measure distances quite easily today but back then it was a struggle you had to do each galaxy individually\nAnd they published an outlet in Nineteen eighty seven and a ... totally notice hey there's a whole sector of the sky that basically empty of galaxies and that was the discovery\nOf the local boy back in Nineteen eighty seven so we've known about the local void since then and even before then we knew about other voice in the universe so it's not a surprise in the sense that there is you're given a that the universe is full of\nPosters in super clusters and voice it's not surprising that there is a boy that is the very nearest one and that is simply the local forward\nAs far as the shortfall of galaxies and the local boy that is a a paper that was published in Twenty one by James peoples and that's one that problem but she called the voice phenomenon started to be known to astronomers so\nThe the discovery of the local void goes back about Thirty years but the the problem with a shortfall of galaxies in the local Floyd is a is it more recent\nProducts and your are your formula of how quickly we're moving is that a new discovery these forces that are compelling is that uh are pushing it pushing and pulling it said six hundred and thirty kilometers per second is that fresh\n[laughter] the actual number there goes back many decades but the explanation\nAs part of the local boys are really goes back to a very important paper that appeared about ten years ago and twenty overweight as lead author was press totally at the University of Hawaii and his team show that to you need the local boy in addition to these galaxy clusters to explain our full Moshe\nThrough the universe up now I should say that there are some galaxies known in the local the local void and the two nearest are about twenty five million light years from earth there for for regular galaxies they can get the pictures of them in the sky and telescope article and there is surprisingly normal\nYou know despite the very bizarre environment to their rather similar to the door for regular galaxies in the local\nGroup so the message seems to be that even if you live in a\nA void you can be a fairly normal gal\nAre they moving towards us or we gathering the men\n[noise] yes yes and in fact a yes vote the local void is basically trying to eat these galaxies or another way to look at it is the galaxies in the local sheets\nAre gravitational pull is oh I'm pulling with other them toward us so that yes they are fleeing the local void and if we could wait a few billion years\nIt's entirely possible there'll be part of the local sheet or at least much closer to it than they are now but in terms of you know forming stars are having no problem making new stars they've got gas\nBy which is the raw material for making these stars and so they seem to resemble fairly normal gal says but as you say they are indeed fleeing the local boy\nDr ... well the article was the uh the cover piece as sky telescope the local boy the boy next door ducks come across well as the author of the lives of stars I'm John bachelor

like we expect\nNow I just got married or not the goblet what is it Bob well\nThis is a little bit more real or at least it's a more solid data a reason that Sean is using doing surveys of the\nOuter solar system to try to see if they can locate an additional planet I'm doing that they discovered an extremely distant object they think it's about two hundred miles in diameter\nLet's all but in the sun from six billion to two hundred and Thirteen billion miles that's how\nDistant is all that is its closest approach is six billion miles which is about the distance of Pluto but it can go out to six hundred to two hundred and Thirteen billion miles which puts it out to the you know or the clouds which just means this is maybe the first\nReal evidence of an on cloud existence that you know that actually is Albany then that distance [laughter] um [noise]\nBase extrapolating the three objects we presently no that exists out there in these far distances that scientists extrapolated that that could be as many as two million objects bigger than twenty five miles in diameter out there\nAnd to put it mildly there's a lot of uncertainty in that extra Appalachian but unless they found the third they call it a GOP the goblet nicknamed at that because it's so far away it's skating\nFair to Bob Bob just this disrupt the search for planet X. or the speculated large body that has just during the course rebelled and perhaps even the inner planets over these last tens of thousands of according\nTo the scientists no in fact they say it's presidents\nFits the president models that say there's a large body out there um but I haven't found the large body and uh you know you're looking you'd think you'd find the bigger object first right around but they have it so it doesn't prove or disprove anything and I think that the models and the daddy here is so uncertain\nAnything they say is waiving hands and shouldn't be taken very seriously\nNow a moment to enjoy it so there was an article in the wall Street Journal these last days read by young woman I Know misspelled shirt\nAnd it turns on papers that are submitted to journals academic journals I Do not know about academic journals I read nature and science that are not academic really their professional magazine\nIt turns out that peer reviewed magazines or being a are publishing article so bizarre and so disconnected from my experience not specialized language but weird interpretation of human behavior\nThat it was possible for free academics or two men and women a woman to submit papers based on complete nonsense get them accepted and published online I guess some of them in magazine form and the question here Bob is\nDoes this connect to all of the peer reviewed magazines or is this just in the social sciences where they're moving around ab verbs\nI personally think that supplies to the entire academic community which in many ways is becoming increasingly bankrupt we've talked about the corruption and the climate field which is hard science but it's so hard anymore the dishes\nPoisoning the entire academic community this is not a new story what these academics did these three academics who they were very disturbed by the by the what they call ... of a lot of these ethnic\nWoman is a feminist um a elder you know what I forgive her gender or ethnic uh departments and the journals set a publishing academic girls just like nature and science and those are not professional those academic journals as well that peer review\nAnd they were disturbed by the lack of rigor and the science side to get together and they they they created\nTwenty fake papers they sent out they said they could have done a lot more but at the end that finally got accepted to several ... or ... pending rewrites we're probably been accepted with time they expected they could have gotten half these fake papers accepted and the subjects of sometimes absurd one of the most secure absurd one\nIt was a fake that they wrote up a paper this talking about how dog parks on an example of rape culture\nThat dogs in dog parks getting home\nThat was just nonsense Bob and it was obvious that was nonsense it's obvious the moment you say it was obvious to everybody you read it in the wall Street Journal and that was the guy that had a ...\nJournal they published it and they gave it an award for a great example of good research in in in general studies they also did a paper in which they read they basically took a chapter from Hitler's bind calm and reshape the slightly using feminist jogging and it got published\nThe one I liked about it the one in the fat studies I I thought ... was a stand up it fooled me I I I I'm In fact by weaken found journals right now that might get accepted you know we'll be right for example a excellent moon colonies we could we could put up a journal like that and probably get papers\nThe thing that you could actually be more real than from these ethics gender feminist or\nA woman much is it is right at home is in hard ... is is Charles ... in the academic community there is bankrupt but Bob\nBob and Bob I care about hard science is I don't care about the
