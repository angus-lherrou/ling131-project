the column for the wall Street Journal is a member of the editorial board\nAddressing the Kavanaugh\nControversy waiting the vote\nIn the United States Senate for confirmation of judge Brett Kavanaugh to be an associate justice of the Supreme Court\nBill takes our attention not to the events of these last week's know or even the Trump Administration since twenty sixteen but back to the late twentieth century roe v Wade decided and reported\nJanuary of Nineteen Seventy three I remember the date because it does all merges together with the death of Lyndon Baines Johnson\nAnd the end of the Vietnam War conflict as we understood it all together but roe v Wade is still with us where the others are history books bill a very good evening to you you present the case\nThat the odd assaults on judge Kavanaugh's character have their origins in the doubts about roe v Wade who doubt to build good evening to you\n[noise] leaving a well as you know I'm the champions of living constitution the idea that the constitution could be made to say anything we think it should say\nAn doesn't at any time in our history they have one exception they believe that the law up ending all the state laws and fifty states I'm On abortion that that is a singular president precedent that is fixed and sacred and it's a bad decision even pro choice\nI'm jurists recognize how bad it was frankly the Supreme Court recognize how bad it wasn't Planned Parenthood versus Casey when they basically gutted the ruling but kept the outcome [laughter] so I think what happens is that the the champions for oh no how brutal that laws and they know that\nA serious jurist given us\nA hard look I'm might find it very vulnerable so whenever they think there's a fifth vote that could affect row they thought that with Robert bark they thought it with uh Clarence Thomas remember at the time they thought Kennedy might be an anti rowboat this is before Planned Parenthood versus Casey\nAnd they think with Brett Kavanaugh even though it's not clear to me you know how Brecht would vote since he's talked about it as a precedent that's been reaffirmed is a precedent so\nBut that's still worried about and this is what Democrats do when we're always at stake for when they think roe is at stake they they just go after people with everything they've got\nYou know that are dying Feinstein who begins this president unhappiness with her revelations in these last right she did not accept Brett Kavanaugh's remarks that roe v Wade is fixed why not why does and she said well\nUS Senate seats have come out in twenty Eighteen it's dominated by Democrats\nAre up for reelection so\nThe cabinet matter before us we don't know how it's going to turn out that the Senate process McConnell says that he's going to call them\nMany many remarks to be passed what I Am keen on is your thoughts\nAbout how this matter these last days will affect the voting in the Senate primaries in the Senate or a gun in midterms especially in states let's take to for example Texas where Senator Cruz is in a very strong read but being challenged by a congressman Beto O'Rourke\nAnd in Missouri where a sitting Senator McCaskill is being challenged also by a very fresh Republican face at all throwing Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota as well or good evening to you both so we begin with you and Texas do you see this affecting the cruise vote\nOr the cruise turnout for Oregon good evening to\nGood evening thanks for having me on so I think one of the most fascinating things is how completely different uh the the the prospects are for the Republicans and just one week\nSo last week I Would have told me that the Senate was essentially going to be a wash and at the end of the day that probably Republicans would probably have a small majority in the Senate as they do right now uh this this completely changed within a week\nUm I think that uh that they have enough to to ration has changed things dramatically in terms of their fortunes for the Republican energized a the coalition for new on it was coalition that brought the two together um for Trump\nOr this is now I I Want to remind people\nThat they ... this this coalition was already building Trump was not the cause of that he was the result of it but they were not they didn't have anything to coalesce around\nUh in in ... in the mid ... they do now and it's not around Trump which I think is a very important distinction they're coming together and they're energized\nOver what they believe is and I I like the tell this and the great revolt is is I'm a ... that culture meaning the big political parties the big political system along with the media and along with pop culture popular culture\nUm are sort of against them and don't understand them and with 'em and and that is the case with ... they believe that it's been heavy handed against him and they projected that on to themselves\n[noise] does that mean turnout models are are are going to change for foreign against you see this exciting turnout in Texas or Missouri in North Dakota as well for both sides Selena\nWell Bert we're out in the Democrats are already or just to show ready AT T right well we were looking to see was will live there this populist coalition was going to do it to be energized to come out um\nAnd um for the ... turns ... this has done it um you know now a independents are always sort of\nWhere we're not sure where they are but you're both parties are at equal levels and because so many Democrats that are up for reelection in red states\nThat put them at the disadvantage to not only will um is Texas and entered your a right for Republican either hold and or pick up\nBut I've seen movement in Florida and Indiana\nAnd uh I uh I I think North Dakota is gone and and I keep an eye on Montana so ... this is a game changing moment I mean I you know I feel bad for what the ... family has gone through\nBut it has been the best things for the Republicans a ... in the in the final weeks of the ...\nCar Flora good evening few political science here I'm I'm On aware helped me teach me is there a political science version of what we've spoken about above the house these last year's month [noise] that are following a close election the advantages to the party out of power does that work in the Senate as well Laura good evening she said\nEvening John thanks for having me on yes\nIt does work but not as consistently so what we do see is that oftentimes the party out of power does pick up seats in the Senate but as I said it's not as consistent and there are times when in fact the president's party does\nDo better and much of that has to do with some of what we're dealing with this time around and that is the\nClass of senators who are up and which party is sort of more on the defensive to begin with as we know in this election the Democrats are incumbents and a number of states that the\nRepublicans won handily\nIn twenty sixteen and so they're already was a sort of Senate lean toward\nThe Republicans wave elections\nAll seats both in the house and Senate tend to fall in one direction and that's where you saw what\nCeline I was just talking about that you know a few weeks ago people were saying well you know maybe the Senate could in fact um do a little bit better than the Democrats than people are thinking maybe Beto O'Rourke is really in a good place\nUm because those sort of wave numbers were starting to be their\nSalinas absolutely right that the Kavanaugh hearings have energize the Republican base but the one I'm cautionary note I Would say is that I'm not certain that in our world today that\nEnergy and enthusiasm will stay there for another five weeks in other words it is very possible to me\nThat um Kavanaugh ended up getting confirmed at the end of this week and that by next week you see Republicans um and the enthusiasm that they have this week\nSomewhat more complacent about well we got it it's done the war spending one and you start to then see the Democrats even more upset and enraged by\nThe fact that Kavanaugh's nomination went through [laughter] so I'm not sure where we're going to be a couple of weeks from now\nI also think it's important to realize that when we do look at the polling um there is essentially a reality that more independence both men and women are believe a Dr Ford than believe a judge Kavanaugh\nIt is also true that um\nThat when you look at just women independence um the beliefs are around Ford's testimony over Kavanaugh's was fifty six percent to twenty four percent so\nYou know there is going to be a very interesting shake out of\nAs the swing voters because the white women college educated um Republicans may not stay with I'm sort of the Republicans and Kavanaugh and they may in fact I'm uphold more of Ford's testimony\nDetail here we just have a thirty seconds or so for both of you or the house is a is a is that on a trajectory to go to the Democrats and the next week since the ... going to affect that Selena just about Fifteen seconds you see the turmoil\nUh also bumping the house or is that on a glide path to land\nI still think I see a Republican or Democrat leaning at least seven to two experts moment um all the way up to thirty nine I think at the end of the day were anywhere by either side in the\n... I did the turmoil here that you just noted you know next week will be a new new scandal is the how is the house settling into concrete what are these metaphors you you like in Washington said that the cat is a cake bake I think that's what I like best or is it still in play\nI don't know that the cake is yet baked but I Do believe that\nJust as ... saying this cat hearing I'm kind of woke up a lot of President Trump's base especially those um blue collar workers I think it is also true that ...\nIt has distanced more college educated suburban women and that will matter in the house races\nLara Brown of George Washington university Selena the tells the Washington Examiner I'm John ... bachelor show\n\nYour chance in a brand new one is as close as participating New England for dealer stopping what's your name in the box cross your\nIf you had an agency with a bad argument then somebody found the student or you know with a good argument you could follow the good argument now on the ... you have to follow the bad argument even if you think it's wrong and so you see case after case doing this\nAnd Gorsuch and cabinet that started the sense that with the following very simple proposition as a constitutional matter let alone statutory matter\nYou're looking at the situation and you know courts is supposed to decide questions of wall and executive branches are not supposed to do that and so we think that this offends the basic principle of separation of powers\nThe point is sufficiently strong that even if they decided to change the text of the administrative procedure act which has been constant since Nineteen forty six they would say you could not do it so the stakes are very on on this particular question I think that the Gorsuch cabinet position\nIs correct about long held that particular view but it used to be a voice crying in the wilderness and now it turns out that we're getting closer to the point where this doctrine may be toppled\n... or injured I what I Want to use an example here and see if I understand this I'll let you clean Air Act which allowed the EPA to interpret the law claiming this with them make us and therefore here's our ruling you said that it permitted the EPA did say that if you have a piece of equipment and you want to upgrade it\nThat is permitted if the amount of pollution doesn't change that's what that's what the ruling it in some however\nThe question is what's a piece of equipment rice and you know there's a bit of a philosophical puzzle here it's this half the heat the heap as a part of a piece of equipment a piece of equipment\nAnd in the factory something you can upgrade without having to ask for new permits and go through the ... the\nDemocratic rule no the moment you decided to shift the amount of emissions from one smokestack to another you have to start over this could be years and and that is\nThat partisanship out of the uh the ... and it would change from administrative ... that's exactly what was feared and it and it happens\nIt happens in this particular case and my view about it is that the stability of expectations that you want out of law means that you should have judges decide these things and if they're going to build a rule that's going to be buying an act of Congress or in some cases where the agency might do so that could change the administrative\nRule in one form or another but it is generally understood when you start to change these rules on an ad hoc basis retroactive application is suspect politically there's a lot of resistance\nAnd at least before the recent Chevron doctrine um it was generally thought that um are there would be legal problems I should put Chevron and context because at the same time that the courts with dealing with Chevron what we did is we had a number of cases involving a question\nOf whether or not when the government made a deal with people you joined this particular pension fund and if you don't think that we're doing things correctly you can pull out without recrimination the argument was that you know\nThat when a government agency says something it is perfectly foreseeable that they will not can keep their work\nSo when you make your decision you have to assume that these guys may well be acting in bad faith as long as it's the ... are you are bound by the change in the ... the whole principle of the rule of law as we know that government officials can act in bad faith and so the reason we\nProtect ourselves against retroactive changes with massive wealth consequences is to make sure that they don't\nThe fact that it's for civil that this thing will happen if you let them go\nIs the strongest reasons to saying you will never let them go so this is in the middle of the Reagan Administration and what happens if it turns out that there is a remarkably low threshold for the protection of vested rights they don't protect them at all and this whole situation\nCreates all sorts of uncertainty in the way in which government or to run and the Republicans have been as much to blame for months of this is the defendants\nAnd there's a story for example about you know ... there's a case called outweigh you we are and what it did is involved the question of how we define certain kinds of police officers and uh the department of labor under Clinton came up with the obviously absurd position that date a sergeant or lieutenants\nWas no and they had administrative and executive or a professional\nUnder the fair labor standards act and therefore is titled the overtime\nAnd you just go spend three minutes looking at the deposition of their duties and of course they're all over the patrol that at one level or another and Justice Scalia wrote an opinion which says well you know this is the way things on the big city it looks to me like it's perfectly sensible I'm not going to strike down they know more about this subject than I Do\nThis was of course a straight political move by democratic department of labor and\nYou know several years later Twenty years later almost you know Fifteen Years later we've just before he died a Philly was hurt the estimate that crazy our decision finance was heated\n[laughter] I'm speaking with Richard Epstein of the Hoover Institution we're discussing Chevron and Chevron ease the administrative state and it is right now a question that will come up
