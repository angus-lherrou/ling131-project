S. capitalist system is the beat the ad campaign is anti Israel activism and so when I see Andrew Gillum so closely tied in fact we put a photo of a Andrew Gillum from his Facebook page in two thousand and four team\nIn which he says court could not be prouder of Philip Agnew and again Agnew is the founder of dream defenders that he wrote a glowing profiled out to me I think Andrew Gillum needs to be honest some serious questions about\nHis deep association and promotion of a group that is anti Israel anti capitalist while he is trying to portray himself\nAs the opposite as pro Israel or even I've gone through interviews that he gave as recently as just a few months ago where he a hot strongly criticized the Israeli military and their response in Gaza and really set some anti Israel\nWhy does why does the mayor of Tallahassee talk about what goes on in Gaza how does that connect Darren\nUnless he seemed to have been trying to position himself even there for support from these protests have grown so\nThat's what he has in common with Taylor Branch these are two agile actors in the progressive part of the Democratic party seeking fun by speaking against Israel does it work\nOh not only does it work but actually that's probably how Andrew Gillum defeated ah Gwen Graham who as his opponent Democrat primary what happened was\nToward the end the last like two months or less of a primary where Andrew Gillum was trailing her um Soros stare dream defenders and actually a coalition of other radical groups that I'm going to get to and the next few weeks in my investigations they port and millions and millions of\nDollars so he he beat her do it just practical on ... ... gallons part if you speak against Israel the crowd will give you money are inclined\nIs watching Gillum and watching dealer brand for Breitbart Jerusalem I'm John bachelor this is the John ...\n\nSays\n\nIt is a large is not a progressive she also had a cowardly staff yes and she could

Roosevelt doesn't make the correct decision and the convention nominated Charles Evans Hughes is Roseanne was on a campaign for\nWell at first he went went when he gets to the news he is so confused this point even though everything is done has led up to use his nomination when they give him the news at at a sack of more hilly looks like his dog died and it's like well you won't see me\nAs almost like you won't have to you are to kick around anymore but then he of course goes on the campaign trail\nAnd overshadows the candidate I Can't think of another case where the surrogate has so overshadowed a the official candidate there's an interesting a telegram back from the German ambassador in Washington to Berlin saying you know it really looked like the Republicans were going to beat Wilson earlier in the year\nBut this Roosevelt guy is losing it and he's going to lose it for the Republicans\nBecause they claim comes available to that of the Democrats to say a\nWilson means peace and prosperity and Roosevelt means war war and panic and ...\nAnd without that Zimmerman no and without unrestricted submarine warfare being resume dislike why should we go to war\nAnd that will happen in Seventeen so we come to the the vote itself\nStrikingly it takes several days for the final count because we hugely blurred ... leaves early from the east but it's not so California is confirmed by about I think thirty two hundred vote to take some time for the votes to be gathered in California\nThat Wilson goes over the top of the electoral college striking to me is the fact that you provide that hire him Johnson wins California by two hundred and sixty thousand some incredible amount yeah Ron Johnson the leading progressive at meeting George as fat and his father so if if\nRoosevelt had been uh been the ticket they would have carried California easily with that scale of progressive votes in California yes everything was lined up for Tiahrt and when\nThe end he was so popular in the west and and she was does not do well in the west um and to our Web still carry the east which is which is very very pro preparedness and interventionist\nHe's back on because he was not president so he's back in action there's ever been telegram the crisis in Wilson's White House\nOr the sending of house for peace gesture all of these events bang bang bang and Seventeen Wilson to ask Congress to declare war in April of Seventeen is Roosevelt satisfied with that\nHe likes war but he won so the more he wants his own war wants his own division he wants his own division and he's going to raise it personally of guys who are ... past the draft age so they would be volunteers it would be like a\nSpare the Spanish American war of Eighteen Ninety eight again he's referring to go he has the the plans drawing up to how many machine guns and he's requested to police or a police horses from the New York city police department if he could ride I\n... he's he's magnificent in preparation for war\nEverybody in the country thinks this is a good thing to do essentially Clemens so the ... the old tiger in France was Roosevelt division they all want it to happen there's only one person on the planet who doesn't want Wilson ... doesn't want Tiahrt average division and that's Wilson why\nBecause [laughter] well there has been some acrimony a little too but I mean at the White House meeting\nRoosevelt shows up after he goes devil fishing in the ... inning huge sea creatures in Florida right after the war is declared\nA buddy aid does it make an appointment Wilson isn't there he's at a meeting of the executive office building and then she are comes back again from New York again on announced but Wilson knows he's coming because you can't keep a secret in DC\nAnd T R turns on the charm but Wilson being this great intellectual creature maybe charm but he's not going to be swayed or words he writes\nYes he is a great big boy and he talks about his sweetness compelling sweetness yeah that was the kiss of death I Will but\nOurs all righty are Spanish American war is not the war\nAnd she is of these old he's fat he's not particularly in good health he's also would be somewhat in subordinate we come down to the disappointment\nThat everybody's going to go to war\n... including a senior politicians everybody's going to go to war except for
