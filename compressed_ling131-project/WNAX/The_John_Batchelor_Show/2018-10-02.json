so let's present the plot at less present a problem first what is the challenge for the carrier groups now with the air air wing manned ... what is the challenge for the good ...\nGood evening John and there's one additional element and mess and that's one of the purposes of this paper are filling the seems in us long range penetrating strike is also the land based element which is the air force

coming in the air force to actually come up with sort of a joint combined campaign to take on the anti access air denial\nTechnologies that both China and Russia are trying to bring to the fore or to try and keep us from being able to reach and and and hit them in their critical centers of gravity they political economic uh or or or military\nAnd so this paper wanted to look I develop some themes a few years ago\nIn a paper called retreat from range that looked at the carrier air wing and then we did another paper about higher farther and faster which looked at the development of the new be Twenty one bomber and what I saw was\nThat I'd taken these separately are distinct platforms and I wanted to see how they would work or develop a concept of operations about bringing them altogether and you're right one of the key essential elements of this is the idea of\nTankers and unmanned platforms and how they can come in to knit this very diverse joint environment together into coherent whole\nThe a challenge in the short fall of the range now from the carriers and the expectation that the PR see I'm going to name the photo here the PR see has developed\nThere are many different

carriers and we're also looking at a paper the Jerry Rohde at his last days at the center for new American security just published about the challenges for the navy in the air force for the U.S military\nIn the Pacific especially off the shores of East Asia against an aggressive predatory state to Chinese with their Russian allies\nAfter the year twenty thirty when Xi Jinping the president for life\nTells us that he expects his military to match and ... match the United States Navy their chief\nA threat to their tyranny in the far Pacific Jerry we've spoken on the air wings and the shortfall we've spoken of the carriers even the fourth ... class carrier not having an answer until it if the\nFor deep strike but you write have something called the science ... fish kill chain dealing with ... percent of weapons that can travel very quickly and this other element that doesn't exist now although I understand it's being built and they're the Navy's debating at an unmanned platform both as a strike\nPlatform and as a tanker platform what does that mean Jerry and what what are they building well\nWhat what is important here is is minimizing what we call late and see\nWhich is the time separation between when you can find a platform or find a target you want to fix its location you want to track it\nAnd then you want to be able to then targeted for elimination so if we have a a a space based asset or an overhead a intelligence surveillance reconnaissance drone\nThat is watching and it has to watch uh almost persistently to see any subtle changes in the movement of platforms are geography once it detects something that looks like a target then you want to minimize the amount of time between a classifying it as a target and then putting a weapon on that target\nThe problem is is all too often now a were either using overhead space based I uh I us our assets or overhead I'm a unmanned platforms that are not equipped with weapons and so the idea of having a platform that can penetrate\nInto a very advanced a surface to air missile environment that means that that platform would have to have a low aspects stealth\nAll aspects self uh all the way around it and then would have to have a deep magazine because eventually once you have that platform get in there you want it to persist in that environment for a period of time\nAh so they get hit perhaps multiple targets so uh the the problem there becomes you know how long can men sit in a bomber or an aircraft and still be combat effective\nOr if you're in a very large bomber like the new be Twenty one than perhaps you can do that you get up and move around and have a little bit of stretching legs but sport naval aircraft it's very difficult to do that and you're almost limited to ten hour profiles\nSo the idea of launching an unmanned platform from a carrier\nAnd then having a platform refuel on its way to the target so that it can extend its endurance and then look for targets identified them hit them and then move on to a new set of targets that's really sort of the holy grail of this ah find fix finish a triangle that we look at\nAnd so this is where a naval aviation ought to be going with it's designed for a long range fixed wing a bomber\nBut dust far has not um in fact it it seems to be hung up on on F. thirty five an F. eighteens which are both fine aircraft for what their original design was which was sort of a light attack mission but when you want to go deep you want to go with a heavier load and you want to be able to persist there\nAnd so the navy is falling short of that over the last generation and a half\nIn the navy fighting in the last war Jerry that is the curse of the twentieth century\nSo we we actually talked about this we we think that the navy ... gets up every morning prepares to fight the battle of midway um and so it's not just the last war it's perhaps three or so ago\nWas that great victory bad boy asked seven minutes to change the course of the war\nAbsolutely absolutely and everyone you know wants to be able to go to a point luck and know the game plan to execute and the army for that sense I mean I I I think we're the U.S military sort of fixed a strategically in sort of the larger wars of the second World War without moving on to the environment we actually exist and\nAnd so looking to the future if the navy was looking to that then it would be wanting to move its carrier air wings or to a new uh a mix of aircraft\nIn order to keep them relevant into these future environments that we can see coming\nWere missiles and directed energy\nAnd longer range weapons systems are going to dominate but that's far we have not seen that in fact we seem to be can last and in the Nineteen nineties when we could park a carrier in the ... sea and then take a Fifteen minute hop over into the former Yugoslavia\nUm and and no one's going to shoot back at you so the idea of being locked strategically into permissive environments\nSeems to be the mistake that we've made over the last Thirty years\nIs the carrier secure now as a as a deploys into the Pacific to act Kenneth defeat China now carry\nA show that that's a great question I Would say that we still maintain that advantage over the Chinese now both geostrategic police strategically at the operational level and perhaps even tactically but the Chinese are building capabilities and resources very quickly\nAnd at some point in time you can you can envision in your mind\nThat sometime within the next ten years I Believe in the twenty twenty five to twenty thirty timeframe\nThat there will be the marsh and um and they will call are bad and we'll have to make a decision whether we're going to lean in and come to the age of an ally or partner or whether we're going to cede that portion of the ocean and that portion of the world\nTo a Chinese sphere of influence and I I fear that we will not be ready for that\nChallenge and the U.S navy right now in the debates they're looking forward they're talking about three hundred and fifty five ship navy perhaps by twenty thirty would that provide the ... of the security that the carrier means in order to penetrate the Pacific\nSo it will head in that direction because we certainly do need more platforms in order to surround our aircraft carriers and give them adequately defenses but this other part that I raised in the paper which is we need to invest in a new generation of missiles\nNew generation of radars and sensors that will allow those ships or be they cruisers destroyers or ...\nOr to better protect that carrier and its air wing as its executing mission we also need a new generation of of ... to do to the day to day presents operations to preserve the peace\nIn the interim between now in that war and then they'll serve an escort a mission once in a war begins and and I think the navy is beginning to think about that we've set the number right three hundred and fifty five ships\nWhat we haven't set is what type of ships with in that number so that has not been decided on and I noted that the air force in this last week made the mentioned that they needed to grow from three hundred and twelve squadrons to three hundred and eighty six so they have a number\nBut again they're debate is how many squadrons of what type families squadrons of bombers versus how many squadrons of fighters I\nWould argue they need many more bombers than fighters in their future for Scott trapping\nJerry Hendricks the United States Navy retired writing for the center for new

president of the United states until the next day Sunday at and at this point he introduces to Woodrow Wilson a a plot that it's so fantastic\nThe question is will will believe that and Thomas Wilson is convinced that America must stay out of the war when he sees this telegram\nYou write that Mr pokes memoirs suggested Wilson took immediate action then he very much present the cases the state department and the White House moving together the president moving together was Wilson reluctant Wilson has thoughts in his mind that this might be a fraud [noise]\nUm [noise] well I mean certainly he asked the question you know is this real can we trust this I'm I'm a you know he knew this was coming from the British\nI think I think he he he he never really believed this was a British forgery I don't think he he he thought the the the Brits would be so primitive to try something like that on him [noise]\nUm but the interesting thing to me was when I read about Wilson's reactions and it's it's difficult to gauge because he did leave any more so you have to read it through you know the memoirs or the notes of other people um\nOf course he he he's not very happy when he hears that um I don't think he's serious they believe the ... believes the United states is is in danger of Mexican invasion but as I said earlier and interview he was\nEven at that point still hoping that um you know he could bring about a peace between the warring parties that would immediately noted states\nNow when he sees the telegram of course he understands the Germans are really not interested in um in peace they're preparing for war against the United states so he at that point see this all efforts to bring about a negotiated peace\nAnd so the telegram doesn't doesn't push him into the war that will be too simplistic but I think it's fair to say that he stopped believing in bringing about media to peace and then eventually it takes a series of steps that brings the United states into the war so it\nIt it didn't precipitate America's intervention but it's certainly accelerated it um but it's also interesting to see it Wilson's reaction when he is told by by Lansing who returns like one or two days later\nAnd he asks Lansing well how did the um\nOut of the Germans transmit this telegram hum and Lansing tells him well it was probably done through a ... you know thrown cables and it seems to me what was the most almost more offended by the fact that the Germans were abusing this this you know American hospitality\nAnd write writing them used the cables then by the content of the
