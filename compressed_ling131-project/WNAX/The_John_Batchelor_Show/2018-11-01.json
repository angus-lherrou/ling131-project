I. X. news\nThe early morning with big Scott out on Steve Crawford on five Seventy five and\nThis is the John ... show a critical decision in Italy affecting the future of Europe especially for energy security and the future of NATO\nThe report is that Italy populist party called the five Star Movement\nDropped its pledge during the election to block the southern gas car door pipeline which brings which intend to bring natural gas from the Caspian Sea bass and the Azerbaijan a pumping station\nThrough the Georgian gone to court or through turkey through ... through Romania underneath the Iranian seat to Italy\nAnd from Italy it's possible to distribute it through all of Europe there by by passing the dependency the vulnerability on Russian natural gas which you can see for geo political reasons is at the moment sensitive\nBrenda Shaffer joins me now professor Brenda Schaffer she is a specialist on this area but she's also the\nVery careful reporter for Georgetown visiting researcher at Georgetown University Center for Eurasian Russian and east European studies theories but rather than and she's at the Atlantic council rather than start in the Caspian Sea I Want to start at Italy because of the sudden reversal of fortune [noise]\nBrenda very good even to the populist in Italy were very very clear that they were going to block\nThey part of the pipeline that was going to go on to the Iranian the within a depot in Italy I Believe is a place called ... why did they reverse themselves what changed for them it's very good news but still sudden change of the weather good evening to\nCut in ... well I think you know this is a classic case of public interest\nStill sudden change of the weather good evening to\nPut in ... well I think you know this is it here at a classic case of\nPublic interest over populism so the pot you know that\nItaly is one of them are a very unique energy market in the AAU um it has one of the highest percentages of use of gas in their marketing for this reason it's one of the only other countries in Europe that actually has a downward trend and there are climbing emissions and air pollution and a lot of other countries in Europe\nDespite all the talk despite all their lecturing to the United states actually ... in most markets in Europe emissions are actually going up on it it really is an exception and it's an exception\nAnd thanks it's extensive use of gas and in fact\nOf all the gas fields vehicles in in the ... Seventy percent or in Italy so you would think five years ago when um the government of Italy and a variety of Italian companies decide to be partners to the tap a pipeline which is part of the southern gas court or\nBringing gas in from Azerbaijan into Italy you this was considered a victory for Italy here we're lucky we get to get more gas volumes into Italy it'll bring gas gas prices down I'm ... and it will increase security of supply lesson dependence on Russia so this was good\nJohn ... so this is the John ... a welcome my colleague professor Lara Brown of George, Washington university political scientist and we're going to go to political science to look at one district that is a battleground district for the mid term in some days this is\nPennsylvania one otherwise known as Bucks County\nFrom Bristol to do ... town to Quaker town I grew up in the summertime in Bucks County it was in my youth in the middle of the twentieth century farm just being industrialized with great big highways moving through it\nBut still it had the feel very much of very far outside of New York now it's a commuting distance from New York Trenton very easy\nAnd close by the train station new hope is also there so there's a lot of trend in it at the edges of a Bucks County it's well to do I underline Florida a very good evening to the race here is for ... is for the professional and veteran Brian Fitzpatrick who's the incumbent Republican\nHe's challenged by Scott Wallace\nHowever you've sent me a link\nPolitical apple is like the takes us inside this not just about them but about how the district is polling on issues right now it's rated ... D for two polls icy and toss out for one poll how to read this is a political scientist what does this tell us about the rest of the nation as well good evening to\nHit evening John and thanks for having me on tonight this is such an interesting district because the cook Political Report rates it as a toss up seat on the University of Virginia it's crystal ball right says says a toss up seat by every measure that we know Brian Fitzpatrick is\nAn incredibly I'm sort of well received and well light income then Republican and in any other year I think most people would assume this district to it's going\nTo follow his way because he has been somebody who has tried\nTo really represent his district not necessarily his national party um but what is true in the numbers\nIn this amazing political atlas a website that this ... Center for politics and it says has created is it you can see in snapshot fashion how he is being dragged down\nBy other factors kind of within his party\nOn the first one being that we in his suburban district that Trump approval rating is twenty nine percent I'm so that is a good you know sort of twelve to Thirteen percent below the national average for president\nTrump and there's no doubt that sort of the ... disapproval of Trump is dragging on Brian Fitzpatrick on reelect possibilities\nI'm looking at the main issues\nUm is dragging on Brian Fitzpatrick um reelect possibilities\nI'm looking at the main issues on social media there's a state wide not just the first district\nPresident Trump dominate thirty three percent\nSecond of course is health care and Supreme Court healthcare favors the Democrats if I understand that this election talking about Obamacare has suddenly turned into a positive because the Republicans fumbled it and the first year of the president's term Supreme Court that looked like a mixed bag\nBecause of the cabinet all a scandal and how it ended so I can see that they're pulling push but to remind the rest of the nation and did not grow up in Pennsylvania this is a county Bucks County that entirely read the New York times every day okay if it's in Pennsylvania but it might as well be in Manhattan\nThere very well informed quite sophisticated heavy media all the time uh and they they process themselves as part of the Bosnian wash court or so it makes sense that they're sensitive to Trump you know the Democratic candidate here Scott Wallace\nHe then has very little to do other than to emphasize the trumps in every headline is that the campaign Lara\nWell I think so certainly I Would imagine that he is trying to create distance from Brian Fitzpatrick on the issues around health care or say around 'em guns but again\nI mean one of the things that is true is that fits Patrick has been incredibly moderate very reasonable he's actually I'm sort of one of the members of Congress who's engaged in um essentially what's called the problem solvers caucus so\nHe is somebody who is kind of model this notion of we should be civil work across the aisle find\nPlaces where we can connect and I think what's so interesting about\nThis contest is how this contest goes on election night will tell us a great deal about how a lot of the other ... urban districts in the country will go and so this is certainly one to watch and it's one\nIn the east you know a poll closing time in Pennsylvania I Believe is eight o'clock\nI'm Virginia will close at seven um but we will have a sense of really where this is going when we look at a seat like this on election night and we look at a seat like I'm Barbara Comstock in Virginia\nAs Pennsylvania where the Supreme Court ... district between the last election and the selection of this district ... in a slightly different configuration was plus nine for ... only eight plus two for bronco bomb a twelve and plus two for Hillary Clinton\nIn six teams so it with a Republican as the representative so it's a perfect target for the Democrats if they are to move the needle back to their side of the majority are let's go to the larger map\nThe conventional wisdom last week when we talk was that the\nDemocrats take the house somewhere between twenty three and forty seats a pickup which would give the majority and the Republicans hold the Senate possibly to pick up has anything moved in the last week [noise]\nUm I don't think so I mean there is this question about whether or not the Texas race between Beto O'Rourke and an incumbent Senator Ted Cruz is essentially narrowing and becoming more competitive there was a poll out today\nThat suggested that the distance between them was more like three percentage points\nNot a six percentage\nPoints I think that's going to be um very much a function of turnout and then there's also this question of how much immigration versus health care\nReally plays in sort of the important states the states like North Dakota where the incumbent Democrat Heidi Heitkamp\nIs trying to um secure reelection where Joe mansion in West Virginia is trying to secure his reelection um those are the states where really this question of will the president's um desire to focus on the caravan and illegal immigration\nAnd asylum seekers or will um the Democrats desire to focus on the need to protect pre existing conditions and support the Affordable CARE Act that's what will matter\nLara Brown is a political scientist she's also professor George, Washington university and we're looking at a website\nPolitical hyphen atlas dot com with a great deal of detail I mean it's just granular to the nth degree so if you're a geek like me you can stare\nAt this on a lecture night the\nDistrict we been talking about his first Pennsylvania\nGot wallets who was raised and norm is amount of money compared to here in Columbus he's raised Thirteen million dollars he has two million on hand\nAs opposed to Brian Fitzpatrick who's raised only three million dollars in comparison to that used to be a lot of money in the first district and he only as less than half a million dollars on the hand in hand so that this is an example of how the Democrats have overwhelmed the Republican with fund raising in this cycle I'm John ...\nThis is the John ... [noise]\n\nI'm joined us you know my longtime colleague Bob's west but behind the kinds of forward is most well two dollars\nOr twenty five dollar donation\nZoom in on I Want to thank Ulysses for

give me what information about good worth without having to do detailed inquiries as to whether the people think\nDo or want it makes it an exchange system rather than an administrative system it's more ... it's more responsive and in the end it works better for everybody the\nPresident's council of economic advisors Richard has that linked to the report has issued the opportunity costs of socialism Richard is giving the overview very quickly we're going to plunge into this\nBecause democratic socialism does not make common sense period\nHowever it's important to pull it apart on the basis of what it believes the historical precedent that would be the nineteenth century and the language of Carl Marx as inherited by the man who you know we call Lenin how the definitions Richard applies in his\nDefining ideas beans I never looked at them as closely as I did and Richard definition because they don't make any sense on the one hand we have\nA definition of socialism that includes these words regulated by the committee as a whole what the heck is that I ask myself the other definition we avid\nCollective ownership of the means of production what the heck is that I asked myself and then the updated version this is for the twenty first century by those who call themselves democratic socialism Megan Megan day is Richard ... pooling societies resources\nTo meet people basic needs what the heck does that mean I think Richard\nThe language here is so inexact\nIt's dumb founding because it doesn't have history and when we offer examples you just did with Venezuela we can talk about you but we can certainly talk about what happened in Russia\nWhen we offer historical examples in which they shuffle aside and say now now\nThat was failure we're going to do it right Richard I do not believe that we can do we can debate with people who don't do history\nWell I certainly won't be able to do it right but let's just go back to the analytics of the points I any serious activity\nRequires joint cooperation either through exchange or to call bring businesses are corporations but when you start talking about a collective ownership of a from these are so but then the five people who pick their friends put together\nAnd then when they do is they put together goods to sell to the world or share that they could sell the other people and everybody knows the business that they're buying from or the business that they're buying into the collective ownership is a way of combining labor and improving productivity\nWhen you say the collective means of production are owned by the government that when it when and sorting process no longer takes place and so which of the three hundred and twenty five million people in the United states are going to be at the\nHelm of which benches and why is going to be determined solely by a political process all political process these are these terms turn out to be completely unstable because what happens if somebody gets in gets elected and appointed friends in cronies to take these jobs over\nThere is nobody who can discipline them by saying I'm not going to invest in your particular business\nBecause I don't think you have a decent business plan so they do is a ... big tax money\nAnd then they put it to benches and they have no idea what to make her how to make it old wine to make it so the system essentially um this fused responsibility leads to nobody controlling anything which is not going to last very long or to these arbitrary groups coming in and taking over segments of the economy\nWithout the consent of the people who invest and so if you ask a simple question Ken this collective pulled asset\nPlan and work with government control the answer is no now the government have a role in regulating the economy\nYes one of the things that you never hear talked about among socialist is how is that regulation actually does make sense and I'm thinking here of common carrier regulation like public utilities and railroads way you do know what you're trying to do which is to control the use of monopoly power as it would otherwise exist\nBy putting in a set of rates that leave enough money to the firms so it doesn't go broke but prevents those excesses this is a very hard road to follow but at least you know what the messages\nWhen they're talking about government regulation\nThey're not trying to talk about reaching some kind of competitive ideal they have no respect for Marcus no us back for competition no respect for the fundamental theory of economics which is that competitive solutions could not be\nTopped by any arbitrary solutions you put into place so the only question is when you can't have competitive market say good capitalist is willing to think about limited regulation is to create it but when you can have competitive markets the last thing you want to do is to have the socialist come along\nAnd wrecked them by taking over all the means of production\nI'm speaking with Richard ... at the Hoover Institution and he's a senior fellow he also teaches law at NYU and the University of Chicago we're dealing with the Democratic socialism idea\nOf the campaign trail in twenty Eighteen people to put a plug into this when we come back we're going to Elizabeth Warren and her concept of collective ownership\nOf a corporation and how that works with the older concept of central planning I'm John bachelor this is the John ...
