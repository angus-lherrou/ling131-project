and how it deals with large a large successful chains good evening to you\nDon't want it shows me is that the conventional wisdom about the impact of large big box chains on the little guy or the proverbial corner store is exactly backwards because if in fact the\nBig businesses were pushing out the small from retail areas what we would have seen over the past Eighteen months is very basic with\nThe whole foods the biggest seller of the biggest most dominant store on global park in Washington DC shut down for Eighteen months\nLogic dictate the other businesses there would have been

John ... he's the author\nHowever before that he's the author of who needs the fed well apparently the vet and he says\nThe largest some more of a kind of a sudden the United states\nDone we go immediately to the Federal Reserve and what makes it sleepless why people wander around worrying and mumbling to themselves and this large collection of economists I picture of vast room kind of Nineteen eighty four vision\nOf everybody at their desk worrying about what's going wrong when the economy is doing very well thank you very much and apparently they worry about inflation why John [noise]\nThey worry about inflation because we're inside the fed the belief is that a growing economy\nIs the cause of inflation they say that it leads to higher prices of everything which is ... percent back we're\nBasically a growing economy is driven by investment what us investment it's just it's it's just more capital flowing to perjure up production such that we're able to produce more and more with less less and so in in the real world inflation is is going to be most prevalent\nUh when the economy is growing the leaf simply because there is the least amount of investment one of the economy is booming that's a sign of mass investment which is a sign that the prices of everything are dropping\nVenezuela you use that example in your article what does that and it was well it showed the fat that it could learn\nA Venezuela's economy I mention quickly Venezuela's economy is in the hands of a dictator and a regime that imports brutal brutality from Cuba and from Russia\nAnd at the same time that people are are they are fleeing or working in the black market because the currency is completely collapsed so much so that they are ... that they're projecting something called the Petro some fantastic crypto currency because they no longer can handle their deaths in the world please continue\n[laughter] Venezuela is dollar eyes that's the other thing precisely because their currency no longer works it's increasingly dollar eyes to major paradox Venezuela is evidence of what true inflation is the boulevard there has collapsed and value and that and it's collapsed so much that the that\nRestaurant owners are constantly having to change prices reflect\nThis truth to think about that\nIf you're constantly changing the price because you don't know what you're going to get that means\nA lack of investment who would invest in a country where you don't know what kinds of returns you're going to get into Venezuela's evidence of what inflation is it's when you do botch the currency and in doing so you drive away the very investors that that that\nPower economic growth the fed is worried about economic growth ... cause and rising prices but we see in Venezuela and other countries that record currencies are actually experiencing rising prices but the big the the the true source of inflation\nIs one you destroy the currency that's the traditional definition of inflation the fed has somehow changed it in the last ten Fifteen Twenty years and it's something that a plainly isn't it never was\nAnd the puzzle about inflation is that they are going to worry about they're going to continue to worry about it\nAnd they also worry when there is an inflation they were both directions these economists wandering around brooding and worrying to themselves this is built in to the Federal Reserve right John there's no way to get it out of there they they warship the idea that inflation is bad and therefore we have to stop it but\nWhen they try to stop it what tools do they have aren't they aren't they aren't they without without success\nHow would that the fed for one doesn't have any control over the valley the dollar there's this myth the fed targets to a dollar in fact it doesn't and it never has\nThe dollar is a treasury function and the fed can only view inflation through this new way of focusing on economic growth and trying to control it through the interest rate and so we're seeing right now with the ...\nSet economists and the rooms obsession with the our storage this notion of reaching an interest rate that such that that that money is neither too tight or too slow that the creditors neither too too easy north ... nor too\nDifficult to guard our star then translates as Goldilocks right it's the Goldilocks\nGoing locks which absurd and economies just a collection of individuals we take it back to inequality grows ... unequal people grow much faster than three and four percent but the fed thanks to the economy needs to be managed like this but there's no way the\nFed could achieve this the interest rate is a price sat around the world based on infinite decisions taking place every millisecond of every day\nSo the notion that a bunch of economists at the fed working with limited information could come up with the our star with the proper interest rate that that basically balances the needs of savers and those who want to borrow from savers is to take you less\nTo even to even contemplate or discuss but that's what's being discussed inside the Federal Reserve today and it's a reminder\nThe feds power is vastly overstated if a group of economists so diluted\nCould actually control credit the U.S economy would Be Sober assessed as to not even be worth talking about it would be yesterday's news booms and booms precisely because the fed is just not that important\nYou know our star are high star misuse of the uh the remark of fed vice chairman Kevin wash\nTalking about the our star quote idea most in vogue and central bank circles does that mean our star is in Europe as well ... and the central bank of Europe are doing this and the central bank of Japan there are all central bankers are searching for Goldilocks\nOh absolutely and and what if they always done it the fed to the central banks are just another bureaucracy in search of a purpose and so they've got one we're going to try to create equilibrium\nOn on interest rates but back to reality interest rates are set in the marketplace the fed nor any central bank can alter reality and so while the central bankers are talking about how they're going to achieve Goldilocks\nSimple truth is there's going to be a lot of credit during economic booms because there is going to be a lot of resources and during the slower periods there'll be less credit as those who have access to limit the ability of businesses to misuse it\nAutonomy or self regulating mechanisms the idea that central banks actually regulate regulate them defies basic common sense\nCentral planning died in the twenty century with good reason this notion that central banks or the last vestige and actually control the the economies of the world it's just not serious and I contend that and the next few years it's going to be accepted wisdom that central banks are just not that important that we ...\nForever overstated the relevance\nJohn Tammany his books include
