show\n\nOh\nI'm John ... this is the John ... show the eleventh congressional district of New Jersey bill in the garden\nHe writes for the wall Street Journal who's a member of the editorial board and he's taking us into the eleventh district and showing us how the Democratic party is making a case that the tax cuts\nAnd jobs active twenty Seventeen which was a predicates along with the regulation for the boom in the economy these last month in court or is it was actually a tax hike I think that's right it's not quite logical but I built kind of helped me bill\nHow does the Democratic candidate Mikey Cheryl how does she maintain a straight face when she says but at the tax cut was a tax hike how does it work good evening to well it works its\nWay John ah as you know that one of the more controversial aspects of the tax cuts was to a cap\nDeductions for state and local taxes and mortgages right\nAnd uh I Am a long suffering taxpayer of New Jersey stand uh but I was willing to give up the things for an overall cleaner system which they've done by focusing on this I mean it's true that some taxpayers um\nBecause they're deductions on this will be kept\nA we'll have to pay more but there's also you know the empty has been pared back and so forth and others standard induction it's been raised so most people are getting a tax cut and even the people who fear\nThat they're not I mean we'll have to see in April but I think more it's going to a more is going to be a wash but it's it's a crazy argument I mean she's essentially arguing the tax bill\nUm was it was a tax hike\nYou know the ways and means he can argue the figures all the time but they have figure saying that for the average Morris county a war congressional district member Lebanon New Jersey the average family of four it's going to give his six thousand dollar tax break\n[noise] this is a problem the Democrats look to solve these last month since the tax cut in jobs that are to explain away the booming economy even to take credit for it I guess and uh build the general conventional wisdom is that they have been successful is that accurate in New Jersey\n[laughter] well I think I think somewhat in New Jersey look on the Republican running Jay Webber is is the real thing he's a principal to a Republican and one of the few with the guts to embrace the tax cuts you know he says he would like to roll back some of the salt caps as well\nBut uh overall it's been a big benefit the reason the Democrats get away with it in New Jersey in particularly in the eleventh is that Mike ...\nIs a very attractive candidate and by that I mean also has a um an attractive backstory she's a Naval Academy graduate I Believe a former helicopter pilot in the navy and worked for a federal prosecutor she also doesn't have a voting record\nRight and it's just absurd to complain about\nThe capping the salt tax as for tax relief when you say nothing about the high New Jersey taxes the Democrats given us I mean since June\nTo one they've raised taxes and what's already one of the most over tax safe they raise taxes on corporate income on personal income and on gas taxes just since June and it's going to get worse\nOne of the most over tax safe they raise taxes on corporate income on personal income and on gas taxes just since June and it's going to get worse so um you know it's not a coincidence that I'm Michelle says nothing about the tax hikes that her fellow Democrats loved to impose on\nThe poor residents of New Jersey stand like me\nFor those who do not live in the east coast New Jersey as part of the trifecta of blue states with an enormously high tax demand and that is why the salt fat is the state and local tax\nNon deduction in the tax cutting JOBS Act is such an argument here because one one hand you have all Democrats and on the other hand the will to do Democrats\nNow have can no longer did duck their ... their\nProperty taxes as they could before and that limits the ability of the Democratic governors to raise taxes that's what that's that's a Frank Murphy in New Jersey Andrew Cuomo in New York certainly no bill that fat salt deduction going away means that they have a harder time just routinely raising taxes\n[noise] yeah and uh it's actually it's going to force them to pay a price for it it's just so so we don't have a press that asks a lot of questions so again ah Mikey Cheryl running on a very attractive resume suburban mom good\nGood background in the military it's harder for her image or she runs very good abs I think her image is just hard to associate with polo the style Democrats and she says she wouldn't vote for ... see as speaker but really do you believe that if she's elected that she's going to be a voice\nFor a tax reform and lower taxes in Washington I mean she's going to be voting with the rest of her party is she in the\nParty of Mrs flows he says that our first priority\nAnd she's going to be the speaker if the Democrat I get that right for her first priority is rolling back the tax bill\nI mean um it's just crazy we we are without doubt New Jersey the dumbest voters I mean we've all these professionals who who um are supposedly so smart and so educated and um and yet we allow ourselves to be so\nBadly run so monstrous Lee over taxed and this is one reason why\nRolling back the tax bill before rolling back Brett Kavanaugh and Donald Trump gets the priority\nNow I don't think that it Brent Kavanaugh is in her belly where but I think should like to do is try the\nThe ... Menendez race affect the Weber shall race in any fashion cuts that I see an end as is struggling to make a case here\n[laughter] yeah I'm not sure in the debate I'm Jay Webber you know I asked her whether she would vote for him in the end is and she said she would and called him a fighter for New Jersey I'm not sure that helps her but I I think the truth is in New Jersey eleventh\nJust no one wants to ask tough questions like what it really means for the state um what it really means for our economy and uh whether um where they were going to get lower taxes as as a sort of implied if we vote for him Mikey Cheryl I it's it's just preposterous\nThe conventional wisdom says that the Democrats have between twenty and thirty feet to win here at dry and forty to win in order to take the majority and the Charlie Cook report says that thirty a good number\nIs is the ... district critical to that thirty or is this was always going to be a democratic way\nI'm not sure it was always going to be a democratic win but it it fits the profile to swing suburban district it's been represented by Rodney freely house and a moderate Republican\nOversized banner for free right\nWho retired so it fits the profile that way um there's been a freelancer housing in Congress almost since there's been a Congress [laughter] um so it fits the profile of retiring Republican members also the state's been growing blue or\nYou know I mean even before Donald Trump hum New Jersey's becoming a much bluer so uh I I'm not sure this just happened to be the year I mean Jay Webber to me is a very attractive candidate he understands economics he's been a strong voice\nIn the state assembly a but again he has votes to defend than his opponent doesn't she just running on a ah some attractive ads and a good resume\nBuilding a car William occur and he's a member of the border wall Street Journal writing for the wall Street Journal Maine's during\nThese racist eleven New Jersey to watch on

by Shonda Shia Muslim and and and Israel's predominantly\nA Jewish that for some reason they would be some a structure to their relations but I think it's exactly the opposite I think that that there's there there is um is this whole region has nothing as we discussed a in a in a previous discussion between that\nHas nothing to do with with the uh religion just like\nIran and Armenia have very close you know relations when you know our Armenians occupies territory that lead to you know nine hundred thousand or she either by John needs to become refugees it doesn't bother the Islamic

Israel but the last major visit of a senior I took a Johnny official with may fourteenth ... does that date to anything to John\nYeah may fourteen that was made fourteen so that was during a conflict I Can't recall what was the ...\nYeah it was actually the hope that this didn't two thousand and Eighteen it was the opening of the U.S embassy\nAll right here in the middle of and Jerusalem I was going the wrong way I thought some something was happening in Baku yet\n[laughter] so it's actually you know the inter inter governmental commission between Azerbaijan and Israel met for the first time in Jerusalem\nWhen the U.S embassy what's being open and you know and basically the whole Muslim world was a a a boycotting end up in arms you know still as either by Johnny minister of taxes ministership borrow you know came came to Israel to Jerusalem [noise]\nUm so really the relationship is a exceptional between ... and ... and Israel\nWe have less than a minute Brenda Iran we've not

Iran is the third ethic gotcha by Johnny and uh you know clearly\nA prosperity to the north of the ... river and the republic of ... now ... instability in a great economic deprivation to the
