a sergeant United States Marines born in Eighteen Seventy eight this is Patrick very careful reporting so he's forty years old he's a member of the forty nine they're very early end of the war they arrive in June of Nineteen Seventeen to train but it is now the summer of Nineteen Eighteen\nAnd this is an event that you heard about on the on the edges of history class called Bello would Patrick take us into Bello would in June of Nineteen eight\nJune of Nineteen Eighteen the French Army is melting away\nAs the the the um the example that they use is that\nIt's like rain on a hot hot iron it just evaporates and the ... the French Army is evaporating it in front of a massive German offensive that is directed it directly at Paris\nAnd lived in dark means to win the war right now yes and the only units that are you know in ready reserve and that are willing to fight 'em is or the Americans the second in the third century wretch a division specifically the second\nWhich includes the forest brigade which is a Marine Corps brigade\nAnd the the Marines are are shifted into below would or in in that sector they dig in behind the fleeing French and this is a very important fact the French were just taking whatever forces that they had in immediately throwing them into battle\nBut the the commander of the the second insisted that the chief of staff insisted that we dig in behind and not be thrown in piecemeal and this and potentially was a war saving maneuver\nJust general ... since he'd been arguing the politics of this for some time the British commander hay and the French commander ... wanted to cut up the Americans and feed them into the weak divisions that were holding the line against the Germans that summer and Pershing had refused\nTo this is part of that that's part of the macro but on the very tactical level the chief of staff of the second division a colonel brown insisted that we dig in behind the French and we form a a defensive line and this was a very important move\nThe um the\nMarines dig in and I mean this is where through accurate rifle fire they stop in many cases advancing Germans through the weak field\nAnd I mean this is a situation where the the Marines are seeing the French flee all around them the the army and the French as they move into the area they the the the French say the war is over [noise]\nExcuse me and and the uh they dig in behind the French and there's you know some famous lines here a retreat hell we just got here is uttered by one of the marine officers who help stop I'm part of the German advance\nGet it out June sex and the Marines are going to go on the offensive against spell out what the Germans now have the superior defensive position everyone in the first war knew that the defenders had an advantage because of the machine guns and because of the heavy artillery that was\nVery carefully targeted on the front lines the Marines go forward including\nGovernment Sargent or his chance and into a massacre which becomes a massacre they they advance in a line or through what is called a weak field\nOpen ground and the Germans mow them down but the Marines don't stop\nThey don't stop they keep pushing forward and their objective is a is known as hill one forty two it's a crucial high ground outside of Bella would and they they push on um the forty ninth company in particular is leading the attack a chance and\nAnd um George Hamilton who is this the captain of the forty nights but\nThe unknowns covers as band of brothers the forty ninth through the entire book it's the through line in many cases\nRight this is a moment in an American military history where they were not separating the Marines from the army so they were all blended together into one fighting unit but this particular unit was entirely Marine Corps\nThat's correct and they're moving forward through the wheat and they take the hill against all odds the hills actually occupied by a battalion of Germans but they overcome the hill you went in\nThere it's a rise from or what does the word looks today what it looked like in Nineteen eighty\nIt has similar there's the wheat fields very bucolic but at the same time the scars of war very present there's there's massive show holes that that literally could swallow a small house with\nThere's the some of the trees are still embedded with the mustard gas shells that it's been hurled around during the war first world\nWar forty ninth overruns one forty two realizes that rise behind this is our position so they fall into one forty two and now comes Johnson's roll the Germans got around behind one forty to how how does it work that he all of a sudden faces more than a dozen Germans\nSay they immediately um fall back on one forty two after they realized that they've gone a little bit too far and they brace for counter attack that's typical German tactics within a half an hour the Germans immediately will counterattack position that they just lost in the hope of of regaining it\nAnd that's what game that there there are literally potato mash or grenades and artillery that reigned in and the Germans counter attacked and great strength\nUm was fixed bayonets and they started to set up\nThey nearly were over running the hill and Jansen spiders several camouflage helmets which were the ... a German helmets and that that were represented by German machine gun or is that we're setting up their their maxims\nAnd have they been able to set up they would have probably over on the hill with a ... fire but chance and saw them and immediately sprung into action and literally let a band that charge by himself and disrupted the these maxim machine guns he was wounded in the process\nAnother body there we need to mention quickly this is a ... a man by the name of del who's field artillery color sergeant James del us you know as the army field artillery he was decorated ... sauce what's a month later now it's middle of July Nineteen Eighteen\nHe fires the French artillery piece the Seventy five\nA and this battle ... sauce was also the they call it the second battle of Martin I Believe this was also a nightmare of casualties for they back\nAgain the with the Americans have to advance across to open fields they faced a heavy machine gun fire but they're going on the counter offensive and they're literally on hinge ing or the Germans salient that had been created\nIn in July or I mean is there in June in may when they were thrusting towards Paris and this forces\nThe Germans to fall back to their their initial positions of the hidden Burke line which are these prepared defenses\nAnd his unit are decorate it decorated for constantly being at risk field artillery pieces don't have a big range so they're ... they're within the range of the big German God\nIs unit are decorate it decorated for constantly being at risk field artillery pieces don't have a big range so they're ... they're within the range of the big German God this is\nYou know I mean a hidden part of World War one history I think the field artillery is really overlooked in ignored these guys actually you know move forward to some degree with the
