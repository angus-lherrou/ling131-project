Vermillion sooner is hosted by the dynamic Christ stomach president dos Santos recruitment National Review retention recognition and recruit from Tampa, Florida for more information follows you as a radio station\nI'm joined us so that the John ... show I welcome Lara Brown\nLara Brown I'm George Washington university to comment as a political scientist\nWith days to go twenty Twenty one days to go to the mid term election what we see in the polling and how this comports with political science\nHistory about midterms following a close election or a White House held by the opposite party to the ambitious out of power party Laura a very good evening to you I think I cage that enough so that I I didn't get too far ahead of myself\nBe elections that you are profiled these last weeks and months we've been talking about this\nIndicates that the Democrats are on the edge of doing the obvious which is winning the house from the Republicans somewhere between twenty six and thirty six feet there's enough\nAt this point there's chatter about a blue way there is also chatter about a red wave\nDo you think do you see anything inconsistent in the polling and the polling has very careful I'm watching the New York times polling they pull every night and they give the numbers as they do it do you see anything in the polling to indicate a an interruption in the conventional wisdom that the Democrats will win a majority in the house of representatives good evening to\nEvening thanks for having me on the most difficult part about polling is that pollsters half to\nEstimate and this is where the art is what the turnout is going to look like and\nThe heart of that usually happens through screens of registered voters they asked them how likely you are to vote so you get what are called likely voters screens some of it also\nHappens I'm through the responses themselves you can start to tell by the the amount of sort of information people have are the enthusiasm that they have in certain questions that you ask them um\nHow likely they are to participate and all of that\nInformation kind of helps a pollster understand what turnout may look like\nBut the problem is we're in something of an unusual mid term environment we're seeing both parties bases\nVery enthusiastic I'm almost equally enthusiastic not quite but almost and interestingly enough people are saying that they're planning on voting with a high degree of certainty and that it's just not\nUsual in a midterm election in other words mid term elections yes we have this dynamic of waves yes there are times where all of sort of the enthusiasm of the out party builds up and sort of cast this referendum vote\nAll of the sort of the enthusiasm of the out party builds up and sort of cast this referendum vote against the president but what we're seeing in this instance is it both parties bases are very excited\nI'm and we're not really sure a little bit about the middle of the electorate\nThe middle of the electorate is non partisan it's either independent or not terribly excited either way it's waiting for that last week under that last day so is there another way to judge George to measure or to get some mid term does the money tell the story lower\nMoney certainly can suggest some enthusiasm and it is true that money has uh some very real\nImpacts on whether or not candidates are able to win I think as political scientists have long studied and Gary Jacobsen is I'm sort of high on the list of canon of political scientists who have understood these dynamics\nBut one of the things that is true is that incumbents have to raise money\nBut because they are already known they usually are raising money in a defensive posture in other words um they need to raise more than the challengers but at the same time I'm every dollar that they spend\nDoesn't help them as much as say a dollar a challenger raises and spends and that just has to do with the familiarity\nOf these candidates challengers are usually not known so every dollar that they spend um does more to help them advance their causes in other words there's a better marginal return on their dollars spent\nBut the truth of the matter is for both candidates the challenger and the incumbent there is essentially a saturation level um or there is a diminishing returns that go with the additional dollars spent\nI'm told look I'm told about the saturation level that we passed it about a week ago that ... minutes left on any TV channels anywhere in the important battleground districts\nThat's right and of course so much of half of this is also happening on line so there's a lot of digital advertising um where people are spending money but really what you're looking at here is\nIf a challenger hopes to sort of beat an incumbent they need to raise typically at least half as much as the incumbent raises and spend that amount what is pretty extraordinary about the election we appear to be in is that\nMany of the Democratic challengers have out raised the Republican incumbents\nThat usually doesn't happen it is a rarity and it does suggest that the energy is on the Democratic side of the aisle but we do have to realize that um challengers need to kind of be known if they're going to essentially\nWinners of twists there too I saw the New York times feature of the story that the candidate for the Democrats in Texas O'Rourke this is the Senate candidate against Ted Cruz has raised some spectacular amount of money tens of millions thirty eight million was not named I don't know what the total some is\nAnd and is not spreading it around the way Congress or the way members of Congress usually do and so there's all and all a lot of the money this is New York times reporting was coming from California and New York in other words not from Texas\nAnd that's the power of online that's the power of crowd funding but at the same time I wonder if that's effective money ... is that a detail the political science can help with\nWell at the end of the day all money is good money and that you can spend it I mean I Do think that one of the things that Beto O'Rourke\nHas um declared is that he's not taking pac contributions so that is helping him\nAt this level at which he can say all this money wherever it's coming from is happening through individuals giving to me um and that\nDoes allow him to spend an extraordinary amount he did thirty eight million in the third quarter heated twenty three million in the second quarter so there is no doubt he has plenty of money for all of the media advertising buys\nHe wants to do um\nThe real question is will it persuade\nAny Republicans because obviously the challenge for ... or ... is the voter\nUnderline voter distribution and registration in Texas we know that there are more Republicans there though there are many Democrats who are not registered\nAnd this is sort of the new fight of the Democratic party which is do you engage in persuasion or do you try to turn out voters who has not\nVoted before and in some of the states that they're in right now in particular some of 'em these more contested typically Republican states like Georgia\nI'm you are seeing a lot of of questions about um who can actually vote and who should be voting\nLargest to detail here with less than ... minutes ago the conventional wisdom also says that the Republicans retain the Senate in some fashion whether it's a pickup or stand pat do see anything to interrupt that we have about thirty seconds\n[laughter] know again I think this is where the underlined distribution of voters matters a great deal um if you look at those states where Democrats are on the defensive granted their incumbents and they've raised money but they are in very Republican states and with a\nEnthusiastic Republican base it will likely be hard\nTo secure those votes for them\nLara Brown is a political scientist she's a professor at George Washington university I'm John bachelor this is the John ...\n\nI think in many cases like this they they kind of weight but they will obviously will have all the\nTechnical reports which will come out from the investigation and they will definitely will be able to give light them they will be able to kind of give feedback whether they feel confident enough to put dust on out back on a you know and the next up no launch was the crew\nAnd it totally there are there a demand for use and to to to and from I ... have you seen that schedule changes in any fashion after this accident\nUm there was a slight change which might take place because in fact to Iowa nuclear say might actually I'd want the next launch a ... because uh because what's going on is there is right now the international space station is under stuff\nThere is only the people instead of six which has scheduled and that could have which is up there right now ... and ... the soil which they will use ... to ... which is ... the station\nAnd sort of sort of like a ... life both he's also has a sort of ... so he needs to come down the aisle actively someone at least in December and January [noise] so what they can see there are doing these to launch the next to\nOr less so it will kind of a but he plays the one which was was not able to wake up there and then we'll be able to relieve that can you which is they're on board and bringing them back a within that\nTimeframe or allow it required by the by the expectation date of that so he was which is All right now in orbit so it's a kind of a juggle of several missions ... several um uh several lunches at the same time so so I use that they might actually launch early as planned before\nDavid any chance they would make a decision to leave the space station without a crew and take the chance was on that what are you hearing about that\nEither\n... or a member of that before the launch that ... that's pretty which which they plan to launch lethal as early as they have the other rockets with unmanned payloads which was\nI mean the the satellites essentially all lined up to me that that is that the lights on one cargo ship to the station so those are the so that their decision to launch the crew will be based on a successful launches so does the vehicle [laughter]\nEven if they discover a as a program sores they bump into into ... and you as a ... ... from the beginning some point or otherwise\nThey have a choice essentially to bring in the ... which is on board the international space station right now back home and leave the station on land this is kind of last resort they\nDo not want to do this of course by the facial ... computers they can uh control the station by saying commands from the ground to the states have again it's a last resort but they can do it in the mirror of course meals PlayStation if you're a member or was that that I Am a on land for for\nA number of years some ... so it's possible it's not impossible at all\nI read on Russian space lab that there's another troubled rocket they're looking to restore to regular service that's the proton rocket or they're looking for many launches in twenty Nineteen are they satisfied that they've solved all the proton quality control issues [noise] yes\nI Believe said they uh they said that ... most of the problems and and they continue improve in a corner to come through which is kind of in the city wide\nProblem and that's probably not not even was one or two ... if you'd still be done from year to year and that needs to be in the study what was the white but they believe they're confident that they can fly again and in fact they had successful Bush before the permanent ones now that they don't have\nMany commercial customers now because most of them are shifted to ease a space sex or throughout space\nIn Europe so ah so the problem was to win back confidence so they lying and not sort of fades at all if finance the Russian missions which they hope to fly a due to most of the thousands Nineteen and hopefully as it is out of the other commercial customers south side of Russia will come back the broth on as well\nAnd it totally Zach he keeps the

the Austrian\nCitizens are totally unaware of how to fight a war they're barely trained and this is the first and then the draftees\nThey don't have enough weapons is generally a Jeffrey stand but they fight badly they punch shop in charge would ban in to watch insulating fire and it's a disaster in the heat and they were beaten by their own tactics and I said that correctly Jeffrey\n...

island and they start getting annihilated and the Serbian campaign and the Russian Campaign Nineteen fourteen and what's happening here in August in August September Nineteen fourteen they invade Serbia\nIs we've seen these troops even though they are technically either long service professionals or anything but and that's because\nThe Australian Gehring army was so\nNew ideas that it it it didn't keep the troops very long with the colors and then when they and they and they would furlough the troops frequently and or in other words instead of keeping them two or three years of constant service they would just send them off for six months back to their villages because they couldn't afford to pay them\nSo these guys were very lightly trained they had very little practice or with their rifles they had no practice infringing there'd been no combined arms practicing maneuvers where infantry practice with the artillery just sort of advanced with covering fire and deliver the artillery shoot them through enemy positions is was unheard of\nAnd so because these troops were so ah poorly trained and poorly equipped and also hard to leave because remember this is a ... army speaking\nA dozen different languages there is a German language of command eighty words that all recruits regardless of nationality need to know but you know realistically they don't really know them I mean you're taking uneducated peasants they probably heard these trends but they have a hard time remembering what they all mean\nAnd then the heat of battle the chaos about all these units completely come undone and you see total demoralization and suing against you know very light reverses where a whole unit will just turn around and retreat covering the ground with his weapons and

called the you know the ... you know birds with borrowed feathers because\nThey felt that they were camped out on Croatian territory Serbian Hungarian polish Ukrainian territory but what were the Asperger's they the the Serbs called them ... because they came from southern Germany\nAnd they thought it just a in a way that this south German dynasty that found it in the thirteenth century was still governing Serbs and Croats in polls and Ukrainians and checks they thought it completely\nObsolete and they have springs reviled the service for treating them that way with that kind of
