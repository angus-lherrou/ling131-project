that\nThe regimen and within that the battalion and within that the company is uh the protagonist cliff gates who has joined the Marines\nI'm not knowing exactly what it's about where it's coming from it's a Marine Corps that fought in China it's fought in\nHaiti in Cuba it's been part of the Mexican war but it doesn't have a big story to tell the American people so much so that when you first hear them it yes what's the marine corps Jemma very good even you congratulations and we begin\nIn February Nineteen Eighteen in France this is what they call the manure factor here we are case is young

second division twenty seven thousand five hundred I'm following the reporting\nOf James Carl Nelson Jim Nelson his new book I Will hold\nAnd our protagonist cliff case commands the Ninety six company that's part of the deployment of the overall six regimen but they are told\nThat they are going to hold the line and advance and in particular place where there's a hunting for us to his own aristocratic hunting for it's called the Bello would cage is given the role of advancing on a village Bora Shay\nAt this point Jim\nCases understanding moving into the wheat fields because that's what surrounding him\nYou make a special case that the Marines were completely out of date they were believing in a mass mock sketch tree and advancing in a line not taking into account that they were going up against machine guns and artillery\nOverpowering belief in overpowering rifle our I shouldn't use our twenty times but they believed in the rifle and they believed in marine marks on ship 'em [noise]\nSo they they a lot of different forces learn this little first world war it doesn't work that dancing in rows and be mowed down by machine guns\nIt's not a good way to to fight a battle [noise] um I Want you to the Bella would a close case was still it was a second lieutenant the company commander was Donald don't get 'em\nBut they decided they made a decision to attack fellow would which indeed was hunting area yeah the ...\nEr and stuff in there the Germans were coming south and then they were heading east there are thirty five miles from Paris so they were getting very close and they sent the second division in a to a fend them off and the first tour I was I Believe\nThe U.S twenty third regiment so they put them at the far eastern end of the line to block the road from many Germans come from that way and just by happenstance the Fort ... regiment was first amend the fifth regiment came in after\nLine in front of mellow would otherwise you might not have heard that the Marines um the regular ... got kind of a of shut out of the picture from that because it didn't really assault della with themselves anyway\nJohn harbor of James harbor to his ear for a brigade commander was certain that they were hardly any Germans in what he was just sort of it but in fact they\nHad infiltrated chase the French outright and built strong a machine gun physicians I'm waiting for the physicians all through it very rocky craggy place on June sixty Americans decided to attack it [noise]\nSo they sent the fifth regiment basically on the left in the morning to try to do that\nThan a general the movement assault was order for the afternoon\nAnd that was at a salt on the far right or he used to end of a line that the Ninety six company carried out on the ... village of ... about five o'clock in the afternoon and basically like you said that kind of spread out on line across the five hundred white yard a wide open field and attacked us\nVery powerful a German position apparatus many machine guns artillery a rifle man and a Cape leading his platoon was worth platoon and the men were literally bent over as if they walk into a rating store [noise]\nAnd as he has bent over a bullet playing up his helmet and knock them cold\nThat let this huge tend to get the helmet throughout the rest of the war um\nBut he ... he didn't even know how long he was out and he said his first impulse was to run away [laughter] so it's kind of unusual who's a very real character but because first battle really it was to his right they saw some of his men over there being and he made his way through a severe a rifle power in the machine gun fire to them\nAnd one of his men started pouring a wind from the canteen on the mood on his head that in case said hey you end up in my head give me a drink so he took a long drink of it [noise]\nFortified he picked up in a band in French rifle that led twenty men into brushed\nRyan twenty of um the fifty six men that ... up the platoon that started a gyms reporting thirty two casualties so twenty four reached village of note here at this point\nA surround there's no way back they can't go back to ... that they just keep continue to go forward they are mass before machine guns that overwhelm them they capture the village\nAnd yet at this point there is no good communication and they're missing their company commander Roberts and continues to ... to disappear I have a headline to supplement gems book because\nI it's great fun to read a book that this well researched and go and go to the New York times headline him or member now this is introducing the marine corps to the American people and nowhere in this story do they mention that the United States Marines to take these villages new advance by our men goes they head\nTowards the end bore shame stormed in a drive on six miles from enemy lots of very heavy each men get a German don't let him get you was the Victor slogan\nNothing stops aren't there rushed twenty five of them fight two hundred in towards the German debt free deepen places and then this from the story are captured German says he did not know that it was the Americans opposed to the Germans he thought the troops were British as they weren't English how much\nHe added that the German soldiers no longer hope to reach Paris all of them are sick of the war and he was glad he had been made prisoner\nSo the Marines get no noticed here Jim and that's part of your stories that the Marines' fight spectacularly in these massacres and yet or the army and pushing overall get all the headlines\n[noise] well in a way um I Would tweak that to say that actually uh they they did start getting a notice to the chagrin and anger of the army regular regular is the first division not not in the second the piece of so much but ah what happened was there was a correspondent prescribe a tribute and went in with uh the uh\nFloyd given the one who ... yes\nWent in through the we feel took a bullet me I knocked out and before he the advance you've been tipped off about the advance or get written a story that mentioned the Marines are pushing it lay down where the no units were to be identified\nThis is the Chicago Tribune is that what it was yeah yeah so one out on the\nWires bats story about marine storming below would and this kind of stuff and uh everybody thought given as was dead so it gets to the censors off as a person who's headquarters in Paris and he says well I'm a I'm going to let this through because it's the last thing I can do ... do you know see what it through that the Marines\nI wanted to rape victims that's why the a P ... story here doesn't make any mention of it because this is by Chicago I see yeah is that don't meet ad right\nAnd it it it made you know everybody but actually it was like the Marines were the only ones fight the war after that to a lot of people there was like you know they never really hurt but they captured the America's imagination let's\nTake them into the village themselves because what one of the aspects of gyms book that is always worrying that once they capture a mission once they complete their mission and capture a point it's going to get worse\nYou know because the German counterattack and in this instance while they park themselves in the village the Germans and start using mustard gas over these next days and\nThey are the mustard gas is especially bad in the villages June aids through a ... minute here that's when they just get rained upon by mustard gas and they don't retreat they they try to survive in their mouth and many don't make\nNo what happened was they were in the village and uh they were getting pretty well pounded by artillery ah and they were really worried about uh Germany counterattack [noise]\nUm there's a very vital point eastern in Belo ... from their any Americans attacking it was a real it was a strong point they needed a gas was not actually used in till later Kate spent several days with his men by the ... by the night of June six\nHe said you know he had like an entire regiment of people that are basically he held any town with a number of people who came in reinforcements um it was on the night of June thirteenth he's actually been pulled to the back lines and sat around and there's cops in trees basically there's a company and Seventy eighth company and they were spotted\nBy German a balloon is all day and write as they were getting their last speeded about midnight or all hell broke through a mustard gas a high explosive shells just rained down on them for about an hour\nAnd basically what it was all over the age would write home that his company with the phones are based it was just as a bloodbath I Will\nHold is the book were going on the worst battles they had Jim Nelson James cone Nelson is the author I'm John bachelor\nOnce again it's time for\nTo break free emails\nGreater yanked him living\nWe're doing with greater yanked him living is um we're promoting a nine county area in South Dakota and Nebraska you know we're looking at all\nWas the only way to moderate the speed at the same time you're faces being gashed my castor oil which they move used as oil business before had an aircraft engine oil existence and that led to nauseous and often played by diarrhea when you came back were freezing above ten thousand feet\nAnd you had a two role playing constantly\nAnd forth I get this feeling that you call it at one point you quote from one of the flyers so many of the left notes especially the dead ones there was like flying a gyroscope telescope all the time Eddie ... every moment out there that he was fighting the aircraft to Newport was tail heavy right it was he always had to adjust the cheapest\nHe knows he's going up to actually fight other aircraft the Germans had superior aircrafts the soccer aircraft or extremely superior to the Newport these were French belt but he never backs off the presses impresses until they give them a chance to fly with what becomes the Ninety ... however\nHe's still treated with disdain by his fellow officers by the others he's a sergeant right they never make him they don't make them in a lieutenant right of ways of flying starch and the other officers there's some of America's most famous families I think the uh the ... family dies in the aircraft\nPam Coolidge or all of these men come from a life that Eddie has no idea about yeah and they don't really accept him I Know him say eventually they do because he comes in but I never felt in China\nI mean the Germans do you look at the red beret and he was from up there it was a quite a wrinkle yes exactly from quite a thing so you're you're looking at the\nYou know these are the best and the brightest thrown out each other and then here's this kid from Columbus ohio or a car racer who has this incredible ability he is not the best shot he is not the best pilot\nBut if you combine shooting and piloting and being here he is the best hair and credible\nThere are companies we begin come at it combat as seriously in Nineteen Eighteen because the American army comes over snow coming over a hundred thousand a month\nAnd John spends that deal of time bay being very careful about the battlefield conditions certainly the construction of the American led army\nThat a person wants to throw in against the Germans and the last hundred days and much of the ferocious action of John in his book of your book John\nComes in the last in July August September of Nineteen Eighteen\nAnd I have to tell you is the leader is heartbreaking because what you're watching is young man who go into this guy's knowing they're going to die and they're coming up against a superior German air ... air force very superior to what is the flying circus\nFlying circus and it's an incredible thing started by Baron bon ... who ah painted his entire by play try playing\nScarlet red and everybody said no don't do that and you're just going to stand out and he said I Want to stand out to bring fear so everyone in the flying circus on his side painted their planes bright colors you imagine these guys going out and you talk about the bravery of it\nParachutes one example parachutes more invented right [noise]\nBut the but everybody until the Germans on the last six weeks of the war did not issue the Americans did not issue they're young flyers parachutes because they felt it would be the fetus\nAnd that the first ten of trouble a pilot would jump out of the airplane they couldn't have that it wasn't 'til after the war that they realized oh my gosh\nThat's such a terrible tragedy to lose people and you know who could have been safe with a parachute an Eddie ... saw a lot of his friends die that way it was just apoplectic about the bureaucracy and what they would do because these men were anything ... defeat us every day are\nFull ... always there's going to happen in may Nineteen Eighteen they separate from the signal corps they form and the first army air corps what exists or by July or a flying just bad which has a new aircraft it's very heavy call it a flying crank it has ...\n... is an eddy now rising through the ranks his kills are mounting but those\nThe other flyer died soft times say land and there's a lot of night Aaron tree going on between the two forces but there's mass murder being done\nThere is no disguising it this is not a happy ending\nIs climbing through the ranks because those ahead of them are dying dying they're pressuring airplanes are being shut down they're burning\nHe was fat I mean this was a little bit of luck for him right when he was Ninety four percent of the worst factor they're read where the the flying circus was he gets out with this with this air thing which was ... he'd been flying up in the air with it for a long time they couldn't figure it out and finally it even\nKnock him out and he went back for an operation meanwhile his all his comrades were just getting shot up but he was in the hospital the doctor said you're not you're you're going you know forget it\nThat wasn't in these plants have talk his way right around that and the first time he went back they hadn't fixed it I had it was excruciating and his ... he couldn't turn his buddy low anybody shut down an still did that and then he was back in the hospital they finally figured it out\nAt a law saying no you're going home you're going home you're going home an adequate have none of that\nJohn Ross endure encourage a pilot that he ... to the age of speed the mantle is the full life we need to tell some of the apple or at least ... the rest he ends the first war as the American hey let me come back after\nThe war and a as a hero and the
