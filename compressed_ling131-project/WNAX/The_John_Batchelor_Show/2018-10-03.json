Bob I remember you reported that some years ago I earn maybe a year ago that they were starting space program and they're looking to encourage investors to come to log some Bergen do exactly what we're witnessing now and I mentioned that this can be done in any country\nYou don't need a rocket to be part of the commercial space we go to U. A. E. which has another approach\nDraft an astronaut corps how they're doing\nWhat you see this it's an interesting way to compare the two last summer when he doesn't have a space program they just simply are trying to encourage investment dollars and let companies come and compete with everybody and invent new things in space\nWell what you eat the United Arab Emirates is doing is copying the Soviet Union and the United states with space program and so they're trying to think they're trying to that\nBy their ... their economy and bring in space the development but rather than doing it the ... greatest space program that that they're going to try to fly a government\nBuilt a probe to Mars and they announced that they're going to fly a citizen to space and they made a deal with the

had the Nassar and the bureaucrats in the United states slowed not slowed\nThe basics down they could've possibly offered this flight to them in to them and dead and important money to the U.S\n[noise] Russia and China the once upon a time wannabes of dominating big space have not signed an agreement Bob this was part of the conversation we've had these last year as Ron costs most\nIs a very famous very stabbed Bush did will be in the history books forever but it's out of money China and the other hand had troubles\nRecently and we'll talk about some of those ... and in doing something bold or making moves that given an opportunity to be fresh do you believe that this combination Russia and China will be successful\n[laughter] well I I I'll let me put it another way of the reason that Russia and China this week signed an agreement to establish some greater cooperation that space projects and specifically has to do with the manufacturing space vehicles and rocket engines and I'm quoting exploring the moon and teach space\nIs one of the main things is focused at well gosh China is building its own space station\nRussia wants to stay in space somehow and the choice that had up to now is to\nTo team up with NASA's boondoggle gateway Luna a lunar space station and they've been complaints by regardless and the guy in charge of Ross caused mostly just want to really deal with America's way these being dealt with\nBecause as a as a as like a junior partner and so they're going to he's going to be meeting with a NASA Administrator Jim Britain and sign on October tenth\nAnd I think these negotiations are part of the Russians very skillful negotiation tactics they're telling the United states and Nassar essentially that if they don't get a good deal and working with gateway they'll switch to the Chinese and the truth of the battery is\nHe's probably looking at gateway from a technical perspective and thinking you know this really isn't going to serve us very well all the Chinese are building a space station maybe we can team up with them and put new modules on their station\nIt'd be easier and less of a a costly and\nPossibly more practical so this is a perfect example of that what I Will tell you here is that um the NASA has trouble building anything they can't do that costs to just takes too much money and time and so they get far income countries to come in here and build parts for them\nI'm much of the fence was built by Russia and Europe and Japan or when it comes to get with the same kind of thing or Ryan they couldn't build a service module for that capsule Orion data get Europe to do it\nAnd so that desperate to get partners in the gateway Luna orbiting station and the Russians couldn't a threatened to pull out I expect that some management to actually back stab to us in any negotiations with Russia they'd rather than defend\nUs interest I expect them to be focusing on trying to guarantee Russia participation even if the deal might cripple American burgeoning American\nBurgeoning private American space industry that I really touching that happened in the past it happened with diet thefts and I really expect to see it again here Russia is playing a good heart ballgame that's what I Would tell you\nI Would warn the Russians that the Chinese will steal everything including your play do so do not leave anything on attended a Bob the rush of the Chinese just deal that's like you know\nThey do with the kind of remember that their space station and they kept so every man's carry my man freighters it's all based on Russian designs\nThat are based on staff and if they get into Ross costs most they'll reproduce it now the Chinese are doing small ... ... is that a positive\n[laughter] well it's always about it from a from a space exploration prevent a point of view down the road and they're having more innovation and more ideas but another one of their claim to be private companies called X space\nLaunched last week a small sect into off it using a solid fuel rocket I'm\nThis is the third of these companies launching small ... ex spaces this one one space is another and I space is the third and they're all using solid rockets to put up law small small fast and they're all very closely doing work for the Chinese\n... solid rock hard Chinese military I don't think so they're all military everywhere I think\nAbsolutely right that the the the military here though is using um Chinese way of allowing private investment poured in its so called independently run companies\nTo build these for them but there's no doubt they are wholly owned and controlled by the military of the Chinese got there's no doubt in my mind about that I Would like to pack up the one thing you said about the Russian stealing\nFrom the Chinese are Chinese companies to Russia to rush the Chinese are\nNot going to steal much from the Russians anymore because they've done it all the Chinese have far better equipment

yes and they are absolutely soaked in these ideas of of Russia as a whole new nation as a messianic nation\nI'm On the ... from the Bible and orthodox tradition they're also using many a protecting ideas that are circulating some from the middle ages which a profit showing how I'm a great emperor or ...\nAh is destined to liberate the middle east to destroy a cookie I I Am so that Russia they support is a it is a Mets fan and make a nation\nIdeas like that and not just found among you know a few excellent peasants that's what a mainstream intellectual think air Russia which at this time is going through one of the great religious revival of the twentieth century seemed to mention that can uh like what we know he's going to happen with big revolution\nBut the Russians it goes to war in Nineteen fourteen years aren't religious Christian\nNation and its concept perhaps as a you know any nation that has existed since the middle ages\nWhat striking about Philips a presentation is that we've named these Christian nations Britain\nFrance Germany and Russia but they pull in the colonies who are Christian or are Christian icing the ... the colonies of Africa also they pull in\nCollege said that the Ottoman Empire eventually coming in on the German side and that is the end of the caliphate that's the end of the police or as the Ottoman Empire is fractured in divvied up afterwards\nSo the language of crusade has paradoxes that's the way I can express to fill up certainly the current state of uh the crusade\nOf uh the Christian churches would have been a sharp odds with the crusade of the Ottoman sort of the way the Ottoman regarded crusading did the Ottoman have conflict with Germans when they came in on the side of the central power because the Germans were using crusader language [noise] you\nKnow partly because the the the ticks themselves are also desperate at this point to avoid being a partition to avoid having the nation are destroyed their delighted to have the uh the uh the Germans\nAre there to protect in the system but the British must be very very careful not to say that a lot of food because at this point the British Empire is the world's largest Muslim empire a it controls the world's largest Muslim population the British don't want those people going into revolt\nSo they have to work very hard to stop this natural urge people to say\nYou know we we have taken Jerusalem this is a this is the final crusade\nA crusade to language is very dangerous feet the Germans managed to keep it under wraps ah the the British we the gum\nAnd they they fight going on in that campaign until the end and the crusade ends in Nineteen Eighteen with put I regard it's one of the great ironies with the war the British when the great victory in the middle east against the Turks ... where else Armageddon\nYeah oh for ... do the strikers Armageddon\nA yes will touch on Allen B will get Alan ... entry into Jerusalem just one more detail Austria program ... we call it also Hungary but it was in fact a blending of tribes in groups all jammed together it didn't much work it had been\nFalling apart under friends do that for about several decades now but in your book I learned that the Russians managed to come up with a way of denouncing\nThe ... there's a ... there is a drawing of Russian poster showing what looks to be the devil with seven had power the Russians denouncing after all the parts were Catholics ... Roman Catholics right\nOn the right to way if you're from unorthodox point of view than uh the uh the heretic the yeah the Catholic or a a a deadly western enemy\nAnd when I came across a picture of the person who are trying to get to know what it was it just seemed to be a picture of a ... with multiple heads but when you ... if you look at it you see that it's um amongst with pets and the way they've created Germany and Austria\nIs they've taken the individual men in the states like cooking but very the kings facts me and made each your head\nAnd they want to get to the magic number seven on the uh the reason for that it's very simple because they've read that book of revelation they know that one of the signs of the apocalypse one of the signs of the end times\nWill be the rise of this great set and had to ... on the Russians are saying well here it is it's in the central part of it was it in Germany and Austria\nAnd no matter ... of violence we have to do to geography we're going to turn Germany and Austria into a seven headed a beef stew Soviet Jews all the uh uh the devil the beast a I'm a pervasive through the\nWall and there's a conflict that is a is every chapter of Phillips' book this is it is this is the fight between Christian nation yes the caliphate is at the edge but it's chiefly\nProtestant versus Catholic versus Catholic versus orthodox and they struggle Philip what I learned from you everyone was confused by how it is they can define the other guy as the anti Christ right [noise]\nRight so the only way Christians compact Christians in that way\nIs if they can present the enemy as being less than a Christian or anti Christian so one country have to look at another one I think well they may appear to be Christian but in fact they are so evil they're so bad that proves how hypocritical they are\nOn the even contributes to a making them even more a more die folic so if you can figure another Christian denomination that's good\nIf you can say that they're doing something very bad by along with non Christians and ... that's very powerful but the ... the enemy may seem to be Christian in fact not just anti Christian with a small way they are anti Christ lead\nLaunch a turn to how they prove the Germans were wrong right away from Catholic friend his point of view of the ... holy war Philip Jenkins is the author I'm John bachelor [noise]\nYour chance in a brand new vote if one is as close as participating New England for dealer stopping what's your name in the box to cross your fingers your name will be drawn as one of them are to be Seventy qualifiers you enter next live broadcast where you can register when\nOld tired old problem with trying to police this this drug trafficking which is that they make a lot of money in this business and what do they use that money for they buy weapons they recruit soldiers\nAnd they corrupt and bribe a law enforcement and institutions inside the country Colombia's courts are very much corrupted by drug money\nAnd this is just an example I mean the the special piece court was supposed to be you know the one where would interview them and find out what their crimes were and write them all down and this is going to be a way to sort of have a cleansing a spiritual cleansing of the country because everything would be out in the open and the criminals would have confessed\nBut it turns out that there's already corruption inside the Peace Corps they're officials inside the peace court that had been cooking up a false ... Martinez described it and and fraudulent testimony\nIn order to help\nFor you know these FARC members basically escape and and and go off and do whatever they want to do so the court is corrupted\nAnd you know he says that he is going to prosecute this particular um series of people that he caught if the court can be corrupted like that it will be corrupted again and again and again it will be very hard to keep up with it\nAnd you know one of my big problems with this court in general is that why should you have a parallel court system\nWhy shouldn't you say to somebody if you kill somebody over there you have to go to jail for Fifteen Years but if you're a card carrying member of the FARC and you killed somebody or killed five people all you have to do is come and tell us and needed to go free creating a parallel and justice system is fraught with problems\nAnd on now you have another layer of problems on top of that which is the parent corruption of the court\nThe report you have from the southern district of New York seems important here Mary because we care about the US's participation over the years in solving Colombia's prices\nYou report that two members of the FARC who were due to take beach in Congress are\nNo part of an accusation by in New York in the southern district of New York\nFor conspiring to import ... tons of cocaine do some Greek\nAnd Marlin marine oh who's the nephew of an important negotiator for the event\nOf group seems married who seems incredibly persuasive\nBecause it's got the attention of the new State Department that we that we signed on to an agreement that it didn't complete violation of our laws not of not only just Colombia's laws and the security of the of the new world but our laws of our own were burdening are prosecutors\nWhile you know I laugh when you say that because there were so many red flags before this thing was signed but the Obama administration John Kerry Bernie ... errands and we're all you know just been to on\nBernie errands and was the representative is that it doesn't speak\nWho doesn't speak Spanish I mean who knows what he was doing sit around and then I don't know [laughter] but um you know that this was all very apparent but they were bent on having this because they thought that it would be a legacy item just like opening\nTons of cocaine as a legacy item I well\nNow you're touching on what the ... he said you know our our is the U.S now aware of this what the us away is aware of\nIs that the area of of ah Columbia that is used for cocoa crawling any increase in a cocaine production has shot up\nAnd um you know now or as I said in my column I mean in many ways we're starting over again a president ...\nHad basically pacify many of the rural regions of the country because he he returned the presence of the state to those areas\nPresident Santos pulled back from that he he basically gave an olive branch to you know all these different criminal groups while he was having this negotiation in Havana and he basically told them you know what we're not going to hold anybody accountable so what do you think the consequences of that are going to be people are going to say well crime pace\nAnd why why should I be sitting here earning minimum wage when I can be ... could be in the ...\nAnd the other thing is that you know if you get these old guys who were the um you know you you mentioned the two that are we looking\nFor a recon marine but the nephew of Marquette right exactly and\nHe's disappeared these older guys you know they have all the money they want that backed away and you know offshore bank accounts and so forth so they're all fat\nAnd what they want to do is coming from a cold and being able to put their feet up and act like politicians with this money\nBut you can bet that there are a whole bunch of you know sort of mid level managers in this business who are going to say hey wait a minute I could be the next ...\nAnd that's why so many of these guys are returning the has the money is in the cocaine\nAnd in the little businesses tend to think that you're going to sit down in Nevada also does it really was carve out an amnesty for these old guys\nWho have enough money and are kind of tired of the foot rod and the jungle and want to come in and he didn't do anything about it actually changing dynamics of what makes the FARC of violent\nYou know a drug trafficking organization\nJohn Kerry a President Santos Bernard errands and Brock Obama\nHave any of them commented on this district ... southern district of New York issue or the fact that the violence is increasing in Colombia or the fact is that the Havana negotiation in twenty sixteen is now demonstrated to be in tatters have commented marry well\nNot to my knowledge I mean I Know that those said publicly that if these guys had violated that they um their pledge not to being cocaine trafficking\nAfter November two thousand six ten that yes they should be arrested and I think he was even in favor of the extradition\nUm but other than that basically apologist for the FARC agreement are saying well the problem is the government because the government has it you know bill that nice housing for these people and they have and uh you know we integrated them into ...\nMarried really that they were supposed to you that the\nGovernment hasn't delivered on its side\nOf you don't give us a gym so we go back to coax smuggling that\nWell maybe it's not quite gymnasiums although they did ask for that but they claim that you know they they they don't have they they vision one thing about what they would get to sort of be welcome back in society and the government is capable of giving them something else what a surprise\nMary and it says you already of the
