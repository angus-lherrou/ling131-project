October\nTwenty four hours to get more college the Saratoga Springs New York\nShe'll probably will be debating with Kirsten Gillibrand the sitting senator right now from the Democratic party\nA show a very good evening to thank you for this and I'm Glad you're going to have an opportunity for debate\nA this is a New York that is deeply blue you are with the Republican camp so you're always the challenger\nWhat is it that you will make available to the people of New York on Sunday October twenty first on your presentation that they need to know about what you want to do for New York grieving to show\nOh John thank you it is wonderful to be here at yes I think that New Yorkers need an an alternative they need somebody who is going to put New York first think about New York and health in New York not my challenger who is on everybody's top ten list for running for president\nOn it is outrageous a million people have left New York since the last census which isn't any great surprise when property taxes are the highest in New York and uh by county than they are any other state\nUm it's crazy and us tax bill really hurt high tax states like my my in my state of New York and your state of Connecticut quite a bit because there wasn't anybody there fighting\nFor this elimination assaulted action which we lost cold turkey and then with a ten thousand dollar cap so when I go to Washington I Will increase that cap and most importantly I Will bring back the money that New York is sending a Washington it was forty eight\nBillion dollars last year and bring them back to New York so we can lower everyone's property\nTaxes I completely agree with your show so I'm going to press on on this issue\nWhat you're saying is so common sense of ... and your campaigning against the Democratic machine that counts on higher and higher and higher taxes what do you hear on the trail from New Yorkers who pay the taxes are they aware of how out of debt and your kids with their ... with other states\nWell sadly they are aware and they are proving it with their feet I mean I'm constantly traveling around the state and I hear the exact same thing from person after person which is their kids no longer live in New York because they couldn't get a job in New York\nSo now they're kids live in Florida or Texas so their grandkids now live in Florida or Texas and they're like well we're retired so we thought we should move so we can be close to the grandkids but they can't move because they can't sell their house and their entire network is in their house\nSo we've got to bring

you you are trying to get on the New York stock exchange traded in I Believe that ts acts\nAs well you have uranium mines and you also produce the navy but I Want to concentrate on the uranium mines because this is a story from the twentieth century\nWhere are your mind and where are your production facilities right now in America and how much are they producing of what the United States needs for uranium good evening to you mark\nYeah a good thing to you John um I mean we have a number of projects that are located and mainly in the four corners region of the United states but we have projects from the state of Wyoming or down south through Colorado I'm Utah Arizona New Mexico into Texas\nSo right now we have a three production centers that are actually producing a bunny or your am a and two of those are are producing as we speak\nThat are nickels ranch I in Wyoming a ... white may say in Utah and also ... in Texas\nHe has the only one that's on standby is all tomatoes in Texas\nAnd you have uranium mines around these production facilities so how does it physically work I've never visited the uranium mine you mine and new truck and where does it go\nWell we we we have um the the three production centers are are are have ... different is that a couple of ways that we have conventional facilities where you actually physically mine drilling blast the the the or\nI'm transported to the processing facility in this case is a white Mason meal where it's conventionally posts asked um which is crushing grinding and chemical extracting uranium or of an ATM\nWithin our project in Wyoming and in Texas are called is set to recovery and it's such a recovery is where you actually\nDissolve the uranium in place in the ground you actually don't physically mind that so so there there are two different methodologies and about half the uranium the United states or in in in the world actually is mind by both methods so about fifty percent is either conventional or in such a recovery\nAnd your company's doing very well and people can participate but there's a but the body as how much does the United states need in uranium and how much does the U.S produce and where do we get it\nYeah well the um United States the largest consumer uranium in the world are between power generation which was about twenty percent of our electric power in the United states\nAnd then you have the nuclear navy um my a calculation\nWe consume about one third of the poll uranium consumed in in the world\nUm but but just for power generation alone because the actual use for the military is classified\nUm but for power generation alone we consume about fifty million pounds of uranium per year for power generation now currently a worldly mining a a ... percent of our requirements which is a shocking shortfall\nBecause arrested that's coming in from imports from both our allies but also from a number of a former or a communist countries like Russia or cause Exxon or its allies and um it was ... on it even China so um\nThat is why we filed a section two thirty to petition to limit a imports of uranium primarily from uh allies of the former Soviet Union\nLet me restate that if I understand this doesn't sound commonsense ago we're importing uranium we need for our nuclear plants and our nuclear fleet we're importing from Russia and from China\nOr inlet changed that tells me our supply chain is in the hands of our follows correct\n[noise] well yeah I mean that's that's the point of our petition is is the United states the United states as the largest consumer of uranium in the world um is is are we ready to\nTurn over the reins to um to those countries you know I I I don't\nKnow the answer is no more we're not we're not mark you're not asking hard questions okay fine but before we we look into your a conversation with the Trump Administration department of commerce as to what we'd have to say as a missed pricing of uranium out what is the ... what do we use it for\n... is is primarily used as an hour away I'm for steel hardening but it is also currently getting additional I'm a demands on it from a navy employee batteries for renewable energy storage\nAnd you ... at the white may ... and a white Mesa mail is that where you process it\nWell yeah we we sit there and we're starting to recover of an ATM uh we'll start in ... in November of this year to start a producing the date him again we we last produce that avium in two thousand Thirteen [noise]\nAh we actually mine the ore are in the surrounding mines and the district and we transfer by truck as I mentioned earlier a but this initial campaign were actually recovering the navy and that is in solution ... facilities that are holding pond so we're very excited about this\nIs the demand for an ATM climbing\n[noise] ah the demand is climbing a quite substantially probably six seven percent per year\nAnd um the price of an ATM has increased from\nA brown four five six dollars per pound to three years ago up to north of twenty dollars per pound so um it's you hear a lot of talk about the battery elements hum metals like lithium graphite cobalt woven ATM\nA is sort of the next in the ... when it comes from an energy renewable energy storage a type of metal\nUh but still at this day are currently the largest consumption is for our voice and and ah there's currently a news owning a in China this requiring the rebar or to be a certain ... strength and it's very difficult to achieve that\nWithout using the atrium so there's a new source of demand which is the rebar and the way into batteries\nBack to your conversation with the Trump Administration about uranium we need much more uranium than the United states is now producing your the number one producer of uranium in the country so what can be done what is the department of commerce I'm looking into what does the investigation tell us what\nWe we we follow the petition and and we asked for two things we asked for a quota now the terror of quota\nThat United States should produce at least twenty five percent of the requirements are from domestic sources to allow enough critical mass so that we actually have a uranium mining industry sustainable in the United states\nWe also asked for by American uranium\nAnd and you know the the administration has his middle by American uh in the first place so that fits in nicely with with our request so\nUh but it's just gets a quota and it's a by American uranium and the key here is to maintain a healthy\nA front into the fuel cycle that does not put us dependent on a ... for a source of uranium primarily from these uh uh you know countries that are associated with former Soviet Union\nAnd mark we just we have less than a minute here uh do do our photos China and Russia did they subsidize their uranium industry in order to out compete\nWith enough say do I mean the the Russia and China and they have national programs that support their nuclear fuel cycle and the United say she used to but it no longer has that so that's why it's so important\nRight now because if if if we allow the nuclear fuel cycle to completely go way and the United states uh countries like Russia and China are not going to lead there's go way they're going to continue to fast forward\n... is the c._e._o. of energy fuels ... traded publicly more to the point the Trump Administration has the conversation started about how it is that we're buying uranium from Russia and China\nI'm John bachelor this is the John bachelor show\nYour chance in a brand new one is as close as participating in Oakland for dealer stopping what's your name in the box cross your fingers your name will be drawn as one of our fifty seven she qualifiers you enter next live broadcast where you can read you certainly\nThat's actually an honorable woman but Borman was involved in his negotiations he didn't want to create a named after him\nBut a whole board that crater was the one he peed on when he was navigating and firing engines\nAnd the other crater they named was Anders earth rise to the bigger crater in the earth rise image and that was to honor the earth rise image itself that he'd talk at a third or create a third feature on the moon was officially named mounted Maryland is is a mountain that\nThe Jim Lovell pick named it after his wife because it's a mountain that is a key landmark for the Apollo eleven landing\nAnd he named it on his own and they have finally officially recognized that this kind of a is a ... a a correct the injustice of decades ago where they didn't name things as he\n... as the astronauts picked a A R U is is a power game and they like to control the names of every Boulder in the universe and they don't really have that right and eventually that's going to dissolve away people in space will use the names that he's astronaut picked without question\nBased exit Vandenberg why Bob what what are they need Vandenberg for\nWhile they need to space what's Vandenberg standing mother went to space sports but they need Vandenberg right now is because you really cannot do solo synchronous all these orbits around the polls from Kennedy because you'd have to fly over\nPopulated territory and the west coast space port has been used by ... literally for half century by the military and private enterprise to get satellites into a polo or that\nAnd so now SpaceX has been flying out of ... for years but this past weekend they had that first successful launch from Vandenberg\nBut when they landed the first stage on land at Vandenberg they built a land landing site literally right next to the launch pad literally within sight within fifty four hundred like two hundred yards of it and they brought that uh that first stage back it was blocked by first date which is the first\nThat that finally to ration their whole this is the goal if they get it to land right next to the launch pad they can turn it around and maybe launch within twenty four hours that's their goal and so they had that success it's part of the ... and you know the races space X keeps moving forward job it's a it's a sign for the future\nNot a delay at the last one of the things seem familiar [laughter] it's\nUnless story well there's a there's an insight story that is not confirmed yet that I Want to add to this last year Congress gave Nasser extra money to fly extra missions of an interim upper stage for Estelle essay would not produce as much a pass powerful rocket\nBut it would allow them to fly a few missions they needed to fly a ...\nBefore before they had the final iteration out the most powerful upper stage well it appears now they're slowing down development on that at upper stage that\nFinal upper stage and they're putting more money and the scheduling low launches we the interim upper stage which isn't as powerful and it there is even hands that they are going to discontinue work on that more powerful upper stage\nThis is only after maybe five years of work on that more powerful upper stage spending lots and lots of money and they've just decided that can't afford to build it so they'll go with the cheap a small stage [laughter]\nDuring this so I end the ... put this up on behind the black and they called the vice president and program manager of space launch system for Boeing and he makes this statement\nI'm a there has been a slow down on the exploration upper stage work he also said that uh\nWe under estimated quote the timeframe involved somewhat and I call that probably the biggest understatement ever in the universe because SOS has been basically under construction since ... for in some iteration or another and it's not going to launch its first manned mission until\nTwenty twenty three and it won't even be the most powerful rocket\nSo we have a commercial crew news as well Bob is this also disappointing\nDisappointing but it's not as a absurd\nBut this week released an updated scheduled for the dragon install lying a test flights these are the cap privately built capsules to bring people die assessed and that meant stay sex headed the way it's first manned test flight until June ... they didn't\nGet the ... the time between the two missions is the same show it was just because the schedule essentially at I assessed they had a delay it and a bowling schedule pretty much stays the same so there's been a slight delay that won't be any commercial crew launches this year but with that right now it looks very clear that they're going to all be happening next year\nI'm a ... says we're now going to be giving updates on schedule on a much more frequent basis because we're really affirming things up for example the Boeing flights they give very rough uh proximate\nPeriods like mid twenties Nineteen denouncing clearly the first amendment in March twenty Nineteen and the first flight manned flight in August twenty Nineteen so they really from the schedules up we should look at the basics first unmanned in January Boeing's first unmanned in March\nA space sex first manned in June and then bowling manned in August every other month dislike the Gemini program back in the Nineteen sixties it'll be very exciting\nThis year just tick off the base for had corner so we have two different directions Bob what how they're going to settle this is talk of war team that's going to show up and\nTurf war within a the bureaucracy um you know Trump is pushing for a new space for us and so the military bureaucracy is putting forth all kinds of ... about what they should do [noise] um\nI'm not sure even plan is a good while on both of the one of them from the agency from the military itself suggests creating an agency that they say is smaller and will be more lean Mike Griffin who is for them and that sort of knew straight who's now been\nPut into a secretary of defense for research and engineering Mike\n... yes and he was basically fit into the space area it's he's supposed to be there to deal with military space he's proposing a different idea which would create a new space agency for the military with the staff of a hundred and twelve people\nAnd I have to say when reading just initial report it seemed like his was more bloated than the other I'm not sure which is right I'm the one thing that Griffin was doing that the military\nProposed hair foreigners that Gary Heather Wilson now as well to me\nThat she's in charge so Griffin was pushing more the trip to trends transition the military to using private commercial assets rather than building that's all and um [noise]\nBut his apparent love to build his own empire here at my work against that go I'm not sure which works I I once again my real reservations about the space forces that I'm worried it's going to just turn into a a big bureaucracy that won't really accomplish very much they just simply need to consolidate the offs and\nBob you're not thinking about we need our space uniforms we need patches of merchandise we need all the things you're trying to bypass Bob it's Washington they only build empires that's what they do\nI Know this is the tragedy that's why I have reservations about the whole idea I'm not sure they're going to ... the people who work in Washington to my mind the bureaucrats they're all very little interest in in the national interest nowadays the only thing they seem to be interested in it appears to me is their own agency interests\nAnd they read as a national interest can go to Bob Bob\nI have to get that uniform and the patch and so if they need to build an empire to get to it All right fine we go now to China [noise] because there's news on Chang eat for this is the next lunar is this the far side of the moon Landrieu yes\nThis is the land that's going to go on the far\nSide of the moon and the schedule is now tentatively a pretty firmly tentatively that that that sounds weird sometime in December the key is that they've got three\nLaunches for the same space sport to do other things prior to it and if anything goes wrong in any of those launches that will delayed Chang eat for but right now they're set\nTo land on the far side of the mood some launched sometime in December and that will ... some very shortly thereafter there's a lot of other information including details about the

first war this teaches Steven questions greatest movie and the second war or they don't have motorcycles but they have all the other tool so let's let's be introduced to the calf wholesome and in is the super camp under construction\nA that is going to come up in the fall of Seventeen but before that our heroes or move through a series of Pam's I've checked off the ones you spend time with Neal\nFarms that seems to be a swamp a ... a crop field is crude a onus broke out ... ... broke his crude bad cold burgers crude so these camps for a variety there was not one standard camp they were white rap requisition ing um villages to make camps out of the\nYeah they were ... requisition villages their records wrecked positioning a former barracks um sometimes work camps that\nUh for instance farms that which was in the middle the swamp\nOr whatever they could get their hands on in order to house these prisoners and some of these places particularly for the enlisted ranks we're roughly cobbled together essentially just some fences and some um rudimentary hot but for the officers there was this certain requirements that they deserve to I'm\nA better housing better conditions and so for the large part you find that uh they were housed in Austin and broke for instance which was a of a former hotel or clouds dial because well\nCamps that were closest to the ... the Netherlands border holiday holiday is the free zone you get to Holland you're out of the war craft field is very close within walking distance I say a couple of nights just sold over his close ... close and our heroes spend time there and make breaks routinely back breaks\nRoutinely make break David Gray um makes a break from ... failed he spoke German fluently he had a some other officers are helped him a disguise himself as a German officer and a German uniform and one\nMorning he just walked to the gates for how to forge past the good morning to the to the guards and then walked himself straight out of the out of the game\nThe challenge to get to the border means that you're passing through uh the German population and with border guards I think he said they go to the border with Hollande has three hundred and fifty miles it did have guards but not that not guard towers not wire\nCorrect I mean the the the the border with Hollande was was very with many things sometimes there were fences and guards other times the topography what the defense alone and so you really had to target where you were going to go to Carl where you were going to cross\nThe aisle gathering of our heroes is a happenstance\nBecause they're moved around some times\nBecause of inspections now let's go to ... and ... and is constructed\nBecause all of these rascals have not been contained by the various levels of camps Holtzman and is given to want a twin brothers and we need to introduce the villain here Niemeyer what do we need to know about Niemeyer at ... and his brother and he might well\nI'm currently Meyer who was the a combination of Holtzman was an absolute borscht tyrant a he was called the cat he was called the road by by the British um the number of ... you could not count he was\nBorn in Germany hum as freshmen officers spent some time about Seventeen years in the United states are doing any number of things are a billion make or a bartender\nA Niemeyer was also an inveterate liar so he was a spy he was brought down um\nYou know served on the front was a hero he was very many things but what he was most of all a was a tyrant a he was a cruel a commandant and when you walked into a whole minute he pointed at your chest and said you will never escape\nThis camp ... dependent as what we would translate in the twentieth century as a war criminal and uh his conduct is a brutal butts exceptionally brutal for the first for this was not routine what we've come to accept us German behavior did not exist yet\nCorrect I mean most of these officers a day to grab for instance when he left gray field he went all the way to the border he mistook one town for another and was recaptured he was brought back\nHe was sentenced the isolation but but that was some of the punishment and ... I mean isolation was no joy a but it wasn't the kind of\nA brutal execution that you would would have faced in in the next war these officers were were brought back punished quietly and then return to general population\nUltimate ah the gathering of the heroes it's it it's constructed in there too large buildings which they called block a and block be and then they put a special fence around it and what ... what's the area where whole than it is what's around it\nWell the area around Holtzman and is it sort of low hills I'm farms\nAnd they place that it was formerly a barracks a cabaret embarrassed and then what they did was they constructed basically Britain out of that so\nIt's kinda like a Russian nesting dolls it was a prison inside a prison instead of prison and there was a high exterior wall than an interior high barbed wire fence wall a dead man zone and then yet another fence so you had to basically jumped those three fences if you were going to get yourself\nFreedom how many German soldiers were occupied and guarding the five hundred six hundred a ... there were\nRoughly a depending on what time of of of the season between Seventy five hundred\nSeventy five and a hundred and that was part of the challenge to tie those guards down and to strengthen the resources of the Germans while mean time back on the western front this is the period between Nineteen Seventeen when Russia leaves the war and looting door\nA will start to move those divisions from the east entirely to the west to ... to launch the final operation to win the war in the spring of Nineteen Eighteen so the Germans are in good stead at this point [noise]\nUh the British and the Canadians than uh the Americans have just come into the war in April but they're ... they had not move the ATF to France yeah it's a it's an root for the Germans are in a very good morale and the Brits have reason to be discouraged\nYeah I mean I imagine if you were a a a POW in hopes men that you had very little information on what was going on in the war or what you received was largely from the Germans and they had propaganda newspapers\nFrom your perspective the war I'm In spring of Nineteen Eighteen would soon be over and the Germans would win and you would be in in a very a terribly let's get outta here the escape\nArtists like Neal basketball I'm John bachelor this is the job ...\nYour

the point I'm trying to make in the book is that the second ...\nHe's perhaps more important than the first Nineteen fourteen Eighteen in really destroying the foundations of empire because they want the Japanese do in a way that doesn't happen in the ... what the Japanese do in Nineteen forty one forty two is exposed the limits of white rule\nIn Asia because of that dramatic comb quit so the Philippines Singapore laugh and so on we showed that the apparently so powerful omnipotent white men\nDo not have in the end that kind of power but that isn't so clear even in the Nineteen thirties\nI'm Glad you mentioned Japan because that comes back to ... large orange and climbing so ah and there's a scene a repeated often ... mentioned of even Wilson coming in and seeing the three leaders of state on their\nHands and knees over large map drawing up the world and you just picture that now with all these contradictions Wilson gives them\nThe wonderful quote in your book is that he gives into the dirty past of empires and make concessions I Want to go to two of them particularly one is France and Britain make a deal\nAbout giving Syria to the French while the British makeup this new country called Iraq out of three provinces of the Ottoman Empire and at the same time draw trans Jordan we know what that will end and and the war is continuing\nAnd the other aspect is that lord cars on this wonderful quote in your book David Lord ... person tells the cabinet in Nineteen Nineteen the great power we have to most to fear in the future as friends I Know it's impossible it's only a hundred years later\nBut I asked this question of a professor of international relations was the British or the English fear and anxiety in competition with the French\nDid that Dr Clemens so and George and lord George to divide the world up especially brutally was that was that the was that the colonel or of vis a vis map that they drop with Wilson\nI think that if we put ourselves back in the ... the mindset of the time\nNobody in Nineteen fourteen eighty nine you know be Nineteen fourteen imagines ... will go on to Nineteen Eighteen nobody imagines that he's going to have the massive consequences of fall out that it's going to have people make a policy as they go along they make how war aims as they get along\nAs the war progress is British and French war aims become more expensive particularly as they can see the possibility that opening up the Ottoman Empire begins to fall apart what you're describing in a sense he's actually a more visceral Anglo French relationship which is that\nThe British have full fringe much more in his day for the gym and\nUm and the the the idea of the on the tone to Cody out the relationship the lines between France and England\nIn some ways is abnormal uh the ... an abnormal relationship in the ... compared to the one\nThat traditionally the British and French have had so it's almost like once the once the war against Germany's over the British and the French stop bickering ... for again this time over this new the new possibilities in the middle east\nAnd we're still bickering over those possible to the other one is the Japanese they are allied with the British the English during the war against Germany and at the end they're rewarded with ... what is that and what does that lead to in China\nWell the the um the Japanese get and they pick up quite dramatically in the first few months all ... all the concessions that commercial concessions and uh uh colonies and so on that the Germans had had in Asia\nAnd they do that um the mostly Chinese Tara Tracy I'm at the time when China is still really weak\nAnd vulnerable and walks happens is that the the peace conference parrot a racket ... Japan's um acquisitions\nAnd this causes an outcry\nA wellspring of Chinese nationalism in the ... century it in the cycle made for movement that may for Nineteen Nineteen which is the day of protest when\nThe the concessions to Japan become no in China and this is an issue that has even the present day government in China still refer to as a ... ... let's test of of Chinese nationalism\nI Want to I Want to include the Americans here as well because America likes to say it doesn't have an empire but it does kind of did at the time\nIt turns into the only a force to offset the Japanese in the Pacific quickly they turn to a uh disarmament conferences naval disarmament Nineteen Twenty one Nineteen forty seven Nineteen thirty one Nineteen thirty three\nBut all the time the Japanese perceive themselves as being disdain by the Americans that drive the Japanese militaristic\nPolicy does I mean one of the things we've been talking about he's an haven't we use the word is race there is a profound sense of racial difference that\nI have a war and peace making um uh the thing that India is not white at the same level as an ally compared with Australia New Zealand for the British\nThat Japan he's okay it's at the top table in some respects the Paris Peace conference body these regarded as different because of the race and race it the the the cleaned\nUp old elephant in the room that's going to become noisy and noise here the twin to think ...\nRaces also of blindness for Wilson ... does that show a professor in the notes about Versace Wilson's inability to get outside of his Virginia race racial orientation\n[noise] yes I mean Wilson is he's a man who speak in the most powerful and compelling and and emotional about basic he's he's all self determination rights and democracy\nBut has a real problem with the implications of that time he's not comfortable with a women having the vote he's\nNot a comfortable with um the the the whole idea of a multi racial equality of racial equality of civil rights and so on um he's the man all his time and also men I think who is\nWho has a a huge capacity to being ... by his and sound bite the light he's somebody who who told\n... and then one would think late they talk out loud and ... have to keep as to catch up uh in terms of policy with the consequences if the director ... state Lansing is particularly frustrated that way will will\nWill make big rhetorical statements and then it's very hard to actually work out well that should meet intensive told us that\nI'm speaking with David rentals his new book it's a long shot of the legacies of the great more on the twentieth century when we come back civilization\nDidn't survive I'm John bachelor this is the John ...\nBalance of nature's fruits and veggies in a capsule\nI care wonderful in a while ago I was walking and find that's fine with me and I don't know what happened I had the after effects of that in my hand and my leg and I noticed that I ...
