think it's not everybody in Texas ... that's for sure\nWhile I've been in Texas for Thirteen Years now I don't have open golf so I don't think it's not everybody in Texas ... that's for sure but yeah as we said earlier they were not doing full medical screening on people who were coming here and we're not stopping those who are trying to come here illegally from coming in only allowed and those who were coming legally\nWe're gonna we're gonna phase the potential for\nA health issue that's not being\nSmart is that's being real it's a one eight hundred and five zero one Seventy eighty Ron dissenters running for governor of Florida when we come back here\nIn the weekend with geo pound [noise]\nRules for alerts and offers the automatic text message Mr data rates may apply\nWho that is something that they are concerned about uh we have an opportunity to make some headway an area that may be a Republican wouldn't cause a Democrat even though their party has drifted more and more in Israel and Florida they usually nominate somebody who's pro Israel but they didn't they find they nominated Andrew Gillum who's really align with the radical left\nA which is really a very hostile to Israel now\nHe's in he's like he's really he's also into our freedom and liberty he's also pro taxation and big government is also pro abortion me the guy's a socialist he wants to\nMedicare for all we can get into all the problems with him but I think that it's it's even more beneficial to talk about the positives that you bring to the table you know it's interesting to me run it in I live in southern Texas now so I grew up around Hispanics I now live in a place where it's a predominantly Hispanic or I've never met\nA Hispanic person generally speaking is Catholic or Christian who is some far left is loon why is it that the Democrats have always been able to count on that Hispanic vote and would have guys like you and me how to do to let them know that we are on their side\nWhy I don't know that day that they have always been able to I think that the Hispanic voters not monolithic I'm In Florida you know we have a lot of conservative Hispanics and in South Florida um and it's just different than I think what you would the impact is our California um\nAnd then of course in central Florida you know we had a burgeoning population of people who are Puerto Rican I've been very involved in a lot of those issues I'm actually endorsed by the setting congresswoman from Puerto Rico\nOr he's a Republican and a friend of mine and so I think the reason\nWhy Florida we're doing good it because we're producing economic opportunity\nAs Republicans I mean we're below is as follows the unemployment and the history of our country is on and I think we can do even better in Florida\nYou can do that so if you do what Gillum wants to deal with this raise taxes forty percent\nSingle payer health care you know on and on it does that would really be the end of Florida's economic momentum so I think a lot of these folks really across the border looking at it and say\nYou know I Want to be able to have a good job I'm going to be able if I work hard to be able to get ahead well clearly if that's what you're looking to do that on your guy because I'm going to build upon that said that Florida has has had economically I Am not going to tear it down with can fifth get tore pots policy\nIt's run run as soon as he used a Republican running for governor of the great state of Florida former congressman from down there but let me talk specifically about school school safety you know the good friend of a republic will course tragically lost his daughter middle school in Parkland, Florida and I missed the high school in February fourteenth that area of the state was put on the international map\nAs ground zero of gun control versus you know armed guards at the schools\nOr you've got people on school boards like this guy runs the who is a promise program Obama guy who will ignore the the violent criminal history of students just so that they don't have a record when they get out of school for some reason\nThey what can you do should you become the governor I Hope you will become a governor think you're gonna but will can you do from that offers from physician to stop allowing sheriff like Israel to turn a blind eye to a bad guy who could walk on campus\nAnd kill a bunch of people to get people off school boards like runs see who is going to ignore criminal records of people like this Eighteen Nineteen fifty three fifty eight I don't see his name I see his his prison number will can you do from that position from the office\nTo shore up our schools and guarantee your kids are gonna come up with the end of the day\nIf you had the way Florida works as if you have and if they're so like the sheriff who's elected countywide are the guys that are kind of remove them from office ah but I said after\nA while in office saying a share of Israel though on CNN blame other people ... for the cameras not be honest with the people a Broward\nIn a share of Israel though on CNN and blame other people\n... for the cameras not be honest with the people a Broward County I bet it if I were the other day that I Would have removed Israel I think that was appropriate thing to do what I'm In the navy I I'm an ... die right when the when the ship on the ground the captain of the ship it's held accountable that just the way it is\nAll Israel was saying hey I gave the guy a bad what am I supposed to do not like problem that's not leadership that passing the buck right I thought it was disgraceful the way he handled himself so that is one tool you are but obviously I'm working with Andy\nPower as well to make sure that we do what we need to do legislatively so that the school districts are able to protect\nTheir students they sang school districts will do a much better job and then I think Andy had a lot of them are getting the Broward school district righteous heavily bureaucratic a lot of very left wing idea\nTo listen to read and he was trying to ... new school board members so that they couldn't remove Ron ... is on and they they narrowly lost so the you know I was disappointed to see that because I agree with you run sees policies helped facilitate what happened in park\nLike Iran would you leave it on a guy like really judge in Polk County to just want to be a guide to other counties he's doing great work there as far as school safety goes\nBack\nTo where we I ... we were in ... county couple of days ago grade he endorsed me with a bunch of the other share already that at the huge huge job plus for me and that's great that almost a unified the court of law enforcement throughout the state of Florida partially because I've been very strong in support of them and have a\nGreat well above that go on me usually hostile than the men and women of law enforcement and they realize that he's dead and are there going to have a plug it on the ... because he will damage dog the police said he will use law enforcement as a political football\nBag review it's a round as soon as this Republican running for governor of the great state of ... to go to Andrew Gillum let me just give you some quick is it about a minute that we have remaining I really appreciate your time run a taxation that looks like a tax cuts to point over on deck here\nIs that how she'd go to the Democrats that's not going to happen as the governor of history would you support the president and continuing to lower taxes\nAs ... people in the United states\nBam right [laughter]\nThat was that was pretty quick I'm All right I'm pro life obviously argue for defunding Planned Parenthood even on the state level\nBut yeah so that's a little bit\nOf what it comes to this caravan of illegal immigrants coming toward border what should we do we just keep on giving you know because I Know the Google wants to give a path to citizenship for anybody who can sneak across the board or what do you do\nSeveral of them he wants to abolish ice and he wants to open border so do I would say the caravan should just be able to go in that foreigners get to determine who comes to our country not we the American people but\nI think the president or should use whatever tools are at his disposal I think the Caribbean needs to be turned back we've got to insist on the rule of law you can't have people just charging end of the country I'm In the middle of the border that just doesn't work\nAnd so I Know the flagging of monitoring that I think he will take some sort of action by and I think if we can turn the caravan around I think that there'll be a good thing we stopped at mad at our southern border\nIf you're the governor he asked you to send National Guard from Florida there to protect our boring what'd you\nSay it would depend on what that means war like obviously we have a lot of them being a helping with the hurricane right now ... so this may not be the best time for it but if I had a free or resources that that that some free time I\nThink that is important because when the drums come over the border you know that affects Floridians I mean the fence and all the synthetic opioid the big problem in our state and I think that if we're able to turn that back that would be a good thing\nI Know that age we're doing this for equalizing schools and education by by forcing more taxation and more public schools use against the school vouchers are you for or against vouchers\nSo we have we have a hundred and thirty thousand kids many of them low income on various scholarship program brains you want to end all of it ... for those I think that they're successful\nAnd they're in a variety of different ways whether it's boiling time whether it's ... I mean when we have a scholarship program for kids that are bullied in school so their parents and find a safe environment Andrew would cut the scholarship and force them back into the school where they're being bullied so he is very ideological about that even though these programs that work\nHe would literally pull the rug out from underneath these family\nGive out scholarships like this obviously expert actually help lower income people why the left would be against it is not to be running I really appreciate your time and it had busy or the Republican nominee for governor the great state of uh of Florida it's wrong to see it as just do it again OK\nOkay thank you\nWe appreciate Rhonda Sanders taking the time he was on the road and we did it live during my program on friday a really great answers to use the right guy from Florida and again I've got a very close personal ties and ... and my mom still lives there I grew up there and I'm ... again you've got a decision to make between the far left or the socialist\nAnd somebody who is fighting for traditional American values lower taxes beverage occasion lower regulations I think it's that old brainer both do I know it's a one eight hundred and five zero one Seventy eighty Joe ... come the writer\nMessaging to raise ... burning your degree from one of the top business schools in the country might sound impossible to fit into your workload but what if it were a business degree to further your career and give you access to world renowned faculty leaders and mentors all on your schedule one that open doors to some of the most influential CEOs tech\nCompanies law firms entrepreneur isn't thought leaders and what if you could earn that degree in his little less sixteen months one hundred percent on line\nTo find out more text offer to seven nine six four or five that's ...
