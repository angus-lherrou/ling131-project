I I was very engaged in politics or won't even though I was pretty young those Eighteen Nineteen Twenty years old I'm ... but he he really grab their attention because\nOf the way that he dealt with crises\nUm he might have dealt with crisis the same way that Donald Trump Boyd but he would do in a very different way wouldn't it\nYeah you know I I've heard Trump often use the expression serve strength\nYou know that was Reagan's blind hum and I I find it fascinating is the President Trump the day after day the take one page after another from the Reagan play ball drops ... write the race in America does strong during the Reagan years this because ... says on\nHand to hand dramatically different styles that side of the things I think conservatives all\nIt's very interesting it's John Hi but she's the executive director of the Ronald Reagan presidential foundation and Institute a really appreciate the time it's interesting to watch\nIt because when President Reagan look there were people in the left who couldn't stand him either the media went after him all the time but the way they handled it was very very different um back then I remember the left in the right in this country all saying well go hell yeah coffee's a bad guy yeah we\nHave to go and get the bad guy if Trump says somebody's a bad guy the left knee jerk reaction is that he's racist these Xena phobic he's still in the blink is was it the way that Reagan dealt with with delivering the message is that why\nMe yeah in some respects I think it was a combination of things Joe I'm you know in the Reagan years ... when there was no such thing as player you know we didn't have the kind of social technologies that we have today so brilliant and\nWhether they liked it or not sometimes in a way to get hit gal was by how they use the word loosely partnering with uh the mainstream media right to go to get us not to cross that one\nNow was by the use the word loosely partnering with\nUh the mainstream media right to go to ... to ... that was it I mean other than that you know a campaign advertising yet this week through ADC CBS NBC right sang CNN was just the nascent little channel at the time and so a Reagan had scripted moments and\nYou know working in in ... in unison with the general crest to try to get messages he couldn't afford\nTo make them the media or any of the the whole ride on a truck you know he can tweak it you know he can reach a hundred million Americans are more and it was a hundred and forty ... writes\nOn any given day see some cheeses without the filter in the media doesn't mean the media since like Reagan did so in that respect too too very quite different styles that they play themselves out\n... it's very interesting comparison to make and you're absolutely right um I I might be missed remembering this and I think that some were Brian Williams said it was I I may be missed remembering this but Ronald Reagan appear to me to do more press conferences\nMore news conferences where he would actually take the questions from the media\nTrump will do you know sort of announcements and he'll walk out in in on the flight will take some questions Obama almost never took the questions he be quite frankly even though the media was his buddy\nOr he he didn't want to sit there will be questioned by anybody why do you think Reagan did that is it because that was the only available way to get it out there and because of bad is that why it appeared as though he had a friendly relationship would they say I'm Donald's even even though the same Donaldson was always you know she's working at um were sniping\nHey I think your analysis that's pretty good I I'm Reagan hit the script almost almost the cameras pointing at him and we're not at all now he had to work with me get a message out he couldn't speak directly to the American people right by you know I I find\nTrump that is that you know they they you can tell they study the Reagan and that is certainly and other previous presidents they use the helicopter track you know\nYeah you know he'll sometimes see and hear a question he wants to hear and not here questioning doesn't want to hear my little office of the road or a helicopter on its way out to uh I I think it's true or Trump\nHas not held nearly as many press conferences that's Reagan right away as he certainly against this law much to the meeting on just about every given day is you know when they all you know form into his office and he'll answer the question is now and then so\nThe bottom line is is the way the media operated in ratings days\nIf you wanted to get your message out you had to have a right right and that's breaking we're doing in this day and that you talk to you know so Trump is creating its own rules and I don't blame them forty six using technology to his great advantage\nIt's John Hi Bush the executive director of Ronald Reagan presidential a foundation and Institute but it's interesting but you say that Trump is on television every day\nEvery single day and it's a new video shown by her new video clip every single day or you're taking long form you know rallies\nI don't remember Reagan doing any of these sort of rallies where he would show up in five ten Fifteen thousand people would be there he did do it from the White House rejected from which ranch in it he would do the media very beer we use every day um he's he's that expeditiously different booted Reagan do a lot of his campaigning on Trump is doing\nWell during the campaign years has Nineteen eighty four re electrify Kunz initial election campaign and boy did really well run a campaign about no doubt about it but there again where I think Trump's than variant that\nHe actually said well what's the old rules he just never stopped campaigning for my mom when he announced to the President's Day and I don't think he's ever going to stop\nThe way that Donald Trump looks like it if you want to win re election\nYou better campaign from the White House for from wherever you are every day a week\nAnd if you want to tell your own praises on accomplishment you have to do it this way he has to be the cameras will be trained on him but he knows at a press conference in and I'm actually asking a question here I'm guessing he knows in a press conference he won't necessarily be able to tell his own praises is that what's happening\nI actually saw a you know I think he's figure it out it's not against the law that campaign ordering you know so he's just inventing a whole new way to you know a self in front of the American people line I ... I you know I ... I think\nWhether I'm sure there are styles and the future for different presidents won't be radically different\nThey're probably gonna pick right up ... ball because a lot of what he does actually works\nWell what's interesting it was John Hi bushy use the executive director the Ronald Reagan presidential foundation or Institute which is interesting to watch is thirty thirty five years later Ronald Reagan is praised by both sides and the media doesn't necessarily ever say anything negative about this\nGuy I don't think a hundred years from now but he is going to see anything good about them so it's almost like a regular you know walk slowly carrying a big stick it out a big smile words Trump just gets in your face he was dead in in your opinion is that'd be the stark difference between the two because when you look at accomplishments like you said they're almost exactly the same\nYeah it's a it's a fascinating question you opposed because I think about that every day I\nTrump is not such a bright white light the relationship is so intense that I too cannot imagine twenty thirty forty years from now somehow\nBad days and media looking back you know it was it near my tourists were tourists Donald Trump ... the fashionable but also say\nDuring the raging taste you never thought it would have been imaginable either a you know or they may not have that as soon as intensely war with each other not not at all\nBut Reagan was the target of a liberal press every day he was an office there is no doubt about it and it's only really because of his remarkable successes but as you look back in history the facts are facts\nAre stubborn things and and people look at the Reagan presidency and they have to give a nod to the west side of the fence that you might think oh\nDied reviews John Hi Bush executive director the Ronald Reagan presidential foundation and Institute I'm I Wonder if you have an opinion on this and all of anybody's ask you this before but\nWhat was Ronald Reagan's um relationship with the media going in Donald Trump for forty years was a media darling the New York LA Washington everywhere they loved him because he met money they\nPut him on people would watch the show and they put 'em on people would advertise on the show this yeah this relationship went downhill in a matter of three years that's all we're talking about here three years ago right before you know he was still a media darling was Ronald Reagan in good with the media before he ran or we get the feeling that he was", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Joe Pags Show", "city": "Yankton", "day": "28"}
