up a beautiful empty so you could display it in your living space as an air a little while also having easy access to it while there is check out the\nProfound two things first one is\nThat service so that's just simply what comes in in income or into a household and then what goes out for ... like student loans car payments mortgages credit card debt okay we're at the lowest level the percentage of income go into debt services the lowest level since the mid seventies\nAnd household networks in this country such assets minus liabilities\nIt's a hundred trillion dollars a hundred trillion although I'm Hi yeah\nSo if my debt obligations are low if my wallet or purses is full of cash as it's ever been and I feel good about things what's the odds that I'm going to suddenly just stop spending money because the Dow drops eleven hundred points\nBut it's not affecting my spending that's a great question and it's interesting but you bring it up that way because I think it was two months ago maybe a month ago we were hearing the big box stores are reporting better sales me ever seen ever restaurants are seeing more people go out to eat than they've ever seen the big scene in two generations so clearly people do have more expendable cash\n'em but you know what the media does the media has to find a ... bleeds it leads and the stock market's bleeding right now that's where they are leading with it\nBut when people generally watch when you when you talk to your investors to people that do you work with or do they call you immediately say oh my God what are we do or or do they say well it's kinda crazy going to go out to eat now\n[laughter] yeah so I [laughter] you know what I mean nobody causes nobody calls me with their dinner plans [laughter]\nI'm gonna I'm gonna from now on [laughter] with the pre said that I call 'em\nSo I Do get some people are concerned of course in that apprehension that's obvious and makes sense logical also get folks on the other side that are looking to do some buying\nBut let me give you a little perspective so at the market bottomed in March of overnight and so I was following the meltdown of oh eight and nine we have had this is this'll be the twenty third but we've had twenty three now correction sense over nine five percent or more than they average I sent this out the clients are smart and just to give some perspective [noise]\nTwenty three times since nine that what we're going through right now is happen average decline as nine point three percent were down about six or seven now um but even today Joe I'm now seeing on my screen as I'm watching a in real time we're starting to see some of the stocks the leaders\nAh which were technology and these are the names we all know Amazon Microsoft Apple Facebook the companies [noise]\nUm we're down early today than down hard this month\nBut now starting to turn I mean Facebook as an example uh this is not a recommendation on Facebook but the shock was in August\nBit over two hundred and ten dollars a share today it's traded and the one fifties now it was read earlier down on the day but now it's green Microsoft same thing it was lower early today now that's turned up so it looks like\nWe're starting to see a little bit of selective buying the average stock or in this ... NATO's moving but the average stocks since this sell off happen is down about Fifteen Percent well\nPretty big correction yeah and now here's the thing to you mentioned this it kind of in passing\nIs too expensive is it over done the market is trading at about the price to earnings ratio which that's just simply the price divided by earnings it's about sixteen probably right today's sixteen point to sixteen twenty three twenty five year average sixteen point one\nSo it's right words deterrent him\nGifts yeah you're not cheap so it's not like oh nine when everything was on sale but you're certainly not at twenty three twenty four times what you're saying jeez are forty percent overvalued nowhere smack at the twenty five year average right now\nIt is I Do gather managing director and senior vice president Raymond James and associates\nA always incredible knowledge let me ask you something off the beaten path and you know for Twenty one years no do you tell them you know smart as you so you're about to prove it here I'm literally as I Do\nWrite a jazz prices go down we're happy gas prices go down because the price per barrel goes down so we're happy with the guy I spoke\nWith the price per bell goes down with the stock market generally speaking goes down and we're all supposed to freak out and be angry that the the stock market is going down so again maybe maybe this was completely outlandish but should we get to the point where we don't have these valuable resources\nLike gasoline like liquefied natural gas like\n... you know I'm I'm utility that we all need\nMaybe we don't have those are the stock market and the reason why I say that is we're happy when the prices go down with the prices go down\nYes and it could be wrong but it's rare to see the price per barrel of gas go down and the stock market go up\nSo how do you feel is somebody who does this for a living and you've done for as long as I've known you but you do it very well how do you feel about those being connected is it right just to have gasoline per barrel um stock market or not because again it seems to be the opposite of what I Want I Want lower gas prices but I Want my stocks to do well\nYeah that's a good interesting questions so\nYou you really can't a separate does for a couple of different reasons um number one is you have companies like Chevron and acts on as an example yeah I'm right there publicly traded show they're going to be on the exchange just like home depot and apple are going to be on the exchange that\nThe commodity itself um oil in this case or natural gas as you were mentioning\nThose are the importance of course into a lot of different products right and so you have to have a market price I mean if you look at commodities you can buy cattle hogs oil natural gas platinum played in whatever it's all out there with a\nPrice I Wonder I Wonder if I Want to interject there's no good I see where you're going to make sense but why did you brought up apple let's talk about apple I've got an iPhone or I Want to go by the new iPhone right\nAn apple stock dumped today Fifteen Percent they're not going to drop the price of the iPhone tomorrow because their stock price went down but at the price per barrel of oil goes down to the stock prices go down to those old companies are you going to pay a pay less for it at the gas pump so I guess my question is\nIs it OK that what we actually pay as a consumer seems to be directly tied to the price per barrel which is for some reason in flux because of what's happened to stock market\nThe iPhone is going to change price because apple gained or lost money today by phone as the eyeball and that's what it costs that's what the plant is right [noise] yeah\nOkay so the or let the lithium batteries\nLittle smarter than you thought I was ... it actually makes no sense whatsoever and I'm trying to [laughter] come on [laughter] ... yeah yeah yeah\nSo it's just choose to dissect the iPhone for an example we all know they have lithium batteries you show live here and there is a commodity right um so that's going to trade up and down just like crude oil that's\nPart of the cost structure for Apple now they might do things to hedge that input cost it they think lithium prices are going to run away to the upside\nBecause they don't want the iPhone going for um a thousand to twelve hundred just because the battery went up by two hundred but right um so it's kind it's a hard question to answer I think the short answer is no ah oil is part and parcel to the equation\nA book just as the raw commodity and then all of the ... of that which are directly ... energy companies but then more broadly plastic on an iPhone right well guess what that comes from where oil my show it's just it's it's just there\nWhy apple is in effect of the ... from the dumb guy respected here the right answer is apple already mark set up by a hundred percent so if there are only making Ninety five percent markup I think they're still gonna be okay and it really is true it cost them exactly half\nOf what of what they're charging for an iPhone so I guess where you've got that kind of wiggle room you could you could survive it the next time we speak do me a favor let's talk about why the price per barrel of oil is it lower for us specifically when we're exporting no more than we've ever\nExported and we're actually exporting no more than we're importing had a great question for the call yesterday who said we're\nWe've got all this or why we keep on exporting it will just keep it we find ourselves and I know that it's a it's a global market that's why but maybe you can break down exactly how that works next on can we do that\nYeah you bet that's easy appreciate dog I'd learn
