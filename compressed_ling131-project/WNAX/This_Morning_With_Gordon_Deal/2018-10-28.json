looking for the three hundred and sixty five days a year\nYou mentioned heretic de Los Angeles as one of the leaders in extreme haunts what goes on and heretic\nMan it's pretty crazy I'll say that first of all I'll have to admit I'm not a huge horror fan\nBut I spent six hours at a hair to ... so\nI feel like I really really went in it and it was almost a rite of passage for me to watch people go through that but everyone's experience was completely different that something that was really interesting to scare actors\nBasically kind of size somebody up as they come in and they can read to see how they're going to be more creative you know they grab them from a friend to grab them from behind I mean\nOne woman had a plastic bag put over her head she was the rash around in the air they threw a cardboard box on top of her will raped across it with a rake and then the guy punch to the box grabbed her neck I mean everyone's experience was different but\nI've heard of people being

fetal position taken much drawn simulated body fluids his first words afterward that was awesome\n[laughter] exactly so that was the one that I was that and you know it was interesting because that took place out in the middle of the desert and they said it was kind of an existential space crisis so people arrived they were blindfolded they were led to this dusty RV\nThey were stripped of their clothes and put in this stress based here\nAnd they were told that they were these criminals that had been on the bottom eyes and that they would be walking around the property collecting\nBlood samples and trying to identify a couple of bodies that were there and they were given a walkie talkie there was this this embodied voice that was super creepy that was walking him through all of them is that they were supposed to make and they walked through this property and\nThere's fog and smoke everywhere they walk in there is a man let on fire running around screaming\nAll these different actors encounter them and torture them and scare them in their own unique ways and\nThey ended up in this tent in the back in the pitch black with all this fog\nAnd this man is monster with a mask just pops out of nowhere and strict rationing them around and\nWhich the spacesuit are stripped him down to their underwear and is just smearing simulated bodily fluids goo and vomiting on their chest and yeah so the majority of these participants did end up in the fetal position in their underwear and what was so hilarious about it as that you know I'm watching this thinking\nWow that they must be really shaken up and they are but as they make the walk back off that property in kind of transition back into normal life they're so excited they would do it again they're telling me that these memories are going to last a lifetime\nFor the actors I guess there are some ... of these extreme haunts\nHere are not allowed to actually hurt the people on and the guys\nWas kind of funny and he told me that his only rules are basically don't kill then don't permanently scarred them but you know they actually get physical which is funny I mean you go to places like the universal studios Hans
