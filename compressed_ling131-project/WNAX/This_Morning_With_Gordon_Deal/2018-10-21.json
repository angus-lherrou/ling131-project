equal wrapping up and you know we we were surprised by how Americans have antibodies killing a path a religion ranked through there\nYou grow up and and and you know we were so surprised by how Americans have answered this question and a path a religion ranks who really really highly for a lot of people it's one of the most prominent things\nUh you know threats and people's family affiliations whether you identify as a mother or father or life wakes really highly\nAnd politics for like all the way down at the bottom at this list and we sort of suspected that perhaps even the something different if we ask people to question again today because it feels like a moment when everyone is thinking about politics politics there's like a pro bathing everything around us\nSo we we surveyed this question about two thousand people and found once again that politics really aren't as important to people as we thought if you sort of ask them this question about you know thinking about your own identity which parts of your identity are most important to you\nKnow it's interesting because as you found out I guess from the surveys you say in the piece most Americans don't live in brief politics the way Washington news beans who\n... and it's easier for states and Iran each state does decide you know how many hours kids are going to be in school and I noticed that the states that have the four days are those states that basically look at ours they don't care\nYou know how many days you're in school they just want you you know the the you know to be in a school for the year for a thousand eighty hours or whatever\nAnd there are some states that still\nDo base it on how many days you're in school and those are the states that it's a bit harder to go to for a day on those states because they look at days instead of ours the ones that look at ours has you know we don't care what your schedule is just make sure your kids you know have this many hours of instruction for the year\nI Would think that there would be some opposition to this plan from parents who have to scramble around to find care for their kid on that empty day\n[laughter] yeah and that's always the big issue daycare daycare on that day\nAnd what I've found is a lot of these districts that go to a four day\nThey typically have something in place rather they open up some of the schools on that friday and they offer like a discount at day care and some of them actually offer free daycare or there's nonprofits that have like relatively cheap daycare and the\nAnd the school district might provide that meals a doodles nonprofit certain in some cases the school district actually might open up on that friday just to serve milk because there are some\nVery poor communities where that might be the only meal the child might be getting you know during the during that a school day period so a daycare has been a really big issue but you know and I went to Colorado where a more than fifty percent of the district seat that use for day [noise]\nAnd and talking to those parents there were a lot of them I talked to that initially did not want it but then they just they just grew to love it it's you know it's all you know let them take kind of a mini vacation if they want to get away for an extended weekend with the family and a lot of um parents\nStarted out not liking it but they ended up liking it\nAnd turn out I guess the biggest question the twenty thousand dollar question what kind of an impact does this have on learning do we know yet\nYou know and I've looked at study after study and from what I can see academics just based on these studies academics are not suffering under the four day and there was actually school districts to say\nThat they've noticed higher test scores because the kids just come back well rested and ready to learn and they're missing fewer days so they're in school more that's how that's how they feel\nUm but academics we haven't really seen studies that show that\nKids too horrible it just seems to be like\nYou know academics really just don't don't tend to be suffering right now according to these studies\nThis weekend's dinner for
