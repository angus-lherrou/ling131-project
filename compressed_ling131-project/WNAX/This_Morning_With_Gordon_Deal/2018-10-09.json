constitutes free speech one consequence more violent protests on college campuses across the country\nMarketwatch reporter Jillian Berman says speaking engagements with high profile figures who make headlines from inflammatory comments have been expensive as campuses shell out to create a safe environment for free speech Jillian explain\nThe costs are mostly um around security so and and a lot of cases when these people come to visit you know there's a lot of protest activity around it um so you know sometimes I can get dangerous a and a lot of cases to protest\nThe protests activity and also combined with you know supporters of 'em are these people are\nComing to support them as well and so sort of clashes between those two you know mean colleges that uptick hurting\nSo you've got type resume campus security and or campus police and occasionally you got to hire an outside actual police force\nExactly so a lot of um a lot of colleges have their own um campus police forces you know so those are\nSworn police officers like any other police agency but you know they can be pretty small but when ... when a big event happens sometimes it's not even controversial like say you know a big football game do work with other law enforcement agencies in the area\nAnd in addition to that sometimes leaving hire private security guard tell companies that\nThat will provide a private security

comments during spring break maybe but they still have to allow them to come and go you know they don't allow them to come and\nBasically according to the Supreme Court precedent they usually have to
