United states spirit frontier in a legion seat\nOr you know the way the business model works is they may sell you a ticket for twenty dollars one way but the baggage charge will be more than the cost of the ticket even for a carry on\nSo there are now a variety of sellers selling jackets clothing items thing\nYou can stuff with some clothes and them and you know whatever electronics chargers whatever and nobody charges you for wearing a jacket so\nThere's the biggest seller of the the one that is best known as Scotty vast as so SCOTT\nE.

or a variety of clothing items that inside have all kinds of pocket so you can stop it and I have a puffer jacket that I bought from their outlet sit\nHas nine pockets inside\nThat I can look up a ton of stuff so um last flight on spirit I flew with the big puffy jacket and this micro carry on I have that I got a Costco that Costco sells for twenty nine dollars and so I had no baggage charge at all [noise]\nPlowing and all that work to tear up out of the internationally as well oh yeah All right yeah so I'm All right people\nStopping step in clothing is something Europeans have done for as far back as I can remember because there's a giant airline and Europe historically it's been one of the most profitable airlines in the world called Ryan air\nAnd Ryan air was the one that originally came up with the idea of charging people separately for everything and so Europeans have been way ahead of us find wearing clothing that you could just stuff everything in the pocket so you wouldn't have to pay baggage charges [noise]\nSo that's great well thank you very much and I'm going to check out the website and of course their outlet store\nYes or anywhere else you should buy other than the discount you can get ... best normal prices\nBayer some serious prices and so the only way I Would ever buy one was something that had been a failed it was on the outlet\nI Am cheap sometimes

frequently but my question is who would you recommend for to provide a service for doing background checks are potential renter\nWhile I'm going to suggest a couple of sites that have grown up since the real estate buses so many people far away on orange now owning from typically one to five properties and it's hard to know how to do the background checks how to collect added all that and look\nOn the Internet and there's a lot of a veil of all services out there that want to charge anywhere from you know Nineteen dollars to you know upwards of fifty dollars so sure\nWell let me tell you about several first\nShows the CEOs the why have you seen that one [noise] you know cozy dot C. oh gosh when people use something of an dot com they get so confusing but it's dot CEO and co Z is set up specifically\nWith an entire suite of services\nFor independent landlords their number one thing is doing rent collection for people [noise] where the whole idea is that\nYour tenets pay electronically through their platform somebody paid on time their system automatically nose to build them whatever late fee is in your face type\nOf service charging they typically charge\nKind of a lot of stuff they offer is free it's one of those premium business models like a lot of apps on a smartphone\nAnd they don't publish their priceless and the things that they charge for but if you'll let them father you from time to time was so stunning emails you put in your email address and they'll send you a priceless for the things they do charge for like you were allowed\nOn a background check you charge the tennis for that [noise] right and do so these services white\nCozy dot CEO and another one I'll mention that it's owned by trans union\nCalled my smart move dot com they're set up economically\nFor you as part of your application which is perfectly legal on any\nBig apartment operator would do it for you to have an application fee in that applications the\nCovers the cost of you running the background check that way where you'll find as you look through different sites if you want to find a list of a lot of them probably you could look at ... dot com which is kind of a clearinghouse of information for landlords\nBut what they consider to be a background check varies from site to site for like some of them all they do basically is a simple credit check where others will do a more thorough background check to see if somebody has been in trouble with the law and that kind of stuff [noise]\nSo what what level would you recommend as far as how deep would you do a background check on a potential to\nThat is impossible to answer and I think it depends on your experience as a landlord\nWhite areas have been traumatic for you with tenets that there have been any I mean it really\nFelt for a lot of landlords the only real issue is ever been to somebody pay on time and in that case\nThat's been your historical pattern doing a traditional credit check is all you need to do on the other hand if you've had problems with tenets of skip to maybe have done the illegal activities and one of your rental properties or anything like that\nThen ... really based on that experience would want to do a much more involved background check system does it all a\nCriminal background check as well\n[noise] I I've been trying to stay with just the financial background check I
