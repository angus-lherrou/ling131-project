Ralph\nHello Clark thanks for taking my call absolutely how you doing I'm\nDoing great Louis uh recently moved back for a living overseas for many years and he appreciated oldest things that you have to say to make out to the integration little cheesy area because so many things have changed and very like he'll put all your life to give it a so thanks for that\nWould give a little back story where have you been living and for how long\nA first looks to the u._k. for about five years studying Switzerland for seven and put in Hong Kong for two years\nMy goodness and do you have kids that speak like twelve languages now [noise] you know kids so [laughter]\nHow about you have any language is do you speak at this point\n[laughter] well three fluently and to a little bit so\nFantastic [noise] and ah I speak English and enough Spanish to be able to find the bathroom [noise]\nSee that's all you need you just need to be able to or the food and drink in line and then you got to go [laughter]\nUm one thing I'm\nCurious about after all those years away did you have a hard time re establishing a credit score getting um auto insurance anything like that worry those areas difficult for you when you re integrated now in the U.S [noise]\nNo because we we had an address ... thanks very good friends of ours and we also had a home outside a plan to on a lake that we catch so we never from that point of view we didn't leave [noise]\nWell that's great because you know the financial reintegration can be really difficult for people\nWho are gone for a number of years but how can I be of service to you today [noise]\nWell the last thing that we wanted to do is we purchased the chrome book and to do our banking and financial hires you have dogs [noise] and I did some research on your website on that as well but\nI'm not quite sure whether I Need to set up a new Gmail account for the way that I can use social Jews and access to well to get that going\n[noise] wonderful question and when you're starting from scratch using a segregated computer\nUsing chrome book for financial\nAid is recommended that you set up a separate Gmail account with not integrate because you know with Gmail\nOr Google accounts when you sign into a computer it just kind of automatically populate everything from a prior went on and so having that separate the male\nIs the best idea you can do to protect yourself and protect what you do elsewhere how much was the chrome book he bought just for financial [noise]\nUh I don't know my wife is from the from the first shuttle no\nReal happy anniversary I'm sure she's very little money\nI'm sure she didn't she listens to to of course a\nPerfect so with the chrome buck the whole idea of a crime book where Ralph and I are talking about is they are ultra inexpensive right now routinely available to a hundred bucks for new ones not ... or anything like that\nAnd they are not prone to the same problems with viruses that can happen to a windows computer or a Mac and so using chrome book for financial only know Web surfing no email nothing no social media just\nBuild pay banking brokerage those kinds of things creates an additional protection for you from people who would try to mess up your life\nBy creating financial chaos emptying your accounts or whatever and so chrome books are the safest\nWay I Know to do that stuff and having a separate one just for financial is something I very much want small businesses to do to protect themselves because where we as consumers have a lot of protections under the law if we get hit by a hacker\nBusinesses generally don't have those same legal protections which is why also in addition for businesses I recommend that you get um\nInsurance to protect to you from data breaches from hackers and having this kind of coverage is something very few small businesses have but if you got wiped out of your small business\nBecause of a hacker what would happen next that's why having the insurance is so key\nCriticism with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Chris\nClark thanks for taking my call\nSure Chris you got to a modern puzzle for me\n[noise] oh yeah I saw a lot glad to hear that actually by a applied for ... and they set up a lot of all these ...
