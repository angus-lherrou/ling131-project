I had this problem with my PC oh I'm going to say it's a long time listener first time caller thank you well let's go to the ... days are out so uh so yeah my windows Kimball update and we can I currently have a son three eight you know free\nYes my my current version is Jeff in Islam update it won't do it\nNow so there are two kinds updates Microsoft at two windows there's the feature updates Eighteen oh three was the spring feature update we are about to get [laughter]\nIf everything goes well eight to nine to fall feature up they pushed it out a week ago and it turned out of the leading some customers data Microsoft said no that's okay only one hundreds of one percent of customers had their data delete it oh my God this episode stopper so they they they paused the update they've they've tried to fix his anyway\nThey come up with important thing to understand that these feature updates are not critical updates that's the second kind of said these are bug fixes and security updates those you want\nNow if a blocked Eighteen oh three is keeping you from getting hot fixes after eight you know three you got to fix it but as long as you're getting security updates every month on patch Tuesday did you give updates last past to patch Tuesday\nOr just on your devices in this important security\nOkay that's bad news that means that the failure of Eighteen oh three screwed up everything and you do and I you know while I don't think it's important to get feature updates is absolutely vital to give them security patches\nBy the way Microsoft with windows ten is not going to let you ... you know if you don't get eight you know three and then he tonight eventually they're going to get mad [laughter] and they've really is part of the deal that you got to get the updates even the feature updates so we got to figure out why your updates or block Microsoft has a troubleshooter\nA four block the updates usually you know if you think about it updating and operating system like this it is you know in place as is working is kind of like I don't know rebuilding a jet engine one flight\nIt's it's it's crazy [laughter] so it works most of the time but if it fails ... you got problems\nSocial utility is it called the ... set up or something\nI'm registry uh uh that well first thing they do is is go look for the windows update troubleshooter\nAnd that's on Microsoft's I don't use anybody else's [noise] okay so I'm a they're a lot of people have you know information about this and you can read information but never get a file from anybody but Microsoft [laughter]\nYeah so\nThere are a lot of the reason I say this instead of saying oh here's what you do is there a lot of reasons that can fail unfortunately and ah when it fails um if it's if it's sticking if the rest of the updates or pause because of it you really gotta you've really got to fix it\nSo if you Google windows update troubleshooter and you get to support that Microsoft dot com\nOr you can you can run that it is a is a trouble shooting tool to fix this common problems won't fix all of them [noise]\nBut it fixes common problems will put a link to it in the show knows it if it don't get it from somebody else get it from Microsoft\nI Am I handle this era I go there and give me an air of ... you know X eight hundred number whatever and then and then I go all that yeah but I mean the little um a ... page okay and then he gave me um [noise] they gave me a list of killing ... utilities shut up\nYeah be nervous about that yeah\nYeah and maybe it is all you need but if if there is something like that didn't get it from Microsoft there are lots of that out yeah there are lots of little things that can go wrong and it could very well be that some nice person has written a tool the problem of course is if you're\nDownloading a program from a site unknown or even if that wikis legit which I'm sure it is somebody it's a wiki somebody could go in there and say hey I'm just going to change that link to my hacking\nToo so you really don't want to do that\nGet it from Microsoft or are they ... if you as I said if you Google troubleshooter they have a registry fix troubleshooter and then they do have a program that will run but get it fixed it and it may be and sometimes they may be you know you got to do something more draconian reinstalled windows I most cases you don't\nBut it is if it does in fact require that it's worth it because you're really at risk if you're going on the Internet with on patch version of windows these days is just too dangerous [noise]\nThe issue is of course you know in order for a bad guy to get on your system has got to get you to run a program he's got to get you to agree to something\nAh and that's hard you know put it I mean maybe not as far as it ought to be but it takes\nYou know you have to scare somebody a trick somebody to do it but they're the little loophole here bad guys are always looking for flaws security issues not just where the operating system but with browsers and anything that goes on line\nThings like the adobe reader this is or there'll be flash these are well known\nIssues so in the past they've all been patched but if you're not doing the patches you might still be vulnerable those\nIn the past adobe flash had a bug that if you are but you know had a ... actually this was the only reason W reader and said because you see PBS all the time right they needed there'll be read it or read PBS\nAnd so it's natural to have a W E reader on your system\nBut it turns out they're bad guys who discovered multiple flaws and uh do the reader that allows them to create a special PDF normally a PDF can't hurt you it's not a program but this special PDF can because it takes advantage of the flaw in the reader to execute a program no sneaky [laughter]\nNow how do they get you to do that well they don't have to get you to do that they just put that PDF on a Web page you go to most browsers will automatically load the PDF automatically call it there'll be reader to display the PDF and boom you're infected pick completely without any intervention on your part you don't want that\nYou want a bad guy to have to trick you at least to make it as hard as possible so you've got to have pet everything that goes on line you're operating system your browser adobe reader do before anything that goes on line has to be patched has to be fixed\nBecause the minute the patches put out bad guys go aha there's a flaw let's see if we can find it and you're much more likely to get bit\nAnd they can put these they can put these exploits they call them these these these these flaws on a website you might even go to they can imbedded in an ad or they can hack the website websites can act all the time put there and you just go to this you're going to perfectly benign website\nIt in the background without any intervention or visible display on the screen it loads a PDF and you're\nYou need to be patch they up to date that's the number one rule\nAnd security [noise] so of course we always say don't click on links you know don't fall for stuff don't download files from wikis but all of that all those bets are off if you don't keep your stuff we'll report\nThe early morning get together with big Scott Allen\n\nYour chance in a brand new for that one as close as participating with Lynn Ford dealer stopping put your name in the box cross your fingers your name will be drawn as one of our fifty seven she qualifiers you went on next live broadcast where you can register to win\nAnd then what you're going to probably have to do is buy a why fire router\nBut that was gonna say Chili's we did that and and I found a company that was fired into their ... that we can't necessarily see the why fight that they're\nNo that's right oh they offer you free why fine\nFor unlimited that by such\nNice that's I is it from who's it from say curiosities it from the company that to rent the building or\nYou know why it at that company puts it in the contract and stuff\nSo that might be all you need it depends on how fast it is there are things to be considering okay\nWe have an inside office or not I'm On an\nOuter wall what does cut back and found that as well\nHaiti maybe not you should go in there with a phone or laptop and just see what you get and how fast it is go to a you know go to DSL reports dot com on your laptop and choose their speed test and see what you're getting now\nReports a calm there many speed tests you also got a speed test that that might be good to go to two of them and then tested on your laptop\nAnd then a good idea to test it during the hours you'd want to use the office of going in the morning lunchtime afternoon and see if it's fast enough for you if that's free it's fast enough for you I say using here's the one thing to keep in mind your Internet service provider whoever provide that service and I would find out\nDoes have you know like any news service provider could see what you're doing so they've got to be somebody you trust it maybe who knows it might be the city that's doing it it might be who knows I don't know who it is it's interesting that so they do offer you\nFree why unlimited free why as\nCrap unlimited by says shake ... well that's you know\nWhen you got to have talent they have a ... trait devices have theft\nYeah unlimited devices is nice I'd like to know if there's a band with limit like after you download five gigabytes they said sorry no more cars that'd be kind of put crimping your style [noise] okay\nOkay sell out at any given point there maybe two people in the room and let them found out I stand with can you tell me about that really takes like much max let's pass\nAs well you should ask whoever's providing that free why what their speeds are still always tell you max\nWhich doesn't mean they're guaranteeing that speed that that's the max usually with less than that right 'cause you know everybody lives and us and nobody's gonna nobody's ever to say well typically you're going to get twelve megabits they're gonna save up to forty megabits\nSo it's not that's not very helpful that's why I tell you get to speed test in there and see what you're actually getting not what they told you you're getting pastel if there are any bandwidth caps if ... if they for instance as phone companies do if they slow it down after you use a certain amount and the month\nIf they say no unlimited bandwidth unlimited devices that's good [noise]\nUm maybe you don't need to buy a Internet access\nBut you'll have to test test that you know you can I mean look this is the cost of doing business has Internet access\nThese days so [noise] um you know I get
