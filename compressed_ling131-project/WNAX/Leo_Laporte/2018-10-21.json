PC so you've really got a you know plenty of choices and it isn't super demanding in order to get that working for instance on an iPhone and I had a I think ... yeah they've released the Android version now it doesn't ... you can play it on on\nPretty low in hardware so um you don't need to spend more than say five hundred dollars on a laptop to play for a ... say\nI'm pretty sure a ten year old laptop you're gonna wish you a computer in fact with all kinds of\nOh he is guaranteed yeah yeah and unfortunately you can't play Fortnite on a a chrome book which would be the safest option for them or\nThey might you know Apple's got an event coming up in the thirtieth they might announce new Mac laptops maybe the rumor is\nAnd I think is strong indication that they're one of them will be a lot less expensive for schools between someone thousand dollars but max stuff is still really really expensive um right so you know your best bet is uh inexpensive windows device\nOr you could almost certainly a lock it down for him by first of all making sure he doesn't\nHave access to the administrator account\nThat'll keep him from installing stuff you know just set it up as a Fortnite machine you could even make it so Fortnite launches when he turns on the machine nothing else does [noise]\nUh I don't think you need to go that far minimum uh for Fortnite unique we'll actually running a core I three processor or I Would suggest my five\nFor best results eight gigs of ram a it's nice you can run it on and tell graphics but if you can get a inexpensive in video or AMD radio card in there it will make a big difference it doesn't have to be a fancy one can be a ... six sixty something like that I think four five\nSix hundred bucks you get a pretty nice PC that would be more than adequate for Fortnite\nHe ... he had and they take him to Best Buy at least once a week I Wish we go back to the gaming laptop or the gaming computers which you know twelve Thirteen hundred dollars that said Jackson there's no way in a world spent Thirteen hundred dollars on the computer no place for\n... for you to play for an eye on the other hand you definitely want to encourage a ten year old to continue with his interest in computers\nAnd somebody 'cause you know and sometimes people say but he just gaming he's not doing anything creative yeah but that's how we all started that's how we all started um gaming is you know the gateway drug how I got started out you know and I got more and more interest eventually one of the right software that makes it a big difference I was just

wanted and\nAnd they turn him into a programmer so there's nothing wrong with the kid wanting to play or night\nBut I Do stand by this recommendation of a raspberry pipes thirty five dollars\nIt will get him into you couldn't get him into programming through it the one of the things if you if you've caught him with Minecraft there is a version of Minecraft on here the programmable by a python and

build your designing python the programming language and then you just say built my house and\nThere's so many fun things you can do in fact there's a wonderful book from no starch press on a computer programming with Minecraft that is a great book he's all you know it's really and probably more to twelve or Thirteen year old but I think\nHe's he sounds like he's really sophisticated spending alone
