could be because they had a lot of trouble with the coaches and those things and then it could be also the pilot burned which is going to mean a moving the transfer K dropped into Dr Jaffe move the transfer case then they pull all the gear box\nA but before I went through all that I Would definitely\nGet your own as manual you have the proper oil for change oil and the transmission and given an opportunity to see if that shift a little bit better now okay if you if you go to an old Riley auto parts store they may not have this on the shelves\nBut little guard makes your product from Manuel transmissions in differential I've used it for years it's wonderful stuff it's a little yellow bottle I think he got like four or five ounces in the bottle\nAnd you put in according to the directions and if I remember I I don't have a bottle in front of me like an an ounce for every quarter transmission fluid [noise] you know and you can put it in the whole bottle it's not going to hurt and I've taken transmissions manual transmission that we're not seeing didn't feel real good added this no matter what oil was in the correct oil\nHad it to the oil and the transmission will shift a lot easier so I Would suggest that\nIf we can find it at a rally the order it for you\nUm but you have to vote or auto parts tell me what the manual transmission a additive from loop guard you don't want anything else and then to prop oil service the transmission see what happens and then go from there that okay\nThat sounds very good thanks a lot of free shaded\nAnd you know Tom the other thing I Would probably suggest as if it's a two thousand model with eighty five thousand miles the most likely since the transmission of the court system I think giving anybody any issues most likely hasn't had a flush or a bleeding of the system also and that's got to push style slave cylinder that gives issues a lot\nAnd at eighty five thousand miles even though the clutches of war and it's a good idea to go ahead and give it a good a bleeding get some fresh food in there and get it actually didn't properly and that may help you out as well\nOkay good good point [noise]\nAlright yeah I'll do that [noise] All right Tom call us back when you make out okay\nOkay you bet thanks a lot\nBehind thanks thanks for the call when you want to do next big one I Want to go to south\nDakota listening to us

on fire trucks 'cause a lot of emphasis on just will use this fire trucks\nOh but that could have been converted I'll bet ... could be that you know Chevy don't have it not I've got several other

it on the ... open it up and you sit there by the leaders crew has having assistant pushed the brake pedal down slowly hold it for a second and let it up slowly\nDo that three or four times what

inside your home for your whole family Joe we got a lot of them got a lot of emails here let me go go to this one this one came from Michael in North Carolina man\nHad a lot of uh seems a little bit of a problem with Florence Hurricane Florence costs so much flooding there and you know all our listeners and friends there in North Carolina Virginia Tennessee area\nI Know a lot of it really did have a lot of problems in your dear dealing with the aftermath of that and we certainly have been thinking about you hear on today's homeowner and hope that we can help you in any way we can we've been\nPosting a lot of articles on today's homeowner dot com\nOf things that you need to think about as you're returning home we want to do everything we\nPossibly can but Michael Wright sand Joe says understand the whole concept about around the\nHouse with the wheat poles and the brick but it seems to have backfired on us recently by this recent hit with Hurricane Florence the backside of our house was completely saturated and lake formed in the cricket area behind our fireplace the we polls are located directly above\nThe roof on let me see here\nI think he probably has a whole nother wall that extends up past\nHim and he you know so that yeah and ... and it's so it's above the refunding flashing on top of the cricket area if we had not been there the excess water that leaked into that cricket area would've come into the first level of the home\nFortunately I knew how to cut through the drywall and access that area and put buckets in place to capture the lakes so now we're looking for a solution to avoid this situation in the future how to better steel off this area should another intense rainstorm\nPass through the week polls are there for a reason row would be your advice on that for Michael\nFor for people are familiar we're we're using the term cricket cricket is simply a flashing that's put up behind a ordinarily a chimney to direct dump water it's coming down the route from just running right into the gym and it's like a little roof shaped piece of metal flashing just to divert water but in any case [noise]\nYeah the um unfortunately for Michael these we polls are not designed to\nMove an intense amount of water we polls are putting brick homes to allow just condensation some moisture to\nIf it forms inside the wall away to drop out there usually high up on the wall and low on the wall and you know build up of moisture will drop out but when they're not designed to keep back or hurricane so there's really not much you can do some people think oh well this deal at the polls yet we polls yeah that's great when there's a hurricane but what happens you know the other cells in\nHis eye or again right so [noise]\nUm I'm not sure what I could tell them I wouldn't obviously would never recommend feeling we polls and I think you just have to [noise] um you know realize that these are not designed to prevent water infiltration from hurricane

things that are also available to make that safe and easy to get in and out of the tub but the walk into probably his one of the better ways to go on that\nI also wanted to mention that they do make 'em depending married in mentioned how you know some difficult it is for her mom to get enough but they do make a thing called the tub transfer seat which is a long bands that kind of straddles the edge of the tub so\nWhat a person can do is they sit on the bench they lift one foot over the edge of the top and the other one and they slide over and they're still in the tub and then they can stand

about a jail coach saying\nAnd what should I use for a top code after standing to get upset and finish thanks so much for your time\nWell I tell you Sylvia the easiest thing to do is to use of water base and you know first it dries really quickly cleans up with soap and water and if you can get a water based gel stain that would be even better because it it doesn't run as much as a much thicker\nMaterial to apply so that's what I Would use you can get a a dark walnut comes in dark walnut\nAnd for um a satin finish what I Would recommend doing we've talked about this and that that that you can get polyurethane and spray\nOn for a picture frame it would be perfect small project like that yeah right yeah you often have like little molding or some detail to work around which make it a little more difficult to apply with a poll you were saying what a brush\nAnd you can get most most probably are things sprays or gloss but if you look you can find one that either either as a matter of fat and spray on and that's what I Would use you know spray one light oh yeah let's drive really first of all let me back I'm going to be sure this day and is very very dry if you have to
