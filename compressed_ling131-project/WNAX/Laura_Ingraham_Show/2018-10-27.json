L. O. B. B.\nAnd he's got a twenty Eighteen Ford F. one fifty and it's got a five leader in it and he's using oil and has some concerns about that [noise]\nOkay Tony let's take it from the top of\nThese new engines have low tension rings and it's critical to all of the tolerances which are very tight in these engines a lot tighter than the older engines\nThey have to be just right and the cylinder finished the class hatching where they do the final hone in on the boys by machine because it's got to be just perfect and they work okay it worked fine\nAnd the reason they use low tension rings and he was very light oil like a ... or whatever you're twenty or five W twenty [noise] and that's when they certify the vehicle they're trying to get the most fuel economy out of it so they can meet the CAFE standards [noise] she got very light on oil which end it's high quality using synthetic\nHave low tension rings\nSo all it takes is you've you've got an engine let's say they were doing a thousand engines that week on honing machine and the stones or getting a little warning or something like that you may have one that has some cross hatching\nCylinder finished is not exactly right so you're consuming oil now he just said you went on a seven hundred miles on a trip and then seven hundred miles you use the court right\nYes sir\nOkay then they told you you had to wait Fifteen minutes half an hour or whatever for checking the oil\nShould that should you have to wait that long to get a correct reading [noise]\nWell I'll be honest with you on these new engines the way they design and intense like even on a diesel engine you should you should shut it down and you should wait you know good twenty minutes by the way if you check and twenty twenty five minutes you're going to get a good accurate reading\nYou know if you have to wait an hour you got another problem [laughter]\nSo um when you check it how long have you let the engine set and have you had to add much oil\nTo add a lot of all the data Shia keeps telling me there's nothing wrong with it\n[noise]\nWell the idea that I put in it it should have been coming out the stick but so\nMany miles around you try to\nJust turned twenty seven thousand started at twenty\nIs what the deal is that these factories all these manufacturers what they're trying to do they're they're trying to get out of taking care of a you know we've ... engine replacement um so they could have come up with\nWhat they call commercially acceptable standards which says okay if you use a court eight hundred mile seven hundred miles that's commercially acceptable what's not acceptable to me\nUm you know if I buy a new car and and I've seen this I've seen a lot of this and even ... will tell you know as you know people stop at the self service gas stations\nAnd you watch them to get out of the car put you on the path of pumping go nobody ever opens a hood anymore consequently [noise] when people go in for an oil change at five or seven thousand miles\nThey usually low in the current case they don't have enough in it so you are being cautious [noise] excuse me you know you're checking your oil you finding that is consuming oil\n[noise] I'm not bad mouth and the dealer and they're doing what they're told if it was my truck could you buy a brand new by the way it was never titled anyone before\nYesterday it was a demonstration had about five hundred miles off when I got it\nOkay that could be a problem because if they had tagged at a title that in the dealerships name and use it as a demonstrator the lemon law doesn't apply the lemon law only applies to the original owner um so you have to check and see if this thing of urban title before you got it\nBut I Would go to our first soft and you're on his manual to be a number for Ford customer service\nI Would get the customer service his own representative from Fort involved in this and say look\nI got a thirty five forty thousand dollar pickup truck and using tons of oil that's not acceptable I'm not going to live with this\nYou got to fix it and I don't want I don't want to buy new trucks all I don't want somebody taken apart the dealership I Know what the warranty so they can fix the effects are more work but she'll materials for a certain length of time it's home I bought a new truck gets used a lot of oil I Want to reply factory replacement engine that's the only thing that's going to satisfy me\nI'm not gonna take a truck that some\nIn the shop 'cause you're rolling the dice that can be fabulous but the guy could be an idiot this working on your truck you have no control over that\nBefore my truck that on what I Would do I would call Ford zone Tom I've got an F. one fifty\nYou know the longest lasting truck in the world the best selling truck in the world all the you know military grade and all this stuff and then I struck by the way I have lots of friends even though I'm not a Ford guy the nice trucks\nBut you've got one that's consuming oil and its brand new only twenty five thousand miles on twenty seven [noise] about twenty twenty thousand\nHits unacceptable and if you don't step up to the plate and fix my truck we'll go to arbitration but then you file an arbitration complaint you have to get the deal and to help you they'll do that though and ah you do have him go to the lemon law you can have them by back\nAnd get another truck okay [noise] but again\nYou gotta you gotta see got you got to see the car faction or are you know you didn't take the Vin coat and go on car facts and see if it was ever titled\nIn someone's name before you got it because if it was titled intact then the lemon law only applies to the original owner unfortunately\nIn the state of Georgia as far as I Know now I haven't been arbitration for a long time but I went through that certain Chevrolet helping I had an astro van that literally I had one for about an eighty six [noise]\nAnd I kept the through Nineteen Ninety two in a truck with flowers I never had an issue with a put a lot of miles on it beat it to death\nI bought a new one in Ninety two\nAnd then twenty thousand miles then spent more time in the shop burned oil the windows fell out of it the air conditioner didn't work I made them by back\nSo\nThat's what I Would that's what I ... and you you know they'll probably put you through an oil consumption thing where they check it and they change it and they do this or make you go back and forth it's inconvenient but you have to play that part of the game [noise]\nThought okay well thank you so much\nI could like call me back Lehman how do you make a month or so when you get it I I think Ford\nWill step up to the plate because as you know car sales a new car sales are ... are really in the toilet right now in fact I watched some ads last night on TV for ...\nDid you know car sales a new car sales are ... are really in the toilet right now in fact\nI watch some ads last night on TV for twenty nine to not be leftover Eighteen or Nineteen dodge ram they're often eleven thousand dollars off of them is are the things barely hit the the deal a lot\nI I watch the news on frontier not from here but the tightened pickup trucks they're offering twelve thousand dollars off brand new twenty nine teams\nSo you know they want to make you happy they don't want to spend any money but didn't want to make you happy just to be a gentleman and beef from but I Would not cheap that truck I Would make them by it back or I Would trade it in\nOkay well you know the old that Monday morning OK buddy thanks a lot next time you go to smoke and pick tell them it tell anybody there I Love 'em okay\n\nToni take care of yourself [noise] we're toll free at eight hundred three five five three

World Series game three longest World Series in history when Eighteen innings I'm not much of a baseball fan but the red Sox where I come from in Boston\nThat's my team and they're playing the Dodgers and then when Eighteen innings and I fell asleep I went to bed at sixteen and things I said I Can't do this anymore going to get up and do radio but the deal is that it was seven hours in twenty

'cause I'm thinking that you know perhaps if a judge jumped the engine jumped time that's another thing that somebody could verify with a dial indicator you take us pop up on top of the center and see where the crank shepherds are you know the time in March or on the ... to wherever they are\nLining up with top dead center make sure the engines\nKammen crank or in time if they're not in time

a timing built\nHere and you know it's got the two point four leader I'm sure as you guys are terrible by any chance\nNo it is not okay [noise]\nIt's got a belt and it's in the end and the transmission down shifted harshly its highway speeds before the engine quit it may have just the belt may have jumped\nShow this could be easy I mean somebody could pull of al cover foot to crank chef

the marks on the um the ... where the where the uh the belts rides on\nAnd see if those line up that's probably the first thing I Do is check my belt time and make sure that's in line and if you if your engine still in time then you know a quick compression check will tell you if the engines got any kind of internal problems that is the belts in time and the compressions good\nThen you got something logical going on and I guess I Can't diagnose that from here but with us a bit scans who and the scope\nThen you've got something electrical going on and I guess I Can't diagnose that from

airbags the way they're built into the dash today it could easily be two or three thousand dollars she can have ten thousand dollars worth of components if you've had cards car for a few years\nThat can be the difference between them repairing your car\nYou have it totaled and if your cars total by the insurance company because they want to go to spend so much repairing it\nOr you have it totaled tend to be cars total by the insurance company 'cause I Want to go to spend so much repairing it and um\nIf you're a total financial hardship for you there's no two ways about it I've done a punt suffocating it's a twenty four minutes after they let me go talk to Rick in Minnesota who has information on used parts hey Rick good morning\nHow are you doing [noise] you know\nI'm doing great if you are to what's going on\nFor a\nA nose or this weekend where people are cutting airbags follow the steering wheels on on the cars\nYou know the break in the car and that's all there after that their bag\nBecause a lot to kind of stuff going on and what not\nSure that they might be stealing the bad the airbag do they have no idea and we know what's going on\nBy the way it very easy to to inadvertently deploying airbag Donald ... and it's and it's sort of like the bag of money you get on the bank and blows up with a die and you you go covered with this caller and you're looking at a cop and St wasn't me laughing at you um\nCops have a good sense of humor you know when to stop me and he says you drink and I said you buy 'em knowing you fail money but anyway [laughter] um\nYeah I'll tell you that\nThat was my question is how Rick cutting things out of there the sort of a rubber boat\nSteering wheel and then they take they get like ten or twelve car than an hour\nWell let's see if they know how to do this is not new by the way this been going on for a while sex sometime a whole cars are stolen then when they recover the car the airbags are gone I'll tell you another thing that they still and this actually happened December dobie but it's happened to a lot of dealerships\nThese guys will go in with these battery powered demolition saw it was like a sauce all\nThe catalytic ... everything off and getting the catalytic converters on them and they found catalytic ... you know the whole deal is that's a problem with society when you think about it they wouldn't be a market for these out these but it's like you've seen this I'm sure in the news\nWhere churches and municipal buildings in civic centers have had all their air conditioners stolen off the outside unit because of the ... when I'm In the brass in them well those things would have no they wouldn't that would be work was if they couldn't if\nI mean if they go to a salvage job as a ... a metal salvage place since I've got a couple of conditions I Want to sell the guy looked at him and they're fairly new they're not some well thirty year old piece of junk\nYou know they stole him if he didn't buy it from they wouldn't be stealing them it's the same thing with catalytic converters guy brings in catalytic murdered with two sockets\nAnd of course the poor owner of the card down they can't use the car they usually cut the wires to the oath to sensors damage everything it can cost you thousands of dollars to get back on the road when some pool is made fifty bucks on a catalytic converter and you know do whatever is going to do with the money\nSo it's it's really sad it's really sad but uh they they they know how to do they know how to cut the wires and get something out without deployment and then they sell it to\nUnscrupulous collusion shops you know a place does body work together I mean if they get the insurance company\nAllows but say Fifteen hundred bucks for an airbag and you can buy one on the black market for fifty bucks you're making a lot of money\nThere and you know however that guy the guy buying their product doesn't know what year it is\nIt can be recall anyway you know what I mean I actually saw it on\nWhen the app will let things for the phone call [noise] hopefully we'll get a lot of these people are going to go to a commercial break here is

good point Seventy percent of us in this country\nAre the fish and vitamin D the fact is is that your body needs vitamin D this is a hormone that should be there and it's not there and\nFix the show

really comes down to here is we're not getting the right form or enough vitamin D delivered the right way which is why we have so many of these health concerns that you probably can't put your finger on and Dr biggest I Want to start just re camping here that\nThere are a couple of different forms of vitamin D and maybe explain\nWhy the typical form that you would find in most off the shelf the formula is different from what you put together here\nWhile there's vitamin D too and there's vitamin D three and the two is the type of vitamin D that has to be activated by your body so sweet converted into vitamin D three\nVitamin D three is the activated form so it's ready to go to work now in the street that I use my formula I think it's the best because I've seen the best results\nWith myself and my family with my patients plots\nBut I think it's the best because I've seen the best results with myself and my family with my patients plus I've worked with a lab where the people in the lab of taking this and they they test their blood every day to see how the deed is going to end up going up and out through the roof where should be\nWhile so Dr biggest I mean who should consider taking your fast melts vitamin D formula\nWell I Would definitely start with kids for development and immunity obviously young adults in their twenties need vitamin D to keep their immune system strong men and women in their thirties you're talking about health immunity\nCardiovascular problems start to turn on but it's also the child rearing years and vitamin D for pregnant women is very very important\nPeople in their forties soil you can you start taking more of those aches and pains like you've never felt before you think you're getting older and again it's important for your hormones and to keep yourself physically active\nAnd when you're in your fifties you start feeling that you can't golf he can't play tennis you know you start becoming aware of your body not functioning ...\nAnd then people over ... the I just wish that every senior citizen would go on the formula\nImagine living in your senior years where he can have confidence in your balance and you're you're able to have the energy to get things done ... clarity you know this is more and more important as we go along because people are living longer but the quality of life is not great\nYou know is it ever too late Dr bank is such that your fast melt do three formula wouldn't be a worthwhile investment\nIf you get to the breath all the mirror in the morning then you know that you're a candidate

order to function at all your body needs magnesium it's probably of all the vitamins I could list magnesium is probably the most important vitamin on the planet right now\nI've not heard a whole lot about magnesium ... why is magnesium so important\nThere's over three hundred and twenty five bio chemical reactions that magnesium is involved with it it's almost like a hormone wow and you've already sample if there was a low levels of magnesium\nYour heart won't be very important factor in life I Would say so\nIn fact let me just read a list of some of the conditions are associated with magnesium deficiencies okay um you have attention deficit disorder Alzheimer's or anxiety asthma autism\nChronic fatigue syndrome congestive heart disease caused the patient diabetes fibromyalgia high

absorb their food\nAnd so they go into what we call mal absorption syndrome\nWhich millions and millions of Americans have and it's not like you feel sick or you know this that use it might be over time just starting to feel more tired tired and tired mhm and that's just a real graduate overtime type of thing and a lot of people justify that they're getting old and they just need more grass or

take the count them out of the bones you start getting goal in life you start getting 'em all muscle loss because it also reduces the muscle mass and pretty soon before you know it you are feeling old
