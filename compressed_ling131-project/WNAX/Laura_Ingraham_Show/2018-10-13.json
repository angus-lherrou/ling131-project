good morning everybody and thanks for joining us today yeah we have a very special guest said this morning we have an interview with Bob Walden\nAnd he has some cars star collusion centers in car star is the largest network of collusion repair professionals in North America as foreigners locations in the United states and Canada Bob welcome to the show good morning\nTo morning ... thanks for having me guys\nPleasures so let's talk a little bit of both of our listeners can get a grip on it when when you have a collusion you can't get damaged whether you do it yourself or somebody runs ... there's a lot of questions that comes up so what's your drivers look for when choosing the collision repair shop\n[noise] well there are many things to look for Sam and I'm I guess I could start off with um [noise] I think we really want to get your car fixed so that's probably the most important and then when you finally do decide how do you decide I should say\nSo customer referrals um recommendations by your insurance company maybe the dealership or maybe somebody in your family or your neighbor probably is already been there once so trying to look around and getting referral is probably one of the best things you can do\nTemp slowly so once you make this decision okay we're going to go to Bob in cars time one of the things to consider before the repair process actually starts\n[noise] well um I think time up front with the with the customer\nWhen you when you bring vehicle in your chances are\nYou're probably in an accident every seven years that the average so you're not familiar with the process and if it is your fault sometimes it's a little embarrassing um so you go in there and your little vulnerable so you want to make sure that you're comfortable bringing your vehicle and\nFor that purpose just mentioned but also these guys today as you know they're not cheap\nSo when you're spending you know twenty thirty forty fifty thousand dollars or more on a vehicle you don't want to make sure that it's rights so and you want to also make sure that you're comfortable so if you can\n[noise] yes I Do and that's what we call cycle time so they um you know again there is a formula like anything else in life but if we have a um a vehicle that has said forty hours worth of repair that between the body the paint mechanical that adds up to forty\nThen they we're looking at roughly four hours a day that we can actually work on that vehicle\nAnd that's the that's the average amount of time yes some days that we have more time on it but then the we have the Saturday Sunday and the holidays and everything comes into consideration that's what we call it keeps the keys so we got the vehicle off on a or a Thursday Afternoon\nAt three o'clock in the afternoon that's still one day 'cause we received the keys that day so then you have a five day and the Iraq for the weekend you might even have a holiday on Monday but so right four hours a day of touch time and that's how we are being judged\nWell that's great well I Know you've got to do a great job and William sure appreciate you coming onto the sand the garage this morning and given as your insight and I hope people learned a lot again the website is cars star dot\nCom and um\nI'll come and see you in Massachusetts\nAnd up and like I says well we'll your lobster\n[laughter] All right very good thank you very much

done and this was supposed to come to me on friday but he got me a loft and traffic and I have to go to a football game at five o'clock so I had to close early but it is completed\nMy car is about

people commented on that you know\nPut a picture of a new rescue dog up there and we call her angel how old is she\nShe is so wonderful she so smart she's so sweet she was found in the woods a gentleman we know that has a hundred and forty eight 'cause he's a hunter and he has a hunting cabin is off the grid doesn't even have power\nAnd he he's a bowl hunter hunting for the bow and arrow when he hunts Darren turkey and this dog showed up at his cabin starving rib cage show in just a puppy\nSo he you know took care of it fed it and so on but he couldn't take it home to his home um he has already has animals there and uh I think he's a limit so the dog was hanging around the cabinet and he'd only comes to this cabin once or twice a week\nAnd he wouldn't go there more often or just to make sure she had food and water and so on but he was afraid that said that she would be you know eating by coyotes because there's a lot of coyotes loose up here because we have so much livestock you know you always find dead deer and turkeys that have been ... so\nAnyway there was no room at the animal shelter the animal shelter is full\nSo we said well we'll take her and see if we can get ... this week we had her spade\nHad all his shots and she's just doing great she's a smart as a whip and I take them out every morning and afternoon at night and she does like clockwork does their business in the woods\nOr she has not done anything on the patio or in a kennel really beautiful dog so she'll make somebody a great dog she reminds me of ... yeah yeah she looks a lot like even yeah and especially the one of the the ... follow God I don't know what it is that these black dog stars got a little blue dealer and uh she's a mixed lab\nBut I think she's got some blue hill or in a shit about twenty pounds\nAnd just as funny as can be some\nFever anyway not to be a great dog and she was her Doberman looking colors she scares folks and she has a mean bark and she's really a a got settled in into a new home and she's been a well trained now and she listens and doesn't run off and stuff like that was very good\nIf I had to live with you I'd have a million bucks to [laughter] see at a busy week\nYeah very busy week some a lot of cars on record as it is clear Sam ... everybody the cooling systems fail when it starts to get cool\nAnd that's what's happened to everything just shrinks and all the gaps open up and everything failed so we replace a lot of cooling fans to see how this week and last week or getting a lot of rating was because when the fan goes out the radiator bus and uh you know it's too late when the temperature gauge is already up\nIs all about preventive maintenance isn't it yeah absolutely and that's what the ... council talks about all the time before you go on a trip before you do any of these is when the seasons change heavy car service than um you know it's funny I got an email from a gentleman that said he was in some kind of a\nSalvage store

south or did they get hit but it wasn't as bad as like a Ninety four when they got flooded [noise] luckily we get more [noise]\nThey get more of that we didn't get on the wall that lost on the other was playing those loud you\nCould be used as a viewpoint focus much going on with the ultimate\nWell look the bubble replaces aggravating off a ladder\nYeah kind of determine that\nBut I was talking to another guy it was a mechanic and he said that that all tonight or\nHad like a few years somewhere\nI guess a near the frame that Rand underneath the car somewhere on their the crime\nThat he had it uh it replace one and they would like some kind of fees but I don't know whether [noise] you know here's how she kind of that's the case certain\nRules of war we work on a lot of focus is we just worked on one um Monday and we didn't notice any sort of fused but he's probably thinking maybe to a heavy red wire is fused going from the battery still later and they are all fused most of them live in a few blocks it's going to be heavy fused\nUm you can easily check continuity um with the battery power on cable positive cable over to the heavy connector or on the up and then it just to make sure the fees is good you can even look for the ... needed fused to what's your manual and make sure that it is located and this could before you condemn Alternator\nBecause I mean it's such an aggravating out tonight or to get the I just I I Want to make because I just had a pet now for a year\n[laughter] sounds like me and my rotation\nAt by the government can put that up and all that [laughter] he got mad at like asking that question about another vehicle absolutely [noise]\nTo to eighty eight ... for the F for fifty super dating that's got to seven point three on I bought the vehicle the gas that it just ... out on it it could have a a an injector pop on there and uh [noise]\nI've had the vehicle for several years but it's it's not published in jail and then a a foot steel container and tried to say than jak pop withdrawal it out of a container to try to eliminate the field pop and it didn't pull it out of the uh uh uh the bucket\nAnd it was pumping futile I mean is pumping kill ... I mean you could see where I'm from ... to the to the rail but it's not getting passed I mean I get to the ... but that's not coming from the ... the cops [noise]\nYou know it's not coming out of the engine to pop\n'em and I there was also like a little ... on the ... or ... that he has another guy told me that check in Asheville annoyed that can get some kind of fuel cell annoyed that sometimes you can I guess can get stuff or whatever or or burn out and uh he told me the check check that and so I guess\nYeah still enjoy about fifty thousand miles out of this or that six set a sort of set the ball to going out even\nPick it down to the house that seven point three was the workforce and has had they had really very few problems with the towards the pomp and if somebody did put a good Trump on it and that's the key they put a good crop on not some use things out of Iraq\nBut for the good component that should be okay the few someone on the some problems but you know\nThose are you inject a zero they're hydraulic they work off a high pressure oil pressure so what's critical is up in the valley there's a high pressure oil pumped to turn the instructors on and off\nEven if they're getting fewer if they don't trigger they don't open you won't get any fuel into the engine\nSo it's critical that the oil will be the end of the correct oil the correct oil filter and the right amount of oil and that that needs to be All right before those uh that injection pump to supply pressure to the doctors and and also the hydraulics open and close the injector\nThat's why they call them you is hydraulic unit electronically control\nSo I'm\nThe vehicles only the vehicle has a hundred and fifty eight thousand miles on it and uh even though it's an eighty eight I thought that you know that's probably not even a a good break in period I Would imagine on that ... and that's why I was\nThe guy that I got it for sure that they use the I Know they use the dealership till they ran a construction company and they took her to get care of their equipment that's why we're just trying to find out what the law\nBut before I replace her and then jet or ...\nWhat were you before you go to spend the money you get somebody who knows those trucks\nTo do a good diagnosis on because you're going to find out as it could be something like I said it was a high pressure oil pumped city and directors [noise] um it's been a lot of things you can be you know the valve cover a gas could have the wiring to the ... sometimes those fail\nAnd you know it'd be crazy to spend the money to put a put a pumpkin and when you got a bad ah\nWiring to the injections\nSo those are some of the thing that's fail on that particular injured so really and truly spend the money what a good Ford technician to know the seven point three to let them diagnose it properly and um you know uh the thing is going to turn over a good speech till you're going to have both\nSo I don't know four or five hundred rpm cranking for that oil pressure be up to work at\n... ... ... ... batteries in it and uh you know data span and over again that I just ... company in the field and you can have a civil chickens are just shove just trying to figure out where to\nOf the southern correct but doesn't necessarily mean it's opening and closing and that's how they shut down they shut the fuel off to them\nBecause you know a diesel doesn't have any sparks ignition and when they're running um you know in the early days before the orange juice on edge that with a caller stuff for boxing deliver under the dash on all these rules and you would pull that they shut the air supply off to the engine otherwise they just run away with themselves\nSo I mean the diesel as long as you feed it Aaron ... little Gulf harder and faster and someone looks loads\nAnd managing the guy to develop the diesel engine classy diesel okay he actually almost got killed because he was when he was experimenting with a diesel engine\nGuts they ran so hard and so fast in the end the test room where he was the thing that exploded and broke him into a bunch of little pieces he was in the hospital for a long time\nBefore he recovered anyway back to work and develop the engine but um you know these these is have somebody who knows what they're doing otherwise you're gonna spend a lot of money for nothing backed by getting back to your focus Sam said you want to check the power to the state or in someone\nOr to the state of seed but don't forget that not just a battery and Alternator in in some wiring by everything on that alternate there is controlled by the PC him the computer it senses the battery voltage insensitive uses even uses the in charge temperature sensor\nTo know what's the temperature is under the hood\nSo it can it can adjust the charge on foot\nAnd um you know the ... the computer controls that so if you put an alternate are on and so those in charge make sure the connection back to the alternatives could make sure you got battery voltage to the heavy water going to the alternate\nAnd that's like Sam's with us probably fused to someplace that might be a fused rubble employed likes those\nAlso you need to put a Ford scanned tool on it and go see what the PC I was doing because the PC um turns everything on and off the justice I mean you don't even adjust the I like the looks at the battery in the battery voltage a little low\nThe PC almost half the I'd love to turn the generator power so the ultimate faster show there's a lot don't matter\nWhat I Want to addict when I had a good battery and it might be I could crank it up driving down the interstate but then they would just like you got all the way you know and then but then when I got back I was like a battery washed or the battery was just drained and uh\nThe voltage jumps and\nDying to go to a break but get someone to diagnose it through those friends a lot of money [noise] and he'll be a good chance especially that's a that's a good truck within seven for you to do with that we're going to take a quick break we come back we'll go to Jason the Newbery about\nTwenty five hundred engine and we've been talking to you\n... can be expensive would repairs cost upwards of a few thousand dollars to\nThese problems often hit vehicles late in life when they're only worth a few thousand dollars or even less there's an alternative K seal is pouring solution designed to stop leaks and help prevent future leaks oldest sailors used sodium ... which has a tendency to clog the system Casey don't feature ceramic technologies is designed to repair the league with I'm clogging\nAnd so the two cents to when you look at the heating the heater on the ... to censor the heaters going crazy I mean we're talking as fast as an injector can pull this heat are turning on and off and ... air fuel ratio censor the turbo car\nSo it's a very important that the central work properly and it's been just a little bit so the ... circuit inside the sensor maybe that there were no closer is known nothing\nAnd this thing's ... he wouldn't believe\nAnd his deal to censor what can we voted one we're hoping Monday morning when it comes in we can replace it but this is where a good data stream diagnostics where you can look at the switching of the heat of start to look at the mixture stays on look at the switching to oh to censor making sure it works fine look at the field trips look at everything and see if the computer's doing his job not just dropping cylinders\n[noise] uh see what you're saying [noise] um\nI can say that my last stand through I'm pretty sure that I just I haven't got that are into it yeah\nBut it's bigger in it out and then going from there but um yeah\nIt was weird a bit calls it doesn't do it going down the road that goes into it Cohen telling a trailer so I kinda ruled out secondary mission right out and it's just pretty much the only time I feel it is at an idle certain other light\nAnd sometimes it feels like ... and then it'll pack up and go again but it's just as the blackouts that it's not I don't hear anything in Georgia and I can just be like come on up through the whole board\nHave you clean the bottle body in the control [noise]\n\nActually put a new idle air controller on it originally and I think when I did that I cleaned it out a but as far as claiming the auto body [noise]\nProbably not real recently every once in awhile I'll do the engine plane a poor the truck for the\nGlobal market and I have I have to do and um [noise] I Can't say I've actually cleaned up bottle\nBody recently [noise] probably to laugh but I\nCan jump searching for the um the idol speed in him and his follows often bumps like that\nYeah [noise] yeah\n'cause engines run really bad at the idol drops low really bad I Can't believe these engines today idle at six hundred rpm Colorado so much ... seven hundred are paying seven fifty even you know [noise] which will be\nShaken and it feels like it's going to stall and recovers that could be the way a controller through a dirty ... body search and um you know it it also looks field trims would tell you a lot like Sam said it may be some kind of an intake\nYeah that was one thing that I\nWas kind of concern to some possibility of an emphatically 'em or something in the spider\nAnd this just momentarily [noise]\nThey you know that spider how those work will the new spider you installed has eight individual injector isn't it worth second batch fire\nSo they do hire at a time so it could be just a few of the injector is because they are individual with twenty or thirty thousand miles\nGetting stuck at low pressure\nYeah that's a possibility or electrically fired\nYeah they're less likely bar yeah because that connector on top fires parents at a time so the electrical fire just like modern day injector\nLet me let me add a Jason [noise] now you see say it's as whether you're driving your it

chance to help you with some of your home improvement project we also really appreciate all of our wonderful listeners throughout the country that wouldn't be possible if it was it for these great\nStations they carry the show each week and each week we like to kind of put a spotlight on one of the stations right\nNow I'd ... I'd love to say hello to everybody and silica Alabama and and they're listening through W F ... am thirteenth forty and one hundred point nine FEMA\nHello to everybody they're great do part of the country and I certainly appreciate your spending some time with us here on today's home on a radio\nYeah thanks for having us on yeah Danny silicon guy is a known as marble city because it has a a large deposit of really some of the world's finest white marble running right through there and have been Korean marble there since ... Eighteen thirties so they know they're marble business down there\nBut that is not the most interesting fact about silicon really it's also the site of the first documented case of an object from outer space getting a person\nWhere do you where do you dig these things up so that you hear and see what are they\nDig that I get it for a bigger to call me marble had to be a marvel this November in\nNovember of Nineteen fifty four nine pound chunk of a meteorite a roof of the home and bounced off a radio\nInstruct misses an Hodges is on the couch taking a nap and in fact they named the media right after Mrs odd isn't it says forever be known as the Hodges media right wow I never saw the first documented case of somebody hit\nBy a chunk of outer space junk ... look out if you're up there like out of here\nI think is a is a bit skeptical of no no I'm not none of none of the leaf and I was just wondering if we're not going to mention the other famous residents per of of silicon wafer or a former resident of silicon now that I'm not aware\n[noise] God oh my oh\nIs that right Jim labor look I'll go oh that's great\nFor just passed on there a few months ago and a hearing a lot about his biggest state town in Hawaii that he's selling this little ... quite a state that you're thinking about getting the problem is only eleven or twelve million you know and\nAnd I'm going to come out because I Love macadamia nuts so it does it but they may have grown Hoover's yeah [laughter] so while we would all over with that one right there but uh\nAnyway we really do appreciate all of our listeners and especially this week those in Silicon August so I'll tell you right now let's see if we can help out a Susan is on the line right now from\nSouth Carolina Susan welcome to the today is on a radio show\nAnd can stay hers\nWas good I Hope so I Hope so here you have a kind of a mystery there which is often the case in in homes but tell us about what you found out\nWell I had one bad as far as I think I had to find a way it's a lot and so\nThe cat is looking down in LA there's hot outside the door that I think all of the pie there's no water and there's no water there's water at like ... like where the doors and\nAnd then I felt up underneath the day and age and it's quiet and calm gang or a ... way a tank separating the shame of it I don't know what's going on\nWhat type of ... and\nAll [laughter]\nI used to have one of those ... are now than it is what she did not how\nIt is white flour and find that land on top by thank I couldn't even get into that define\nPlastic laminate yeah but that's okay\nThat's okay well you know I'm of course I have a sink is something that you have to be aware of you know that sometimes you know an older counter will flex a little bit but that's okay um but the the sink definitely it's always better when a sink is installed if you um you know are able to put a ceiling they good\nUm kitchen bath type ceiling around the opening and been set the sink in that wet coke\nUm but without that is still very easy to go around the perimeter of the outside of it and it does need to be done because you know when you wash your hands or you're doing something they're in a little bit of drips get here and there is going to go running behind it\nAnd a matter of fact just last week we removed a kitchen sink where the countertop and so forth it or we stood renovation for a TV show that involves putting a um an inexpensive granted in in place of it\nAnd as soon as we pulled that top off that whole thing just\nFell apart because the exact same thing just a little bit a bit of a drip of water has been going into this over the years and I said it was in place they didn't know it but the minute we touched it just fell apart at the back of the sink so the same thing could happen to the front of your saying so\nIt's pretty easy just to basically clean around that lip\nAnd you don't have to take it back out and then just ... just like you would any um area where a fixture meat so a surface and then just a nice even be get a good quality silicone and it can be clear or a few um the basic color of your countertop is what\nI like green marble\nOkay and is the sink or white or another color okay fine I Would go with white Vanna White silicone and just put an end thin bead around it you can use a regular cooking too for that or you can get a smaller ones that don't require ... going to go around there and then just a\nReal thin beat and then just pull your finger around it and make it nice and pretty\nThat will ... the water out and keep it from getting under there\nAnd uh and this is a good one for everybody that's listening here going take a look at that same spot something might be happening there that you don't realize and of course you were able to be alert because you saw a little water but a lot of times it's just a few drops that get in there and start writing and you don't even know what are the\nParent will check their point it come down the hour yeah but don't worry about it now I wouldn't\nWorry about it at this point if you could go ahead and seal it up now than ah than you you you should be in pretty good shape\nThe cocker around their\nOil up with a new fossil generally you have a a rubber gas to get there that seals the water but it never hurts sometimes they don't quite do what they should do to do in a nice neat I'm Talking job around there is also a great preventative measure that you could do\nIt just always wondered that day as a starting to walk and clean\nAnd I just want to give you another to first of all you can use as they didn't mention either white clock to match the sink or good use pitiful green Koch now\nSo I can find a good number but I'm not you know there is water I'm inside so water is the little puddle was inside the cabinet when you open door not outside rides on the floor\nAnd okay we'll probably just ... I also thing I the only thing I was thinking is that it might be condensation I'm drifting\nBut beyond and not need cars where am I washed dishes outlined by dish washer it brought it out at me\nAnd
