wow have you ever notice any my own and I've been in about five or six calls us\nIt's accumulating in the um car based in which I think and just\nAll over the surface it's true I Know it's an unusual large amount\nWell our our our listeners across the country are going to think we ... back to these calls up here but I was just talking about ah this very thing well let me ask you about your house um is it up on piers got across space underneath\nWe do have a space it it's ... it's actually carved into he'll start of it and we do have a space however if we can walk\nUp underneath it and I actually went under there today went in today\nOkay so so you have a fair amount of space there and I'm now do you have any plastic on the ground\nIs some plastic however I noticed that there are areas where it's uncovered\nOkay because you know what happened so often I'm is when you have made it happens with very dry soil as well as wet soil in that that water can migrate up into your home causing moisture mildew problems but along the same type of path\nYou can have a very dusty conditions and what happens is your house a ... let me ask you in a more questions um you have central air and heat system we do\nOkay so so you have a return air system in your home that is polling air into and through a filter\nAnd then it's being filtered hopefully whale and then going through your duck court system to distribute the heat or the cool throughout the entire house so that creates a pressure\nThat that that a suction this polling from all areas of your home matter of fact a lot of people are surprised to know that every cubic foot of air in your home\nPasses through that filter\nTwo to three times per hour\nThink about think about that so I went to the foot all this base all this air you have is going through that one little bitty innocent filter two or three times an hour now but it's also the cost of the pressure if that duck or if like your return air\nIs not sealed completely under the house or in the attic or wherever then it's pulling whatever it can grab\nInto the core and spread it all throughout your house so that's one of the first line of\nDefense is first of all and make sure you have a good quality electric static filter costs you twelve to Fifteen bucks sure you're changing that at least two to three or at least every two to three months and okay and and and and then\nReally need to inspect that um have a air conditioning guy tell them what you're concerned about tell them that I mentioned that you might have some dust this being pulled into the system and can they please make sure that it's sealed properly\nBecause I'll bet that's what's causing the distribution of dust and and the ... of dust\nThroughout the entire area that's usually what makes that happen\nOkay okay I Do have it in nearly we'll ask him\nThat I mean I really do think that's probably the case there and then like I say that filter will make a big difference in trying to cut it down but if there's a branch or a leak somewhere else and they called the ...\nArea of the air conditioning system that so that filter won't help you at all but a check that out have them check it out thoroughly and I'll bet you'll be able to cut down on your dusting time\nOh okay All right [laughter] so ...\nEvelyn thanks so much for being with us here on today's homeowner if we can help
