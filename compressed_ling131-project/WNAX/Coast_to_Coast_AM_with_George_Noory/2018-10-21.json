who Woodrow Wilson was like all criminal house was Woodrow Wilson's won't give you a big note at the time that people was uh he he was a uh styling point and um they were ... they all in love with this\nCommunist ideal and um you know of course they didn't know anything about it the only that but it was just going rate than\nIt was true at I'm kind of house and I'm I'm actually are going to actually go looking says from secretary in the navy\nAnd from there it can seem to use the ... the political connections on New York to bump for governor and then once governor I'm you know it was a\nThere was a jump to the White House one\nSend me off into from out of the time\nI'm In ... was a there was a jump to the White House one\nSan Diego and took him out of the time when a\n... some things that I wanted to do\n'em over want it to do but\nYou know he would have to cooperate very well with what are some of those were his ideas and now we don't have to jump right to a jump right to the White House some\nStarted he originally ran on tax cuts and we realized that wasn't working you've completely flip\nAnd what not to the socialist\nWind of it and uh you know what's going on in the camp like watching the suffering so\nRight well we'll get into the the new deal in the depression and and and so forth and and the fact that it will do this after the break but I just wanted to mention the idea that someone in a in a confined to a wheelchair or and it had a such a debilitating disease polio\nOr for that person to to rise to the White House at a time when as you point out in who murdered FDR at a time when\nA physical handicap like this was also also equated with sort of the moments of mind and how without I guess the complicity of the media that sort of agreed to not talk about it he never would have been president\nYou know it's amazing the parallels ... ... that's a very sympathetic maybe they'll just like well now a days like today without ...\nShort [laughter] absolutely free he gets a free pass to\nBe a or between these two guys will have to talk about but you could buy a rich history ... eating them repeating itself\nOr the Russians and the White House and just all kinds of things that they can cut off putting it down and well known catches it you know\nBased on the health but\nHow is it that's a ... that no one sort of ... you don't notice store or said hey wait a minute or president does in a in a wheelchair or he can barely walk is he equipped you know this is the thinking back then you know obviously we know better now but\nThe idea that back you know Seventy eighty years ago\nUh that no one would take notice of that well\nThey they they pick their camera shots well and I hope people out of the day that this was a guy who\nEven really think guns horrified box that says it was really really really shocked when he would do is we'll without someone on one arm he will come and help build a crutch or an or something it\nWould appear to be ... able to pick a couple of steps so they can I just you know buying all the young is a little bit different than the shops and you know they they didn't remarkably well so they are to ward off the fact that are in case anything you\nAte painting a search shopping to outlook and claimed that you know five minutes experience so it was shortly for X. amount of hours so I mean the propaganda in those oils were Walsh anything back then you know it's just that\nThe media was smaller and easier to control that we didn't have other things you know cell phones and cameras on the phone you know they could swipe at work\nWhen he won the the the first election or you know they'll get the whole idea of the one hundred days those first one hundred days which you're seen as being so important today in the media what does the president accomplish in his first hundred days that really started with FDR didn't it but he he kind of cheated that a little bit\nYeah absolutely that I'm\nLike this is complicated fire I'm struck\nBetween the men had changed the date and which the president was going to be sworn in from march until January\nSo we didn't go into effect until October of Nineteen thirty three which meant that rose or at a way to take office for or ex boss\nSo this mystery thing all the hundred days and they still judge presidents by ... it was a hundred days [noise]\nYou learn

asked ski are you know when people put out these lists you know the greatest presidents and so forth FDR's often on those lists uh you know right up there with with Lincoln and Washington\nAnd Kennedy of course I'm ... FDR is is one of those presidents that you either you either loved him or hated him and\nUh he certainly made a lot of uh of enemies rate out of the gates let's let's talk a little bit about\nUh what was happening in America when he came into the White House and of course the United states at this point is it is in a mired in it in a horrible devastating depression like fifty percent unemployment in the bank system failed and said paint that picture for us how bad it was\nIt was pretty bad ah you know the president preceding Hoover\nHad a roaring academy going and of course remember remember the roaring twenties well let me go you know I'm you know things were starting to\nWe're starting to ... to be able to afford luxuries and the country over got in and fill it with the knowledge and lovers and raise the taxes and put some regulations on and here that fast\nAnd uh you know so here comes FDR in ... says there's a lot of people who really in trouble and suffering so he has this is closing of legislation a in a you know in order to help these people and also a thought\nAnd he did he did a great deal helps a lot of people we put people at work and it was on the government or the grammar paycheck\nAnd um this was the experiment from the county and hosts the Communist Party the United states of America had already set up camp and Nineteen Nineteen in this country okay so all of this information or was coming through\nA his friends and the Communist Party of the United states of America and they're still in existence by the way and then you're a mirror study or and so this is was their idea of how to help the workers in the working class\nAnd it was a flood of legislation or were they just basically regulated everything from banking to basically if you if you if you were able to take oxygen FDR regulated at that point everything from farms to banking to securities act and all points in between\nSo this was done to put everyone to work on the government do so we can have this cradle to grave wonderful society that style and and the Soviets had fooled us into thinking existed\nNew ideology they thought that it was going to be this great thing where we are going to escape the uh the peaks and valleys of communism and you know the government was in charge of everything and all this new wonderful\nPeaks and valleys in capitalism I think you meant he I think he's the communism ...\nI'm Sorry about that I hear the stories of pitfalls and valleys in a ... of of uh of capitalism you know so right\nYou mean ... if I might you could because you you are you you print the list of legislative\nUm actions that were enacted a in in who murdered\nFDR let me just read here I'm In the emergency banking act the government economy acted beer wine revenue act\nOf creation of the civilian conservation corps abandonment of gold standard the federal emergency relief jak agricultural adjustment act emergency far mortgage act Tennessee Valley authority act securities act aggregation of gold payment clause homeowners look lone act\nGlass Steagall banking act natural industrial Recovery Act emergency railroad transportation act and the farm credit act um and he I mean he did this really without much cooperation from the Congress didn't he\n[laughter] he just basically ran that through how wasn't going to bore everybody with Richard I'm Glad you did that I well\nI'm happy to bore them with it here [laughter] so I mean it's just a laundry list but it's just it gives you a sense because you mentioned you know that this was rate out of almost like the communist manifesto that that he had the kind of control that Stalin had in the Soviet Union which is kind of an interesting parallel\n... it's very true it granted it was the Walt Disney version of it but it was it certainly it certainly was the same basic control he was carrying\nJust like Stalin style and just Persia all of his enemies you know if you got no way of style and you know you ended up that his first two wives his doctor who told things to\nUm you know he he just went crazy um the great purge was basically a show trials to put anybody to death for either disagree with America challenging politically\nAnd that kind of Stalin did it FDR did it by what packing the Supreme Court\nWill write what happened is my Nineteen thirty six he had worried you know there was an election coming so you know he thought that people were getting a little bit you know wary of the new deal so he came out with a second new deal it also wasn't working to the extent that he thought\nSo well all of this was going on in Europe is great wars ... you know he is the single that Europe's war we're going to do our thing we're in trouble we're staying out of it so if this was\nAnd Europe is great war is brewing you know he's singled out Europe's war we're going to do our thing we're in trouble we're staying out of it so if this was a great a second new deal must be better so\nI'm starting to put a you know implement and then the second new deal and they start to realize that substantial portions of it were unconstitutional so\nWe um he had to pack the Supreme Court to see if he could get it passed than it was I mean he was really really fiddling with things I mean a tremendous amount and I know in the history books\nHistory books say a lot of things are I Know the history books paid him as this wonderful magical genie of or economic success he wasn't there was an economic failure\nPeople were ah they were surviving and that was about it that was about all they were doing and you know unless we got into that war and started to move some goods and services\nWhere were you know we're we're we're still going to be in the new deal for until his death I mean that was it was it was a cat is it was a ... because I asked her feet\nHow do you use the training with the enemy act or to gain more power lend lease\nRecently you know the the trading trading with the enemy act [noise]\n[noise] well again when he did was that was just an attempt to bolster the economy and the same as the same thing with the with the wind lease program\nHe was moving you know munitions and goods and services to the to the to the ... the axis powers and he was giving him to the to our allies you know free France included and eventually this new Soviet Union\nSo that we could win and they were just running up a cash register to be paid back at a later time so there's a you know there's there's a lot going on here I mean he started or he had to do that because he started to realize the new deal was not working\nSo there was a there was a lot going on economically in in our country and then there came to a point where he knew that we had to get into this war and the spies indeed and\nYou know we had spies too I Know I Know it sounds terrible we do all countries have them we have spies to our spies in Germany were starting to tell us they're finishing are heavy water experiments and with the veto rockets to carry the nuclear weapons all for it to the globe\nWe'd be speaking German right now\nI mean they were on the brain so we had to get into this war

[noise]\nSix ages six feet to find somebody you don't even [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\nPremier networks resumes and goes to goes to a you\nKnow here's your guests to Richard Sayre is welcome\nBack I just wanted to take a moment and I mentioned that Nathan state in back in LA or technical producer he's twisting the knobs in the dials and the doodads behind the big audio boy this is the last time I will be working with Nathan he is leaving coast to coast am to go to ferrier school\nOr not free or a school ferrier school what is that you ask well so I actually Nathan a it turns out like his granddaddy back in Kentucky is a horse lover a horse enthusiast and\nNathan is going to um ferrier school to learn how to care for horses who've [noise] a sort of like giving a many in a petty to the uh echoing set and and had a shoe horses which I think it's just a totally cool vocation kind of a throwback\nA I in fact I thought that job of kind of gone the out of fashion sort of like ... at the bowling alley which was a great after school job for kids back in the day\nSilent as already beating Hitler he doesn't need us\nSo Hitler has he has he ever hand here he has the opportunity to play a little a little harder to get in he certainly was so when we really had to go begging ... style is table and wish to get this done\nSo there was a conference in Casablanca and and then later Iran\nI think in a was terrain in Nineteen forty three and a gang member forty three correct they have that even at this point they have their eye and sort of carving up the post war world\nA skilled at this point you know I think she's Roosevelt still it's pretty robust or you know he you know my my standards in Nineteen forties he was an older guy but by today's standards he was only like sixty years old we tend to think of him and you know in our mind that he was like eighty but he was in was relatively young guy [noise]\nUm but he looked pretty healthy even in in Nineteen forty three [noise] um but I Want to back up all of them in and talk about the assassination squads Hitler was sending over the United states because I didn't know about this until I read your book\nOh yeah they were what was going on the other side of history that has now been revealed and this is what's so interesting about about writing things afterwards because that that can fashions come out diaries or published a you know ... ... documents are declassified and then you can really go back\nAnd really and that's what I like to do um some people right to make friends I write to solve murders a call me crazy so you can really go back in pieced together the snippets of of what was going on so I'm the decay inspiring with the Nazis firing\nA was a large aspiring American history thirty three members and they were over here to assassinate and sabotage anything that they get their hands on um operation Pistorius' or was another Nazi aspiring eight members\nOr they were created after Pearl Harbor [noise] um and they attacked Jillian targets and has a state and they were all caught a leave of each one of them except for one seven of them got the electric chair one got Thirty years in prison because he flipped on the other ones\nThey ever get close to Roosevelt\nOh yeah absolutely they did but Stalin was closer Stalin had infiltrated so much of a Roosevelt\nRoosevelt some white\nHouse it was it was incredible so this is it this is what I was saying about the parallels to modern day and people think oh this was Seventy some odd years every five years or whatever what have you\nOh this you know this was all history is not all his reasons repeating itself okay so here we have in the White House again I'm\nRoosevelt was basically screwing everything in the White House and here we have another another president who's accused of all of these things prior to being in the White House and uh the the Russians had completely infiltrated the communists completely frustrated of FDR's White House\nAnd we'll talk about that ensured on the road and here we go again here's Trump the same thing he's being accused of the Russians infiltrating is White House\nSo endearing example of give me an example in ... Roosevelt White House of some of the the ... and they had a ... year for the first\nCommunist overhead as there was a ... house which was um a Woodrow Wilson's 'em right hand man as far as um the communists and so forth they came\nThe Wilson's 'em right hand man as far as um the communists and so forth they came that were involved in um FDR's White House I couldn't list them all uh there there were there\nWere hundreds of them at least Fifteen high ranking officials and half the White House winnowing communist starting with Harry Dexter why all the way through the elder us and they were in all kinds of different uh and also Harry Hopkins which turned out later he was\nFingered in Nineteen Ninety and I'll talk about ... into the er at length later\nSo they don't get bored and go away it's more common [laughter] um the or the White House at the White House had been infiltrated in the following places that I could find the agricultural adjustment administration the attorney general's office the department\nOf state the national labor relations board the labor advisory board of the war productions\nBoard the price of administration the U.S Treasury Department [laughter] U.S Treasury department was infiltrated by the communists was incredible and the public welfare committee so I won't bore you on with the laundry list but it's in my book of all of the people who were you know who are in that list or who are high ranking officials in\nThose are in that list of of people so\nI mean he was just communists were all around them Harry Hopkins actually was the HHS secretary of state it was one of the architects of the new deal there was one of FDR's closest friends and confidence and he was one of the top officials who sent to you know obviously\nEvery FDR couldn't travel very well because of his affliction and you know the races in the wheelchair and so forth so we had to have someone fly over to talk of style and and so forth\nAnd uh that person was Harry Hopkins um who's Harry Hopkins actually was the friends of Eleanor Roosevelt 'em through the CPU essay the Communist Party United States of America which is still in existence by the way I don't know if I mentioned that or not\nAnd how Hopkins is down and get on famously\nHe was actually ... Harry Hopkins as time went by he was also architect devote my lease program to help the Soviets out So Harry Hopkins who famously got along with Joseph Stalin because Stalin was warming the waters in America before all of this happened okay I'll get to that in a minute [noise]\nUh he was Harry happens afterwards fire afterwards was fingered by a KGB the factor and I'm going to butcher this name I'm old ... and there's a name here I just simply couldn't even begin to pronounce they both identified 'em they were both KGB the factors they both identified\nHarry Hopkins as the mysterious agent Nineteen\nWho is contacting a Soviet Union about uh the the than on a project which of course we all know is a nuclear weaponry so here we have I mean there are informants inspires all around the FDR\nSo so the point where they he goes to the ... conference you know I mean I feel a style and knows more about Roosevelt than Roosevelt knows about Roosevelt when they're meeting at these conferences it was just it was incredible how how penetrated the Americans were\nUh at the hands of the Nazis weren't like that they didn't want information they just wanted to kill him\nChow in writing information right he had plans in the post war world of taking America does have communist anyway he had plans of taking over America and making them a full communist country with him as a ruler so he was a little diluted in his own in his own right\nBut how this all happened was\nPrior to this of course this is a new ideology communism while this is great you know no one suffers and everyone does this and that and you know we don't have to go to work in every word is provided for\nWell Stalin had sent invitations to um\nTo the directors in Hollywood a union leaders ah college professors he knew the target and they would were sent invitations all expenses paid to go over to Russia to see how this this work\nAnd they went to a city in the city's names escaping moment it is are listed in my book\nIn the they were to observe how Russia did things and how everyone was care for how this works and how terrific it was and look at what we've done and you need to do this to your country because you're you know look at you look at your depression that's going on and so forth he really sees the opportunities town was not a stupid guy\nRight I I had an author on a couple of years ago who wrote a book about Ernest Hemingway and how they tried to recruit anyway you add loudly so\nIt was a fictitious count it didn't exist there was made a cardboard basically\nSo they can village a Potemkin village and there you go um he sends all of these people\nHome with literature and propaganda as to how they can transform their country meaning our country and to this wonderful new ideology they didn't know anything about evil umpires you know then the new deal you gotta cut Roosevelt will get a break here should never been done before\nSo this was an experiment in amongst itself so there's a lot going on here there's a lot a backdoor dealings and string point by style and stone is the puppet master the uh he's this guy what he managed\nTo accomplish in his life was incredible he was one of the six original members of the most of the revolution\nAnd he ended up there just to make fun of style and\nHe was nothing more than a\nHe was to keep the party's journals and use the column\nComrade uh what was it come Conrad index card used to call them ... used to make fun of him because he was just so worthless and the party\nOne by one we knocked off everyone in the party to take control I mean the guy was it was just incredible what a what a ruthless megalomaniac this guy was\nThe Senate stop I'm Sorry I'm Lenin wrote that in his a quote from lens will come redstone is to root too dangerous remove him\n[noise] and after Stalin's death they they called him a you know a pencil pusher and all kinds of stupid\nDial pound to fifty on your mobile phone and say the key word free bottle again dial pound to five zero and see the key word free bottle method you dated ...\nConsidering going back to school I guess those are following questions do you need to flexibility to take classes on your schedule he left college credit you need transferred to earn a quality degree in the world renowned university\nIf you answered yes to any of these questions

author of who murdered FDR stays with us how you do in a Steven you hold on okay\nAm I'm just trying to get over the story of the ... the girl bake their grandfather's ashes and the cookies she wants to Simmons was onto the gray Persian the famine in Russia under Stalin and\nMust really going on Rick tea or anybody you know [laughter]\nYeah well it it never ceases to amaze uh when I just wanted to take them anything because people need to know where you know you're on the east coast it's three forty in the morning and the three hours is a long stretch to talk so I just want to make sure you're you're doing OK and we appreciate you being here with us and staying up\nLate so I'm I wanted to talk about [noise]\nYou know so much of the post world\nAre so much of the post war world\nIs a result and then in the ensuing Cold War and and all of that really is a result\nOf FDR's frail condition he's greatly diminished mental capacity at the conference in your pain forty four when when that post war world was really carved up and style and obviously you know took advantage he seized upon\nRoosevelt frail condition or and and um FDR really didn't know what happened did he just was so out of it but I mean you you look at those pictures of FDR at the the L to conference\nAnd obviously he is he he looks like death warmed over like seven months before at the Tehran Conference he looks as as fit as a fiddle I mean what is going on with what happened in those seven months\n[laughter] well over to this point we've been talking about the bond that we haven't talked much about the horrors that way we haven't talked about the murder and what's going on with them I'm happier as being slowly poisoning from within the White House and I have to be very careful here not to give this book away but\nIt was a type of poison and see what are you thinking of America is a leading edge on things and knowing all these things and what they were poisoning with with something that was\nPlentiful that they didn't know was poisonous yet but the rest of the world\nCertainly did here certainly did some of those countries in Europe or Fifteen hundred years old maybe older so in certain situations they hit a jump\nOn us and you know I don't think grandpa Walton would've known anything about\nPoisoning or the after effects of this poisoning especially 'cause they didn't know it was poisonous at the time so [laughter]\nFDR as being slowly poison from inside the White House every time he goes away too Warm Springs Georgia to sow his ailing legs\nAnd go on a retreat so he can mentally and physically removing them so he starts to get stronger every time he comes back to the White House he starts to get sick or so I [laughter] I did a little digging\nInto this because it was just so started me on this whole thing of FDR I thought it was a little suspicious and a little too convenient\nIn the tiny margin Eighteen days\nA Roosevelt Hitler and Mussolini had all died conveniently it'd be on the door I thought that was a little bit later [laughter]\nSo this is what people actually we just start looking into this for and this and that I also I was interviewing the FDR just died of natural causes as allied troops were storming Hitler's longer I thought that was a little to get a little bit convenient so [laughter]\nAnd when I started to dig in and I ... the ah deterioration of this president during this time period I said you know wait a minute I I really got to look into this I didn't believe that in high school when we were taught about it back then they actually taught history\nYou know I mean [laughter] it but in the book you point out how his his doctors\nI guess Dr uh mcentire admiral a navy admiral mcentire\nBut in the book you point out how he he doctors I guess Dr mcentire admiral navy admiral mcentire his personal physician and a cardiologist Dr Howard grew in\nMaine where they had no idea what was going on and they were doing X ray take doing all of these cats they were really clueless [laughter]\nWell and this is where you know this is where the rubber finally starting to meet the road for me they really work for what they were thinking the American public just thought oh he ... himself out for us and you know he was he advanced the polio and this and that and the other thing and\nThe symptoms of the his doctors were absolutely baffled he had a bunch of doctors emmer Ross McIntyre who's the White House physician he was also the vice admiral\nAnd in a certain sort of in general the navy um\nYou know he was FDR's physician from thirty to forty five until he died a Dr Howard brewing was a commander in the navy a course FDR's a navy guy who's going to have maybe doctors\nOr he was chief of cardiology empathize though I mean these are heavy hitters they have no idea what's wrong with this guy no idea [laughter] so what they do is they take him to the doctor of the day and the reason why they're so baffled\nAs because FDR is getting sick after meal times\nThis is my first hand something was wrong in his blood pressure would bounce it would\nDo normal and then it would do it will do warring out of control three ten over one Ninety five or something and it would be up there and then it would come back and they were trying\nVery hard to every and he wasn't responding his body wasn't responding to anything that they were giving him\nSo we know when they when they\nGot to this point they should look at you know Nineteen forty four is rolling around this guy's going to run for president again again [laughter] we've got to get to the bottom with how's it going on here so they send them to the doctor of the day\nDr frankly founder of the lead clinic in Boston and he's a surgeon and he is the guy\nIn America at the time [laughter] so he examines FDR in March in Nineteen forty four and um when he comes out was is a so glaring statement which is now available online you can look it up at the History Channel\nBasically saying that this was a dead man walking and do what he the laundry list of symptoms that he reveals that FDR has\nNot align with the advance of polio\nThey advance they align with the advance of poisoning FDR is being slowly poison\nStyle and style and got him I can tell you that I'm styling wants FDR out of the picture or at least mentally incapacitated at the altar confidence because he wants to rule the world\nAfter yard he wanted to set up the Fort policemen of the world um the United states Great Britain trying in the Soviet Union so they could all police there quarter of the world FDR didn't want to share of the world with uncertainty Stalin didn't want to share the world with FDR he wanted to rule the world\nHe was a megalomaniac look at what he didn't Soviet Union of

I have no idea if the doctors were in on it I Do know that in Nineteen fifty seven Eleanor Roosevelt\nWas tired of hearing the swirling around Washington DC about that they are being murdered I'm definitely not the first one to come up with us [noise] um and she commissioned a private investigator to\nUh to the bottom of this stuff so I Do know that I'm\nA private investigator hit a dead end all of FDR's medical records were were stolen from all walks violent with us though so one of four people had those keys or one of them was a doctor\nAnd a ... [laughter] it was the same doctor who in Nineteen forty six wrote to the uh the books being um the White House physician and that was\nThe six world so the uh the books being um the White House physician and that was a ...\nMore U.S mcentire were they in on the murder I Am it's only no idea like I couldn't say I have to say that they had good intentions they were just a little bit\nLittle cigarette maybe and and what happened to ... the Russian painter and her driver and and and um she which has been [noise]\nWell\nThey just kind of disappeared into obscure I mean at the time or two afterwards well immediately afterwards\nWell they packed up the uh um uh Robbins and assume it's off in the true loose Lucy Mercer who he was having an affair with among others um [laughter] and um they tried to get a Warm Springs Georgia as fast as possible so in her book\nUm her being I'm sure with off in her book she describes the place that they took to to get away from Warm Springs Georgia which I thought was a little crazy because if it was a natural death um knew why I don't know why would you want to flee the scene\nRight right you know I mean if it's a natural death ... records you know and there's a parallel here to the FDR's or to the JFK thing actually\nUm JFK shot in Dallas\nThey break law to bring him to a dog of Dallas the autopsy should have been performed in Dallas they break law to bring him to besides the\nNow the law was the same in Nineteen sixty three is it was a Nineteen forty five they did the same thing they broke the law removing FDR's body from Georgia bringing it to them with us so both you know both the JFK and FDR's body I removed a legally they're both at but says though we're all kinds of\nFun things happen you know a lot of this besides the could talk you know and then they they rushed this guy it's it's a little less than sixty nine hours from FDR's death\nTo him being guilty being buried they couldn't get this guy's body in the ground fast enough\nNo nor do by the way and no one bombing\nNo autopsy Nolan bombing it's just easier\nAnd crazier and crazier all the way through so I mean then there's other things in history to Richard I mean take a look at 'em you know not just this I'm going to be working on Princess Diana coming up next but there are other presidents in history who I also believe has been a murder that they've lost over um Warren Harding\nWarren Harding was it was it was obvious this guy was murdered and there's another one that we thoughts with us but as far as FDR's concern I mean the the [laughter]\nThe information in my head just exploded when I started digging and digging and digging and it's still it's still boggles my mind in the book is going to publish for a little while now and I still even after the book is one published you know I'll find a new fact then they go wow I should have put that in the book\nI mean it's just out to be a volume three perhaps uh let me get the calls here and he's in Alabama and the wild card like any good morning locked decode\nThank you Steve I'm calling to ask you about some written music ... she was ... garden party she cannot aunt who work at the

[noise] yeah it was\nIt wasn't people around him they were disposing of with war for him because it and she's right she's right I mean it's been the blood out to to the point where if you touch a person they'll get you know either their their brains will either bleed or they'll have an ... or something\nOr cerebral hemorrhage and they'll also and of course I Know Dr but you know my parents were both on it they're both on a variety of blood and her so right my late father was as well sure not necessarily caused brooding with any thanks for calling on\nThank you uh let's go back in the wild card line is it my New York\nMy hide their good morning okay\nAnd quite honestly part of an outlet sent over there and finally I Am not far I mean it can't all men on the air I heard wet head top lay\nOff ... voice like that and I'd like to know if he hadn't have Haley around there\nI sat in ... and when it hit that graphic or how he would be someone that we talk about getting the new deal is [noise] ... ah [noise] ah doing the right thing around that\nThat can go for that show called great get prank and anti like start killing ... and last lady named ... about\nBoth up there watching ... balls and the I Am a current stable genius saint Pete will now White House is hanging somewhat different because\nThey went to and then they can have more to do with leading up to you know even now he wound up as president and of course that money that he had to go to encounter I can get re be\nLike a lab but right on and and he I don't see a Fifteen than the fat you know we know that he has ... ... and in\nMy if I could just jump in because we're not talking about Trump I think if they see them but we're talking about but I think you'll be kind of ...\nUh about the Russian connection with Trump like let's just stick to FDR where we can do a whole show perhaps another time on on the Russian dos and so forth but yeah you're right ... a big fan of FDR and no Webster a little bit and and I've had dinner with him and and he waxes on about the new deal\nUh obviously ... you're not a sand did you have anything to add\n[noise] uh no I don't know the man I Would love to meet him sometime uh as far as the new deal I think it was probably the right thing at the time I think it was an experiment I don't think anybody knew how it was going to go 'cause I was asked to my knowledge there's never been done before\nSo I mean it I have no doubt that they thought at the time it was a really good thing it helped a lot of people um\nIt just wasn't along sustaining campaign so uh as far as the Russians and the current administration yeah I was kind of being a little facetious as to how how everyone is in our history you kind of repeats itself what kind of doesn't you know um it's it's amazing how\nWe have the [laughter] we were right back in the same thing we have another red scare and in the country and it's really it's really something you know suddenly Joseph Joseph ... realize you know it would it would really enjoy this I think\n[noise] right so I think the point they were making there was that the the Russian connection\nBefore it was you know it would it would really enjoy this I think\n[noise] right so I think the point they were making there was that the the Russian connection during FDR's time was overt uh and today and I guess you would to coin a phrase from CNN it's nothing burger [laughter]\nRight I mean if I mean if they ever proven with Trump which I don't know if they're ever going to um they may I don't know I'm not privy to that information but it's it's just interesting how how how to reach another red scare it's starting to repeat itself over again\nAnd here we are Seventy some odd years passed its funny which is how history repeats itself\nBecomes relevant actually interesting book I think you'll like it thanks very much for going in\nWe will uh we're heading into a break here at the at the bottom of the hour and then we will get to a more calls people are lined up in Chicago Pennsylvania Gulfport, Mississippi San Pedro California Sioux Falls South Dakota we'll get to as many of us we can\n[noise]\n[noise]\nWell comeback allows the beanie they are lined up and ready to speak with you so let's try and move quickly let's go to the wild card line yet again John his Long Beach California John good morning\nFor having me real quick thing\nOne uh if you look at a at Roosevelt might be forty four you look so bad I have a hard time thing that they had to kill him because he was gonna die anyway that's why they got rid of Henry Waller may Truman to buy for the night before or campaign 'cause they didn't make you live\nIn a bar I don't I've read up on this path with tall and how it got away with all that stuff but Roosevelt God dollar somebody to look at ... body currently to make sure that he would he would call 'cause I'm calling it a lot of that\nAnd I think it was the er the story was that he will go to ... he won that Roosevelt but we're going to break them over the cold that the\nThat to Ron and ah you know and all that and got to do what he was afraid of but current I I Can't buy that that's all I wanted him dead I think he did not want him that he wanted to live on the way that just mark my take on it\nAll right interesting John were coat hooks in bad shape you're going to die anyway All right Stephen and you want to reply [noise] um\nI you know there's a lot of people who read up on things and to the Victor goes the spoils okay a lot of the things that we've been told 'em have a bone slanted okay I'm not suggesting that what you said has been\nHe looks so bad in Nineteen forty four that was after almost two years of being poisoned systematically poison\nThat's why he look so bad in Nineteen forty four there's wasn't from the advance on polio and it's filled it out very very plainly in my book so it's a it's an interesting time in history is an awful lot of people who research lives and I learned from every one of them I'm not gonna sit here and professional every little wiring that's for sure\nBut um as far as silenced I wouldn't want to rule the world\nHe didn't he didn't have any interest in sharing anything with that we are so he sent something to look in the ... in the end of the ... someone to verify what was going on he was already being there that that was already verified from the two Russians that were in front of him when he died\nSo if if indeed that happened and it may have I'm not suggesting that it didn't if indeed that had happened it was probably just so he could uh you know get recognition of the fact that we weren't giving them some sort of falls propaganda\n[noise] All right John thank you for that to me to sing points there ah let's see how to James in Philadelphia Hi James good morning look at the coast to coast\nTrying to Richard\nI guess my question for Mr Schorr banning it in your research was ... did you come across anything about this ... an attempted coup against so Roosevelt and the thirties and that\nUh if it did happen if you came across it how close was it to happening and it was just ... uh it was exposed by an army general ... mainly butler into one of the people involved was ah I think was\nDid you come across anything about the coup how if it if it's true how posted it comes to happening\nIf it if it did happen if there was an attempted coup against Roosevelt [laughter]\nThat's something that you discuss in the book but or is it sees\nA James thanks for calling and I did run run into that information but it was after the book was published so you won't find that information in there I thought it was fascinating when I did run across it didn't make the book I'm Sorry I Wish it did um and yeah I don't really I don't know I guess that people say a lot\nWhen I did run across it didn't make the book I'm Sorry I Wish it did I'm In ... yeah I don't really I don't know I guess some people say a lot of things I don't know how true that really is\nWith the amount of people who are around Roosevelt who\nDidn't like him for multiple reasons\nI'm from you know suppressing the uh the the capitalist to holding off as as long as he did it would not would not surprise me\nBut I mean as far as as far as that's concerned I don't have any I don't have any great knowledge into that I discovered it after the book but I did run into it so thanks for calling I'm Sorry I couldn't be of much help there like I said I I I Would be lying if I said I felt that I knew everything\nLike James thank you for that way and he's in Chicago Wayne good morning welcome to coast\nThere and courage or ... you cannot do your job do you feel very returned from from nurtured married\nWow that's very

I've I've not I've not heard that before but I'd have to I'd have to look into that um [noise] I guess the question would be why why would he [noise]\nUm why would he do that I don't know Stephen have you have you ever come across anything indicating that any theory that it ... that FDR mean tried to take his own life or did they can go next\nYou know that's a new one on me uh I haven't heard that but again like I said I'm I'm\nYou know I I Know what I Know I don't know what somebody else knows [laughter] I just I just I wrote this book and I ...

radio news talk ... last night I mentioned this news talk ten ten the old C F R B had been on the radio for eighty years correction is more like Ninety\nAlso last night or should I say earlier this morning during the open line segment a number of callers shared their near death experiences or glimpses of an afterlife [noise]\nTonight in our one I'm revisiting the topic of the afterlife this time and alleged after death communication involving the great American magician escape artist Harry Houdini Houdini and his wife best were fears the bunkers of cycling ability mediums and spiritual this movement in fact\nHoudini wrote several books exposing fake mediums and there are fraudulent methods\nHoudini of course died of a ruptured appendix on October the thirty first Nineteen twenty six Halloween four days after receiving for unexpected punches to his abdomen\nBy McGill University student backstage at the princess theater in Montreal Canadian connection there on his deathbed Houdini allegedly told doctors that despite being a skeptic of after death communication if he were able to get a message to his beloved wide best he would do sell\nThen more than two years after his death his wife best attended the ...\nConducted by medium psychic Arthur for during which for allegedly channel the message from Harry using a secret coded message previously agreed to\nBy Harry and bass initially best dated public lean assigned in witness testimony that she believed Terry Haddon fact\nCommunicated to her from the grave\nLater however she recanted and stated publicly that no Harry had not communicated to er during the say odds despite this best continue to hold highly publicized San says in New York every Halloween on the anniversary of Harry's death for the next ten years\nRight right [noise] I thought it would just\nDidn't have any kind of reason to go there or do anything\nRight right I thought\nIt was I just wanted to ask you briefly about a circle is their Arthur Conan Doyle because they were area and and he were were good friends and yet\nA Doyle was a prominent spiritually so how did that how did that friendship survive the fact that Harry was such an avowed do bunker didn't have time for spirit you listen yet he's good friend and his wife were both very much into spiritualism movement\nYes yes the spears was movement is not exactly out and to find in some kind of permanent structure you know you can't say there is a leader but a lot of people did looked at the oil as the leader of the spiritual as a matter of friendship starting in around Nineteen twenty for about two years\nAnd I think the friendship came about through fame just fan crossing pass and hey how are you and they enjoy the fact that they had a different perspective and they talked about it um but eventually um there was a little bit of\nA discord between them that got so much that they did\nBreak off their friendship after a couple of years it was the oil's wife who gave a I think it was a [noise] what do you call it they automatically writing kind of reading for Harry where she claimed that he brought she bought through Harry's mother\nAnd Harry's mother the spirit of Harry's mother plays an important part in this whole thing [noise]\nUm Harry was supposedly moved but he declined to acknowledge any real evidence that there was contact and that kind of upset the oil and his wife and that was the beginning of the tension so anyway\nAs you sort of outed or in public didn't need any out her ... yeah\nYes yes uh thirty taco view um some of this play out through the newspaper which is an awkward way to have a conversation\nYou know part of this debunking that that uh Harry and Bess engaged in ... would be to sort of demonstrate I guess the audience is how it works so they would sort of do their own\nSort of photos psychic act\nOn stage and I don't know if they didn't explain to the audience you know how they were being deceived but they had this\nSecret coded method that that Harry in best could communicate with each other in order to sort of demonstrate how psychics may may be pulling these scams off can you explain the secret Cody methods um\nI think we should touch on that a little bit I don't want to go into it too much but I'm here's one way to uh anybody that's interested in business all explained in the essay quite clearly there is a list of Penn words and the ... word is actually a phrase in each word corresponds to a number number one to Ken\nAnd number can can also be taken to be zero and so this was the use to point most commonly\nTo date on a coin that's how the trick would normally work when Harry and best first met and Eighteen Ninety four that's when they got married\nThey would do this little trick where they would have someone volunteer they'd reaching their pocket ... all I Would have to laugh today just on the coastline\nAnd they these words which ... play answer say now tell and so forth these words would be correlated to a number and so that would work these words into an easy sent tens like\nQuickly area I Know you can do this and that would be number eight\nAnd so it has a natural them is to it and yet there's some information in there you see what I mean\nCry so if the coins the best held in her hand was a let's say Eighteen eighty eight\nAnd because she would say she's communicating to him verbal using these code words and she said quickly quickly is corresponds with a number eight eight eight were in in the secret code emitted so he knew that one of the numbers was age\nRight and then she might use quickly again so that would be the same number right mix says right okay\nAnd I don't want to go into the details and how it can be used to construct words rather than just\nNumbers but it can you know of course we have twenty six letters and the alphabet so you got to use a pair of words at times to get to the letters that are passed number tan but the way of doing that and that's what was used to make this code\nSo they would have had to memorize they'd have to memorize those ten words or phrases praying Hussein ... please speak quickly look be quick and as you say all of this can be found in the essay let me just because people the website if they want to follow along at home as we say infinitely mystical\nDot com infinitely mystical dot com is the website where Houdini afterlife experiment you did work the essays posted there and\nThere's a link on the coast to coast now let's talk about this code because after the message was delivered to bath and she said that it works somebody quickly said hey this was all in a book\nIs all already published in a book this is no big deal well I thought and I read this on line a number of times someone would say within a book but they wouldn't say the name of the book out of the people were saying it's on page da da da da da and they wouldn't have been named it the book is driving me crazy and then I\nFinally found someone who said the name of the book and I thought you know I'm going to look in the Santa Barbara county library and see if that book is there and I was so surprised to find out that it was in northern Santa Barbara county\nAnd for all of twenty five cents\nThey would move at book down to the downtown Santa Barbara library and I could go in there and check it out and eighty five year old book\nI couldn't believe it so I got the book\nAnd I stand the relevant pages of this book and if you're interested just follow that may not say there's a link inside there to show you scan of this book and so that book does talk about\nThose ten words and how it used to form numbers but not out of form or\nSo that's not in the book in fact there are a number of important things that are not in the book\nAnd down that see I hear some bullet points about it that the code can be used to form words not just numbers\nHow the corporate coating method works to form these words that they use this code in the afterlife experiment that the secret message would start with the onion coated word rose about that the secret message would include the word the leave and the actual\nSecret can word message none of that was in the book and the person who claimed that it was in the book\nThis is important to ask who this is he also was a famous magician and he's a close personal friend of Harry Houdini so in this person says ah it's not a trick it's in the book\nEveryone just took him at his word did not look into the book and just believed that Ford was a fraud without looking into it anymore\nOkay we need to back up a little bit because we need to introduce a Ford and and why was important for you to point out of that\nAnd we need to back up a little bit because we need to introduce a Ford and and why it was important for you to point out\nThat this secret coded message was sort of explain in another book by Houdini or about Houdini a and therefore it may have been possible for someone to know about that because now we get into the say on\nAnd and uh we should back up and explain that on Houdini deathbed in Detroit and\nOne of the last things he told doctors allegedly I don't know if this is actually true but allegedly he told them that\nI'm a skeptic I ... I don't believe in an afterlife but if there's any way I can get a message to bat I Will try and then she has contacted best is several years later correct by an Arthur Ford how did he how did for get in touch with best [noise]\nWell that's an ad in just\nA minute but I just wanted to point out that I think that this worked they can bath and Harry loved each other so much I think that's really important to point out about science runs the experiments checking into reality as the heartless machine\nAnd I think it's really important for us\nTo think about how well we love one another and how they look we are for kindness and compassion and we're not involved in a big giant heartless machine go back to your question\nI'm bored with a reasonably successful psychic and he had clients that would come to him and ask him questions and in one of these sessions in Nineteen twenty eight I think it's about I think it's about Fifteen months after Harry die [noise]\nOne of its clients is getting and reading and Harry's mother the spirit cherry ads the spirit Harry Harry mother intrude into this session and then I'm putting words forgive and all capital letters putting in a ladder and sending it to pass\nWhile that gets this letter and she very fine in writing the understanding I had\nAnd she says it's too bad this came after Harry died because of this is the word that he was looking for from his mother to show him that his mother's soul or spirit was surviving gap and got\nHer attention but what's really interesting is that neither ... nor Arthur forward pursued this anymore they didn't want to pursue Arthur Ford\nWas well aware of who ... his reputation and how strongly he was pushing back against the mediums and he\nMorning noon or night cardio mobile that you take on limited medical grade EKG\nAnd joined the peace of mind for your time today for just Ninety nine dollars mythic cardio dot com K.

A. and I think it's pronounced ... right hum she had an apartment and she invited Arthur forward over to visit her and she was going to interview him\nAnd she had some friends hiding I don't know where they're hiding in a closet but there is hiding somewhere and they're going to witness this exchange\nWell the person that shows up is not really author Ford it's someone that's been paid doing person ate Arthur forward and he shows up and he says uh I paid Mrs Houdini some money she gave me the code I'm just here to tell you the truth [laughter] I just you know it's really funny because\nBats heard about at well as the reporter wrote this up\nAnd so bass responded in a ladder um to that same paper where she just completely denies that there's she's been a party of fraud in any way and if Arthur Ford\nSaid that they were in cahoots he's a liar I mean she's very clear in this letter goes on and on and I'd never seen this letter until um yesterday and it sent an article posted\nOn a website and the author's name is Greg new Kirk I'm so it's\nThere and this was written to Walter windshield the great Walter wind chill that's\nWhat I thought I had read that there was a letter written to watch Walter wind chill and he was um yes the social they go to guy you know and um but this\nKind of made it look like it was a letter written to this um the New York evening graphic but it doesn't matter there may have been two letters but she was very supportive and these these were supposed to be private letters\nLetter starts off saying this letter is not for publicity I Do not need publicity\nYou know I'm just telling you I was no party Danny fraud you know but anyway um there's a number of things like this where it looks like someone saying aha we've got prove there's fraud he can fast and then it's like yeah but that wasn't him his lawyer said he was somewhere else at the time\nSo Arthur Ford didn't go to this meeting with this reporter at all\nRight however at some point best Houdini further uh money's the water because although she has been insisting and insisting that had happened other than she does an abrupt about face\nYes [noise] and you know in the very first days after the message happened\nIn one of the newspaper articles I read something where she says oh by the way my family and friends they don't buy this you know they don't believe in their communication you know and so I mean I think that this faster and she was tired of being ridiculed by her friends\nBeing labeled and not um and I think she just told that and said you know what I'm ... I'm I'm going to go back to my friends I Want them to access accept me um and she even said things like\nIf anyone says they get in touch with me after my death and know that it's false I Will not try to get in touch with\nIf anyone says they get in touch with me after my dad to know that it's false I Will not try to get in touch with anyone [noise] um so this also muddy the water\nAnd and when I mean how long after the stay on twenty nine was she re camping and changing their position\nI think it was about fourteen month\nFourteen months and but also she had at some point she had offered up a an award a reward ten thousand dollar prize to allow anyone to ten thousand but and then she refused to pay for it so we really interesting\nTo yeah because you know if he really wasn't ... with Arthur Ford he could have\nDone this much more gracefully she basically said hey look I'm not paying because a couple of weeks before this happened I retracted the offer well that sounds you know pretty\nPretty iffy whereas if they were in cahoots he could've said I'm so happy that she's so generous but I don't want my spiritual\nSearch at USC cell Newhart media center in Vermillion seminars

FDR is is one of those presidents that you either you either loved him or hated him and\nHe certainly made a lot of uh of enemies rate out of the gates let's let's talk a little bit about\nUh what was happening in America when he came into the White House and of course the United states at this point is is in a mired in it you know horrible devastating depression like six percent unemployment and the banks system failed and said paint that picture for us how bad it was\nIt was pretty bad ah you know the president preceding Hoover had already are counting me going and of course swimming or even remember the roaring twenties well let me go you know I'm you know things were starting to\nWe're starting to ... to be able to afford luxuries and the country over got in and fill it with the knowledge and lovers and raise the taxes and put some regulations on in here that fast\nAnd ah you know so here comes FDR in ... says there's a lot of people who are really in trouble and suffering so he has a ... of legislation a in a you know in order to help these people in or so he thought\nAnd he did he did a great deal of help for a lot of people we put people to work and it was on the government or the grammar paycheck and um\nThis was the ... experiment from the communists the communist part of the United states of America had already set up camp in Nineteen Nineteen in this country okay so all of this information or was coming through\nHis friends and the Communist Party of the United states of America and they're still in existence by the way and then a mere study or and so this is was their idea of how to help the workers in the working class\nAnd there was a flood of legislation or were they just basically regulated everything from banking to basically if you if you if you were able to take oxygen FDR regulated it at that point everything from farms to banking food to securities act and all points in between\nSo this was done to put every once in a work on the government do so we can have the cradle to grave wonderful society that style and and the Soviets had fooled us into thinking existed\nNew ideology they thought that it was going to be this great thing where we're going to escape the uh the peaks and valleys of communism and you know the government was in charge of everything and all this new wonderful\n... valleys in capitalism I think you meant the I think he's the communism ...\nI'm Sorry about that I hear the words of pitfalls and valleys in a ... of of of capitalism you know so right\n... ... if I might you can because you you are you you print the list of legislative\nUm actions that were enacted\nA in in who murdered FDR and I'm just read here I'm In the emergency banking act the government economy acted beer wine revenue at\nThe creation of the civilian conservation corps abandonment of gold standard the federal emergency relief jak agricultural adjustment act emergency far mortgage jak Tennessee Valley authority ac securities act aggregation of gold payment clause homeowners look lone act\nGlass Steagall banking act natural industrial Recovery Act emergency railroad transportation act and the farm credit act um\nAnd he I mean he did this really without much cooperation from the Congress didn't he\n[laughter] he just basically ran that through how wasn't going to board everybody with that Richard I'm Glad you did that I Will not\nDo that I'm happy to board them with a here [laughter] so I mean it's just a laundry list but it's just it gives you a sense because you mentioned you know that this was right out of almost like the communist manifesto that that he had the kind of control that Stalin had in the Soviet Union which is kind of an interesting parallel\n... it's very true it granted it was the Walt Disney version of it but it was it certainly\nIt certainly was the same basic control he was carrying\nJust like Stalin style and just push all of his enemies you know if you got no way of style and you know you ended up dead his first two was his doctor who he told things to\nUm you know he he just went crazy um the great purge was basically a show trials to put anybody to death for either to disagree with America challenging politically\nAnd Stalin did it FDR did it by what packing the Supreme Court\nWill write what happened is my Nineteen thirty six he had worried you know there was an election coming so you know he thought that people were getting a little bit you know wary of the new deal so he came out with a second new deal it also wasn't working to the extent that he\nOkay [noise] so well all of this was going on in Europe is great war is brewing you know ... soon that Europe's war we're going to do our thing we're in trouble we're staying out of it so if this was a great a second new deal must be better so [noise]\nUm and they start to put a you know implement the second new deal and they start to realize that\nOkay new deal must be better so [noise] um and they start to put a you know implement and then the second new deal and they start to realize that substantial portions of it were unconstitutional so\nWe um he had to pack the Supreme Court to see if he could get it passed than it was I mean he was really really fiddling with things I mean a tremendous amount and I know in the history books\nHistory books say a lot of things are I Know the history books paid him as this wonderful magical genie of economic success he wasn't there was an economic failure people were ah they were surviving and that was about it\nThat was about all they were doing and you know unless we got into that war and started to move some goods and services\nWe were all you know we're we're we're still going to be in the new deal for until his death I mean it was it was it was a cat us it was a ... because I asked her face\nHow do you use the trading with the enemy act a key to gain more power\nLend lease\nRecently you know the the trading trading with the enemy act [noise]\n[noise] well again when he did was that was just an attempt to bolster the economy and the saying it was the same thing with the with the wind lease program\nHe was moving you know munitions and goods and services to the to the to between the axis powers and he was giving them to the to our allies you know a free France included and eventually the Soviet Union\nSo that we could win and they were just running up a cash register to be paid back at a later time so there's a you know there's there's a lot going on here I mean he started or he had to do that because he started to realize the new deal was not working\nSo there was that there was a lot going on economically in in our country and then there came to a point where he knew that we had to get into this war\nAnd the spies indeed and\nYou know we have spies who I Know I Know it sounds terrible we do all countries have them we have spies to our spies in Germany were starting to tell us\nThey're finishing your heavy water experiments and with the beats who rockets to carry the nuclear weapons all for it so the globe we'd be speaking German right now\nI mean they were on the brain so we had to get into this war for economic reasons and for other reasons for the great catalyst hear what's going on fascinating time in history scary time in history\n[laughter] when the book you argue as many as ... a man that that FDR new Japanese attack on the U.S was coming the only question was when um then the question is did he get he sort of make it happen beanie let it happen or what you just sort of glad of that
