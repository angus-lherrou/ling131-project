we're going to go to Mars when I'm either ... or one of us ... and we're one of its competitors takes a fair um space sex is pushing hard a following up their success with the Falcon Heavy launch

now [noise]\nYou know NASA is does great work with its robotic planetary missions Senate space astronomy missions uh [noise] their work in that field is ethic but ah the human spaceflight program is dysfunctional uh they claim they want to go to the moon but they're not even planning a reasonable plan to do that\nAnd um so I think it's gonna be one of the new kids on the block that gets us there\nAre you happy that privatization is taking off the way it is and that NASA is kind of like feeding away\nI'm happy that privatization is taking off I Am not happy that NASA's human spaceflight program is dysfunctional ah I'm not happy about that at all um the uh you know I ... it would be a disaster is NASA's robotic\nSpace flight program and space astronomy programs became is dysfunctional as the human spaceflight program but [noise]\nI mean it's really sad to see this program that I mean that storm to have it in the Nineteen sixties\nDoing this crazy stuff now where you know they say they want to go to the moon and I was at a conference in Florida a month ago or a high level NASA official that actually got up in front of an aerospace audience and said we're not ready to land on the moon we don't know how to land on\nThe moon [laughter]\nWhat happened in Nineteen sixty nine [laughter]\nYeah you you you got and maybe they're waiting for all the people that can remember that to die off so they can tell people they get it the first time\nIn that statement alone Robert will make all the people who'd dumped that we went to the moon jumper joy and say see I told you so\nWhen I got to tell you guys like him didn't take us to the mood um and I mean here's the thing you know they're saying before we go to the land on the moon we need to build a space station orbit around the ... which is totally crazy\nIt's totally crazy and it's it and they want to put it in this weird orbit which is going to be hard to get to and hard to get to the moon from it and hard to get back to it from the moon it's going to add propulsion requirements is going to add timing requirements to any lunar mission I mean let me tell you what this they call this the deep space gateway\nYeah OK and let me tell you what I call it the lunar orbit toll booth okay\n[laughter] me the the ...\nHere's an analogy let me say I offered you the following deal I Want to read you an office in Saskatoon now you're gonna have to pay to build the building\nAnd you're going to have to pay a hundred thousand dollars a month rent and it's a thirty year lease you can't get out of it and you must go there and stay there at least one month a year and if you want to fly anywhere from your home you have to pass through Saskatoon to go there\n[laughter] I'd pass a bill by pass on that deal and this thing is that I\nBuy the ... and you probably filming what have you I buy the swarm play and you'd probably want to sell me a lot\nBetter off with the swamp plant then went this\nIs why do you deal with measles doing what he's doing fell ... sex are it's a good thing you're right it's just you know for someone like you and\nAnd me the way we grew up during the space program watching NASA just kind of not do much anymore with manned space flights in and see it's disappointing Robert there really is\nWell it is and I mean look you know our parents' generation one World War two they had a government that was functional and ... built the interstate highway system and that government got us to the moon\n... and ... and now we we see this thing is just dysfunctional it's incredible\nUm I mean it's not all NASA I mean this is across the board we've had a a major deterioration in the quality of the political class in terms of its ability to execute great projects on an act on the basis of public spirit instead of partisan\nA chaos and the the the you know so\nThere it is but uh I gotta tell ya you know I was hoping that the new NASA Administrator who was delayed and getting into office for quite a while\nWould come in and say I'm not buying this crazy lunar orbit space station this is you know what the incompetence who preceded us uh you know wanting to do I'm going to straighten this out we can certainly land on the moon I was hoping Bryan it's time would do that but he didn't he just went along\nAnd I'm just shocked frankly\nA couple of weeks ago when I was in Los Angeles I had a chance through a witness the flight of one of the falcons a at night to another\nTeam back it was a reusable and it was just gorgeous Robert watching that and half the people who are looking into the skies at night uh the they didn't know what it was so he thought it was a UFO or something like that but it was big tech humor to watch it's incredible technology isn't it\nIt is although I mean one might say it's about time uh because sure we started the space age with expendable rockets and you'd figure that fifty years later we finally get him to be reusable so um\nIt sure we started the space age with expendable rockets and you'd figure that fifty years later we finally get them to be usable so I'm Better late than never and and here it is and\nAnd I got to tell you this thing that mosque is done in creating these reusable rockets and and and and and he is reduced the cost of space launch by a factor of five it was ten thousand dollars a kilogram before ... now it's two thousand dollars a kilogram traumatic\nIt's traumatic it's spectacular and it was done on a shoestring compared to [noise] um what a NASA considers normal for developing new space systems\nI mean it was done like from one tenth the money in one third of the time that anyone a it was accepting would be normal and this thing um that the results has been not only a these remarkable space systems that space excess fielding\nIt is causing a private money to get into space and a number of other advanced fields that people were helpless uh so okay Bezos has his own money's got blue origin but we now have three small launch companies\nA firefly a vector space um electron a these are small launch vehicle companies that have all gotten you know investments on the order of Seventy million hundred million dollars\nA two to field a small launch systems and it even goes beyond the the space industry we now have a fusion power startups getting funded\nBecause people you know they were looking at future parents all this is just never going to happen they keep on saying it's going to happen in Twenty years and now it's been Twenty years and I think another Twenty years\nAnd but people then say maybe it's not really an impossible technical problem maybe the problem with it [noise] and um [noise]\nI gotta tell ya I actually worked in the fusion program in the Nineteen eighties and I can remember one lunch we had at Los Alamos when the group leader looked around a table and he said to all of us\nYou know when fusion power spine I developed it's not going to be at a place like Los Alamos or Livermore it's gonna be a crock pot working in his garage yup well maybe not a crock pot in his garage but I think probably a start up working in a warehouse is going to do it\nAnd he's going to get funded and God Knows what he's going to be able to do with the Robert stay with us we're going to take a quick break we'll come back and talk more about space next hour we'll take phone calls with you Robert Zubrin our special guest tonight for a couple of hours next to the coast to coast\n\nAnd walk it back with Robert Zubrin from the bar society as we talk about space we'll take calls with Robert next hour Roberta you know ... don't you what kind of a guy is the\nOil um [noise] [noise] what can I say he an unusual guy um do you like him a\nYeah although we can be a difficult at times it has a sense of humor it's kind of dry and uh he he is\nUm [noise] [noise] [noise] okay look um\nThe thing to know about Iran is is this okay on the one side he well he is very driven is very hard working a A N T is\nA driven to want to do something great for the human future he wants to be a person for the ages [laughter] he likes money he likes cool things he can buy with money but that's not what he was about uh [noise]\nNow he he he really wants to do he wants to go down in the history books for doing something great for for human\nKind and and so that's the other side of it okay is that he doesn't just want to do great the he wants eternal or you for doing great deep so he's not Mother Teresa can be selfish and\nUh he he and he certainly um\n[noise] I'm not above using people uh [noise]\nAnd you know if you look at some of the things about him that um [noise] didn't come off so well why can getting angry that he couldn't be the one that rescued those kids in Thailand\nUm that that's the other side of it so you're a ... you know there is [laughter] um\n[noise] um that that's the other side of it so\nUh the the you know there is [noise] um\nYou know a self assigned to it but it's not selfish for money it's it's it's it's selfish for eternal glory for doing great teaches eagle about\nThat [noise] it's not exactly ego it's it's you know if you read Greek mythology like the ... this is what homers heroes are about they are about eternal glory for doing great deeds or Shakespeare's Henry the fifth\nYou know uh when he gets that speech you know we few we happy few we band of brothers he he wouldn't want anyone else there with him in action core to to fight the French because he he even though I mean the odds are more against him he doesn't want to share the glory with anyone\nSo you know that's months to a tea and um and and and so but really um [noise]\nYou know that that's the classical motive of the hero okay so I I think must hero not a hero in the sense of being a perfect person but a hero in the sense of being the kind of person\nI'm a ... [noise]\n[noise] is depicted as a hero in literature a that is a person who wants to win eternal Gloria Knight errant who goes out a ... looking to slay dragons looking to do something terrific uh ... ... and that's what he's about but you know um\nHow would you can just results Robert\n[noise] Well Jeff Bezos is much calmer a much more laid back um I don't know\nThese cells I met him once uh uh but that was certainly my impression uh\nAnd if you look at how the two companies are run a they reflect the at\nA mosque is extremely driven he wants to stun fast a he wants everything done yesterday and um the company takes chances and thus far um they're winning\n'em but it's certainly a there they pushed very hard being shows the model if his company is step by step ferociously he's not in a rush being cells strength and his weakness is that he has unlimited funds\nNow why a limited funds that sounds like a strengths doesn't it [noise]\nUm well in one sense it's obviously is up but the and the other sense it isn't because if you have unlimited funds you have unlimited time\nAnd that's why at this point space sex is racing ahead of him so this is the you know space exit the hair\nUm blue origins the tortoise\nAnd ah it'll be interesting to see who wins this race you know measles is at least ten times as rich as mosque okay so I mean must you know by the standards of you and me and almost anybody um is a very rich person he's the Ninety fourth richest person in the world according to Forbes\nAnd is he doing all this with his own money or is he getting financing what's he doing\nNo mosque or is it well he started out doing it with his own money right now it's partially his own money [noise] but he's also won a lot of contracts for launching things for NASA effort the military base so it was just doing it all with his own money okay these shows\nYou know is the richest man in the world ah and he you know he says I can just take a billion dollars worth of Amazon's stock each year sell it off I got a billion dollars I'll spend it on blue origin\nSo he he has unlimited funds and he thinks he has a limited time\nI'm much ... knows that I'm you know in aerospace a cost just people times time\nUh the quicker you just do something to cheaper costs people say things like oh if we uh uh uh uh try to do Mars you know within ten years it would cost much more no it costs much less uh because\nUh you know space programs like riding in a taxi cab and it costs you whether it's standing still or whether it's moving\nBill that is true let's talk about our mutual favorite subject in March what what's going on with some of the latest discoveries underground lakes and things like that Robert\nOh yeah well it's pretty spectacular okay the European book all these experiments or ex discoveries by the way are being made now with a [noise]\nUm something it's not exactly new but is is is finally really showing its its stuff which is a ground penetrating radar than his radar that can look through the ground and see what's underground\nAnd um the ground penetrating radar on the European Mars Express pro found an underground lake on Mars it's salt water [noise]\nUh and um but it's definitely from the point of view of microbial life a habitable environment [noise] um it's been suspected by a lot of scientists and by me um that uh there was a liquid water underground on Mars who has now been found\nAnd I believe that we're going to find a lot more because there's no reason why this lake we'd just exist in one place I think there's an underground water table on Mars uh and um you know on earth\nSome of the earliest organisms that ever lived on earth are still living deep underground in the ground water the surface of the earth has changed radically it's no longer habitable for them but the ground water is is as it was billions of years ago and they been down there and\nIf there was ever life on the surface of Mars it would have retreated into the groundwater and it'd be they're still\nNow then beyond that the ground penetrating radar on the American Mars Reconnaissance orbiter has found\nGlaciers on Mars at mid latitudes fat is I'm a mountains of pure water ice and something like\nA a million cubic kilometers\nOf pure ice covered by just a few feet of dust it's right there and it's a mid latitude said it's it's as far south is thirty eight ... a a north and the northern hemisphere Mars which by the way the same latitude a San Francisco\nSo imagine that there were glaciers\nIn San Francisco and Denver and you know a Washington DC\nYou know that's the attitude that these things are and what it means is that there's water readily available on Mars and not just you know I'm half a kilometer or a kilometer underground like this lake is but right at the surface where you could get at it with a shovel\nThat's exciting you know some people it's just strange some people say that if there's life on Mars or even the possibility that we shouldn't even go there that's that's weird\nWell this is strange [noise] some people say that if there's life on Mars or even the possibility that we shouldn't even go there that's that's weird why\nWell that's a pretty crazy point of view um I think so there's there's two they there there's two different versions of it one is the scientist saying if you go to Mars\nUm them if we find life there we won't know whether we brought it or not okay contamination\nYeah well that's like saying if you go to France you won't know if the people there are French or not I mean that the ... because they might have all gotten off the plane with you I mean look if if if\nHow do we know that there's actually people in France and they didn't all just show up when you did

extremely rich in rare earth metals in platinum group metals things like this that are extremely valuable [noise]\nAnd um once our space a capabilities advance a bit more on that will become a possible thing to do\nLet's go to John in Seattle, Washington welcome to the program John go ahead\nYou for taking my call You're welcome thank you for your your gifts and Robert Robert\nOr over a three questions of people who are\nOh probably take 'em off here [noise] they're sort of speculative\nFor the first is um\nYou know anything about Mr over here that go there but we're just talking about anti gravity back in the sixties and conversely\nYou know anything about possible reversal of being able to generate artificial gravity and secondly you know anything about electrical ... ... from\nA I mean that those three questions\nWhen you've got one more rubber got one more\nOkay one more when you're the third one is um\n... ... ... to design a space station like a ... type thing to test I'm a human physiology reacts to Mars gravity\nOr it Robert let's take that one first go ahead\nAll right well let me just to run them down quickly then maybe a provide some detail the first one of the Learjet saying the anti gravity I don't know anything about that\nSecond question artificial gravity um which goes along with your last question of a spinning space craft yeah we do know how to create artificial gravity you spin the space craft\nCrates and cheer physical force that mimics gravity and that's a uh in my view or a a a very wise thing to do on a long space voyage in order to uh prevent\nThe deterioration of bone and muscle that you can't with um\nThe route gravity\nLong range belongs to a long time so\nYeah exactly 'cause see if you you know anybody who just walks around on earth the you know not an athlete just a person that you know walks around the house goes to the store\nThey think it's somewhat of a workout 'cause they're carrying a hundred and fifty pounds on their feet and and and and and and ... you know and moving around a\nA worse in space just floating around in zero gravity you don't get that and so in fact I Do recommend artificial gravity for use on trips tomorrow so not that we couldn't survive going there and zero gravity we can\nBut if you're going to Mars to explore you don't want your astronauts arriving there in a weakened condition\nThough will do anything for their\nAnd and the the the third question was electrical pulse and yeah I Know a fair amount about electrical pulse and [noise] um electric propulsion is using\nA electric or electromagnetic forces to accelerate a pre Palance to very high velocity she can get about ten times the exhaust philosophy with an electric thrust or that you can with chemicals roster the problem though is that it requires electricity to run them and typically the power sources way a lot\nAnd that means that I'm your power is limited and therefore you're thrust is limited and what that means is that electrical pulse and systems\nAre kind of like a car that gets a thousand miles to the gallon and but it goes from zero to sixty in a week I'm not terribly useful for short distance driving around town\nBut if you were going to drive around the world and let's say there was somehow a road that went all the way around the world [noise] okay you floor of the car you know in San Francisco and [noise] um\nYou know a week later going sixty miles an hour and you've reached the east coast now you can go driving around the world 'cause your car can drive over water in this case but in any case now you you have a tremendous advantage in that you're here you're mileage is great\nBut if you're going from earth to Mars it actually takes longer to get there\nYou have a tremendous advantage in that you're here you're mileage is great but if you're going from earth to Mars it actually takes longer to get there with electric propulsion than it does with chemical bullshit [noise] if because the time it takes to speed up is longer than the time it takes to get there\nOn the other hand if you going from earth to Saturn electric propulsion would get you there faster\nRobert if you had to pick one man going back to the moon or going to Mars which would you pick\nI take Mars you would um be costs you know I mean look we went to the moon fifty years ago uh we're not going to inspire the next generation by doing things that their grandparents' generation dead\nOr the science on Mars is far more profound we're going to discover the truth about the potential uh existence and diversity of life in the universe and bars has got much more resources sent me to compare Mars to the moon\nTo choice in the age of ocean exploration Mars compares to the moon to way North America compared to queen you know Greenland was closer to Europe European scotch Greene long before they got to North America [noise]\nBut it wasn't a place where you could build a civilization that didn't have all the different resources\nAnd ah so Mars is is is you know it's a much richer world\nBut you know here's NASA and frankly it doesn't have the confidence to take on Mars well then they say well then we'll go to the moon well but I say is okay if you think you need to go to the moon before you go to Mars then get on with they go to the moon don't come off with\nSome other thing that's a halfway house you have to do before you go to the moon because if you go to the moon fifty years ago we could go to the moon now\nCan you believe ... next July will be fifty years since we went to the moon with the first time fifty years already rubber word the time go\nYeah I don't know I was Seventeen when we landed on the moon and if anybody told me then that I'd be sixty six and we'd be sitting here stuck on earth I [noise] I I Would have thought they were crazy\n[noise] yeah I Would agree east of the Rockies Joe's with us Long Island New York cage oh go ahead Rob\nIt I'm Sorry they can get to go to the mall\nBut a couple of questions are in deep space [noise]\nUh when we send out these probes are which you are or what would you be dealing with extreme heat even open space as opposed to the planet\nAnd would it be advantageous to us to kind of go to mercury though with some sort of probes in case back here we have one away a global warming due to maybe solar flares combined what CEO to increase was\nUh in other words what the spin off of dealing with extreme heat and space help us to deal with it potentially back here and also what kind of pro somewhat profile are going to Mars\nUh how would you profile a potential candidate to travel on a ship come to Mars what type of person always looking for [noise]\nAll right let me take the question is when the time the first question it the hot and space if you're close to the sun um if you are far away from the sun is called ... and\nIf you're in earth orbit and climate depends on whether you're in the sun right now or not\nUm [noise] but um\nYou know we do have a kind of I mean you ... you can get the reason why spacesuit so why is because they they can overheat Trump sunlight and they want to reflect most\nAs much as you can write a\nOn the other hand things that are in shadow even in earth orbit can get cold so you kind of have to watch that uh but space itself\nDoesn't really have a temperature but certainly the the power of the sun is much more when you're close to it and you get hotter much faster [noise] um now second question\nProfiles some people\nOkay hold on for a second the Robert we're going to hit the brake already school by fast food you Robert ... with us we'll be back well ah let them finish up your questions there and the interesting what kind of a personality would want to go to Mars will be back in a moment on coast to coast am\nCalled national debt relief at age ...\nHappened you used to go hours without visiting the bathroom now it seems

final segment with Robert Zubrin here from the Martian study Roberts websites by the way are linked up it goes to goes to end up what Robert you you have looked at profiles of people and personalities who would love to go to Mars what are they like\n[noise] well um well there's all sorts of people that say they want to go to Mars uh [noise]\nUm I mean quite literally and and some are people that uh\nYou might well one on a crew a it's going to Mars and others not a chance that the caller asked what sort of people would I select to go to Mars [noise] um [noise] and I'll tell you it's real simple it's the same sort of people that you would like to go on a ...\nA a hiking expedition with you [laughter] I'm a or an exploration ah adventure of any kind um they're the people who you know\nHave a high spirits are fun to be with ... sense of humor a you know or not you know a ... um and and and ... and and and you know and and the people who can laugh when things go wrong and people who you know our one for all in all for one\nYou want to take to Mars what's going on with the your August conflict you're working on\n[noise] ah well we're having another conference a in August uh or actually this year it might be in September in Los Angeles I'm In ... he could ah it it's probably going to be at one of the major universities in Los Angeles [noise]\nUm and ah\nI'm sure we're going to have all sorts of debates about things like is this lunar orbit gateway or is it a gateway or is it a toll booth\nOkay you know we're going to have that one out um you know we're going to have all sorts of presentations on the latest discoveries [laughter] you know ... there's a Mars probe on its way it's going to land in November ... insight\nAnd it's going to find out how geologically active Mars is so that's kind of land this November and he'll probably have [noise]\nUm [noise] discoveries from ... um [noise] there's also a new space telescope that just got into orbit um a couple of months ago which will be reporting data discovering planets going around other stars\nOr am I guess it will have discovered hundreds by them you will pop you discover thousands what's done I'm Cass um you know a will you know since we're going to be in Los Angeles will have a scientist from Jet Propulsion lab coming over and [noise]\nTalking about a um all the latest discoveries from the rovers on Mars and the plans for the next one's ah probably have space X people talking about what they're up to I'm hoping to get flu arching people there too so we can hear from them\nAnd maybe some from the the the small entrepreneur rocket companies like factory space just got funded by Seventy million dollars to\nCreate small countries you know the we now have small satellites that can do what it used to take big satellites to do and so small rockets make sense um and um I I myself I'm involved design of a mission to go to the moon with ground penetrating radar\nWith for satellites each of which are the size of a shoe box um and so little launchers life this could really play a role I'm\nAll right let's take a few more calls for you let's go to the first time caller Armand in a bell gardens California go ahead Armand\nYes good evening George did you and your guest I just wanted to put something on your radar screen so to speak\nAnd that is that you may not be aware of this but there is a whole new paradigm for water planetary water\nOn not only earth but on march if you're interested in learning more about it you can go to jail water I. M. T. L. dot com like international geo water international\nAnd the reality is that it's already been demonstrated on this planet but the water comes from them that well below at whatever you got the ... the planet fractured\nThat water that hydrogen and oxygen element of hydrogen auction can make it's related to the surface I moved back in areas it'll go ... the process for sure that happens quite often\nAnd on Mars the same effect is there in fact the largest ball you know in the solar system though and puts moms are bars where it gets over eighty thousand feet tall just perked their jets\nThere is that called on top\nAnd that's what ... her provide Scott city or lava flows to happen so that's really where the water has always been on Mars and that's where the water is on this planet and it's time I think for us to start factoring that is true our calculations for hours trip\nWell said Robert what do you think\nWell I I it sounds interesting we certainly know there's a lot of water on Mars we found the lakes found glaciers in this probably more to find so I think he's on the right track\nDo you think\nWe are the Martians that's a long time ago either\nOrganisms flew here ... ... it'll chopped up media writes a slowing off the planet or\nOr maybe they had a full blown civilization long time ago\nAnd the ... I think I think the former is is this a good chance is true or not civilizations but a microbes on\nYeah I think I think the former is is this a good chance is true\nAh in not civilizations but microbes on on meteors a because Mars um well a couple things first of all life appeared on earth almost immediately after it could [noise]\nWhich either means one of two things that life can evolve very quickly from chemistry or that life was floating around in space and as soon as the earth was cool enough\nFor life to to prosper here they landed in the seeds to cold as it were\nUm and now if you think about that then you say here's Mars nearby it's being hit by meteors knocking chunks off sending them flying and hitting the earth were hit by Mars meteorites all the time [noise] um if life could evolve quickly\nOut of chemistry it would have on Mars Mars coup before earth to Mars have liquid water before or is it [noise] so life is is is a quick study evolving rapidly from chemistry it would've occurred on Mars first and then it would have landed here\nSo there is a good chance that it came for Mars the the the the a and also that is supported by the fact that we find no organisms on earth no free living organisms simpler than bacteria and bacteria really pretty complicated they have this book [laughter]\nSure of DNA in are in a whole alphabet for transmitting genetic information [noise] um you know or imagined you you've found a um an ancient manuscript that\nI had a complete alphabet along with all the punctuation marks and everything and uh it could not possibly be the first written document that they would have to be more primitive things before\nYou know the complete alphabet and punctuation and comments and paragraphs and all this had been worked out\nSo uh but bacteria have all that so that suggests\nThat they came here already fully developed it could've come from Mars or maybe both earth and Mars gotten in it for interstellar space\nI just lost his how did you get interested in all this Robert\nSputnik that did it for yeah\nYeah well I was already somewhat interested I I was an early reader I was five when Sputnik flu\nAnd while to the adult world split it may have been a terrifying event to me it was just great ah because what it was proving was that the um the space faring uh stories that I was reading we're going to be true\nAnd I can

education is your best defense against sickness and misery inspired by visiting critical Health News dot com you can purchase modular nutrition facts and see the yourself how you can feel\nOf as you say some people do get these experiences why not\nWell I I think it actually comes down to something I'm pretty mundane [laughter] I\nThere's a lot of research out there in something called environmental insensitivity All right and um what environmental sensitivity as it's not like psychics sensitivity it's not like I'm chip coffee and Sylvia brown and and those types of psychic sensitivity where your mediums and\nUm you have psychic abilities but something as simple and concrete as sort of our ability to taste touch and smell and that's what environmental sensitivity is\nI'm so those who are environmentally sensitive are simply picking up on the environment to a higher degree than the normal population\nSo if you think about this as humans man you we both experienced the world differently we're both affected by and react to the environment in different ways\nBut the physical environment affect certain people more than others and this leads to all kinds of conditions and dysfunctions\nUm there is a researcher out there Michael ... hour who categorize these environmentally sensitive people um and what he found was people who are environmentally sensitive have longstanding allergies chronic pain fatigue migraines fibromyalgia and just an\nOvert sensitivity to light found electricity\nAnd smells more than maybe me and you do so I could walk into a room and be fine other people could walk into the same room and they smell cologne from all over the place they all get\nBashes [laughter] so he's environmentally sensitive people actually way way way more paranormal experiences than the general population\nUm there's those higher it's a really high number\nAnd what the thought is is these environmentally sensitive people are picking up on whether it's X Darnell magnetic fields more than the general population in other words they have a better antenna or biological radio\nAnd the electromagnetic spectrum than other people so we all are we all have radios with basic equipment the tune into things but some people have really really really redefined are sensitive radios\nAnd they're picking up on things in it and detecting things in the environment that normal people don't pick up for the general population doesn't it [laughter]\nSo this ability to truly experience paranormal phenomenon it's it's more likely to be detected a registered among this group and I think that's a fascinating thing so we have environmental sensitivity which there's a lot of research suggesting obviously it's viable and it's real I think in Canada you can be on disability for certain types of environmental sensitivity\nSo there's science behind it and then there's also signed saying these people are having way more ghostly encounters why is\nThat and then that's kind of where we go a little further into that\nTo some of these people didn't realize how sensitive they are taking all these things do they know they get it\nI I think they do it in and and when I go out there and I ... my research was done I had I talked to a lot of people who are environmentally sensitive and what you find is you know\nOnly or do they pick up on things or have way more paranormal experiences but it's genetics so their mom get to wear their dad and then they're ... and so forth and so on so this is something\nKind of like most you know genetic diseases or or what not this kind of passed down from generation\nKinda like most [noise] you know genetic diseases or or whatnot just kind of passed down from generation and listen they know they're sensitive to the environment um\nJust by walking into places some people\nYou know like I said get rash of 'em they can't um the under neon lights some people almost allergic to electricity or so these types of people just experienced a different world and and believe me they know it affects them probably more negatively to that does positively\n[noise] you know you talked about some of the reality television shows Brenda my a criticism of them\nBecause they always seem that they have to have some kind of\nGoes Leon tone or because of television and you know they don't want to do their three minute or one hour program and not have anything happen so looks like to create these things and I think that kinda hurts the credibility of some of these uh episodes don't you\n[noise] [noise] yeah I think it I think it it it really does too because it implies that if either people or misinterpreting normal things or there's over fraud and um\nYou know ... those those people who do this on a regular basis and are genuine do you know out of ten locations that you go to you might have one experience\nIt's really impossible to have you know thirty or forty experience 'cause every time you go to a location 'cause then it's your money in the water and I and then you kind of lean towards that that fried type\nOf thing so we've we've talked about the individual who might have the ability to spot goes to fuel ghost more than others but what about the ghost itself or there's some goes that come back more often than others or because they have an ability to do that\n[noise] um I think it's really I guess which one is stronger and when you think about it is the person's ability to sense that goes if if I'm really sensitive to it I'm going to pick up goes way encounters a lot more than everyone else\nSo I might pick up on a ghostly encounter a civil war soldier I'm very often if I'm really\nSense I mean a good a good radio or real good radio probably from she crane has the ability to pick up all week signal from a radio station\n... isn't that much that way with the person that if that person is a good receiver he or she may be more apt to pick up these ... things\nExactly yeah exactly so you know ... and ... and that that kind of boils down to the environmental sensitive per se\nUm they are going to have way way way more goes the encounters and um so I think it has to do fear prior question I think it has to do mainly with the person not so much that goes for encounter the environment but you have to ask you know hey I'm an environmentally sensitive person I pick up on all this stuff\nYou know I go from place to place to place throughout my day however one location I'm picking up a lot of\nUm having a lot of goes the phenomenon happened to me um the places pretty active whereas in other places are so then you start asking yourself why why that place and and why not the other places um so then you have to go into why is the location have more um paranormal phenomenon\n... out of that other locations you know it's like those antennas we had the rabbit here was\nYou know why is this configuration picking up channel thirty three and this configuration that you know what I'm saying you have to figure out the right combination of things that happen for um the TV to show up in a clear picture and the same with ghostly encounters you have to figure out the right sort of ingredients\nAre variable of that line up the habit goes counter location is one person has to 'em and then there's there's probably other ones that I you know we haven't really identified at this point but the person not only of their sensitivity but their internal ... electric\nA consciousness of all this stuff really plays into it and it's really fascinating to me it\nReally is I remember when my dad brought home a better TV him to do was the kind that didn't just move with the rabbit ears but it had like a little uh knob on it then you click\nIn and brought into signal better that way too and I thought to use this technology amazing how times have changed Brenda\n[laughter] I remember those two [laughter]\nDo you know or have you come across demonic spirits in your work\nUh no I haven't and I'm I get that question a lot though the the team a question of seems to be getting more and more prevalent in the last five years or so\nI think you know when you have it go sleep counter or you have some sort of phenomenon happened to you it's amazing it's great uh and then you want to start maybe putting labels on it you know this experience what the good the\nBad weather the positive that this was a fat and I think when you start putting negative to it then you start feeling like it's the Monica ... really the Monica deem and it's more of a religious perspective than it is sort of um\nYou know like a scientific perspective so usually whoever classify this is a demon or um you know a regular goes I think there's more of a religious pills to it\nUm that's where I usually when I meet them at all it's just they're they're very religious as well um so I think there's a little little that labeling going on\nFor me it's an experience um and some people perceive it as good or bad I might perceive one experience being really positive you might have the same experience can be terrified and believe it's negative and then kind of you go towards the more demonic part of things [laughter]\nSo I I really enjoyed not enjoy it but I have the experience I research experience and I don't try to put the beam and label on anything\nWell

I'll go with this one\nPerfect um trick or treat [laughter]\nMy wife passed away unexpectedly over the summer while it's been difficult I managed to care for the house of myself\nAs Halloween approached I was putting up decorations advocate in the neighborhood usually love trick or treating my wife and I had bought a plastic pumpkin together when we first got married Twenty years ago we have places Plaskin plastic pumpkin and our window every Halloween\nI searched out for days looking for that park until I finally gave up a few days after giving up I was walking down the staircase and I was shocked to see my wife standing at the bottom\nShe smiled and whispered check behind the workbench and then vanished I began to weep uncontrollably and rushed out to the garage huge smile came across my face of the plastic punk and was laying behind the workbench it must have fallen off the top shelf\n[noise] so\n[laughter] this is a great example of a you mentioned it before and intelligent hiding or goes they're acting with us\nSo in this case you know the goats during his go counter to go out of conscience\nAnd she was actually giving information that the husband wanted so they're aware of their surroundings they they're giving information they're not sort of confined to an area they're interacting with the witness\nUm they're not like routine specific like they don't just show up every day on that are on the twenty fifth of mayor on Christmas Eve or anything like that [noise]\nSo this direct interaction um it's sort of the ... the cream of the crop when it comes to go slowly encounters\nA and these are the most rare ones that I've been talking with people these are the most rare when you have like I'm In college and the interaction the giving information which is verified um this is sort of what we all seek in a way of those who investigated the paranormal\nZero pecking order on the other side Brandon in in your opinion of over ... I mean who sends the ghost back to do what it does it does it do it on its own or is there some organization that's involved in doing that on the other side\n[noise] I'm a strong believer and conscious this so you know who who we are as people are are personality our memories are um everything that we are um after we die you know what happened to that right\nOr some people will say that we're just computers and when the guy who everything of who we are memories or ... it just seems to exist [noise]\nUm and that's kind of mainstream science says you but when you look at things\nIf consciousness survive death and that goes in it and it continues to exist\nIt's it could maybe it really be in the environment to some degree and I think when needed maybe like ... example with the husband when needed he can sort of resonate or or link up with the consciousness of his past wife\nSo I don't think it's a pecking order as much as you know someone just really need something and then they sort of resonate with the consciousness of of a path love one and then these experience maybe happened [noise]\nSo yeah you know I I really believe that there's obviously things in the environment that we don't know about and they ...\nYou have this [noise] so yeah you know I I really believe that there's obviously things in the environment that that we don't know about and the consciousness I'm electromagnetic fields all this stuff that really happens in the environment\nIs really important uh Michael pursing or who recently passed away but it was a neuropsychologist basically said and he did all of the numbers by this but the the environment holds enough energy for every every person that ever ever lived their consciousness to exist at it\nUm which means we have access to memories from Abraham Lincoln civilian a kid it's it's all out there and the environment has enough energy to store all that and then maybe some people can just connect with that or resonate with that and that's when he's great experiences happen\n[noise] what do you say the skeptics Brenda who see these people who have these encounters or mentally unstable or something even worse\n[laughter] yeah unfortunately I think you know when someone tells you a ghost we encounter um a lot of people will just kind of say well you're crazy and they kind of said jokingly but it really makes the other person feel like they're you know they might be crazy [laughter]\nUm so you you know what I usually tell people who\nMove skeptics or or things like that I usually just basically kind of go over listen you know and in my experience it's all I Do all day is diagnosed mental health and and you\nKnow you see it all\nYeah I mean my job I worked in the ER for seven years so I just did behavioral health assessments I've met floors in the ER and I've I've done probably five thousand assessments of over the course of ten years [noise]\nUm so I Know how to parcel out you know significant mental health issues and all these real life and counters that I've come across um Ninety nine point nine percent of them are from people who are genuine and had a subjective paranormal experience\nThat's huge yeah you know and and I think that it's easy to say oh you're crazy or your this or you're that or your unstable or you're losing aiding or you're drinking too much or withdrawing or whatever the situation is\nMuch less than ... in my professional opinion a lot of these go sign counters are just as there are genuine and the people's eyes it's not the result of mental illness\nWell I've always found that skepticism as healthy as long as a true skeptic has an open mind ...\nExactly exactly you know it's it's really easy to beef you know a steadfast believer or a steadfast skeptic right\nBecause you can just in golf yourself and whatever your reading journals magazines books\nAnd it's really easy to sort of said on everything is everything is not a goes through everything as that goes\nIt's being in between an open minded is the most rewarding and challenging because you have to take both sides you have to read the skeptical stuff and you also have to read them believe the believers stuff and you have to have common sense in a way and sort of parcel out what's\nYou know what's broader fake or just people being overzealous and then come up with your own conclusions and that's where you're right the open mindedness part of the essential when it comes to being involved in the paranoia\nUptick for I'm pretty much a majority of my life\nChanged you [laughter] you know I I when people would tell me\nAnd I was really interested in Paris psychology like I said before but I never had an experience so I always kind of thought well these people who are having experiences maybe they're just misinterpreting things and just getting it wrong so when people are telling me experiences I Would kind of sit there and that they're talking I wouldn't even listen to him I Would just sort of go over how to ... or what could be happening\nAnd then I just sit back and you know I'm going to start listening and I started listening and I'm like oh okay and then I started picking up books like um Carl Young's collective unconscious shell Drake stuff I'm Harold tax than birds life feels\nDuring the ... Moody's work\nYes exactly near death experience at all this stuff\nAnd you start reading it and you go wait a minute there's actually this might be happening and then you go deeper down that rabbit hole and you're reading research articles about untangle matter and then you kinda go wait a minute this is actually somewhat possible and then you know as far as ... the and things like that\nI mean the research on that is growing every year um but I Know every year I'm reading more and more journal articles which historically give credence to the idea that come up at the end ESPN aside phenomenon is legit and then you're like whoa wait a minute if all this is saying this and these ghostly encounters could be possible as well\nAnd that's kind of what led me into it from a skeptical to more of a believer part I think\nAfter years of fundraising\nAbreast could go with our son was mugged near the family home in Omaha off Roscoe records\nUsed twice in our breaking news when it happens on five Seventy\nHustler supers Ilan lowers had been built for speech or is he delivers superior quality of cut much less operator come here we're ready to go reliability year after year much more is our first and last all about getting the job done fast\nMe for believing Fifteen mile an hour which is that no other ... in America\nMatch the hustler supersede see the ... governments formed supply five miles west of candles South Dakota\nSomebody who\nAuto makers that you become America's Best selling brand\nIt's three o'clock\nHe's CBS News on the hour sponsored by the recruiter\nI'm Lenny to lead a caravan of immigrants in southern Mexico had swelled to more than seven thousand CBS is Adriana Diaz says they're\nHere only wearing sandals\nThat only one hundred degree heat exhaustion and souls Jessica ... brought her strongest child with her she left her for others in ...\nA city that my my dad also from other parts\nThat I can say\nShe goes the harder it is that her children are farther away from\nAnd migrants continue toward the border hoping to find something the U.S government\nTurkey says it will cooperate if there is an independent investigation into the death than journalists ...

environment and having an experience with some guy\nYou know there's that intelligent hunting that sort of like the cream of the crop you know those types of things are harder to explain in and sometimes that falls into an earth bounce spirit but I I don't necessarily think they hang around in the walls and kind of watch us in a way\nUm you know just like when we walk into a hunting building it's not like a zoo where we have to you know call out for the goes to come out and you know try to encourage them er instigate them by yelling at them\nYou know it it it doesn't to me it doesn't work like that there's so many complex processes that happen whether it's the person the environment of the resonating the frequencies all the stuff we talked about earlier\nThat just simply yelling ghost come out is not sufficient enough in my view I I think there's a lot more to go into it\nWe teach in Rochester New York Yankees\nI'd like to ask about possible or early imprint teams and the brain that might explain to an extent\nWhy people see ghost like others I've seen film of the baby ... being fed by humans with hand puppets made to look like the mother so wouldn't return to the wild the chicks\nNoted key in on a mother conned or are you mentioned the window or who was searching for the pumpkin and his\nWife appeared and then goes gone I've never had any experience like that but the closest I've had over many years I'm now sixty three I Will rub my eyes in various ways and all different kinds of\nThings here will appear before me a figures that again bringing up imprinting I Would not think would have a Kurd with in me a different figures in all different kinds\nFigures that again bringing up imprinting I Would not think would have a Kurd with an me a different figures in all different kinds of actions some of them quite grow pass\nAnd I'm sure that those are ... by definition\nBut just kind of bringing us together and closing a one about imprint teens that like with a window or a scene his wife saying look at a\nUh in the back of the garage I Can't imprint teens can people be so emotionally attached and mentally like a husband to his wife that\nHe would see his wife orange the rest of us would not and maybe I in my life which you things that the rest of you would not\nMm [noise] yeah [noise] yeah it's it [noise] I I don't think that's a tough one to answer I I think that you know I I\nIt's a little bit with a widower they were talking about if a little bit like he is resonating with something in the environment that's why he's saying his wife he's not saying Abraham Lincoln or whoever else\nSo it specific to him there's a there's sort of a connection to him you know as as we're driving down the street in our in our cars there's radio signals all around us but if I turn my radio station in Ninety two point five I only pick up Ninety two point five\nBecause we're matching frequencies so with a husband and wife with ... and a mother they match frequencies and that's one of these sort of experience happened\nAs far as an imprint goes I'm if I'm understanding that the way you're you're describing a ... there is I mean Carl young had this idea of collective unconscious\nSo were all born with these archetypes and the sort of a blueprint for how to really manage life um so we're sort of imprinted um\nWith with with these archetypes and and with sort of\nAncestral beliefs that are common throughout every culture that's happening so this could be me here at Ohio or you know um people in other countries we all have similar sort of\nVisions and stories and things like that\nSo I think we're all imprinted I'm In a grand gesture but it could be more specific for cultures it could be more specific for families can be imprinted I'm with certain information so you pass that down to your family\nUm so it could be more micro then macro when it comes to this collective archetypes that are out there so I think there is something to the imprint I I I couldn't answer your question differently but that's sort of my best guess that it\nDoes religion kind of changed your views about the knees aspirations ghostly encounters\n[laughter] yeah I I think it's it it changes our views and I basically changes our perception of an experience so\nYou know you can have someone who's a devout religious person at the same experience as someone who is not\nThe religious person might perceive that as more of um like we talked about earlier a demon or an angel or I'm a of of a sign from from God are assigned from a deceased person that they love\nUm whereas a person who doesn't have that religious tell to it might experience said as simply you know an experience or or um mundane thing or ambiguous stimuli so everyone's\nEveryone's pass sort of influences how we perceive any sort of ... paranormal phenomenon\nUm and that's why we talked about before you know the believers are automatically going to go to whatever they believe in and if they believe in earth bound spirits everything is that are found spirit [noise] ah so I think perception religion or they play a huge part and how we perceive a ghostly encounters a paranormal phenomenon\nHave you ever witnessed an extra ...\nNo I never witnessed that would you like to [noise] um [noise]\nAs long as it's not yours [laughter]\n[laughter] you know I was somewhat although I did interview a while back and and I I Can't remember what I said but I just kind of like yeah I'd love to have an experience like that and then someone emails me and says careful what you wish for those types\nOf foods that you know [laughter]\nSo I don't wish to be part of an exercise but scientifically are worth my fascination I'd love to sort of be part and sort of gain some information from that or knowledge\nI Am very curious about executions and you know how they can get this demon disappearing demon out of the person's system and you know be gone in ... it's really weird and remarkable it's the same time\n[noise] yeah yeah it it's just my brain always goes to there's a there's so much misinformation and mismanagement of things like that and possibly fraud that I I'd have to be there to experience it for me to ... okay yeah I Believe that\nLet's go to Sally in North Dakota Hi Sally go ahead\nWell why don't you know I mean I'm ...\nI'm kids couldn't have talked about a serious\nCar wreck when apple yet my\nWell my daughter Christian [noise] you know in she was down on the lake [laughter]\nJust having a blast and uh she came home with a sunburn and ah my hands and then I came home early from a bank rally and he had painter twenty\nDollars to mow the lawn and it's\nPretty big blonde\nAnd he says well she got her money you know kind of ... counts chicken and she just cry didn't catch his son burn Bonnie nice to ... ... ... she she\nJust get it done it's the new deal cake and then I had to go to work\nAnd teach\nHer grandfather lay down on the couch and\n[noise] [noise] well ...\nWhat happened she got into her car\nShe got into her car there was a corn do by\n[noise] but she always Salt Lake was a ... car and then her boyfriend was there and he knew\nWho who are in the back of his pickup ... who was driving a car smelling she was\nShe driving car George and she didn't wear\nAnd\nSo you don't need to can were what Eighteen Nineteen years old and they were kind of challenge\nThen let me ask you this ... are you getting visitations\nAnd they were kind of look at it too well\nAnd let me ask you this so Shelley are you getting visitations from her now\nGeorge\nI in a lot is known\n... nobody there\nStrange phone numbers no doubt or your caller i._d.\nRight right right do you think she's trying to communicate with you\nI knew I shall not really sure like\nYou may be All right let's get Brandon's take on that when we come back and just a moment Brandon remembered the story and uh let's just get your reaction to that because I Do think loved ones\nDuring moments of tragedy like that do try to make an effort to come back and communicate that does happen we'll be back in the moment with spinal calls from coast to coast to\nAnd what stories like that more people are interested in owning it\nWow that's quite a pizza [laughter] and that's where you come in\nRight bitcoin is a little tricky to buying holding an IRA so we make it easy we do all the work\nKevin is bitcoin or currency\nIt can be used as a currency but right now we see it being used as an asset like gold and silver but in digital form\nHow much is bitcoin right now\nJust over sixty five hundred dollars but at one point Georgia was worth over twenty thousand that's why people want to own it\nYou say you make it easy to own bitcoin in your IRA talk about that\nGeorge we do all the work we buy it for you holding insecure account and sell it for you any proceed you accumulate will be retained tax deferred until you take a distribution\nKevin any of our listeners want to learn more about the bitcoin are re what can they do\nThey can call for a free book at one eight hundred five seven nine sixty sixty or visit black man IRA dot com that one eight hundred five seven nine sixty sixty or visit black man IRA dot com\nThanks again Kevin in once again you can call for a free market one eight hundred five seven nine sixty sixty one eight hundred and five seven nine sixty sixty or visit block them into our a dot com\n\n\nThan walk it back to the coast to coast George story along with Brendan will sue law in his book of course called the ghost studies and brand and we're going to go back to selling a just a moment here Sally in North Dakota has a situation where her daughter died sadly in a car crash\nA but she's getting visitation Sally how often are these visitations occurring\nShe's she's not there anymore okay well I'll get your reaction to that Brandon what do you think's going on\n[noise] well that's actually becoming more and more common um and I've heard more and more stories about the last ten years but this this idea that\nYou know somehow um goes are utilizing electric electrical equipment to communicate for that's like phone tax emails the types of things\nUm you know typically people will report they'll get hang ups from a family members lumber who's been deceased for whether it's five days or five years\nI'm getting text messages from them you know after their death or you know these types of things and there's a there's a book out there that I'm a fair psychologist Dr column Cooper road called telephone calls from the dead\nWhich encompasses a great age have\nLess of a bunch of these um phenomenon that are happening and then there's the phantom menace methods which has recently came out as well which goes over this is well it's hard to really know that to me I mean listen to the idea that um\nGoes sir consciousness or wherever you want to call it ... electrical electrical equipment has been going on for a while so you know to to know the exact or how that's happening I'm not sure but anytime we talked about this and there was times say anytime there's some sort of trauma or crisis or life threatening events\nLike she was talking about um it increases the probability of these types of things happening so we we the only thing we can do is try to save these consistency there are similarities and then try to find the answers as best we can from the back and [noise]\nHow do you change skeptics mind Brandon can you\nThe best we can from the back and\nChange is getting smaller and you\nKnow I think you could um put some some doubt and education in there about what could possibly be happening [noise] ah it's it's a challenging it's challenging because you know at this point go start measurable phenomenon\nAnd the paranormal is difficult to study in a sort of a logical scientific way and this is mainly because paranormal experiences are you know there are radical their episodic they're\nDocumented um their random and they're not repeatable or will which is essentially everything that the scientific method hates [laughter] um so these things are are tough and and isn't that kind of why most people go into its fraud or mental illness or imaginations um\nYou know when a cop out to be just to say though\nI think it's an a cop out would be an easy answer to it so that's the idea is if it's ... if I'm presented with something that I don't know the answer to um rather than spend hours and hours of researching it I can just say found the person's misunderstanding or it's fried or over active imagination\nAnd then I could go on living my life in my normal views and it doesn't blow my mind at any kind of way\nSo it's an easy way to sort of give an answer to something that you know which is pretty mind blowing phenomenon um but you know there's there's all this this stuff out there that that some people point to as evidence like pictures a BP's\nUm but there's really no follow up after that um and then those things nowadays are easily fake\nI I think really is and and this is kind of what I tell people out in the paranormal investigator is is you kind of gets about collecting data it's about sample sizes it's about being consistent and what you do and that was over how you that's how you progress or advance a field\nYou know similar questionnaires at all these people are using when they do investigations similar methods\nUm you know if sample sizes huge in academia and was skeptics as well is that you know if if you have a sample size of three hundred people that's pretty impressive if you give questionnaires if every paranormal team gave a questionnaire to somebody and they did a hundred investigation of the year and there's\nYou know I don't know three hundred paranormal teams out there your sample size is getting pretty big and in academia takes notice because you have a hundred thousand questionnaires that are just waiting to be analyzed and then\nYou start getting some variable or um some similarities inconsistencies and then you have measurable phenomenon\nSo you know it's it's hard to argue with someone
