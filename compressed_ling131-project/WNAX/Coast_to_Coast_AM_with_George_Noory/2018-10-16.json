the golden rule is protection against evil forces and I want people to listen to that very carefully because we're apt to overlook familiar things we are apt to overlook temple things\nIf you are concerned about negative forces in your life the golden rule can serve as in\nEnormous source of protection there was an esoteric and a cult dimensions of the golden rule that we don't always appreciate\nWell that's absolutely true now why do our thoughts shape the reality of what happens\nThis is my contention in the book and I felt they really have to put myself out there and come up with a theory of positive thinking I'm going to be very brief about it across all kinds of scientists from cyclical research the quantum theory rising we have made the determination over the past eight years\nThat time is not what we think it is linear time as basically a very powerful illusion that we use\nTo organize our lives and it's a necessary illusion but if it's an illusion that means that we are selecting events all the time from across an incentive to to the possibilities [laughter] so I don't use the term manifest I use the term select and you can select events under the right circumstances\nWithin exquisitely focused and the motive Lee charged\nThought and that's what's going on we are selecting and the same way that when you take a measurement and the particle lab\nYou're very decision to take that measurement will affect what you experience the same is true in our life\nAnd you use these powers to affect your health\nWithout question and and I have to emphasize that we live under lots of laws and forces or one of them is a lot of physical declined one of them is a law mortality there's never been an exception to that but one must never feel that you're without devices that year without tools in the book I write about extraordinary\nCases of spontaneous remission of diseases which doesn't mean that is going to happen to people all the time I Would never extend false hope but the cases are there the occurrences are there and we have to probe and look at these things very often they correlate with intensive a meditation people who live meditative three hours a day\nHave recorded instances in the medical literature of remission of diseases not all the time but it has occurred\nYou say that when you were writing the book or something weird happened what the rock band the monkeys\nOh it was George talk about us all being loose in time a couple of summers ago I was getting into the music of the monkeys just completely out of the blue and my wife thought I was going nuts my kids were memorizing\nThere I Would think you are going nuts yes you would think that no one could imagine what they did have a few good songs they really\nDid dance and beautiful pop songs [laughter] and [laughter] and I was playing them all the time I was getting into them\nThought I was going crazy I couldn't figure out why I was getting into the monkeys [laughter] George it was months and months later that I got a call from an editor at the Washington Post who said to me do you know Mike Nesmith who was one of the members of the monkeys I said no he said that you know Nesmith just wrote a memoir and I said no and\nHe said did you know he was a Christian Scientists which is a a a a healing and mentally based on a form of spirituality I said no he said well we'd like you two\nAnd a a review Nesmith a memoir for the Washington Post the interest that and I said of course I'm interested and I told him this story of how months before without any for thought about any of this\nI started getting into the monkeys\nAnd I actually put this into the review and the Washington Post to its credit\nIncluded this material that was just the weirdest thing that it was almost like retro causality in a way wars if I was loose\nFor money or time this is why I'm saying that time is not what we think it is I was completely prepared for that opportunity because for reasons that no one could understand I was getting into the monkeys but the reason\nSeem to be off in the future so to speak but my contention is it wasn't the future it's that everything is happening all around us at once which is why mental focus is so effective\nI was sixteen when the monkey started playing with\nThat right long long time ago and if I remember one of the members was Mickey Dylan's that's right who played circus boy on television right that's\nRight and and still touring still touring the yeah they're still going that's absolutely I Love them [laughter]\nAnd do you know the name Jill ... a gallon burger buddy chance I don't show civil wrote a couple of books one called liquid block of course All right I Know the book I Know the thing he he would conduct experiments still does in Las Vegas with groups of people mhm\nAny which is trying to prove that positive thinking and the mine has a lot to do with influencing things that happen that's Ryan and he is totally convinced that he's convinced me too that if you go into a situation like Las Vegas upbeat\nAnd you know just you know positive about things\nThe odds are really high you're going to win\nYes and you know what's so fascinating about that is that outlook is been validated by Syria CSP research my hero J. B. rind pioneered scholarly ESP research at Duke University in the early Nineteen thirties J. B. is now deceased\nAnd one of the things that Jay be found that he just buried that's in the foot notable booklet it's monumental\nThat when his subjects in the ESPN lab and these were people tested under very rigorous conditions when they had a feeling of hopeful expectancy when they were upbeat when they were enthusiastic when they were a positive their scores spiked\nWhen they were bored when they were downcast when they were fatigue\nTheir scores death and it was inevitable\nAnd spike followed mood it's the same thing that he says in the book\nIf you go into a situation any kind of situation doesn't happen to be Las Vegas down in ... you know putting that black cloud over your head for whatever reason yeah he's not going to happen for you\nIt's not going to happen and the thing that I always tell people is and again this one of these familiar things but listen very carefully to it you must really want it you must really want it if you're a person who's attitude is neither here nor there about winning in Vegas or the lottery or money or whatever\nIt's not going to work it has to be something that you really want which is why it's so important to mix surely identify your most heartfelt desires there's real power there because the power comes from an emotionally charged thought\nWe're talking with Mitch Horwitz his latest book is called the miracle club as a matter of fact we are going to tell you how you can\nGet a membership in the miracle club a little bit later on in the program is website is his name all linked up for you and coast to coast day I'm dot com it's amazing how well how did you decide to write this kind of a book\n[noise] you know it was funny I had written a history of the positive among\nThe miracle club a little bit later on in the program is website is the name all linked up for you and coast to coast day I'm dot com it's I mean you talk\nAbout the techniques and it was a big step because a lot of historians are afraid to mask themselves as believers in what they write about but I've never been afraid to do that and I just really wanted to share with readers the actual hands on things I Do in my own\nLife how powerful is our human mind Mitch\nIs powerful in ways that our generation is only ...\nRealizing that things work out there like ... surgery we're realizing that people can lose weight literally George\nAnd lower their blood pressure just based on the thought that they carry with them things that we would have thought were unbelievable a generation ago are being validated and clinical experiments\nToday I think this universe is ultimately mental that doesn't mean that we don't live under many laws and forces but if one can understand how much that means\nYour thoughts are more powerful than anything you've been brought up to realize\nIs that the power of the brain or are we dealing with something outside of the physical body\nWe're dealing with something outside of the physical body and I think we could say that conclusively today because we have actual experiments but the thought change the brain\nYour stand thoughts will actually alter the neural pathways the electrical pathways in your brain that's demonstrable by brain scans it literally mind over matter so fought changes the brain and fought has to be something that extra physical that goes beyond the brain\nLook we're human beings sometimes things work sometimes they don't that Iraqi if they don't work what does that mean\nYou know it's very important that it's an extremely important point because people will sometimes try a method it works they're thrilled they try it again it doesn't work and then they feel project one of the things that I read about on the book\nIs that we live within a cosmic framework where we experienced many different laws enforces the law of mind is constant as a law must be but so is the law of gravity but you're going to experience gravity differently on earth\nThan you would on the moon around Jupiter doesn't mean gravity isn't there doesn't mean gravity is an operative but it's affected by math the mind is the same way\nCircumstances are going to intrude upon how we experience these things so we're fortunate that we experiment very clearly and very carefully\n... going to come back and talk more about your work\nOf a devastating crime called mortgage fraud ... title and

with Mitch Horwitz says we talk about his latest book which is called the miracle claw ... thoughts become reality will take your calls and your stories\nNext hour as well how does he is pretty good into this mess you were talking about it briefly but ah I I tend to think there is a very deep rooted tiring here\nOr there is without question ... experience in this country about eighty years of serious\nPolitical research serious experiments that the ESP creek admission telepathy and George the evidence is simply overwhelming and what we're seeing him ESP lab is that the mind possesses extra physical qualities there are ways\nThat we receive and get and give information that go beyond the five census\nOnce we've come to grips with the fact that the mind is extra physical but the mind as an existence outside the sensation body and open the door and all kinds of possibilities we realize we are not just material being added helped confirm to us that\nOur thought can make a difference in the world we may be like sending in receiving station we're always looking for people\nTo help us with projects to give us a hand to me this way and as I was mentioning in the last segment Jay be running the grid ESP researcher found that ESP result bike in the laboratory based on the enthusiasm of the subject\nSo that gives you a different perspective on how important your thoughts are what actually happens to you may be based on your emotions your enthusiasm your focus\nAnd you believe that you can just\nGet a better job maybe find the relationship you're looking for just about all that stuff\nI Do believe that but the here's the key thing and this is really the magic key if there is one behind all of our self help systems\nYou must wanted with everything in you you must want with passionate intensity and we often tell ourselves that we want things without scrutinizing and examining our convictions\nDo we really wanted for example we say we want a job when what we really want is security we say we want a new relationship when what we really want\nMaybe is is is something else you know to move to a different city or to have a different domestic arrangement or to somehow rearrange the furniture of our lives it's very important that we get down to the essentials of what we really want before we put a label on it because I Would contend that\nWhat you want to over time you're going to get do people know what they want\nAnd that is really the key thing we tell ourselves well we want you know we say gee I Want a better job I Want romance I Want to live you know in this city versus that city but my\nUrging to people might urging people and this is something list ers can do right now is to sit down with a pencil and paper and for a mature stained sustained period of time really write down your deepest desires your deepest wants\nDrink about this dwell on this be private about this don't talk to anybody about it being intimate and see if they channel in one direction discover what you want to or because sometimes we repeat things to ourselves by rote\nAnd they don't represent are really passionate heartfelt desires get in touch with your desires you may think you have but I Would contend that few of us actually\nHave Mitch how close you echoed the secret that story or is it different\nI ... it's different in some ways I have a lot of respect for run to burn the secret but I rarely use the term law attraction because\nI don't believe we live under one mental super law I Believe that given the circumstances we live under we experienced many different laws and forces like the law of gravity as I was saying and the previous\nSegment so I think it's a mistake to think that\nOur minds and our thoughts are the only game in town so to speak they are part of the game they're part of the game and that's important enough that's essential enough\nYou write about how people travel back in time to help other current life yeah but can't that also be dangerous\nYes it can and it's a very interesting prospect this is why I tell people be careful of what you're thinking about be careful of what you're doing because you know we like to play games with ourselves and we'd like to say gee you know if I could travel back into time and give advice to my Fifteen year old self\nWhat would I say well my contention is you may be doing that all the time that may be happening all the time [noise] linear time is very likely a very powerful illusion that we use to organize our lives but what we've discovered\nIn the hard sciences as well as over the course of testimony from centuries is that\nLife is intimate everything is happening now there is in and finish a tube of events occurring at once and we select among them\nSo it could be that we are selecting among the events past present and future all the time and yet these things feel very real to us very set in concrete to us\nBut I Would contend that when you think about going back and giving advice to a young herself you may actually be doing that so be careful be careful we are granted perspective we are granted some perspective\nBut use your mind use your thoughts carefully because things that you may think of as a novelty may actually be concretely we'll\nPut it all into Apple's stock that's where they come back well\nWell who knows George you know who knows the guy who owns Apple's stock right now you know he may have just had that fought based on what you said and he's experiencing that his concrete reality whereas there might have been another reality operative in his life a few minutes ago\nMitch what is the thirty day mental challenge or\nThe thirty day mental challenge is something that I invite everybody to join me and it's very very simple and any coast listener who emails me I Will send them a little instruction sheet\nYou basically right out a pledge that for the next thirty days you were going to dedicate your mind to everything that as\nProductive progressive forwarding you're not going to think of negative events of the past you're not going to think of unpleasant possibilities of the future you're going to think that every reasonable ambition\nIs within your grass get makeup of grid of thirty days you do this for thirty days it's your private experiment just see what happens see what happens it sounds easy but it's not it's very difficult\nAnd if you fall off the horse you don't have to a restart the thirty days you just get back on the horse\nThe ideas to just try to direct your mind in the direction of that which is positive and productive for thirty days\nSee what happens when you give thirty days to the possibility of experiencing a whole different life and I will do it with you I Will do it with you and if you're having a hard time you can write to me you can email me and say you know I really fell off the wagon last night\nAnd I'm there in the trenches with you\nA couple years ago I started the coast prayer club and you know what that is Mitch is on Fridays people will neutralize a list of people who have written in yes who are on the prayer list for whatever they need is willing to a new job in a selection\nSomething people even right in and said please pray for my cats you know you sick and stuff like that anyway wonderful how powerful do you believe in and I will say I believe in this war since I've gotten emails back after the fact that people say you know so and so the thing was cured and this like that\nBut how powerful deeply prayer is\nI really do believe prayers powerful and it's for this reason I don't think Mother Nature plays cruel tricks on us\nThere are instances and there are times in life where somebody is feeling\nSo depressed than facing such difficulty that they can't do the things that aren't prescribing they can't direct their minds in a positive way they're all kinds of methods and techniques I can give them but let's face it\nThere are times in life where we feel crushed by circumstance that's one prayer comes in that one prayer comes in prayer is an escape hatch\nFrom the difficulties of our own psyche from the difficulties of life's circumstances when we can do nothing else\nWe can pray and there's no wrong or right right way to pray it's an escape hatch\nFrom our own psyche so again I I don't think we've been put into a cosmic framework\nThe tricks us I think we've been given away out when we can't use our minds and the way I'm describing and there are times where people are suffering from addiction from depression from Greek and they can't do the things on saying there were times I Can't do the things I'm saying that's where ... comes in and I devote a special section to prayer in the marrow clubs\nTwice in our breaking news when

I ... I was reading some of their ... and many enough of these people were truly professional in their lives you know one\nThere was evidence before the crash of something bad was about to happen I Know myself I Would have spoken up and said get me out of this debt trap but these those people Mr Horwitz of the\nUpper middle class the all basically we remained mom no one spoke up their their very lives were coming to an end and yet you say a from a ... a higher exalted background that people should know but the ... they were like many people and society they\nThey were conditioned to stay quiet and it ended up costing there are a lot there were twenty people killed Eighteen in limbo not one spoke up to say this has got to stop pull over now and they could have but they didn't like she does say it they went to their deaths sort of wrap all of this up [noise] um ... weather me\nFellow city residents ... many of them good enough but not getting ahead and then in school Harry\nThese upper middle class people not speaking up for themselves I'd like you to tide us together and so far as why to say it if I have to like sheep\nSo many people go to their dome and they just can't bring themselves to grant themselves by their lapels and just speak up for themselves and say gosh darn just let all of this that and let us all come together and do something about it\nAnd she let me let me ask you because we had the story the night in happened it was a tragedy for sure but what do you mean by to tell somebody to stop what was going on inside that bloom all ... uh\nThere are indications that the car was basically to use my term coming apart that that uh people are saying uh amongst the victims because they had cell phones that we can't we can't even hear each other next to each other a talk of\nThe car was being coming very noisy and and literally coming apart at the scenes and you would think that intelligent people and many enough of for both of you these were quite professional people would noticeably higher ... middle class jobs where they should\nHave had the smarts but no out just to say I'm going to speak up here get this driver to pull over and I know because you've heard me before me keep that driver would have pulled over no if fans or if\nI would've wanted to be in that limo with you you would have stopped that guy\n[laughter] you know what there's a lot to unpack and we'll keep is saying and of course I I read that same news coverage now you know there's a new age expression there are no accidents and I break with that expression I don't I don't abide\nBy that everything happens for a reason\nRight right one of the things that are right in the book\nIs you know as I've been alluding we live under many laws enforces we experienced many laws and forces and I've never including love accident including accidents birth for example now peer pressure as as Keith was alluding\nIs an extremely powerful for Senate can be a destructive force one must never get caught up in peer pressure because it can be a kind of group mentality\nRegardless of whether it holds you too where you've been born or it keeps you from speaking up if you're seeing something that you think is dangerous\nIt's vitally vitally important that everybody acts with independent agency that doesn't mean you can escape accidents that doesn't mean you can escape tragedy but my contention is that the mind is one vital element that participates\nThat participates in other things that are going on and it is extremely important\nTo exercise it at all times you're never without devices whether you're facing a crisis or based on\nThe accident of birth and economic class I Can't tell you and I would never tell anyone that there aren't crushing forces\nSocially and economically there are but the fact is the mind is one vital tool in your belt that you can always use and it can make all the difference at a crucial moment it is one thing we think of ourselves as having mines that control cognitive and motor function and that's true\nBut there's more to it than that there's more to it that that the mind as extra physical properties\nThat doesn't mean that it necessarily determines everything\nAnd every force occurs or comes into her life but it's one vital tool and my messages\nUse it use it always and everywhere and in every circumstance whether its environment as Keith was alluding to or whether it's a situation that you think is going to be\nHazardous never feel bound by peer pressure there is no more blunt force of your own will ineffectiveness in potency than peer pressure it must be escape\nLet's go to Tom is a long way in California you know I'm going like\nGeorge thank you for taking my call very up the

the outside of events but it's your own human imagination yes creates your reality yes yes\nDevil is truly my hero and for any listeners who haven't heard of him he was a British bar Baden mystic who lived and worked in America died in Nineteen Seventy two\nAnd as the caller was describing metal taught that your imagination is God and that the God of scripture Old Testament New Testament is really a metaphor\nFor your imagination and everything that you see and experience including my own voices you're hearing and right now is really coming from within you it is rooted in you I Am rooted in you as you are to mentally rooted in God and that everything\nThat happens to your relationships your experience and you're listening experience right here and now is really your emotive fall into mental
