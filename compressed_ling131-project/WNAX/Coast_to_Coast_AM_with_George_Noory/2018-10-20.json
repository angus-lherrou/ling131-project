F. R. B. ten ten so there you go [noise]\nUh coming up an hour is one and two lieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis or as we say up here in cannot stand left tenets colonel Robert McGinnis retired he says America is locked in a new kind of do a little Cold War with the Russians and the Chinese\nThe Russian Federation under a populist off the authoritarian leader seriously threatens the west through cyberspace and military uh thanks to that country's heavy investment in sophisticated mass killing weapons [noise]\nThe People's Republic of China is a great power with global ambitions led by a new kind of communist leader focused on rapidly growing use nation economically and militarily and together China and Russia collaborate\nTo dominate our future and that pseudo alliance could well become the catalyst that leads to the prophetic and times\nLieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis author of alliance of evil is here for hours one and two\nContinue to do that they considered a Ukraine the breadbasket of Russia\nAnd of course they're continuing to fuel the anti key of\nCivil war which I call in the eastern part of the country and that's a after having seized Crimea and of course two provinces in two thousand and eight from the republic of Georgia and they're pushing back against the Baltics against Poland\nHungary Romania the entire a former Soviet satellite regimes\nThat something that I Know when Mr Yeltsin the new president after Gorbachev stepped down came to this country met with Bush Camp David [noise] we had the opportunity to do more than just give them a few crumbs we could have\nA brought them into the fold and I think that that really is you indicate who you know fueled the rise of Vladimir putting\nThan you know of course has captured the imagination of the Russian people and as a direct result\nHas you know really fueled\nNationalism and patriotism in a way that um they're somewhat um I Would argue blind to perhaps with the west is looking at because\nThey want to rise again they want to be a great power again\nAnd they do have them the main through their nuclear arsenal and of course I'm putting you know here even this week when he was down and so she was arguing that\nYou know we have a modern weapons systems that really a push against the emergent China very capable west and he talked about the Auburn guard a twenty time speed of sound\nA nuclear capable go anywhere breakthrough any a defense system\nWeapon system a hyper sonic weapon system much like what the Chinese are working on the Russians are really for to find themselves they're pushing back they are concerned about NATO and we did violate the initial trust that we wouldn't push against them we did and so we find ourselves\nIn a very dangerous position today a visa V. not only of course putting but also president Xi in China\n[noise] how much has the narrative of Russian collusion\nHandcuffs the Trump Administration into perhaps\nSmoothing over relations pulling back from the break if you will because now\nBecause everyone is seeing a I'm a Russian under their bed in the closet in the White House\nOr that he has to be asked to appear almost overly aggressive against the Russian how much has this this Russian collusion narrative endangered American national security\nWhile I I think that it has and in fact ... said once again this week\nThat he believes that Trump clearly wants to stabilize and improve U.S Russian ties\nYou know when they met together\nAnd health thinking this July they talked about a host of issues now of course all those are a an not out in the open because president's talking confidence about things of concern but one of the things he talked about was ridiculed reduction of nuclear weapons throughout the world and of course it starts with both Russia and\nThe United states I think that a President Trump is pragmatic he he does want to you know kind of get the rhetoric lower uh not only with the Russians but with the Chinese now if people argue well what's he doing with this trade war and and the like\nWell he's representing if you look at the national security strategy and the national defense strategy that were published in the last year\nHe is trying to make sure that people understand America is first he's not going to sit back and see other countries take advantage of it is but at the same time he does want stability he does want to end the tensions but at the same time it's very high today for a variety of\nReasons let's pay the China you mentioned the trade wars are ... and how people need to appreciate how this trade war strategy or terrorists\nOr against China is is not just economic also national security and that if\nI Would argue if we don't engage in this trade war now we're going to have to end up fighting on the battlefield linger in here and it tends to weaken China significantly economically so that they can\nAchieve military supremacy over the United states\n[noise] more clearly we have as the number one and number two economic powers in the world there is a lot of competition but there's a lot of commonality a lot of mutual interest\nTo keep both are kind of these you know going along and the Chinese and in the last year or so have seen somewhat of a dip\nA there is what six and a half percent growth and the last quarter which is down over the previous quarter but the fact is that we need one another\nAnd yet if we continue to allow them to take jobs to manipulate and our businesses and Robert intellectual property in and Trump says while we're losing something like three hundred billion dollars of intellectual property to\nChinese you know not only cyber attacks but through your company to company relationship and company to state relationship with Beijing then that's a national security issue he makes it very clear and the national security strategy that\nYou know economics is\nNational security we can't afford to lose jobs we can't afford to let\nOur wealth go to China and so he's trying to level the playing field he wants a fair playing field arguably president she said much the same but from a very different position and so are there hopefully going to meet within the month maybe and Argentina will see\nAnd if they do maybe we can get kind of movement in the right direction I Know the Chinese\nMedia is is trying to figure out Trump and just like the\nAmbassador to Washington from Beijing said on Fox News this past weekend they can't figure him out and I think that's to the Americans advantage you always want to keep your opponent you're adversary or even your friends to a certain degree gassing and Mr Trump certainly does\n[noise] and then you call it an alliance of evil yeah between the Russians and the Chinese and perhaps there are other a component to this line of terrorism perhaps but in terms of the Russians and the Chinese becoming\nA bed may is is driven by ideology in any way are are there still vestiges of\nUm the bed may is is driven by ideology in any way are are there still vestiges of a communist\nIdeology here or is this simply about hedging many\n[noise] well a combination of things I don't it's not as simple as communism versus liberal democracy if it was I Would argue during the old Cold War\nA potent for his own ideology is about order and bring jobs back to Russia bringing confidence in the nation is as opposed to what they would call an amoral west\nAnd the things that they represent they paint the wife says what Hollywood is spewing all over the world and they said you don't want that in fact ... is is famous for embracing Christianity and family values and\nAnd and the things that you know used to resonate in the United states in the fifties so he was you know even though we suffer Terry and he still is perceived widely as a leader of the common man\nIn the in Russia and as a result there's a lot of confidence in him you know they have adversaries but [noise]\nYou know it was just this week\nYou had you know a gentleman by the name of Valerie ... who is the chairman for Russia's constitutional court who even started to hit at perhaps we ought to amend the constitution much like the Chinese did this past year and allow potent\nIn this case to serve beyond twenty twenty four because he was just elected of course uh [noise] yeah this past march they're beginning to see that we need longevity and we need to have the capability to\nKeep the momentum going in and they feel confident that ... is doing that much as the Chinese are feeling confident and president Xi is well\nNot exactly painting prudent as an evil adversary and yet the ... the title of the book is alliances evil so why why should we aside from the fact that the Russians have a vast nuclear arsenal\nWhy should we be fearing prudent and an alliance with China\nWell what they're doing is they're weaponize eat everything against us you know if you look at\nPolitical coercion predatory economics strategic extortion information warfare um covert action you know I I could go through every one of those Richard and\nIf a naval operations admiral Richardson\nHas said recently were in the fourth battle of the Atlantic the first one was in World War one Second World war two\nThe old Cold War was the third one of the Russians have put in place a\nNuclear submarine and\nYou know a ... a diesel powered submarines that are just as capable almost as certainly hours not only in the Atlantic for the Mediterranean and elsewhere and of course are confronting us militarily or in the air or they're back off our coastlines\nAre they are very aggressive in terms of cyber as we know all about the allegations and justifiably are the sanctions put in place because of their interference in the twenties sixteen election here recently or in the twenty Eighteen mid term we arrested\nOr someone of course this was a Chinese person in the Belgium you know these sorts of things are not to be ignored or the Russians are bellicose and they're\nYou know claims against us and to a certain degree or we're pushing back you know President Trump's not a you know backing down and that and given that there's some given some take but maybe it's not a favoring an outcome that uh is going to suit is all\nAh and then of course you join up with what's going on with the Chinese and perhaps in the south China Sea East China sea and of course their belt and road strategy ... a new issue all over the world where they're buying\nUp infrastructure and using that as a a way of planting their People's Liberation army capabilities you know literally across the globe\nYou know do I say Russia is more dangerous now China is certainly the long term more dangerous adversary\nWildly vanquished the former Soviet Union economically we brought them to their knees or they have an economy which is what their GDP about the size of Texas ... why why couldn't we do that again with another arm strength\n[laughter] well we are in an arms race or I mentioned earlier the hyper sonic weapons for\nPutting put forward keep in mind you know you're right there GDP is miniscule compared to ours um but they hide a lot of the stuff so it's not really as obvious as one would think in terms of how much they're really plowing into their capabilities [laughter]\nHe said this week you know we have these capabilities and our experts don't contest that yes they are working on capabilities and they probably will feel them and and the near future and are they willing to use it twelve putting says\nYou know he's not going to be the first to use nuclear weapons even though there is a strategy called escalate to de escalate which isn't there twenty Fifteen doctrine that in fact they might use a tactical nuclear weapons which is\nWhy the U.S Congress or in the national defense authorization act twenty Nineteen now wants to fund a new counter to\nA vet to provide us a tactical capability in Europe so you've got all these kind of flattering around there I Would say right now because of the capabilities that Russia is posing against NATO\nAnd they of course the more strategic capability that he's been modernizing with this platforms and his uh weapons\nUh that they're the the mere threat the long term threatened and especially if they collaborate as they are as I pointed out earlier\nWith the defense ministers consistently meeting and you mentioned the Vostok twenty Eighteen\nJoined exercise which is going to be an annual exercise these sorts served indicators and demonstrate that these two nations are pushing back against the former you know dominance that we had across the world and arguably you know you can\nCome up with the conclusion I think that uh perhaps were not as dominant perhaps we are weakening or certainly up until the ah the Trump Administration came in and started to refuel our defense industry\nA and our Pentagon to have capabilities that we were really bleeding a and therefore we're not able to stand toe to toe with rising Chinese\nMilitary and of course\nThough not as big as the former Soviet Union the Russians have capabilities that clearly we don't have and they were trying to catch up with even now\nLet me ask you about NATO article five\nCourse the cornerstone of the the North Atlantic Treaty Organization an attack on one member of NATO was an attack on all of its members should we really go to war with Russia if let's say they roll tanks across the stony and border we want to go to war maybe World War three over in stone yeah\nWell that's a that's why you know Trump has been over there you know\nTrying to shake them up saying you've got to spend more and yeah you know even the idea of accepting Macedonia we already have twenty nine members do we need to all these other little countries\nYou know might Russia going and and and disturbed that country and then as your right to make it clear article five and we have to go to war now there's only been one of the declaration of course that was two thousand and one when we were attacked or\nYou know in New York and Washington and Pennsylvania and in the light can we declared war on terror and we're all over the place to include Afghanistan et cetera so [noise]\nUm no I I don't think that we should you know jump at that and I think that's what is in the back of Trump's mind says you know I'm not sure I Want to throw my entire nation's capability and wealth and and statue in future into the hands of these little tiny nations need that may not have\nThe wherewithal not only to push back against the Russians but to ah you know make these tough decisions so\nThat I think is very much on the forefront that's what John Bolton perhaps is going to talk to his counterpart in Claremont next week\nYou know certainly you know the defense ministers are are talking that I Know the general Dunford was just over at his counterparts in NATO and\nAnd he was saying look you folks you've got to wake up and he said yeah they are waking up to the threat posed by Russia [noise] uh but we as a nation you certainly the United states\nHad better make it very clear that if\nIf we can't back a an article five declaration by even one of these little tiny countries that are threatened Lithuania Estonia or even poll and which is a you know really a very concerned about the Russian Bear and what they might do perhaps similar to what they did\nWith Ukraine these are all issues of great a magnitude that um we've got to decide and thus far we haven't backed out of NATO but perhaps that's something we need to rethink\nTalking about China um we've been hearing all about Russian collusion in elections and so forth are Nikki Haley the UN ambassador and the president has accused the Chinese\nAll about Russian collusion in elections and so forth are Nikki Haley the UN ambassador and the president has accused the Chinese of of meddling in\nThe mid mid term elections uh there's obviously a huge amount of economic integration with China in the United states [noise] um the big concern as I see it again comes back to cyber warfare and all these talks about\nA Chinese made computer chips and components in electronics they may have a back door\nOr even in US military equipment talked me about the series the seriousness of that threat\nWhile it is a very serious threat in fact over the last year and certainly at the Pentagon you know the\nDefense secretary Jim Mattis uh put out a mandate say look you know even in these Chinese made yeah

but others\nI think on the air one is going to be one of those proxies to a certain degree even though he would like to think that he can rule the the Muslim world um I think the Chinese have a better idea\nCertain degree even though he would like to think that he can rule the the Muslim world um I think the Chinese have a better idea for him\nA ... if you were in John Bolton supposition you had the president's ear who knows maybe you do or what would you be advising have how is this how do we counteract saying how do we step back from the brink of of war\nWell I I Do believe tumble will talk to his counterpart about\nRenewing new start which expires in twenty Twenty one we've got to do that it's in their country's best interest to not have a an agreement that isn't for civil the problem is and the Russians notice that a Nineteen eighty seven IMF treaty with\nAh with violated or with their own cruise missiles\nAnd uh you know they probably will admit that behind the scenes or you know we've done a lot of in the open a so I think that will go get something I Know that\nYou know they had was from Trump asked for you met with putting in Helsinki in July but yeah they did talk about that issue and potent surreal is you know yeah he he has grandiose ideas about the fact that he can meet with the world leader ah on the west Trump\nYou know in the eyes of the Russian people means that they are great power again and of course you know ... meetings with President Xi on a frequent basis just solidifies that viewpoint so if I were both ... and ... you know I Know I've talked to John Bolton before and so I ...\nI kind of have a sense that that's what he's going to do you know he's a real pragmatist he is a tough guy\nYeah but he does have the president's ear and I think that that's a that's going to be the top of the agenda and of course he'll probably try to deal with\nThe issues in Syria um and with air to one of course uh the uranium the Iranians are our problem for Israel\nUh we we have no question I think after Netanyahu revealed months ago you know those volumes and volumes of evidence regarding their nuclear programs [noise]\nUm we don't acknowledge a lot of things but I suspect that uh you know there's good reason to believe the Iranians are up there is no good\nIf there were a dummy regime a regime change in in Iran and and hopefully that'll come about by the Iranian people\nAre just getting fed up with the situation with you and chasing the mullahs out of there if Iran were to become a secular non align nation or you know again leaning to the west as they get for many many decades\nHow would that change the situation because obviously what's going on in Syria is not about a civil war it's about a proxy war and it's about Iran so if Iran has regime change how does that change the equation\nWell if you don't have the ayatollah running you know the [noise]\nYou know the military and their diplomacy or\nYou know for me to promote their their sheer world view a and B autocratic world view of of the moves and I I think that you find that they're not involved with a hoot teaser not involved with\nAssad a there are less involved with Russia accept because of economic interests and perhaps even to a certain degree with China um\n[noise] and it's the the problem is the age old tension between the Sunni and Shia Riyadh and tear on it's going to continue um but it it if you're not involved in you know in fueling terrorism switches Hezbollah in\nSouthern Lebanon and you know encouraging Hamas and\nPalestine and so forth then\nWe'll have an easier way in that part of the world we can we can work with them a Iranians are wonderful people are very bright capable Persian people and they have a long history I Would hope that they will\nReplace their autocrats with people that are have a more a better sense of history and were were they ought to be going but we're not going to eliminate all the tension unfortunately\nOh you will be the only thing that you will be on like this little Amazon apple groom can you live ... dot com and download the ... and I do go to use ...\nNo universal access to us on TV all access for over Twenty years\n[noise]\n[noise]\nLieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis is with us before we go to the phones a Bob let me ask you the last three years well projecting into next year the Trump Administration earmarked ... trucks mentally to point to or to point three billion dollars and increase\nDefense spending we had seven hundred and sixty billion a couple of years ago seven hundred and five I think last year and another seven hundred coming up this year uh is is that enough I mean a lot of that I'll be going to salaries and so forth but isn't enough\n[noise] you know half of it you're right does go to the salaries and that's why people often say well gosh\nYou know you know how can the Russians and the Chinese speech such an adversary and competitive with us while they hide most of what they're spending on their own national security you know the answer is I Will see\nI'm One of the concern is here this past week the president came and said we're going to all parts of the U.S government must ... five percent well we went through this quest ration period in which it just crippled our readiness our ability to go out and trained to be ready to fight to replace\nYou know with you know new aircraft these\nAntiques that we're trying to fly around the world the same thing was ships you know it's an incredibly expensive\nTo have an armed forces and you know it reminded me of of something that Ronald Reagan said you know and this was you know obviously a few years ago and basically he says if [noise]\nIf you want to be free you have to be willing basically to to pay the price and the price in this case is to have a modern armed forces nobody's going to seek to contest well today we're being contested seriously on all fronts by\nBoth China and Russia especially combined fear forming a new one alliance and so if we don't sustain as you know the chiefs of staff and the and the chairman of the joint chiefs General Joe Dunford if we don't sustain heavy investment in long term capabilities\nThen we're going to fall behind were already falling behind in terms of hyper sonics in artificial intelligence or even in an investment in our our blue water navy uh\nUh the last couple of years have been great and it's only putting it on our rights glide path if we can sustain it\nLet's say a say hello to the west of the Rockies in Las Vegas Skinny Me good morning the welcome to coast to coast Dana thank\nYou very much a Robert you were talking about the Chinese tapping our electronics for information\nOr I'm really concerned about is what if the Chinese have programmed to an end date into all of these electronic chips so that everything shuts down at the same time some time in the future\nYou know it's it sounds a little paranoid but I think it's very feasible and that's really a something major that could happen\nQuick question Steve is that possible Bob\n[noise] well I'm not an electronics uh no expert however I Do understand the question and I share that concern a and that's something that I think that uh Jim Mattis our defense secretary is concerned about that\nThings like that could undermine the complexity of our systems and if we get a programmable and reversible inundated\nElectronics aboard our satellites or missiles or aircraft\nOr ships and it's and so forth and we could find that this could be catastrophic so I think there's plenty of caution today\nA there was a wakeup call across a certainly the U.S military and I think our allies are are joining that understanding that uh this is a very new world that we're facing and we have to be very careful of\nOf the type of equipment that we do embrace and so this is I don't think it's out of the possibility\nIt reminds me of what the us spy plane that held in ... was held in China for some time uh I think\nThere was maybe a near collision involved and and I'm I'm ... I'm Wondering is that it that might be what we're talking about here perhaps it was ... it was ... it landed there because of being hacked into somehow\nKnow wealth you know that's a sort of thing that we are very concerned about a cyber the battleground or the you know cyber as a woman before that I point out an alliance of evil and\nGo into great detail is two and not only the threat of taking down our own infrastructure a hacking into our elections and doing all sorts of things that uh we hear about every day this is an existential threat to us and in fact when you look at the\nPresident's strategy and he says that there's a there's a possibility that we would respond to\nA cyber attack a with a nuclear weapon that's how serious it is today and yet you know ... there's so much we don't know so you know could somewhat take on an aircraft because they take down a satellite takedown of Los Angeles\nI think all that is possible or if we don't put fire walls and the capabilities to prevent this in place\nWildcard line down his intent Ohio Don good evening good morning welcome to cost\nThe Robert happy ... of a ... and lieutenant colonel I really appreciate your service your patriotism and you're with them during the main things that you have do they ever consider the Bible prophecy of Daniel eight where America will attack Iran and destroy it\n[noise]\nHave to remind me of ... and Daniel eight where you're looking at dawn I'm you know I I understand perhaps where you're coming from a [noise] you know I I don't know that that's something that we would do unless we perceive that the threat was a against\nYou know our key allies and against our interest in science they claim that you know the he go from the west will come up on the whole face for years the whole not touch the ground and it will destroy the ram that half the two wars and said the the ladder horn is the bigger on that comes up last in the first time\nUs the the L Newhouse media center in Vermillion seminars hosted by the dynamic cruise stomach presidents do stomach recruitment on national radio retention recognition and recruitment firms based on them down to Florida for more information as well as you as a radio station\nIn Iowa to inform you that we have an excellent line of auctions books for this fall including farm estate auctions retirement auctions inventory reduction\nAuctions and farmland auctions where you believed to have a successful option that it must be planted marketed we already have several dates book but it's also give us a call today to reserve your date to start marketing for your auction we'd probably serve Iowa South Dakota and Minnesota check out our website is auctions dot com\nAuctions dot com\nSomebody or has the highest owner loyalty any all of them I tell you become America's not selling brand it's two o'clock [noise]\nCBS News on the hour sponsored by their work release\nA ... piper Trump Administration officials have been waiting for news from both Saudi in Turkish investigations after the Saudis confirms ... death but they're saying he died after a fight\nHave spoken to the king I Want to speak with the crown prince\nAnd you know I think we're getting close to\nSolving or a big list is the ... with the president in Mesa, Arizona in his first comments following the Saudi Government statements the president said it's a good first step a big step\nFrom said Saudi Arabia has been a great ally but what happened he said is unacceptable\nEarlier the White House issued a written\nContinue to advocate for justice to this timely friends' parents\nSeveral senators have already shared their doubts about the Saudis story including Democrat Patrick Leahy and Republican Lindsey Graham it's a ticket worth one billion dollars but is it out there mega millions has not yet said of a ticket with the exact numbers was sold anywhere\nAnd I put a number to sixty five fifty three twenty three Fifteen Seventeen and don't make 'em all seven ... members who they can be one billion dollars one\nTicket in California was close matching five out of six numbers on during migrants in a massive caravans surged across the bridge leading to Mexico before they were halted in a confrontation with Mexican police in riot gear\nTheir on their way to the U.

... on the fire I wanted I wondered about\nDeath experiences or near death experiences\nIf you had one or you know someone who ... who's had one would love to hear from you a man who claimed to have stood on the brink of death this was in the United kingdom said he faced God himself the for the early gates\nShowed up in a she should the state patrol due to investigate it actually came every day

uh almost died so it's real show or to explain\nAll those cliches about your life flashing before your eyes everything slowing down truly\nIt is it happened it sure is like like a movie or most of your whole life to instantly your vision and and and accidents pitch slows down to ... motion remembers every detail\nThan it's home [laughter] it's it's hard to hard to explain Richard\nI finally

life David thank you so much for sharing great story thank you thank you went to the Rockies Tommy in riverside California Tom good morning good evening welcome to coast\nWell with a certain ah thanks for taking my call and uh I just wanted to comment on you know I'm a your guest before and uh the last caller\nOr any you know I'm [noise] I'm not a young person in a [noise] and I've been in this country and uh haven't went anywhere around the world at all I have never left the country and it seems extremely obvious to me\nThat something has happened to our government over the last fifty some years and the teams will hold on a lot of people think that uh\nUh you know they preach uh patriotism they preach uh uh you know go to send our our country's freedom and a charm military\nUh in our military really is and our military anymore as far as I'm concerned it seems obvious that we're not really in control of our government anymore it seems very obvious and uh it seems like a\nPeople is a you know I of course the younger people don't really you know remember America has lost you know in the fifties and sixties\nAnd uh they've lost touch with them you know would they didn't lose touch it just be able to me was never a savvy to them or what came before them in a\nA you know a lot of the country has opened up prisons around the world can turn gay people I Know that's not American to me that's not the way I was brought up in America posts to torture people in prison for cross a disease that\nIs that the way it is [noise] uh and uh\nUh the government a\nStop to the draft owned the seventies when they're\nBeing kicked around I thought it was just so good on D\nDay at time you're fading out on me here you're you're fading out on\nSomething about ending the draft\nYeah the draft should be ended the draft she'll be reinstated as what I'm really saying you know that's one problem but I mean here's the problem we're not controlled by the government anymore and I don't blame Russia seems to me as an American never been to how the country ... raised in Indiana\nAnd you know in the middle of this country why should I feel this way Kennedy was shot in your head when I was maybe ten years old I remember that\nUh I was Catholic course I was that was a direct assault on or you know a on me in\nThe program and uh the uh the nine eleven and\nUh on me and people ... and all the whole nine eleven who you know Richard what's his name all along\nHere said you're fading out on me again Tom so I'm I'm Sorry I'm going to have to I'll respond but then I'm gonna have to want to thank you for the call [noise] well before Kennedy there was McKinley and there was Garfield and there was Lincoln and there were\nMultiple attempts on other presidents um [noise] I don't know that that certainly something changed since Kennedy a ... but has much changed I think once the United states\nA sort of grew up in matured and became a major player certainly after the civil war\nOr after the first World War and began to\nEngage in\nMultilateral trade organizations\nAnd ah he did all of those things that some of the founding fathers sort of warning against foreign entanglements I think is\nWhat they called they called it\nSays these sorts\nOf um games dirty wars and so forth are almost inevitable\nWhen you become entangled in in uh in other countries' business and and he put yourself out there or you end up fighting wars on foreign land so that those wars don't visit upon your own soil\nAnd yes it's it's nasty and dirty but one thing that the United states has I think that most other countries that don't have and that is the power of redemption [noise]\nAnd I'm I'm a Canadian so I'm a bit of an internal Oprah but I have strong emotional ties to the United states and I believe strongly in the idea of the United states and I believe in American exceptionalism it hasn't been fulfilled perhaps the way we like it\nBut the United states yes they\nThey have been involved do if you talk about to lend day in Chile and the overthrow the government in ... in Iran in in in the in Nineteen fifty three and in Guatemala and so forth\nFor ... to the United states\nMost other countries that have the kind of a power and responsibility at the United states has to do the same thing\nBut they don't reflect\nUpon those those dark chapters in their history the way the United states does they don't talk about it on public forums they can't they're not allowed and there is no redemption\nAt least in the United states\nThat exists we reflect we're right we shut down and we try to make ourselves better and I think we should all be thankful for that\nTom thank you for your call a Doug is east of the Rockies in the great state of New Jersey Doug ... welcome\nThank you very much our either through everything I'm well thank you I'm Glad\nTo hear that I'm going to go a little bit off topic here um I tried to get married some time ago a it was a yes host them so to so and ah they were talking about our climate change in a warming over\n... over the ocean now I'm not a uh Iraq I mean go either way with the pro or con on a global warning or anything like that but\nAh they're talking about how the shoes and the oceans are rising which that is the fact that there's measurable they can tell that\nBut I was wondering I never heard anybody take into consideration water this placement\nEvery year we put billions upon billions upon billions of vessels in the water whether they be military whether it be giant or a ... a million dollar a cruise ships\nSubmarines we're sinking um subways out here on the east coast to make artificial reefs were sinking old military about this just taking up space\nAnd uh I Know that Hawaii has been having a volcano that has a stop for some time and that's also taken a whole lot taking of water but it's adding land\nAnd uh I I Would think if a if anybody a you know of or any of the gift that you've a hat on or heard speak about this uh ever brought up the theory of water to this place [noise]\n[noise] uh no not that I'm I'm aware of um I I think the type of\nSea level rise that they're talking about isn't about you know the the the the ice melting that's in the water because you know what happens when when ice cubes melt in a glass of water doesn't overflow\nI'm Talking about bits of ice shelves breaking off and so forth but\nCall one eight hundred three eight seven nine nine zero three\nOne eight hundred three eight seven nine nine zero three one eight hundred three eight

little ones cannot suffered any more of this and not know why I was just listening to this is going to go on for years and decades and decades hundreds of years\nAnd I said it can't go on that right so the promise I looked at the pictures I couldn't believe alive and smiled and days and I smiled\nAnd the father was saying to me it's not going to go on\nIt's going to end and people just don't know that it's going to end very soon that they are they're going to be standing in place where the U.S we're going to be standing or laying are sitting in their place\nAnd uh they're not going to know that this comes upon them if they're not ready for me\nAnd I'm about\n... coming up my end or\nI'm ...

are they are met either by their guide or maybe a family member\n[noise] um if they don't cross over a they will either told to go back or maybe they may talk to someone and they usually come back into the body you know near it they're\nNot a full death experience but there are books written about life between lives his who which I Do live between allies [noise] although most people don't do that they don't call on me to help them do that they rather do some hailing were\nAnd some of the things that we do is work with angels and arcane rules and they're healers and sometimes here to guide\nSo as far as uh do we do we do we continue to live\nYes we do a more importantly we can experience happened we can experience what it's like the crossover would out dying by going through some

Russian ties\nYou know when they met together\nAnd Helsinki this July they talked about a host of issues now of course all those are a an not out in the open because president's talking confidence about things of concern but one of the things he talked about was ridiculed reduction of nuclear weapons throughout the world and of course it starts with both Russia and\nThe United states I think that President Trump is pragmatic he he does want to you know kind of get that rhetoric lower uh not only with the Russians but with the Chinese now people argue well what's he doing with this trade war and and the like\nWell he's representing if you look at the national security strategy and the national defense strategy that were published in the last year\nHe is trying to make sure that people understand America is first he's not going to sit back and see other countries take advantage of it is but at the same time he does want stability he does want to end the tensions but at the same time it's very high today for a variety of\nReasons let's pay the China you mentioned the trade wars are ... and how people need to appreciate how this trade war strategy or terrorists\nOr against China is is not just economic also national security and that if I Would argue if we don't engage in this trade war now we're going to have to end up fighting on the battlefield later this\nAnd it tends to weaken China significantly economically so that they can achieve military supremacy over the United states\n[noise] more clearly we have as the number one and number two\nEconomic powers in the world there is a lot of competition but there's a lot of commonality a lot of mutual interest to keep both economy's going along and the Chinese and in the last year or so I have seen somewhat of a dip\nA there is what six and a half percent growth in the last quarter which is down over the previous quarter a but the fact is that we need one another\nAnd yet if we continue to allow them to take jobs to manipulate you know our businesses and Robert intellectual property in and Trump says while we're losing something like three hundred billion dollars of intellectual property to\nChinese you know not only cyber attacks but through your company to company relationship and company to state relationship with Beijing then that's a national security issue he makes it very clear and the national security strategy that\nYou know economics is\nNational security we can't afford to lose jobs we can't afford to let our wealth go to China and so he's trying to level the playing field he wants a fair playing field arguably president she said much the same but from a very different position and so\nAre there hopefully gonna meet within the month maybe in Argentina will see\nAnd if they do maybe we can get kind of movement in the right direction I Know the Chinese\nMedia is is trying to figure out Trump and just like the\nAmbassador to Washington from Beijing said on Fox News this past weekend they can't figure him out and I think that's to the Americans advantage you always want to keep your opponent you're adversary or even your friends to a certain degree guessing and Mr Trump certainly does that\n[noise] it is a ... alliance of evil yeah between the Russians and the Chinese and perhaps there are other a component to this Islamic terrorism perhaps but in in terms of the Russians and the Chinese becoming\nA bed may is is driven by ideology in any way or are there still vestiges of a communist ideology here\nEven by ... in any way are are there still vestiges of a communist ideology here or is this simply about hedging many [noise]\nWell a combination of things I don't it's not as simple as communism versus liberal democracy is it was I Would argue during the old Cold War\nI'm voting for his own ideology is about order and bring jobs back to Russia bringing confidence in or the nation is as opposed to what they would call an amoral west\nAnd the things that they represent they paint the wife says what\nHollywood is spewing all over the world and they said you don't want that in fact a potent is is famous for embracing Christianity and family values and\nAnd and the things that you know used to resonate in the United states in the fifties so\nHe was you know even though we suffer Terry and he still is perceived widely as a leader of the common man in the in Russia and as a result there's a lot of confidence in him you know they have adversaries but\nYou know it was just this week\nYou had you know a gentleman by the name of Valerie ... who is the chairman for the Russia's constitutional court who even started to hit\nAt perhaps we ought to amend the constitution much like the Chinese did this past year and allow potent in this case to serve be on twenty twenty four because he was just elected of course uh\nYeah this past march they're beginning to see that we need longevity and we need to have the capability to\nKeep the momentum going in and they feel confident that ... is doing that much as the Chinese are feeling confident and president Xi is well\n[noise] you're not exactly painting potent as an evil adversary and yet the ... the title of the book is alliances evil so why why should we\nAside from the fact that the Russians have a vast nuclear arsenal why should we be fearing prudent and an alliance with China\nWell what they're doing is they're weaponize eat everything against us you know if you look at political coercion predatory economics\nStrategic extortion information warfare um covert action you know I I could go through every one of those Richard and there was a long history and in fact an alliance of evil I go through sixteen\nBut his online bank closing on us they even had documents that I signed for a home equity loan only I didn't what a nightmare\nShe's the victim of a devastating crime called mortgage fraud your ... title and mortgage are kept on in life where thieves foreign and domestic hack them it's simple pay for your title borrow every penny of equity having your whole life is a police officer\nI Know about title fraud sorry register with home title walk and discovered some faith had already taken over title thank God I found out on time\nNo bank identity theft program or insurance protects you\nOh title luck will for pennies today oh title lock puts a barrier around your homes title and mortgage the instant did detect tampering there on it helping to shut down\nFind out if you're already a victim of title fraud get your hundred dollar shirt free with somebody not visited home title luck dot com oh title luck dot com\n\n\nLieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis the author of alliance of evil Russia China the United states and a new Cold War has the mystery of the end times finally arrived\nOh do you perceive us the greater threat right now to the United States Russia or China\nMade it Richard ... Russia given\nTheir provocation but also um their military capability or which they're not shy to exercise around the globe I'm very you know this issue from the ... rich\nHave said recently were in the fourth battle of the Atlantic the first one was from World war one Second World war two\nThe rich and you know have said recently we were in the fourth battle of the Atlantic the first one was in World War one Second World war two the old Cold War was the third one\nNow the Russians have put in place a nuclear submarine and you know a ... a diesel powered submarines that are just as capable almost as certainly hours not only in the\nAtlantic for the Mediterranean and elsewhere and of course they're confronting us militarily or in the air or they're back off our coastlines are they're very aggressive in terms of cyber as we know all about the allegations and\nJustifiably are the sanctions put in place because of their interference in the twenties sixteen election\nAnd here recently or in the twenty Eighteen mid term we arrested\nA someone of courses and the Chinese person in the Belgium you know these sorts of things are not to be ignored or the Russians are bellicose and they're\nYou know claims against us and to a certain degree uh we're pushing back you know President Trump's not a you know backing down and that and given that there's some given some take but maybe\nIt's not a favoring an outcome that guy is going to suit is all ah and then of course you join up with what's going on with the Chinese and perhaps in the south China Sea East China sea and of course their belt and road strategy a new issue all over the world where they're buying\nUp infrastructure and using that as of a way of planting their People's Liberation army capabilities you know literally across the globe\nYou know do I say Russia is more dangerous now China is certainly the long term more dangerous adversary\nHoly vanquished the former Soviet Union economically we brought them to their knees or they have an economy which is what their GDP about the size of Texas ... why why couldn't we do that again with another arms race\nWell we are in an arms race or I mentioned earlier the ... you know weapons are\nPutting put forward keep in mind you know you're right there GDP is miniscule compared to ours um but they hide a lot of the stuff so it's not really as obvious as one would think in terms of how much they're really plowing into their capabilities\nHe said this week you know we have these capabilities and our experts don't contest that yes they are working on capabilities and they probably will feel them and the and the near future and are they willing to use at twelve putting says\nYou know he's not going to be the first to use nuclear weapons even though there is a strategy called escalate to de escalate which isn't there twenty Fifteen doctrine that in fact they might use a tactical nuclear weapons which is\nWhy the U.S Congress or in the national defense authorization act twenty Nineteen now wants to fund a new counter to\nAh that to provide us a tactical capability in Europe so you've got all these kind of flattering around there I Would say right now because of the capabilities that Russia is posing against NATO\nAnd they of course the more strategic capability that he's been modernizing with his platforms and his uh weapons uh that they're the the mere threat in the long term threat and especially if they collaborate as they are as I pointed out earlier with\nA defense ministers consistently meeting and you mentioned the Vostok twenty Eighteen\nJoined exercise which is going to be an annual exercise these sorts served indicators and demonstrate that these two nations are pushing back against the former yeah dominance that we had across the world and arguably you know you can\nCome up with the conclusion I think that uh perhaps were not as dominant perhaps we are weakening or certainly up until the ah the Trump Administration came in and started to refuel our defense industry\nA and our Pentagon to have capabilities that we were really bleeding a and therefore we're not able to stand toe to toe with the rising Chinese\nMilitary and of course\nThough not as big as the former Soviet Union the Russians have capabilities that clearly we don't have and they were trying to catch up with even now\nLet me ask you about NATO article five course the cornerstone of the the North Atlantic Treaty Organization an attack on one member of NATO was an attack on all of its members should we really go to war with Russia if let's say they roll tanks across the stony and border we want to go to war maybe World War three over in stone yeah\nWell that's a that's why Trump has been over there you know trying to shake them up saying you've got to spend more and yeah you know even the idea of accepting Macedonia we already have twenty nine members to we need to all these other little countries\nYou know might Russia going in and and disturbed that country and then as your right to make it clear article five and we have to go to war now there's only been one of the declaration of course that was two thousand and one when we were attacked a\nYou know in New York and Washington and Pennsylvania and and the like and we declared war on terror and we're all over the place to include Afghanistan et cetera so [noise]\nUm no I I don't think that we should you know jump at that and I think that's what is in the back of Trump's mind says you know I'm not sure I Want to throw my entire nation's\nCapability and wealth and and statue in future into the hands of these little tiny nations name that may not have\nThe wherewithal not only to push back against the Russians but to a you know make these tough decisions so\nThat I think is very much on the forefront that's what John Bolton perhaps is going to talk to his counterpart in the Kremlin next week\nYou know certainly you know the defense ministers are are talking that I Know the general Dunford was just over at his counterparts than NATO and\nAnd he was saying look you folks you've got to wake up and he said yeah they are waking up to the threat posed by Russia [noise] uh but we as a nation you certainly the United states\nHad better make it very clear that if\nIf we can't back a an article five declaration by even one of these little tiny countries that are threatened Lithuania Estonia or even poll and which is a you know really a very concerned about the Russian Bear and what they might do perhaps similar to what\nThey did with Ukraine these are all issues of great\nA magnitude that um we've got to decide and thus far we haven't backed out of NATO but perhaps that's something we need to rethink\nLet's talk about China um we've been hearing all about Russian collusion in elections and so forth Nikki Haley the UN ambassador and the president has accused the Chinese of of meddling in\nAll about Russian collusion in elections and so forth are Nikki Haley the UN ambassador and the president has accused\nThe Chinese of of meddling in the mid mid term elections uh there's obviously a huge amount of economic integration with China in the United states [noise] um the big concern is I see it again comes back to cyber warfare and all these talks about\nA Chinese made computer chips in components in electronics they may have a back door or even a U.S military equipment talked me about the series the seriousness of that threat\nWhile it is a very serious threat in fact over the last year and certainly at the Pentagon you know the defense secretary Jim Mattis ah put out a mandate said look you know even in these Chinese made yeah phones you know who you", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM
