you were with me years ago and when you were first on with me are executive producer Lisa ... who thinks the world abuses I'm going to give you a special guest teasing mundane astrologer\nRight and I went like what what are you giving me somebody who's mundane for [laughter]\nIt's it's it's actually uh I I guess\nIn the field of astrology that that's the name that has been around for hundreds of years for people who study pretty much it's it's really earth astrology global astrology\nIt's the astrology of nations of world leaders things like a clip says new moons full moons major planetary alliance\nIn other words that's kinda the opposite to doing personal horoscope readings although I've been doing that just as long um so the word again now people think of mundane kind of just ordinary and that's really not what it is\nAre the results the same mundane astrology impersonal horoscope type ... you\nKnow I mean well you're dealing with the same plan a\nFine line there there's a fine line isn't there will\nAgain kind of it's the make or caused them rather than microcosm so people who are in my field it's just kind of they're they're wanting to take the broad objective universal perspective on things they prefer to look at the big picture\nOf national events current events the way the world is and when I was growing up it's just kind of where I was I read the ... to the world book um you know the almanac the world ... book affects every year we'd come out back in the fifties and sixties still going after a hundred and fifty years actually\nMostly for sports like baseball growing up in New York with all the sports baseball football and so on\nSo I got into that and was really into ... social studies and current events and then of course a President Kennedy came into office with the with the Peace Corps the alliance for progress I was I was a young teenager and then we know what happened you know in the sixties there [noise]\nAnd I just wanted to keep focusing more on the world the nation and the world probably because of that particular event\nMark tell us exactly what is ... is\nWell what we're as I said before as above so below this goes back to ancient Egypt the idea of a of being called ... or the the thrice great ... which is the actual\nEgyptian Greek name for for the planet mercury and supposedly there was a deity somebody came down and taught all kinds of numbers and mathematics\nAnd we really get a lot of our astrology we know I'm of the modern astrology we say modern goes back about two thousand years to the time of someone named Ptolemy who was also connected to Egypt but then we go back to Rome we go back to Greece but really Egypt is where there's so much and\nI also studied all kinds of things we regarding Atlanta is a when I first got in the whole field I got into reincarnation\nMeditation metaphysics lived at the coin community after spending a number of years I'm working next to the United nations have what's called the Alice Bailey center or loses publishing and I know you've had some people on you know connected to those areas\nLet's talk about ritual grade planets what does that mean\nWell again if we were just if we're all living on the sun or from the solar perspective he Leo\nNothing the pilots just keep going the ordinary cycles mercury has an eighty eight day forward moving a orbit around the sun um we have three hundred and sixty five days each planet has its normal motion but because we're Ninety three million miles away\nAnd the astrology we use is what we would call geo centric every so often all the planets no this is not the center moon towards but all the planets will tend to appear to go in reverse from our vantage point\nIt's kind of like a this is the perfect metaphor you're at a train station and you're in a train and your train is beginning to pull out okay now another train right next to yours\nIs going to go in the same direction they start pulling out after you and the kind of looks like an optical illusion for a moment like you know they're kind of ... in your direction but there are like going the other way and it's confusing well that is kind of the idea of retrograde\nMotion so what most people have tuned into over the decades\nIs mercury going in reverse because that planet does it three times from the earth prospective for about three weeks at a time and what's amazing now into that as an Eighteen if he is so I went to Google as far one of these places and you put in mercury retrograde year and then you click on images\nIt's fill George with all kinds of things like stop signs in road signs saying mercury recreate don't go here don't go there because people are actually too afraid that the cycles are negative when the planet's going to reverse\nIf you had ... would you be had five different kinds readings at any given time\nUm well let me answer it one way if people who really have studied them to feel like I have with four and a half decades\nVery intensively if you had say a five of those people me and for others and you gave them the same chart of somebody or the same event\nAnd you ask them you know specific questions I think you've pretty much get the same kind of understanding and interpretation depending on what the questions are as long as the what I Try and do you know we we've often talked about politics and\nOther things over the years because I've been on during the election times and often you know people want to hear predictions you're\nGonna go however astrology really works best in terms of ... as you said and he's studied it I'm not just psychology and UFOs and among dollars and everything else\nBut he actually studied astrology hundreds of people got married and he's the one that I use is called before whatever is born at a moment of time has the qualities of that moment of time it's because time\nShould not be thought of is like I'll meet you at ten o'clock in the morning at such and such a place\nSo that people think of time has kind of a convenient system it's really a power and so when a person is born and they have a particular astrology charts and at their first moment that they take their first breath the sun the moon the planets they're put around in the great circle\nAnd they're in different signs of ... and the stroller ... puts it altogether and reads it as a kind of\nI'm almost like a spiritual genetic code to interpret what is the greater purpose or higher destiny of that particular individual but\n... ... several hundred thousand people around the world are born on any given day and so lots of people have more or less the same kind of\nSolar energy lunar energy and climate or energy it's just indifferent formations some setting summarizing some above some low so at any rate the answer is basically I think that most of the straw injures kinda who've been around the horn a long time will come up with a similar results\nOr use psychic too or just the straw which\nI'm Glad you asked that question I okay if I say out for the pope what my my son is in high seas which tends to be at least as I understand that signed rather reticent to to be\nA for instance do well kind of planet earth for Twenty years I'm not somebody who likes marketing and advertising and commercial stuff I'm much more focused that's why the Monday in astrology or not you're a cool thing [noise]\nAnd so I'm putting the mentally I'm I ... it's interesting you asked me that because I have been very psychic\nAnd intuitive but I don't draw tested but particularly in things like sports because I that's what I loved him out\nAnd I ... in in sports or astrological you like it I Can't stay with us mark where the break we're going to come back and talk about world events how they affect all of us and the next hour we'll take your phone calls with the astrologer finished website great barrier enterprises dot com Martin Lorna\nUm and then October Nineteen Nineteen eighty seven the one day crashed I'm not anticipating anything like that at least I'm\nNot at the moment I'm the one thing that is interesting though um is that the the people call this planet burn is Iran of\nYour ear and its depending on their pronunciation but that planet the first of the outer planets um which is so powerful when America was born because when a Seventeen eighty one when the American revolution was one is in the same year that Iran is was cited by sir William Herschel and ironically and bath England [noise]\nUm but at any rate that planet has just gone into ... is okay and tourists as the main sign of money\nAnd ...\nNew York stock exchange which is a chart that is used by a lot of astrologers goes back to ... Seventeen of Seventeen Ninety two [noise] and so not yet but in oh five years\nOr Iran and spends about seven years in a sign that planet which is a planet of extreme change revolution the unconventional soda things coming out of left field shock some surprises Iran us will cross over the sun\nThe solar life force of the New York stock exchange when when that happens it'll probably happen three times in the course of the year but it is a little bit down the road although\nIf that happens with some of the other things I see on the horizon for America which is we're facing Pluto coming back uh which takes two hundred and forty seven years and if you had two hundred and forty seven years to Seventeen Seventy six he get two thousand twenty two two thousand twenty three\nAnd that's one of the big things that mundane astrologers\nOf my field people look at these kind of thing with like a a nation's chart nations are born like people if you can locate the birth time of country\nCities have charts states of the union have charts but America is definitely going to have something very big coming coming up in a number of years including a probably market changes but I don't see it right now\nWhat about ... [noise] now cryptic does\nThis this brings up something I find really fascinating and and this is one of the bigger things in the field of astrology it's part of mundane astrology it's that over about an eight hundred year cycle okay it's actually seven hundred Ninety four years\nThe planets Jupiter and Saturn which the largest fine it's even actually looked at by people going back a couple of thousand years we can go back to the middle east and they were charting believe it or not because they didn't have\nA all of our modern conveniences they were sky watchers so the the ancient people were not just astrologers they were stronger is they just didn't have the scientific kind of\nThings that we have now we can locate everything exactly to a degree of ... but basically Jupiter and Saturn or the big movers and shakers and they go through each of the elements fire earth air and water to make a what's happening is in Eighteen forty one every Twenty years\nJupiter and Saturn have been in earth science okay and that has been the rise of the main banking world the financial world as we know it\nIt's going to happen is on December Twenty one of two thousand twenty which is only two years in a couple of months from now\nThose two planets Jupiter and Saturn marriage together at the beginning of Aquarius and then for the next like a hundred and eighty years old at Jupiter Saturn going to be an air science and the point here is that crypto currency is are more connected to the air element of things that are more\nA theory that are more on the line that are more part of the communication world and not part of the physical material dimension that we've been dealing with in the Eighteen forties of the banking world the corporate world and all that so that we were ready to have a big change but we're not yet there\nHave you been following the story of the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nOr should I say unfortunately yes\nYeah I guess you could say that\nVery stormy and um I we do have a couple of things on the website that people can look\nAnd I've created something new and my daughter has created it really beautifully it's called the astro flash it allows me to do some shorter thing so I don't have to write very very long articles\nBecause so many people now they want to kind of a short hit so I've got a couple of things on great parents prizes in our or a earth Aquarius news zone so now earth of course news which is still a website we have a smaller earth Aquarius news segment and great pair enterprises and people can read some of my takes about what's been happening\nWith Brett Kavanaugh and and Dr ah Christine Blasey Ford\nInteresting take on all of this will send you can you predict ... I mean today one of his color Joe ... says I Can't call um a friend but said that he was drunk\nI Will you know it's\nInteresting with President Trump because we know he is he is he's not a drinker because of his brother dying from alcoholism\nYou know and regardless of where people are on the political spectrum\nOr the president have certainly speaks his mind sometimes to some people too much but the thing is is that you sort of wonder what is going on here with whether or not um he could withdraw I mean you know it it looks like he's going to stick with it from what from what he said you know last Thursday\nI don't think it's a thing that's going to be hard to prove anything through um you know that such and such an event actually happen however the whole ambiguity of everything is really big and what I did is I looked at the charts for the moment of Thursday when the session began you see that's part of Monday and astrology\nAlways look at the heart of a personal though you can do that and I have looked at their charts individually but very often if it's a national thing or an international thing what the mundane astrologer does as we look for the moment that something began and it's like a chart just like a baby was born and we look at that chart and that chart\nIs very descriptive of that whole tumbled last Thursday\nAnd put you on the spot and ask you if you think he's going to get confirmed astrological speaking\nWell okay here's the interesting thing you brought up the retrograde this Friday the planet Venus in the science Scorpio which is often connected to not just psychic things but sexuality Venus is going to make one of those retrograde at the end of the week and Mitch McConnell just said today hey we're going to vote on this thing this week he keeps trying to push it\nI don't think it'll happen but well\nYeah well the thing is is that there's too much unknown but if I ... for the hazard a guess you know I Would just say there's certainly pushing forward it'd be a major embarrassment but here's the deal if he doesn't get confirmed there's going to be just as conservative with somebody else who's going to be nominated\nIn in his in his place so it's not as if something like that would be a liberal or Merrick Garland they're not getting in there\nIs there anybody out there that a squeaky clean\nWell I think that would be because they've been saying that uh a\nLot but my question was do you think you'll get confirmed Yvonne\nI'm\nYour logically thinking\nWell Esther logically we know his chart I Would I Would say probably but I I just think it's going to be based on pushing from the Republicans full force you know Mitch McConnell trying to take control\nAnd you just have to guess on that side of the equation you still didn't answer me though I think it will get confirmed do you do okay All right that that that's probably why that might be one I I I I'll be wrong on but er well they'll say no you at least you took a stand right\nBecause when the whole thing happened with Trump and Hillary um were so many of the predictors and you know these forecasters ... we're all looking at everything\nUm I was on and I looked at the numbers and I thought that Hillary would probably went on she did have more you know a popular vote but she lost those key states by small amounts Michigan Wisconsin\nA Pennsylvania sixty seven thousand votes out of a hundred and twenty million and that turned the election to the electoral college in Trump won\nSo many words now next stop let's talk about Kim Jong un on and his upcoming planned meeting with President Trump the second meeting right what do you what do you think what do you think it's happening here\nUm well I'll tell you one thing and I think this little this'll be an interesting thing for you to when you talk to your other or people who come on often about Iran and the world situation [noise] I think it's a done deal that they are going to have nuclear weapons and when and they're never going to get rid of them\nBut what's gonna happen is is that because of the way Trump is doing this thing um in other words it'll be like you develop this kind of Brotherhood [laughter] whether it's a false whether or not a kind of you do these kinds of things that no other president would have ever done and you try and just sort of like make things nice\nAnd then eventually you know right now they just said the other day uh the secretary of state said we would like them to denuclearize by the end of of the president's administration I don't know if you've caught that did you see that\nAnd I sure did it it was like where we we want them to do it tomorrow last week why they dragging their feet and then during so I don't know if it was a late friday or something oh you know as long as they do it within the next two years were fine what you know and so I just I've seen this all the way through the danger I think I'm In all of this\nThis personal and diplomacy we don't know of Kim Jong un is going to be the leader tomorrow the next day in this country at least we have a succession of how\nAre you also don't know what he's doing is a trend\nExactly so you got the tricky thing we the other thing is\nUh in astrology this is very important Donald Trump's char President Trump's choice is known we've known as exact birth time for decades and it's not a mystery Hillary Clinton's birth time could have been twelve hours off nobody has figured it out it's not talked about birth certificate it's not as if we've ever seen it\nSo she was kind of an unknown quality in terms of her chart okay we didn't know whether she was morning or evening we don't know the year of Kim Jong un on\nYou ... and our breaking news when it happens on by Seventeen W.

Know you have a lot of people talk about that stuff hoard guiding and bringing in that entity and then you have your own guardian angel with you throughout your whole life I'm a firm believer and all of those things\nAre excellent let's go on to Cleveland Donna's with us welcome to the program that's my buddy Geraldo Rivera is in Cleveland now Donna\nHi I was born in Cleveland, Ohio by the way okay\nPhil Donahue is February second that's my daughter's birthday by the way the same thing okay every second Nineteen sixty in Cleveland\nOhio anytime or no time Donald you'd think twelve am wild me out of a of our nine twelve ... twelve ... twelve man ... okay hold on in the meantime bill Brown's go Indians the\nBrowns or they've got one there during the season and in ...\nQuestion I really you know not really as a whole okay\nWell we're about to give you the overview bear with me computer I this is to take me I'm George hours when I'm doing now in in minutes or an agent and you'd\nBetter be minutes on this show right could you imagine the taking hours\nOkay uh you have a it's interesting\nJust like the previous caller another moon in areas okay we're which means like from the past ... recent lifetime you've developed leadership skills that you need to bring through their kind of instinctual like being in charge being assertive without being aggressive so there was a kind of forceful part but your son sign Aquarius\nAquariums need to learn through groups through friendships through team kind of activities or global kind of things\nAre where you're ... you ... that are sort of close to your philosophy of life and what's in your heart and you're also born with Pisces rising which adds if it's positive a compassionate empathic kind of energy and also a psych equality\nInterestingly you like the previous caller have an enormous amount of Capricorn the previous caller had sun a Capricorn you have one two three five less devising have record more than even what you have an Aquarius and Capricorn\nHum is worth Saturn is moving and so you also if you want to do this you're you're moving into a strong career cycle [noise]\nAnd I mentioned earlier you asked me George something really for two to good happening and I said Jupiter going into its own kind of ... as well here's somebody and Donna\nYou're born with Jupiter and said you Terry and so it's going to be home coming few over the next year a lot of Jupiter and Saturn\nSo do something in the world there was something you know where you're making 'em expressing yourself in society and kind of a mover in shaker ... even in your community or neighborhood or your state you know to do something that you feel a significant ends and worthwhile\nAlright Don good luck to you hope everything works out so amazing mark how you're able to pinpoint individuals with a strong as\nWell because it's kind of like if if I were a doctor okay and what I'm doing if you just if you said okay this person who needs advice about their chest area and you put an x-ray in front of me I just start talking you know the doctors thing whatever it is and it's right then you'd say okay\nA serious enough that you know we're going to have to put you on antibiotics and then go back and forth a little bit for how long you know and then come back\nTo me it could be a pneumonia it might be bronchitis will will have to take you know have have you do some you know see what happens so it's kind of like a Rorschach test the chart is\nIs so magical but it's like again if this were a beginner and they they'd be looking around and saying what do I do you know I see that there's the symbol for Aquarius there's ... there's some Capricorn ... it would be like gobbledygook\nBut when you have done it for forty six years you know it's there that like on the website I have what's called the cosmic calendar which used to be and walk on the planet earth and now it's independent and that's where people can\nSee what's in the sky every day and they can they can subscribe you know for a year or two and we even have a new thing where they can try it for one week for less less than a dollar or a month or less than ten dollars it's it's kind of part of the new great fare\nWell that's fantastic that's you've been doing this for so long and you know I I think it's important for people to chart themselves right into the directions are going for advice\nMy whole goal has always been George again this partly by Pisces what I Am when I Do a consultation for somebody\nI hate to say this I mean I'd love to have them come back hey I'd like to do a deeper thing and you know I can do charts\nOf compatibility with a loved one or a parent and the child but my goal is to get them so excited that ... years later they would come back and say you know you did my reading and studying I'm doing it on my own if I can do that that is the greatest thing that I could do\nCouples ever come to you mark to say are we compatible but well\nI Will say this first of all I don't do this anymore but I used to do a lot of marriage charting really yeah it would be but the thing is it's an it's very fine\nTuned I'm there we have a ... we have reports that we sell coal friends and lovers and there's something call ...\nSo I I Would tell people to go to our strategy you poor thing and they can put in their birth data and get that relatively quickly for me to do things is ... you know it's more expensive you have to do to charge you gotta get background information both people but basically astrologers have been doing this for a long time\nAnd it's and it's like you look at Venus and Mars for pilots of love and or the sun and moons matching up and all the different climates but it's quite complex but you can do it\nAre you like a human ... card [laughter]\nWell I've created to erode decks one with my ex wife Asia or we did inner child courts which have sold well over a hundred thousand copies for the last like almost Thirty years so many different languages and she has done an enormous amount of\nPromotion of that and then I did baseball tomorrow and I just ran into the gal Laura Philips the other day I hadn't seen her a while and that has not sold all that well because the publishers sort of well doing calendars but they had never done a terrific project so I've done through longer than I've done astrology\nI'm going to give you our next to a special callers birth said first of all\nNovember Nineteen Nineteen eighty eight November Nineteen Nineteen eighty eight we're going to Bradley in Illinois Bradley do you know where you were born\nThough Illinois in\nDelano well and now how about a time any idea\nI'm I'm not sure the day time\nOkay do you have a question from mark who just want them to get going here\nI like this all spiritual aspect to you know like you know regarding also another thing like that but you know make it different than you know how you are and things like well\nI don't study Chinese now I just want to make but you know I I'm aware of the five different elements and those kinds of things in the you know the ... the birthdays that kind of [noise] but um what I Need to know is was it Nineteen eighty eight\nNineteen eighty eight the November Nineteen Nineteen eighty eight okay hold on one\nSecond okay and while you're doing that we've got a couple of minutes before the break mark and we'll take some more calls when we come back later on tonight by the way we're going to be talking about science Austin's from beyond the earth would\nGordon Moore go ahead mark\nOkay so November Nineteen Nineteen eighty eight I'm just putting in like close to sunrise this person is a sun science Scorpio but you're not going to believe is the third time in a row we looked like we have another moon in areas that that is really talked\nAbout not so unusual that yeah\nI mean there are twelve times three callers all within areas man\nThat's my that's my audience\nSo again we have somebody and this is interesting traditionally Mars which I mentioned earlier is going to hit its own zero point of areas on December thirty one and New Years which is what I said you know it's it's traditionally a planet of war but it can also be a planet of energy a planet of passion\nFor um sports exercise and this person who just called um has the moon in areas conducting Mars and he's the son signed Scorpio and traditionally Scorpio is also\nMars is night time because it ruled that water sign this person has a lot of Mars a lot of intensity\nUm a lot of enduring energy that comes through the Scorpio world and currently and Jupiter is making a ... a a crossing just finished three times on\nThis individual ... so he the fact that he made it through on this is probably part of Jupiter offering a kind of blessing just that he's on here and again I Would say to him he also has Capricorn strong\nTo do some kind of a study in metaphysics philosophy um people have his son find Scorpio need to really get into the thing was\nA sort of in a hot and heavy way and stay with it\nDo pick lottery numbers mark [noise] um\nI I I often enter you know the different lotteries

chart\n[laughter] um [noise] I don't know that that would actually do something although my favorite magazine is astronomy ya gotta Wisconsin I don't know if you get it it's beautiful and the credible\nIt for a long time and they just had it in the previous issue where there's a a free program I I don't remember exactly where it is I have in order to get [noise] which I think is really unique with it the people can the\nUh they can plot like around America around the world when the moon would a cult of planet or star and even an asteroid to sort of comes close to what you're asking about and that's actually a software program so\nIn the software world these are amazing things but meteor you know we have the you know the different kind of media storms that happen every so often like this one in August you know the Perseids and different ones\nUm there there may be some effect with some people I think more psychic Lee the people who like are prone to respond to earth changes you know some people tune in to earthquakes and animals and you know things like that so I'm anything's possible but it wouldn't really change the charts so much\nAll right let's go back to the final coal series they line up for you or your ... birthday is October Twenty one Nineteen fifty coming up pretty soon a birthday October Twenty one Nineteen fifty we'd go west to Albert in Tucson, Arizona hey Tucson how are you Albert\nHey good evening George good evening mark\nUnhappy upcoming birth to my friends\nOh well thank you hey another year oh there you\nKnow they keep clicking by do you have a question for mark I just want him to do reading for you\nOr he can do or reading my question would have been kind of in a financial limbo for the last year so I was wondering if that was going to change and the other question is about you know it's love and money\nEven money go ahead Mr learner\nUh by the way I did follow the aries three\nPeople in a row because there's something called the part a fortune in Arabic astrology which was developed a thousand years ago they were all mathematically oriented that that's where we get algebra\nAnd there was what's called parts like the part of the birth part of marriage and so on something called the part a fortune and throughout the entire a segment there the part of fortune for Los Angeles and out on the west coast was in the areas the sign that the moon was showing up and the part of fortunes very connected to the moon\nAnd the moon was also the moon as an assigned cancer and is rising in the first house of self expression which is the kind of archetype all areas area so there was a reason that happened will this fellow now has a ... and ... is\nFrom from the past from another life or other existence is in the past [noise] this person has developed in this could be why the financial thing I'm\nMore of sort of a need for compassion may be working in religion and philosophy behind the scenes and it's not ... not very much of a mover and shake her in the world so\nAn individual people who've Pisces moon come in and they're more impact and paths okay for good or for ill okay and some people with strong Pisces moon can get sort of pulled into they can become vulnerable you know to other people and lose their way but\nThe sun sign of this individual is the sign of a partnership Libra and he also has Neptune mercury and Venus\nThere in that science so as far as relationship is concerned the keynote esoteric leaf reliever is I Choose the way that leads ... between the two great lines of force and my mentor\nI'm dating Roger talked about lever as the great pyramid following the mystery of the things which is really Leo in Virgo with the body of a lie on the head of a heavy a woman\nAnd so the whole Egyptian mystery kind of tradition it goes back to the summertime is of cancer Leo Virgo and lever and so so basically spiritually\nThis person should study everything about the great pyramid and that would be very good because there's a lot of lore about mysteries even Jesus going and being a potentially initiated you know two thousand years ago during those last years from you know from age twelve or Thirteen to thirty three\nGoing all around the world to India possibly to Egypt going to a glass and very and in England I mean these are kind of war but may very well have happened so study the great pyramid study Egypt\nA and get into things like reincarnation metaphysics that might help\nOr anything else they're Albert\nNo just uh how is my upcoming year looking well Jupiter you have for planets celestial bodies inside the terrier so Jupiter is kind of tick off what are called conjunctions to palace which has to do with solving problems\nTo get into a kind of study about how to solve your problems and developing strategic thinking and you'll also have Jupiter contact your Mars what's called tire on and series\nSo those are all unusual planets but they ... their gifts from heaven so Jupiter the king of the gods which has a lot to do with you know success power of positive thinking faith Providence benevolence is really trying to give you some gifts here so hopefully you can use them\nNext up we're going to the Rockies November twenty of Nineteen fifty five let's go to Jean in Florida and she was born to two forty in the morning or mark\nBoy you're going fast moving

[laughter]\nWell now we've got the beginning of Aquarius ... uh where you have some strong energy is George and I do as well moon at the beginning of Aquarius\nAnd this woman who is called a has the moon with higher on which was discovered Nineteen Seventy seven entire\nOn is kind of a shop and the mentors so this brings up the idea of getting involved with the group or some kind of group process would be really good from a soul spiritual standpoint we're kind of building rainbow bridges between your spiritual life and higher destiny and your personality world but definitely\nTeam or group were community work global kind of connections you've done this before in the past and it's still important to keep doing it just like the other a color your you're going to get the fortunate oh Jupiter energy you have\nAn asteroid called Juno the planet Venus which represents represents love relationship\nOr creative artistry and what's called the north no to the moon which is the moon's orbit they're all on such a terrier so Jupiter is going to help you\nWith all the ... energy that the the big issue probably in your life of being a sun science Scorpio and you have sun close to Saturn is you know you need to be the warrior the turkey note for scorpions warrior I Am in from the battle I emerged triumphant in every sun science Scorpio comes into life\nHaving to be daring and courageous but also off and having a lot of um challenges just kind of like the need to die to the old and then be reborn but we're Jupiter is moving\nUm is very helpful for you over the next uh you

the earth's his website is his name and it's linked up the coast to coast team dot com some of these cases in your book or just bring back just amazing memories\nOr I just refuse to remember how excited I was Everytime I'd read a brand new UFO story and just looking at them and flying saucers from beyond the earth recollect all these all these stories all over again are amazing\nI kept some good file to ... to go through the years and I've been I've been wanting currently saw last ten years to do this book and finally\nGot around to it and hopefully it's my uh it may be on the phone but I think I can maybe has proven about this subject and\nWhy do you think the government really has not disclosed what's going on\nWhy don't they tell us\nI think they're coming close with this latest program at the Pentagon I think if the closest I've ever come but um I have a theory that it it it may sound kind of a quirky but\nI think that we have known all along where these uh uh saucers that come from and that we've been actually exchanging perhaps technologies what's I mean it it sounds like a far out thing is that something would approve of it in his heyday\nA matter of fact he was reluctant to put out any of the Occupy putting on a porch until I wrote the book strange effects from UFOs in Nineteen sixty nine which was really a night cap publication\nBut for the first time we got into the the um occupation cases and uh and and and things like that but of course ... main focus was to get congressional hearings he managed to do it twice and ... Nineteen sixty six Nineteen sixty eight\nAnd he has such great hopes for the University of Colorado\nA UFO project matter of fact I call my chapter on that liar liar pants on fire the University of Colorado UFO product project [laughter] because we are just symptom a disagreement of our uh out of some of our best cases\nAnd I'm In the long run they just almost completely ignored them\nI remember when the ... report came out kind of food do you lose\nThat was January of Nineteen sixty nine ... from that time\nOn all the funding for night cap went out and then a a a there was a knockout staff member who was also at the CIA connections and\nI think to say I had been trying to take it over a for some time of course Roscoe Helen quarter who was the first chairman of the night cap board after ... took over how was the first director of the CIA\n[laughter] yeah yeah what do you see to see I wanted to do like just squash it\n[laughter] well I think that's part of it but at the same time I think they wanted to keep it going as long as they had control over it\nAnd um but ... didn't believe that even they call of didn't believe that I tried to persuade him that there was a a staff member named Stuart Nixon who had a who had a practically admitted to me that he was a CIA plant and put the date for\nSome reason didn't want to believe it [laughter] um which which struck me kind of um\n[noise] off balance because uh\nActually that was the one that before I ever came on board I think it was on sixty four maybe sixty three were to CIA agents came into the office and they went through the night kept files of Hurley over a period of several hours and um\nSo I think they knew all along that uh you know but they have a certain amount of control over it [noise]\nBut uh and and kill\nA\nI don't know I I just don't know how much kill really new I really believe that it was a CIA took I think he believed the CIA was willing to let my cap continue um\nAs long as they can monitor\nAs long as they could monitor right and I I think he was shocked to as I was when he and I were suddenly fired at the end of Nineteen sixty nine who fired you\nOr is it um\nI think it was a joke Brian he was the CIA contact the did you see the CIA member and the ... and and uh and and Colonel Brian\nUm and also do it for an a and a heart transplant and see a connection store next to know is the the the uh health plan to I'm the office had CIA connections\nAnd uh I think they were just trying to see how they could eventually take it over and not make it look like it was a CIA takeover\nWas an independent private the organization\nIt was supposed to be yeah exactly\nWho who who have the authority to let you go and kill too you said\nThat's correct he will use the founder\nSo yeah I Know but but the thing is that the we had a board of governors\nAnd um and early sixty nine they appointed a keen how the prices are now he was the director first they put it in the present and they appointed me the vice president because they call at that time had left and taken a more lucrative position\nAnd or a bus and by the end of that year it took less than a year for them to a closed down me or organization but I think they had been a\nA a ... of\nThe really monitoring us all along metro we haven't even thought the air force had won the a K O and I were on the phone now can you hold live to a hundred miles south\nOf Washington DC he wasn't on the office and all that often maybe once every two months or so [noise]\nUh and we were talking about a UFO case and we're
