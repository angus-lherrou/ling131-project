loan lenders he's the author of the student loan scammed the most impressive ... you in history and how we can fight back he's also been selected as one of the seven financial heroes by money magazine back in two thousand nine and here he is back on coast it goes Alan welcome back my front\nYard it's great to be with you\nHave things changed since the last time we talked about student loans doors they've gotten worse I bet\n[laughter] well yeah they they have indeed uh gotten worse ah we're probably at it and I think I was on about a year ago as we've added around maybe a hundred and twenty five billion onto the tab\nWhich is now sitting officially in about a one point five trillion um but quite frankly it's certainly a significantly higher than that even still but a lot of loans didn't the don't get counted\nWell let me ask you about the scam first of all you know if you go and buy a car and it's thirty five thousand dollars you know you've got an auction here and that is I'm going to buy that car for thirty five thousand apartment to walk away and look for something else\nWhy do you call the student loan situation a scam when nobody's forcing these kids to take these loans to go to school\nAnd I know what you're going to say but I got to ask you that\nWell no it's it's a fair question a and you know in the case of automobiles we have Lehman laws right if the school provides a in a state of the car doesn't work then you know we can take it back well obviously that option doesn't exist for student loans\nBut what is really missing from student loans that people I think probably many if not most of your listeners aren't aware of or is that nearly every fundamental consumer protection that exist for every other type of loan\nHas been stripped from student loan for example student loans have no bankruptcy writes a there are no statute of limitations are uniquely for student loans a fair debt collection practices truth in lending laws these things have all been restricted or remove\nSpecifically for student loans and most most blatantly for federal student loans George the feeling was that the federal\nAnd loans and most most blatantly for federal student loans George so the feeling was that the federal government makes are the ones that are most option of the consumer protections that I just mentioned\nWhat if they did something like this that they had a guarantee that a student in his or her chosen major uh would be guaranteed a job at a certain salary when they graduate and if they don't get that job for whatever reason the economy jobs aren't available\nThey get that discounted author student loan novel huh\nThat's a that's a that's an interesting thought and in fact in some but first world countries in the nation or something like that in fact happens Australia for example um you don't have to repay your student loans unless you're making a minimal ah annual salary I think it's forty thousand dollars or so\nUm that could work a ... and you know there's a lot of pretty interesting ideas on how to pay for college out there\nBut I can tell you that what we have now today is the most predatory lending system that this country has ever seen a you know the founding fathers way back in the day\nOr people like Thomas Jefferson George Washington they were being pilloried by British brings in merchants\nOr so after the revolution ... when they wrote the constitution actually around the time of the revolution [noise] um they demanded uniform bankruptcy laws and they did this ahead of the power to declare war\nHas the power to raise an army and many other very important powers ah so the founders you know are they required bankruptcy laws for a very good reason and this is exactly what's been taken away from student loan\nThat's all they were going to take calls next hour with Alan and those of you who have student loans definitely check in with us and want to see how things have been manageable for you when\nYou do that when you call it the student loan scam give me that definition Allen\n[noise] well you know when it becomes financially viable in fact when it becomes financially preferable to the lenders for the bar or to fail to be able to repay the loan in other words to default\nOn the loan belonging to default don't\nThat's right if it becomes more financially lucrative for them when a loan defaults rather than remains in good stead\nWell that's a defining hallmark of a predatory lending system and we're seeing that throughout the lending system for the collection companies and the services and the guarantor ours are often are the very same companies by the way they would much rather see a default than a loan the remains in good stead\nSo this is you know in stark contrast to even say credit cards where your credit card companies are thrilled if they get back even you know ten cents on the dollar on a default [laughter]\nAh but it turns out that the uh the lending system can make far more than a dollar for every dollar paid out on a default in fact I'm all for a loan for federal student loan default and gets rehabilitated\nThis alone can easily double or triple and the agents that I'm compelled to borrow or to what's called rehabilitate these defaulted loans they going to sixteen ... percent commission right off\nThe wall so you know where\nThey can make the three hundred bucks over the course of ten years for servicing a healthy loan\nThey can make ten twenty thousand dollars in a matter of four or five six years on a defaulted loans that they can build a bar or to put through rehabilitation\nAnd so the financial incentives that are under ... a federal student loan system are just completely perverted and it's been turn I mean really federal student loans have essentially been weaponized against the borrower\nSnowing explain the process of a default to loan in how the lenders make more money how does that happen and let let's use a student loan for your college fifty thousand dollars as an example which is not on your toes\nAnd by any means so a student goes out borrows the thousand dollars or his parents are her parents borrow fifty thousand dollars and then they default what happened [noise]\nSure that's a that's a good case a good ... easy numbers to start with so I fifty thousand or student loan when the student graduates what say they they give it their best shot and after maybe two two and a half or three years [noise]\nAh they're unable to make payments they lose a job or or whatever happens so with two hundred and Seventy days of non payment [noise] um the student can expect to learn to be thrown into default\nSo the fifty thousand dollar case that we're discussing here would probably default it's somewhere around ... let's say Seventy five or eighty thousand dollars will with penalties and fees and capitalize interests that are slapped onto that loan very quickly that would escalate to say a hundred and Fifteen twenty\nTwenty five in the bottle or is responsible for that\nYes yeah the borrower will begin getting demand letters for payment in full for\nRoughly ... let's say a hundred and twenty five or so thousand dollars oh my God\nSo what the what the lending system will do will say oh you're into falls on your loan\nBig trouble you know the federal government has all these Orwellian collection a power as we can follow your for the rest of your life [noise] we can garnish your Social Security check you know you can't run you can't hide we can get you fired from your job if you work in public employment we can have your professional license suspended we can even have your driver's license suspended in some states\nIt'll be taxed too you stuff like that\nThat's right yeah um you know your income tax returns will be garnished et cetera so huge amounts of power that none other no other lending system has are brought to bear on the bar or\nSo ultimately they will wind up um hopefully in the government hopes to I'm going through a loan rehabilitation so this is where they make payments\nFor about for ten months typically none of those payments go towards alone this just goes directly into the pockets of these third party agents that oh this rehabilitation\nAt the end of the process they wind up signing for much a newer much larger loan say a hundred and forty fifty thousand dollars [noise] well these agents I can get a sixteen percent commission on the value of that new loan so in the case of this fifty thousand dollar bar or\nThese agents that will compel them to do this loan rehabilitation get a paycheck for what what would that be sixteen thousand plus he talks about twenty four thousand dollars goes directly into the pockets of the servicers\nFees and the ... indeed agents or collection companies\n[noise] well yeah these agents are typically I'm large sort of conglomerates and there's four of them they're Sallie Mae navy and there's ... there's the ... higher education systems agency [noise] uh and there's Great Lakes but there are others as well on these\nThese companies own servicers they own collection companies and they also own Gehring tours so they also have a lot of legacy student loans from back in the day before\nPresident Obama so these companies make out like bandits they would\nLoans from back in the day before\nPresident Obama these companies make out like bandage they would rather see alone that goes into default rehabilitate than\nUh than alone there were amazing just good said and I should probably say here George to all the people listening out there to rehabilitate you're alone it's horrible idea according to Moody's these devoted loans to rehabilitate they default again\nThree to four times and they just keep growing oh that's right yeah and if you can imagine said a hundred and fifty thousand dollar rehabilitated loan default again\nA dozen others in the process that critical Health News dot com we use education

once said there are two ways to conquer and in slavery nation one is by the sword the other is by debt and you sure have that with the student loan debt so Ellen if somebody gets sued for not paying their student loan or they're going to lose in court ... there's no way to win is there\nWhat happens more often than you would think George is that they will receive a summons from a an agent of the federal government and maybe they get it maybe they don't\nIf they don't get the sons and they become subject to arrest\nShow in the state of Texas for example in around Houston one of the federal districts there people are literally being hauled out of their homes by SWAT Team [noise] and and and forced to ah to come into court that way\nTo deal with their student loans I kid you not\nDo you mean if they're not properly served by a process server as the sheriff or private process serving ... company if they're not served ... you're saying that can go and get them anyway and take them in the ... in in the court\nThat indeed is what is happening in the state of Texas certainly in just this one federal district or they had plans on arrest gene between Thirteen and I think Fifteen thousand people [noise]\nUh the one case that we know about ah the gentleman had an original I think it was a three thousand dollar loan [noise]\nAnd they hold this guy in literally with a SWAT Team and uh they wouldn't let him out until he agreed to pay something like seven or eight thousand dollars\nWhich included you know penalties interests in court costs and these were the federal marshal and the court et cetera um\nThat's debtors prison back again\nWell that's right you know the the founding fathers or even people like Thomas Jefferson\nFlirted with a debtors prison James Wilson actually spent time in debtors prison that was what the founders were trying to avoid when they wrote the constitution and demanded bankruptcy writes ahead of the power to declare war and as far as an army but it looks like we're sort of headed back in that direction at this\nGod that's crazy now does anybody have any recourse so let's say that they're having trouble paying their student loans\nThey all fifty thousand or they want to pay the fifty let's assume that's what they want to do but you're saying because of these defaults the fifty becomes a hundred and Fifteen thousand and if they default on that it grows even more can't they just cut a deal on the fifty\n[noise] well they can and here's the deal I'm [laughter] it's really no deal at all um the federal government typically will settle on a defaulted alone if the pays one hundred and twenty percent the value of the loan at the time that it ... it\nWas kind of settlement is that\nMost people it's a completely unworkable settlement you know people were having trouble paying on their loans in the first place uh to think that they can write a check for a hundred and twenty percent of the value of the loan

schools are participating in the student loan program these days and so the prices of trade schools are getting jacked through the roof or as well you know when you have this landing system stand behind these schools\nYou know they can charge and almost what they want because there's all this quote unquote free money out there and so for guys that want to pay out of pocket\nYou know what are they supposed to do they can't compete with that\nUh and it's just a travesty it's it's really shutting more people out of getting an education even at even provoke Texan other trade schools are as it is you know allowing them to actually go to college which was the intent of the lending program in the first place\nTo go to Gordon sorry to hear the\nGordon in Lakeland, Florida have already go ahead\nHey thank you for taking my call 'em I Want to publicly think Allen he the one that pointed out to me\nThat the lack of bankruptcy protections encourages predatory lending um and of course a tuition and inflation I I already knew then the more you dive than loans especially the taxpayer on her comments gonna crash the dollar by the way because almost ten percent of total debt is college dad\nOkay I don't need to do it hypothesis but now there's one thing they don't want to mention and that is the the I'm a conservative everyone knows that I'm the guy that almost one I lost a forty three\nSplit decision and the parents out okay I'm pro life pro gun I'm as far as conservative as Rush Limbaugh and most of those not even the liberals want a free hand out okay\nBut the college tuition is technically and legally attack because there's money going to an arm of the state government college and were being over tags that though it wasn't real and matter of fact the private colleges about ten times when you adjusted for inflation what it was back in the fifties and\nThat though it wasn't real and matter of fact\nThe price of college is about ten times when you adjusted for inflation what it was back in the fifties and hear the fang okay we spend a lot of money on our military and it if it were too much really we spend a lot in you know even at the conservative we spend a lot of money on those the security but we can only ... those things a little bit\nThe on the third or fourth thing is probably the tax dollars are being used to make er Yankee college loans and we don't need to spend any money at that not only does it put the tax dollar on the hook and it can crack the dollar like Greece or Venezuela Georgian\nAnd I'm Alan by the way I'm Alan was good enough to make me the leader of the Florida group and\nI Hope I'm I have gotten on an equal talking a little too much and I miss an eye and all of the reason it here's the deal OK almost ... percent of the tone that his college dead and it's going to craft a dollar that the only thing if we get rid of the window and get a credit card\nLoans but let them get a credit card it'll the tax dollar and it'll save the student college will drop like Iraq and it I Love I Love my rage man 'cause I'm a conservative and they provide jobs in hospitals and police\nBook and here it can get and I and I would vote for Trump if I had a chance to get a look and he can get bankrupt he repeatedly for millions in bailout and handouts\nAnd if all these rich bank and the college is going to get rich on the standing looking here that that that those are the two beneficiary in here and\nThen okay and they use the third or I we uh got your point there Gordy\nAllen [noise] you know I'd buy he said a lot\nThere but I appreciate all his points and he's exactly right you know if we can throw seven trillion dollars into Afghanistan and Iraq [noise]\nI think we can throw maybe a trillion or so at the student loan problem but but more importantly from conservative point of view [noise] you know if the government was to drop out of the lending system tomorrow\nI think on balance that would probably be a good thing it would return prices\nBack down to rational levels uh and you know it would do would I'm really clean out a lot of the sort of socialistic uh nonsense that's been allowed allowed to creep into the system but ... but ... but in particular it would it would lead to lower prices\nWill go with all the debt right now Alan would you are just a white to clean\nWell I Will say that is\nAt a minimum bankruptcy protections are not restored so that people can go to a judge and according to the wisdom of a judge I'm settled that debt now according to their means\nIf that does not happen then we're looking at something like a full on jubilee soon you know the Democratic and I'm a nonpartisan guy but I Will say that uh the Democratic socialist particularly in New York are starting to win elections on the promise of canceling all student debt\nAnd [noise] you know I don't think that is maybe the best solution because there are you know forty percent of the people are out there are able to successfully repay their loans but that is exactly what we're looking at very soon if at a minimum a the bankruptcy writes the founders demanded aren't returned\nAll and you do have salaries and teachers' salaries and things that you have to keep the university going which should be reasonable right\n[noise] yeah that's right um you know my best estimate is that the colleges are so flush with cash right now there are so badly overcharging their students by and large\nThey could probably suffer eight thirty percent if not forty percent reduction\nIn the student loan income that they are currently receiving and still be able to keep their doors open not have to lay off one person [noise] uh and you know be able to service all the students that they do today so I think there's a lot of capacity there for price reduction in academia um\n[noise] so yeah I mean ending the student loan program tomorrow would I agree probably be pretty devastating to a lot of schools [noise] um but certainly there's got to be a middle ground [laughter] you know and with bankruptcy back with the department of education having to contend with the same bankruptcy laws that every other Linder has to contend with\nA that would go a long ways towards compelling them to crack the whip on the schools to lower their prices improve their quality and decrease the amount of time that the students are having to stay in school now to get a degree\nFirst time caller mark in Provo, Utah hey mark go ahead\n[noise] well George you said they can't uh they don't force you to take student loans but when I started school I was on a full scholarship they even pay for my books but the federal government makes you go to the student loan counseling so I went\nAnd I told the lady I'm I don't know why I have to even be here among full scholarship and she told me Will Hunting if I were you I Would borrow as much as you can put it in the bank and earn interest on it\nOh boy I Would love to sue her this did you end up doing that oh yeah and then life happens the money disappears you know over\nFifty thousand dollars just in interest on my student\nLoans and loan balance is a hundred and three thousand dollars a gallon never pay it off I Will die owing money do they harass you mark\n[noise] no I'm right now they've got me on some ridiculous thing where uh my payment is zero [noise] um I did a double major in a minor in to some point I did need student loans but uh the irresponsibility um I just I I Would have never tasted that crack had she not pedaled it\nTo me exactly exactly well what do you think Yellen these loans are\nPushed on the students were way ahead of any scholarship or any other um any other aid that where you don't have to pay back I mean the college and some of the colleges are making money on these loans by the way they're they're making these loans and then reselling them\nTo private banks and so the colleges are in on the action as well and it's it's it's just disgusting [laughter] you know I might actually add um the repayment program that the to mark is on a is probably the income based repayment for him\nTo a bunch of government programs out there that sound like they are forgiveness program so there's public service loan forgiveness there's income based repayment but what all everybody out there needs to know\nIs that all of these programs are failing the vast majority of people who try out for them so we now know that the success rate for the public service loan forgiveness program where\nYou work for a you know if you work in a college or hospital other nonprofit get your loans forgiven only about point three percent of the people trying for that forgiveness are actually getting it so the rest are being disqualified and they're being left going far far more so mark mentioned he was making zero dollar payments\nWell interest continues to accrue on that loan so\nSo that loan is getting bigger and bigger and statistically speaking there's only about a ten percent chance that mark will make it through to the end of that I'd be our program and actually get the loans forgiven or and I might add that any amount forgiving under the I'd be our program is taxable income\nSo with twenty five years\nGet a nice little thing that send to the IRS that says this is income for this year\nTaxable income with twenty five years you get a nice little\nPlaying the center the IRS that says this is income for this year\nThat's right at the end of the twenty five years you get a tax bill which probably equals or probably even exchanged the amount that you were originally borrowed\nThe federal government is not benign altruistic key is you know she can help its citizens get educated federal government particularly the department of education they are out to make a buck and they are making a\nWas gonna say they are obviously know how to make money don't think\nThat's right you know it was ironically

E. R. dot com\n\n\nAnd welcome back this is our final segment with Alan calling just we talk about these student loans scam Ellen are the student loans that are out there now hurting or helping the economy\n[noise] [noise] [laughter] I think it's clear that it's hurting the economy at this point [noise]\nUh you know interest alone on one point five trillion dollars more than Ninety billion dollars a year or so that money that gets taken away from home purchases a you know business formation\nA auto ... you know other ... big ticket items that improve the economy [noise]\nUh so certainly is hurting in that respect\nAnd you know it's it's also hurting in a number of ways that are really harder to quantify you know when you've got forty four million people\nA straddle or you know strapped under ... this new sort of debt levels\nDirectly to sort of oppressive type of debt [noise] um this really can make people do bad things um you know make people do things for money that they wouldn't otherwise do\nI'm also forces a lot of people into the underground economy and certainly those people pay no taxes and and et cetera so so it's really hurtful in many ways that are maybe not a parent or to the naked eye\nLet's go to Paul Fresno, California to get things started here west of the Rockies ball go ahead sir\nHey I'm very grateful you pick Michael thank you very much Georgia now them Tom I graduated from college to dealt with it being just before it closed down [noise] I'm I'm One of those fortunate who are that one\nUm I graduated from college two thousand Fifteen just before it closed down [noise] I'm I'm One of those fortunate case who are at one point three to aloe with talking about that actually got um most cars that were given by a got thirty four thousand of the thirty seven thousand but I got you know that I owed\nForgiven wow how'd you do that graduations\nI appreciate that thank you well I I did a little bit of a horrible way or the bears bumping called a binding\nAnd what that is is that like a lifting of pretty much like a courses you cook or trade the trader Joes yeah and the ... the benefit of course who are the reason they're in the situation because they both by job place where it so if you were from a certain time period to a time period at the end of the school I'm\nPretty much that's when they committed a that broad so it actually took me from I Would have to say December to ... to around August of two thousand and fixing to get it all given what I did is I actually wrote Kamala Harris and email um she surprisingly bonded\nUm but that the avenue that I went to get a lot to do but I had to write a cover letter come I submitted a pretty much a with a cover letter I had to put a plenty on it then I had to pretty much just\nA political out but what I'd gone through a had to submit transcript that to a a cover letter transcripts and pretty much all the information that I actually had to prove that I went to college\nIt was the fraud that got it reduced I guess right\nNow yeah so that's one of the main things I put there because if you see many of the college commercials what being a problem with this life long job placement of cooking show what how I falls advertising\nYouth exactly so when the schools shut down there goes your fall on the job place there goes your your life long drop like what if it\nRight you got that right or interesting Alan isn't it\nYeah that you know and that's a good point and I maybe I should have brought up at some other point the show there is some breaking news now where if you went to particularly for many of the for profit colleges they get caught well why you're seeing just like the just like Paul mentioned\nSo they'll misrepresent their job placement rates in you know say oh you know average earnings per year degrees this much and these could be lies and so there actually is a rule that was put in place by the Obama administration where if your school ... you\nBeen at least on paper you have available to you and avenue called defense to repayment where you at least theoretically you can get your loans cancelled and I\nI think mom Paul is probably one of the very lucky few that has seen this works successfully for him [laughter] ah but I Will say that even just yesterday and I'm One of the federal court struck down an attempt by the department of education to\nSort of do away and slow walk this on this program so as it stands now today there's a bit more hope for people who are light to buy their colleges are then there was a a couple of days ago um now I Can't say for sure what the results of this will be\nBecause believe me the department of education has no desire or intentions of forgiving anybody's loans if it doesn't absolutely have to uh you know under gunpoint practically by the legal community but [noise] um but there is a bit more hope today than there was before so you you were lied to by\nParticularly for profit college or you may may may possibly have some avenue for record snow\nWhile you know with all these credit card fraud that's out there and just credit fraud indeed I mean if you get a letter from a collection agency for some debt you don't even remember could be yours maybe it's ten Twenty years old if you ask them for a copy of the ... and they don't provided to you they're up a creek aren't they\n[noise] well that's right and\nKnow similarly for student loans we find a lot of private loans the underlying note uh well first of all the loan has been bought and sold so many times that whoever says they owned a note actually does not owned the note and they have no business collecting on that loan [noise] um\n[noise] I Know there are other there are some avenues that the the lenders can go to they can say that the note was lost and they have other avenues to prove that is a valid note but that certainly is something to be aware of\nAnd I should also say people who have private student loans are not federal student loans [laughter] they do have statute of limitations so somebody comes up to you Twenty years hands and starts demanding money from you for a private loan than almost certainly that loan is not\nLittle suspect little there you suspect\nUm and you want to look into the statute of limitation laws that govern that particular alone depending on where you live or where you took up alone\nIt's going to pat in Minneapolis used to the Rockies Hi Pat go ahead\nI worked in a Social Security office for a while and I figured out that at ... at least one of the agenda of the destruction of the Social Security program because there are families with co signers\nOf grandparents and parents and still none of them are ever going to get any security and all the question and I think Justin alright\nIf I own a house ... signed on one of these student loans is does that blame that on my house so that when I die instead of my air is getting at it's collected for a for a student loans kept\nThat goes to the lone first doesn't it\nWell that's a yeah that's a great question to her first point\nYes Social Security wages are being garnished as we speak for student loans and what is even more disturbing icy legislation out there right now it has been passed yet but I see legislation out there right now which offers a loan forgiveness in uh in return for people for going\nTheir Social Security when they when they reach retirement age [laughter] uh so there are some people at work in Washington DC very busy trying to figure out how to take away Social Security benefits down the road from student loan borrowers\nInteresting is that what did you hear what other things that your\nFamily has already where we'll take generations the grandparents and parents and
