hello there Mr Warren\nHey George I am so excited to be on the program tonight it's Halloween the event oh I Love it\nWe're going to dig into this extremely creepy thing it's like a man you mirrors I also have an update for you\nAbout time warps in UFOs or later on we're going to give away some free tickets\nThe Saturday a there's a lot going on tonight so I'm pretty pumped to be with the\n... the way I'm bummed 'cause I've got to be in Denver taping some beyond belief shows on Saturday and Sunday I'm going to miss your event but at least the spirit of me will be with you OK\nWell you know what when people say that to me it means something so thing you got that\nAren't the cycle man the of it's a small enclosed area set up with a cheer dim lighting in the mirror is Ingles so you don't reflect anything but darkness it's intended to communicate with spirits the dead have you tried using one of these things\nOh yes Oh yes as a matter of fact a doctor Raymond Moody as a friend of mine and I even invited him to western North Carolina years ago to train me\nAnd the number of other people in person in the ... technique um and it it is really however George began with me when I was a teenager\nBecause I started writing articles about ghosts and spooky things when I was quite quite young for the uh local newspaper and I found again and again\nWhen I go into a haunted place\nSomeone would take me into a room and say this is the most talented room and I would look around and see two mirrors facing each other [noise]\nUh it got to the point where I Would go to a supposedly haunted house and say to the owner don't even tell me what the haunted room is let's see if I can figure it out and walk around and I'd find a room that had reflections like that\nAnd there's something about mirrors that magnifies ghostly and spiritual and often creepy phenomenon um there are a number of possible explanations for this for one thing when you have two mirrors facing each other and you look at the reflection it just looks like an infinite tunnel\nRight like it goes on and on and on forever\nAbsolutely it's a reflection within a reflection with and now what is light light is electromagnetic energy and so it may be that we're creating some kind of an infinite tunnel of light which operates has some sort of a ...\nThat these beings that have some electromagnetic connection can sort of travel through to go in and out of our realm and that's pretty far out there and I know that but when you look at the mirror [noise]\nUm there's a similar phenomenon going on because we don't know what consciousness is when you look at a near what you're doing is you're seeing yourself\nAnd so it's almost like you're creating an infinite tunnel of consciousness there and it may be that this helps to facilitate the passage of the spirits into our dimension\nOf course ancient people used to cry by staring into reflective things whether it be just a a a glass of water or a bowl of water or a creek\nHighly polished stone but there's something about this idea that when you take a reflective of substance and you gaze on it and you go into a meditative state\nThen if your intention is to have a paranormal experience\nYou have an experience Georgia and I want everybody to understand this I'm not talking about some kind of a little illusion\nLike oh you see something spooky that shows up in the mirror or you just get some kind of a dream like trance like state known them when you do this properly and that's what Dr moody has studied how to do this properly\nWhen you perfect this you will actually have the experience of a full bodied tangible three dimensional\nSeemingly Corp portrayal figure that will appear right in front of your head to toe and this being can come up to you and not only speak to you\nBut touch you\nAnd so the idea here is that if you know how to use this technique and it's important to you and you go in there with a purpose you can create that experience for yourself and that will be your reality\nHow do you get rid of the spirit if you want to does it go back in what happens\nWell fortunately most of the time when people go into a truly well designed properly oriented psycho man the and they're going in there with a mission they usually want to contact someone that they love\nWho has passed on and there's a preparation for that so if you were to go to somebody like Dr moody and say well I Want to contact my deceased mother\nThen he would take you through a period of time that could be days where he just talks to you about memories of your mother and and says you know grab whatever artifacts that you may be able to find the reminds you of her and he pictures and he really talks you extensively through this whole process of remembering her\nAnd so then when you go in there your mind is charged with the intention and uh so that is what it dramatically increases the chances of your mother coming through\nNow when this becomes very scary as when you have people who experiment a you know people talk about like I Know just about enough to get me in trouble\nSort of thing you know the people who go in there and they just say I don't care I just want to see something and when you go in there with that attitude that is a danger to you you are well you know you get what you ask for right\nI just want to see something and if you want to if you go into these situations and it's a very simple to create a cycle Mandy\nBut you're convinced they work\nThey work they definitely weren't they weren't in fact\nThe over the years I've done many experiments where you know we'll set up a camera to see if we can record the experience and sometimes we can't record what happens but it's very real for the person who's sitting there and the chair\nAnd so the basic thing you need is a big mirror on the wall of a dimly lit room with a chair in front of\nThe ... same mirror mirror on the wall I Wonder if that has anything to do with it\nAnd bloody Mary and blood you know all that kind of stuff yeah I think ... the odd thing is you're not supposed to position the mirror directly in front of you so you can directly see your own face\nYou put a slightly above Iowa level usually have something like a candle or little nowadays LAPD lap in the background\nAnd maybe some white noise I Love playing white noise it helps a lot with the and I've taken probably ah you know close to two hundred people through Sacramento him experience and I would say that a\nLot of people chores or is it is a lot of people yeah I I started doing this a long time ago even before I met Dr moody and a three quarters of them easily I almost want to say a hundred percent\nBut I always am you know worried about or maybe I'm forgetting one or two incidents but almost a hundred percent of the people had some kind of a paranormal experience they couldn't explain and about half of them actually had\nThe full on it and that's dramatic Josh with us we'll come back and talk about time warps in some UFOs here's our first emerging artists Paul Rubin from Santa\nCalifornia with a song called the winter when\nI'm going to take it to a certain place I don't think I said where of course that plays turned out to be ...\nLas Vegas outside of Las Vegas Nevada [noise]\nAnd um I I I sort of gave everybody a heads up and then when I found something that surprised me um it just went viral I mean I I made international news with this discovery it was a Newsweek inside edition and the ABC NBC CBS Fox News\nMedia in Russia China basically I discovered some type of a space time anomaly between Las Vegas that area fifty one at this nondescript site on the side of the road out in the desert\nAnd it turns out that that is one of the most extreme UFO hot spots in the\nState were incredible footage has been shot of UFOs we're close encounters have occurred [noise]\nAnd so uh I have of course continued now going around and taking measurements trying to see if I can uh capture something else\nBut in the meantime here's what I Would like to share with your George and um I mentioned this to you when we were in Asheville by the way a very cool that you played a a group from Ashville north\nCarolina grew apart\n[laughter] you know ... my home town for for listeners who may not know and ah you know that's where I have my mystery museum and we do the haunted Ashville go stores so very very fitting the player an Ashville group [noise] but anyway George in Ashville I mentioned this to you but it's gotten even more intriguing [noise]\nThere is a timeline that I Would like to know share with you in the audience that I think perhaps helps to put my discovery in context okay\nUm and I want everybody listening be the judge okay am I just being paranoid is all this just coincidence or are we just seeing different facets of a larger project that as sort of a being slowly revealed or exposed however you want to view it\nAnd of course I never believe in coincidence Josh\nWell you and I have that in common for sure I agree entirely to believe in that would mean you'd believe there could be in effect without a cause and that just doesn't make sense does the Jordan new\nSo All right let's start with December twenty Seventeen this is something that's been talked about many times on coast to coast am of course the Pentagon finally announced that that that they were working on this thing or back engineering UFO debris in the state of Nevada\nAh the advanced aerospace threat identification program called a tip so that was a big deal there should have been covered even more by the mainstream media\nBut it was not it was not\nNo I mean it was broken by the New York times so I mean there was plenty of ample opportunity for everybody to really get the scoop and this was a program that was a course headed up by Senator Harry Reid who was it was the senator from Nevada\nSenate majority leader and it involved a contract that was primarily given to Robert Bigelow aerospace who has his operation here in Nevada to keep that in mind [noise]\nUh okay so now let's move up to June of twenty Eighteen of this year in early June NASA announced they found quote complex organic material on Mars and grow\n[noise] now later in the month of June to be precise on June Eighteenth of two thousand Eighteen I discovered this time warp and which was the product of me being the first investigator to take this technology out into the field and use it\nThat night George as I was in my very remote motel room out in the middle of nowhere a winding down out in the middle of the desert I turn on the news and solve the very night that I discovered this time warp President Trump announced the creation of the space force\nSo here I Am next to Harry fifty one and I get that news that was pretty intriguing that was in a memorable night [noise]\nUh and then we moved to July on July twenty fifth now NASA announced that there is an underground lake on Mars and also right around the same time George Jeanette whom we all know well and love who is of course a journalist here in the state of Nevada\nAnd they're good one yes he is the best uh he released this incredible mind boggling letter\nThe Senator Harry Reid wrote to the department of defense in June of two thousand nine if any of your audience members have not read this letter I just want to point out a few key key parts of it\nThis is a letter where Senator Reid is saying we need more stringent security because of what we've discovered by you this advanced aerospace you know a project\nAnd I've got it in front of me but he says much progress has been made with the identification of several highly sensitive unconventional aerospace related findings\nHe goes on to say given the likelihood that these technologies will be applied to future systems involving spaceflight weapons communications and propose and the standard management and safeguarding for classified information or not sufficient\nHe goes on to say even more that this is the one that really gets me\nAssociated exotic now that that ... that ... what do you think that means folks associated exotic technologies likely involve extremely sophisticated concepts within the world of quantum mechanics nuclear science electromagnetic theory ... and thermodynamics\nGiven that all of these have the potential to be used with catastrophic effects by adversaries\nAn unusually high degree of operational security is required well let me pause for a second here so he said in this letter which is a validated it's been verified I've independently verified it with my own sources here in Las Vegas [noise]\nHe's saying George we discovered that exotic technology that's going to affect all these things but we have to make sure our adversaries don't\nGet don't get it that's right we ... we need to get it before they do that's what he's saying\nSo what he's saying is it didn't come from them new so if you discovered something that has that impact that didn't come from your adversaries and you call it exotic\nWhere could have possibly come from um I also wanted to just mention here briefly a you know there is a an appendix to Des where they go down a list of some of the topics\nThat have been a officially explored with this project and some of these topics this thirty eight of them are one is uh advance space propulsion a invisibility or cloaking worm holes in space time gravity wave communication worked drives brain machine interface\nA laser weapons quantum entanglement communication ultra capacitors and my favorite one is number thirty eight redacted so it's like whoa you're putting all this incredible material out there with the topic and the scientists and the institution a scientist as with\nAnd yet still there's one that's redacted so anyway getting back to the timeline\nSo that also came out right around the same time and a ... July twenty fifth All right so that said now we move up to August August of twenty eight team right around the time when you were doing your event in Asheville\nJoined the mainstream media announced that the air force has been doing experiments dropping a new kind of weaponry\nWhich is very similar to a type of earth penetrating nuclear gravity bomb and they've been experimenting with these things and dropping with them and doing God Knows what else\nFrom a beach to nail us air force base which happened to be right beside the area where I got my anomaly and furthermore guests when they were doing their experiments\nJune of two thousand eight team when I got my anomaly and when the president announced the creation of the space force\nSo that said\nI Am of the impression here\nThat there is some kind of amazing technology\nThat is being utilized to form some kind of weaponry that is being tested around here and I just so happened to stumble into a spot where they were testing their their their stuff out\nAnd it but you see the thing is it doesn't matter because\nThey're in humans are not supposed to have technology that will manipulate space time but it looks like they might and I want everybody to know if you doubt when I'm telling you you can download the information for free if you go to Joshua ... Warren dot com\nAnd scroll down the home page there's a place where you can it says something like you know Senator Harry Reid's PDF or whatever and you can you can download that now you tell me George do you think that that is our coincidence that this stuff is lining up the way it is\nNo coincidence you know that none in the let me ask you this when the late president Ronald Reagan initiated\nAnd want to do in this huge his Star Wars program I was convinced he was more concerned about something coming from outer space that we needed to protect ourselves from when President Trump announced a space for ...\nTalked to George ... guard line that he would eat vibes zero one rule one zero in on\nThe first time caller line is the one eight by eight zero one more civil to one to talk

that suddenly word began to spread like okay this dog here\nAnd you know he was fighting back yeah and it's because of that\nThat um he I Believe now is so famous because the word has now spread for so long that if you go to see how you have to be respectful people now take it seriously\nAnd I don't think that there are nearly as many people who were going to see him now who are having bad experiences or even paranormal experiences because he seems to be at peace\nAnd I think it's in part thanks to people like you George you know you inspired me and gave me the opportunity to go down there to Key West and almost ten years ago\nAnd to do live reports and to really dig into this and I you may or may not recall George I actually called into the show\nI realized you know live it was just me and Robert and the whole place just the two of us was creepy\nYes it is great on the\nDollar just anybody who's ever seen Robert The dog just go look him up you know on the just type in Robert but all Google and you know you can see he's a creepy looking guy but from the moment I got there I was respectable\nI asked is prevention if you go to my Web site you can click around and find some of my video that I shot you know from the moment that I actually met Robert ... and I said look I'm Joshua pie Warren\nI have come here to understand you I'm going to report on what I find to a lot of people I'm asking for your permission and blah blah blah\nAnd so I think Robert by got along very well and uh so I think you should also rest assured George that you played a big role probably and helping to educate people\nThat there is something bad happens to you if you're disrespectful to the stall and if you're nice to have to do then you have nothing to worry about so I think he is much happier so to speak than ever\nNow originally to win the dog was first given to the family years ago didn't people see the dog like in the window or running back and forth and weird stuff like that\nIt's been creepy is thing about the story of Robert The haunted Dahl is that he was given to a young boy a Robert Eugene auto which everybody called Eugene ore gene\nAnd gene became obsessed with this dog when gene was only like maybe four or five years old\nAnd then Jean grew up to be\nA very you know successful man uh had had a wife that everybody loved that a nice big house but it didn't change his infatuation with the dog\nI mean are you might think back when you were a kid maybe there is some point that was special queuing there came a point when it just sort of drifted away that never happened for gene auto he kept this\nThis ah dull uh till the end of his wife and treated it in many cases they say if you talk to the locals better than he treated his wife I mean how little special furniture made for him and gave him a little special room\nSo are his room was essentially moved to the ... at at the wife's insistence but you know they claim that when finally Eugene died [noise]\nUh and his wife moved out of the house and the house sat there abandoned for quite a few years waiting for a buyer to come along and I actually did get to talk to some of the caretakers who ah worked in the house during that period of time who told me about just chilling experiences\nBut nonetheless people who were in the community said at night you can sometimes walk outside the windows and you look up by\nNew new that house was in ... new there\nHaven't read the little Robert de do running around the house George Back and forth in front of the windows\nI Love that next step let's go to Tyler in Asheville North Carolina first time caller for Tyler Tyler welcome to the program\nHey how you doing good good to be with us to\nA Joshua I was a up on the blue ridge parkway about ... years ago it was around uh August\nAnd I spirit who crave the light on to make it to make a brief I was up a around like black Baltimore area me and my friends were just hanging out there and then all of a sudden like this huge deep dark fog just kinda swept in\nIn the afternoon like we're watching the sun to all of a sudden\nThis super thick fog just sat and there were like six to eight what looked to be like deep headlights\nOff in the distance solved enough to know that about five to ten minutes later they started heading right out of like right outta we've got to thinking about it we're at and overlooked there was no way it could have been linked jeeps or anything we started watching them in like this belief at this point\nThey get right up on us about two hundred feet away and then they dislike broke apart and just started like bugs and all around and we took off um come to find like\nFor two years I thought I was crazy me and my two friends ... what was that what's going on out that way Josh\n... it was it was the wild stuff and then uh about a year or two later my my buddy send me a link it might have been from your website or something talking about it and uh it just like connected the dots though I've been really trying to contact you learn not\nTrying but we're willing to talk to you for about twelve years now to see what you think about it what is that Josh\nBaugh Tyler thank you for that call always good to talk to a fellow Ashville yet another tar hill and um you know right in North Carolina ... everybody of course focuses on brown mountain or the brown mountain lights because the ... mountain lights are the most famous example\nYou talked about them before Josh\n... of this strange phenomenon where you have these balls of light that appear but actually this is widespread this goes beyond brown mountain\nThis goes all over as Tyler was saying the blue Ridge Mountains and ah you know which is of course part of the Appalachian chain lead a leading over to the great Smoky Mountains there are all kinds of spots where these balls of light appear\nNow I Believe that [noise] if you get me if you if you really want to get the scoop on this you can download a free PDF about it if you go to brown mountain lights dot com [noise]\nBut basically an eye on that website but um\nBut what I can tell you is that there are places on earth\nThat produce an incredible amount of natural energy\nAnd that that energy has as a byproduct of bunch of paranormal activity that spins off so you get more ghostly encounter is people seeing UFOs time slips scripted all that kind of stuff but and it's role as form\nIt's almost like Marie idioms on planet earth that acupuncture is Mike compare to the ... of energy the flow on a human body\nThese are places that conduct electricity and when that electricity manifest and ... in certain angles at certain cliffs it can create what similar to to ball lightning\nAnd so you have so much of that which is creepy around western North Carolina but at the same time it almost seems to sometimes have a consciousness and so we're still uncertain as to whether or not these balls of white\nAre just [noise] merely and simply a raw natural phenomenon like ball lightning or if they might also have some sense of intelligence and uh this is what makes this such a great mystery\nJoshua his

final segment next hour we'll talk about on to the world war two amazing stories Matthew swing will join us so Josh my friend you are one of a kind how did you originally get started in paranormal investigating what was that one catalysts that got you in doing\n[noise] oddly enough George it was really an incident that happened before I was born really um\n'cause I come from a large family or my mother is the youngest of ten kids and my dad is one of seven kids while at on both both sides of my family they've been in the mountains of western North Carolina since the late Seventeen hundreds early Eighteen hundreds [noise]\nUh but there was this one incident that occurred on my mother's side of the family\nIn the great depression or my mother is a mother was named to Virginia Callaway that was her maiden name and when she was about Thirteen Years old she got a camera as a birthday present which was a pretty big deal back to her family was a little better off than most but\nThat didn't last long they they lost everything and the depression but she lives out in the countryside and one day her father a guy named Jack and her older brother who was in his twenties are named Claude\nCame home from a small game hunting trip and she photographed them a holding up their squirrels and rabbits and stuff and when the picture develop my great uncle Claude Callaway her older brother did not have a head and\nThey they knew that was weird but they weren't not able to understand enough about photography to realize just how weird it was so fast forward one month later a card was sitting on the porch of the house\nAnd he was reading a copy of his favorite publication western magazine old gunslinger tails\nAnd uh his father Jack was in the kitchen fixing fixing the lunch and they were conversing through an open window and at some point or jak said something to Claude and called the Napster and when the lunch was ready jak went outside and\nUm here's clause magazine lying on the porch but there's no call\nAnd I'm going story short my great uncle clause Calloway was never seen or heard from again\nShe uh David ladies involved in the sun\nWell yeah well you know it's actually it's not too far from where there is a national uh art these days you know the ... national park area and and and what's even weirder is that you know I mean they did everything they got the authorities involved they got you know they were searching the woods and\nUm you know here he ... this fellow my great uncle was waiting for his lunch you know in the middle of a story\nAnd reading a magazine ... how could he have disappeared was he abducted was the rapture the way that he did he get caught up in a space time slip I mean we don't know but but you see it was compounded by the fact that this creepy photograph was taken\nOne month before and when I became an adult I went back to that area and did everything I could to try to find out what had happened and I mean I've verify the whole story with\nElderly people and a historians and but still there's there's no explanation for this and and you see this was a big tragedy in my family ah they never got over it they never had closure\nAnd I got to grow up sort of seeing the the sensitive wound this created\nAnd it made me realize that some of these mysterious phenomena or they're not just legends or superstition or or old folk tales mean the the paranormal if you want to call it that there's something very real\nThat we have to take seriously and so that inspired me to go out and sort of try to define fact or versus fiction and then finally by the time I got into my early twenties was the one I really started seeing some bizarre stuff for myself with my own two eyes\nGood for you let's go to the final calls here and let's go to Mary in Los Angeles to get things started Hi merry go ahead\nI my ... you have to go ahead and I was wondering if I only will\nAlso said yes and how we relate to how all souls day in Halloween\n[noise] yeah well thank you for your call Mary as a matter of fact um my birthdays October twenty fifth\nMy mother's birthday is November the third the day after yours and my sister's birthday is November the fifth and I can't tell you how many people I Know who have birthdays around Halloween including Dr Moulder who builds wishing machines his birthday is on Halloween [noise]\nAnd I'll just say a ... if you go back nine months it takes you kinda close to Valentine's Day so maybe there's an explanation for why I Know so many people who have birthdays around or you know October [noise]\nBut um as far as your particular question is concerned so the the the basic tradition of Sao on which of course we now call Halloween is built around October thirty first and this is the product of the Catholic Church\nComing into the pagan areas of Europe and trying to dominate them and switch them away from their pagan beliefs into Christianity\nWith their own date\nWell ...\nWell they they realize that you know they weren't doing a good job at switching them over to Christianity so instead the Catholic Church tried to sort of work with a pagan and say instead of considering October thirty first [noise]\nUm some kind of a pagan holiday you know why don't why don't we kind of a you know sanctify this whole time period\nAnd say that the well this is the evening before the spirits of the saints comeback\nWhich would be November the first\nAnd so we will say November the first is the Halloween day\nAnd the evening before that is the Halloween evening or Halloween [noise] and so then uh they sort of combined the pagan beliefs of Halloween with all saints day on November first\nAnd then of course November second they said well why don't we just not only celebrate the saints\nBut just celebrate all the soles of people who have died and so you end up with all souls day but this is one of those are interesting examples it goes back to you know Christmas\nWe're going to be hearing more stories about this soon uh probably is Christmas approaches where you know the a lot of the patients will go out and worshipped trees you know the evergreen quality of trees\nAnd there was there was one of the um the higher ups in the Catholic Church has said look if we go out and we find a bunch of people who were worshipping a tree\nMarks on my soapbox

Okinawa they would build an airbase in that air base would bring\nA most of Japan uh easily into the range of their of of the American bombers [noise]\nSo what the Japanese did was they spread stories to the civilians\nThat if the Americans invaded they would torture kill and you know God Knows\nWhat else civilians in slave them\nSteering the living daylights on again right\nAbsolutely terrified so when the Americans did invade the civilians were would run off the cliffs and commit suicide and then you know that's a documented piece of history\nJust a terrifying uh a story but now it there are stories a one story in particular that rate of that I wrote about in the book\nIs that a group of tourists were added peace museum near those cliffs\nAnd ah they were walking in a field near that that museum and they heard the sound of what they consider to and they said it was almost like a herd of of footsteps coming their way and they couldn't see anything and then they felt a win just pass them and then later heard what they described\nAs cries and screams to that was\nPretty moving for me um another story from the Pacific he would Jima is is equally\nUm a heartbreaking and the ... there are literally thousands of Japanese soldiers that were probably buried alive because they were ... they were a in a tunnel system a very intricate\nTunnel system under the island\nAnd um the the entrances caved in or or the soldiers were actually burned alive or in the tunnels\nSo there's a story that I write about that one\nA Japanese civilian worker claims that every time he gets a call that he has to return to the mainland and he\nUh he gets a knock on the door and he claims that the spirits of these are soldiers on wood Jima that want to be repatriated back to the to the mainland and Japan to those are some pretty intense stories\nThat a crop up and it's ... they're certainly not rare uh in in this volume middle\nEast what's interesting too man is that they seem to be so prevalent all over the place something's going on\nYeah that's true and not only are they everywhere that the different one of the amazing aspects of of the world war two supernatural is that the goose don't even necessarily have to be people because there's actually goes planes that appear especially over England\nAlmost like the flying Dutch membership yeah absolutely exactly people see these planes and they're really not there\nYeah this is I'm In and I'll tell you a little story from my own\nFamily do they hear them too\nWell some do and some don't but there's one area or in the United kingdom a\nIt's a northern section of of the u._k. called derby sheer\nAnd it's known as the Bermuda Triangle of um the u._k. it sounds pretty pastoral sounding so I don't know why there's such activity\nBut there have been a lot of plane crashes there about fifty planes I think if I have crashed in that area and it has quite a reputation but over the years there have been what they call goes plane flaps so for example in Nineteen eighty five\nA bunch of people are claimed to have seen this huge military aircraft flying overhead one couple was\nI'm driving down the highway can they solve this very low flying bomber cruising over the highway and they said that it didn't have any sound whatsoever which was remarkable because it was so big and uh you know I think they described it as a\nA for profit um engine in it look like a World War two bomber\nSo of course skeptics believe that it was probably you know a key their current military plane or possibly a um maybe a a bomb or going to an air show or something\nLike that was what they don't want they thought\nHe right but to counter that a lot of these people that solve this first of all\nThere didn't seem to be a pattern a slight with with this there didn't seem to be a straight line as you might see with a a a a regular conventional non spooky aircraft\nDisappeared in different areas throughout that region and a couple of the people that spot and this one in particular worked uh\nFor a an airfield during World War two was ... I Believe I'm\nA someone on a flight mechanics for the for the uh or a half so definitely would've known the difference between let's say a modern\nI guess like a Hercules aircraft and something like a B. twenty four or uh Lancaster Bomber and and this person described it either as a Lancaster or is it would be twenty four bomber\nSo a pretty peculiar and and there have been other what they call goes plane flaps a throughout history and I think there was even one as I was writing this book so two thousand Seventeen um pretty interesting\nMathieu did they describe how the planes would disappear how would how how they would leave\nIf the one couple just said that it flew overhead and they thought it was going to crash and I believe they pulled over to see you know see if it did crash or at least to hear it and it just it just kind of disappeared\nJust to like that yeah yeah like they want to do a different time war or something right\nAnd the reason I looked into the these are a ghost planes stories is when I was young my parents woke up early one morning it was a sort of a misty foggy morning and um they went for their morning walk and my parents came back in and said that as they\nWere starting their walk they saw an absolutely huge aircraft coming down just a few hundred feet off the ground and it was very foggy a make a sound went overhead and then just kind of disappeared into the mess that would be Yuri\nThat what it was my mom was still telling that story over and over and that's what made me think well England was just a huge aircraft carrier back in World War two I wondered whether\nYeah any any story similar and sure enough it's it's not that happens all the time but it it certainly rather common occurrence for these goes planes to be seen\nI bet they handles hundreds of and we're going to come back and talk more about how to World War two next hour you're sharing your questions and stories where this\nGoes website is no conveniently

com couple of his other books haunted rock and roll ghosts of country music more hunt and rock and roll we'll talk a little bit about that tonight\nAs well but tonight right now we're talking about his latest hunted in World War two soldiers spirits ghost planes and strange synchronous cities Pearl Harbor is it haunted or not\n[noise] it's extremely haunted according to a lot of the people that go there and uh\nThe people towards people who are interested in history go there uh we'll talk about the feelings they have when they're touring Pearl Harbor [noise] especially the the USS Arizona memorial which is essentially a to a mass grave\n'em and it'll tell you what a a moving experiences and again we we think about that idea that somehow the power of that event has etched itself into the time and space around Pearl Harbor and the stories that have been told about that a\nFamous area are pretty extensive\nThere's one story of a of a sailor who apparently left\nAnd just watch on the USS Arizona [noise] ah just briefly and then er during that time where he left the ship\nIt was attacked and sunk and now there's this story of this for Lauren looking sailor standing at the uh standing at the edge of the the memorial kind of looking out into the bay where the Arizona ... an hour or so that goes story has been told\nA quite a bit um [noise] excuse me sir there's also a story of a level of\nOne lady who took a picture just of the memorial and of course the waves and the memorial and then when she looked at it there seem to be faces in them into the picture\nIs very uh in that went on online throughout and not only is the area Pearl Harbor the harbor itself haunted with therapy and goes stories at places like the show field barracks\nAnd hit them airbase areas that were a part of the the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and one place in particular and heck I'm\nA there was the headquarters building that uh supposedly served as a morgue after the attack and had some two hundred three hundred bodies in it and the places so haunted they said that they moved to\nThe sea cue desk which is usually inside the building they now say they post the guards outside of the building because of all the complaints that the soldiers had of this ghostly activity the sound of people running up and down steps to such a degree that the the steps the staircase itself would shake\nToo it's a it's a pretty haunted place\nThe desert Fox rumble or the or the Nazi panzer tank leader\nAnd some incredible things happened to him to he died in Nineteen forty four ... ... but what does he still haunts\nThat's probably the most interesting\nA story that I found a a when I when I started to research this book because I I did initially look to see if I could find the\nThe ghosts of a lot of famous general Patton eyes and our as well as some of the the axis powers or an or when ... has always been kind of a subject of fascination for me so I started to you know try to find if there were any ghost stories about him\nUh I I thought he might be ...\nFound in North Africa which is where he gained much of his fame as the desert Fox may be on the shores of Normandy he would be among those many goes that appear in Normandy he was really behind a\nA architecture the development of the fortifications there are in the construction of the defenses along with what was considered the their Atlantic Wall\nOr maybe he would be in Germany but I actually found go stories about ... in the United states believe it or not so one of the places as mount Hebron cemetery and Winchester, Virginia\nPeople claim to see this a figure a long trench coat or a cap on a looking over the graves and and there are some people who say that he is actually at the [noise]\nThe graves or he's seen at the graves of some of patents a general Patton sand sisters and then there's a A N in West Virginia where they\nClaimed that Romney will haunt so what's the story behind that there is a story that\nAre between the wars wrong all along with a few other\nGerman generals traveled on a secret trip to America to visit some of the ... the battlefields of the civil war particularly they were looking at the way the Stonewall Jackson maneuvered through the Shenandoah Valley\nSo this is why this story that uh Irwin ... haunts these areas is is around today they think that uh he has left his spirit here because he once once visited the site now is there any historical basis for this\nI haven't been able to find any and most historians will tell you that it never have happened that the German generals never came here are people who believe these stories say it was a a secret mission and therefore there would be no historic record\nThat was kind of the interesting one for me\nAnd what about other World War two infamous people do they still show up on\nWell there's some really interesting stories uh for me there's there's one that Churchill still haunts a subway in a in a in London that once served as kind of a temporary bomb shelter\nAnd and and people have seen his spirit there I found the story that Churchill actually witness to the ghost of Abraham Lincoln in World War two to be fascinating ah he said that he and I hate to lay the imagery on your listeners but\nA according to Churchill he had stepped out of the bathroom completely naked\nIn what's now called the Lincoln Bedroom at the White House and he had traveled to the White House on several occasions to visit with a ... FDR Franklin Delano Roosevelt as well as other uh officials from the American side he steps out of the the bathroom\nAnd there's Abraham Lincoln leaning against the mantle and I think Churchill says something like when Lincoln turns to face him Carol says something like ah I see you've caught me at a disadvantage Mr President and then a Lincoln fades away so that was kind of\nLincoln probably faded away quickly\nYes I I would've I would've got out there as fast as I could he's Lincoln has gone through enough he didn't need the witness\nNot I'm not a new Winston Churchill ...\nSo there's some other stories about Eisenhower he haunts ah what's called the bullet which is a a train that's on display at the national railroad museum I think that's in in Green Bay Wisconsin or we talked a little bit about the ghosts of Gettysburg and apparently he andme Amy maybe behind some of the haunting Z\nIn the farmhouse that they used to own their [noise] so yeah there's a lot of um a famous ghost stories from uh some of the the bigger\nLeaders of uh the most famous leaders of World War two into these continue these hunting\n[noise] yeah they do as a matter of fact ah you know the the bullets a I Believe has the story that some of the stories that I found out about that\nUh were from the Nineteen nineties the two thousands one story is that I'm a custodian who was a vacuuming the carpet in the bullet\n... uh was halfway finished and decided to take a break left to lock the door of the train and uh went to lunch or or have a snack and then when he came back the someone had completed\nThe vacuuming and he could tell because the lines of the vacuum cleaner were super straight up and down and according to some of the people who knew Eisenhower he was very meticulous and that's how he insisted on having his ah the bullet cleaned\nSo that story probably uh not too long ago and you know as we talked about the ghost plane flap they're happening probably even as we speak\nBack in World War two actually reports of UFOs they called them poof fighters and they were small little disc type objects flying all over the place that pilots reported seen did you come across anything like that\nI actually did a whole section on it because they were so prevalent as you point out and and it's based on my research in my reading about that\nTwice in our breaking news when it happened five Seventy W.

I thought worrying costume of the civil war and their faces and the expressions or just they were extremely songs that they were just awfully awfully worried from the expressions\nAnd the smell was just something that I had to get away from so I went back in and our guide caught me and said have you been and I said\nI just went in and nine I came out and they said we've been looking for you for the last half hour while while we are we going to have enough time to watch the filming within those costumes are excellent so please explain to me how they were able to get that stench at smell hideous smell\nAnd they all looked at each other and they said\nThere isn't anyone out there\nAre there are a lot of smells associated with some of these teams that there is a ...\nOf a sense with um with some of these hunting sand or\nFor instance the Irwin rumble um ghost story is really focused on ah the smell of a pipe that he allegedly used to smoke in this this haunted in to their their stories like that there are stories about people getting the\nUh I think in the case of the heck I'm a airbase [laughter]\nThere's the scent of a rotting corpses that overwhelms people [noise] um the interesting thing for the when the caller reminded me that uh [noise] my history professor told me that one of the most sought after\nUm [noise] ah articles\nOr after Gettysburg for the civilians was a kind of um I I think it was I guess you would describe it almost as many drops that they use to put on their nostrils because the the scent was so\nBad and then you know that story certainly reminded me of that\nA couple more months we will be at the Seventy seventh anniversary of Pearl Harbor I guess there can't be many soldiers or seeming still left\nFrom the Nineteen forty one I mean that that was Seventy seven years ago right and if they were twenties they'd be Ninety seven there might be a few but I don't think there are many are there\nNo I don't think so and it's um it's sad because again that that's why I think the important thing is to make sure that these\nThese stories are preserved and the memory goes on and if this book helps that at all or maybe inspires people to look into um [noise] the the battle of of Pearl Harbor in particular I I think that it's done it's done its job\nBrian in Indianapolis is with us She's still the Rockies good morning bright\nHey
