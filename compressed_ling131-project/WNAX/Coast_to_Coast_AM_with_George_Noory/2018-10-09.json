tech entrepreneur with multiple IPO's\nByron is uniquely suited to comment on the effect of technology in the workplace and on society as well he writes books that explore the wonders of the world of tomorrow and delights audiences all over the planet with his visited presentations on the future of work in life\nIn Erie is on the coast to coast looking for love your cover on this book by the way Byron\n... thank you very much and thank you for having me\nSo a lot of people are concerned that the world of robots is going to take over the planet take ... take our jobs and do everything else is that something for us to be concerned about\n[noise] I don't think so um you know I think people's worries fall into two big buckets\nOne of them is what you mentioned which is 'em robots taking people jobs\nBut I'm not a test on my website you take to try to figure out if if your job is at risk\nAnd it is a record it's all the answers and very very few jobs actually cut a robot take over and then you try to just imagine one being a plumber or I'm a kindergarten teacher or a hostage negotiator or any of the thousands of other things people do and and and that\nAre so no I don't think that's a a real concern at all I think we build these tools to increase our own productivity and we we're all kind of better off because of them\nLet's talk a little bit by run about artificial intelligence and I ... what is it and how are they able to make these things so smart\n[laughter] well that's a great question what is it is is more complex and you would think because nobody agrees on what intelligence means but what what they what people mean by the term are two very different\nThings that may have nothing in common so they either me or what you see in the movies so commander data upstart truck or ...\nOr a that would be an a machine that can do everything a person can do it's created it can teach itself new things and we don't\nWe don't know how to build that nobody knows how to build that and that's called a general intelligence or it is a computer program that can do one thing very well they can identify spam and your email it can route you through traffic\nAnd that we know how to do pretty well and the way we do it is really quite simple you take a bunch of data about the past\nYou get the computer to study it and make projections about the future and that doesn't sound all that interesting but that said in a sense of what we do we're just a lot better at it than we used to be because computers are faster than\nWe can collect data much easier and the rest so we're now able to just do a lot of things to really look\nSmart by just using the simple simple techniques which are called machine learning\nOur our government's so far advanced with artificial intelligence that they're doing things that would just curl us if we found out what they were\nWell there's certainly that potential you see we we used to all have some amount of privacy or just based on the fact that there are so many of us can't\nFollow every person you can't listen to every phone conversation unfortunately with artificial intelligence the kinds of tools we are developing to do very good things like a dinner by cancer or something like that\nCan be used to to to to follow people voice ... ... to text so now a every phone conversation can be recorded\nAnd it can be turned into text uh computers are as good as humans that reading lip so every camera even if it doesn't have the audio can read lips as well as a human um\nYour you know you have a a device that tracks where you are and again all of these things ended up themselves aren't bad technologies but they certainly can be used in aggregate to profile everyone and you even have places in the world\nUm you know China has implemented a kind of a social score yeah that's right you\nWrite run a red light you lose a point if you go to an anti government rally you lose four points if you write a pro government blog you get two points and ah if you if you get low enough you don't fly on airplanes anymore and you don't um\nAnd and do you do your kids don't get into good schools and you don't\nGet any may not even exist who knows right\nHope it doesn't come to that but but it just shows that these technologies really are uh have that capability of of of being misused of course hopefully in in a country where you have a lot of transparency and you have\nA government that you know you have a Republican but this is governed by laws the price of liberty is a turtle vigilant Senate so the price of privacy is the same that we just have to make sure that the laws are in place and forced\nThat don't allow that to happen because it's certainly something that is technically quite possible\nByron is Amri tell them telephone conversations smart phone conversation being recorded or listen to or even though in Ninety nine percent of them are probably mundane and don't mean anything but but are they being listened to\nI don't know I don't know but I I just couldn't say the technology is it a point where they could decipher you know what what\nBut that many people are saying and then it can ah it doesn't have to understand that in the way that human understand something that decides to look for patterns in combinations of words along with um actions and and and just kind of build up built\nAbstract profiles on people I mean all I'm saying is is it is it is a potential way to use this technology which can be can do so many good things\nAnd you know I've got mixed feelings about this too because on one hand on a let's say that there are a group of terrorists talking about bombing or something and the computer you know is\nIs set up to pick up code words like bomb terror or whatever\nAnd so scientists are on one hand\nIt's an invasion of privacy everybody's privacy on the other hand they may have been able to stop something from happening if they follow through with it and they go in you know catch the perpetrators I'm wrestling with myself brain and Byron in terms of if it's OK or not\nIt is it and it does\nTrue enough problem that we kind of don't have the suicidal consensus on how to deal with it we don't we don't have kind of norms you can find you know a Federalist Papers that addressed that topic uh an hour that's going to have to be a conversation that we have over the course of the next several years about about what what we want\nAll right well stay with us we're going to take a quick break we'll come right back by Reverend Reese with us his book is called the fourth age we're talking a lot of high technology folks and what it does his website is his name linked up for U.S Coast to coast am dot com we'll be back in the moment don't\nTouch your time never missed a detail on a show or a gift to sign up for the ... ... email newsletter available for free at coast to coast am dot com\nA well I I Would say that I don't think so but I'll say this what what they're worried about a was mentioned earlier which is kind of artificial intelligence we don't know how to build a general intelligence\nAnd that's we don't know how to build it but the idea that we could build it is based on the simple a supposition and that is that people are machines if if you are a machine and your brain is machine in your mind as a machine\nAnd it stands to reason at some point in the future we can build a mechanical you and then over time that will become better and better and better it'll have an eye you have a hundred and two hundred and two thousand\nAnd two million and then it won't even know what you are [noise] um I find that idea that people are machines to be very pervasive in Silicon valley I'm On my part cost about a I I I find that the one person in twenty that doesn't believe that and yet when we take surveys\nOn my website asking essentially the same question about eighty five percent of the rest of the country\nDoesn't believe that machine so you you should be worried if you believe you're a machine because eventually we'll probably build on a mechanical version if you don't think human beings are just machines then no bending machine can never do what a person can do\nTechnologically how did they make artificial intelligence working the way it does just with chips and the little things that they do I mean to me it's amazing that they can put this kind of brain power on a little computer chip\nIt's staggering there really is um\nBut the thing is is that where the computer can play chess someone that computer complete go and when the computer can play poker and and do all of these things the way human does it ... you tend to think that it's thinking like a human is but but there really is a quote anybody home there's nothing there\nBut does any thinking at all it's it's one losing zeroes manipulated and memory turned on and off\nAt the speed of light it's done with what's relatives and it's interesting the techniques we use foreign official intelligence we've been writing about for\nForty years since just we've never had the machines to do it but it isn't some thing\nThere's a thought experiment called the Chinese room problem and it's about it it goes like this series is\nThere's this rumor that's full of these books and there was a person that this person is called the library and then it's important to note the librarian doesn't speak any Chinese people outside the roof slide questions written in Chinese under the door\nTo this Chinese to this library at the library and picks them up looks at the first character on the question goes and finds a book with out on the spine\nLooks up the second character that certain some to another book to another book to another book to another book until it gets to the end of the message the last book says write this down any copies these symbols he doesn't even understand and besides the back under the door\nAnd the person who submitted the question looks at it and it's brilliant it's perfect Chinese since perfect and so the question is does\nDoes the librarian understand Chinese\nThose ... those library and understand Chinese did turn to a lot of people in Silicon valley the idea that it can converse in Chinese but doesn't understand it doesn't make any sense but to a lot of people\nKnow delivery and doesn't know if they're talking about Colorado or coffee beans and the analogy is an apt one because it's all computer does it runs a set of determining stick\nProcesses in memory it spits out an answer and it doesn't know it's playing chess it doesn't know any what is talking about it doesn't know anything and so you're kind of ...\nThat's because the computer thinking or not there's a computer understand anything or not or by my way of looking at doesn't that doesn't understand anything but other people other people say if it can do everything that that's something that does understand can do then you just have to say it does\nIt is just mind boggling and it's getting even better or is it not the technology every year\nAbsolutely computers do this thing where it in a very simple short and they double and power every couple of years\nBut on top of that we're collecting data faster than ever before right now there's Fifteen billion devices connected to the Internet many of which can collect data there'll be eighty billion by twenty twenty five and all those who may have all this data coming in and these faster computers\nAnd so it's it will only get faster and then if you think about it\nIf you think about it the Internet but mosaic browser cannot twenty five years ago\nA literally in Ninety three\nAnd all that did was like computers talk to each other and that was hit and that somehow changed our world and that created twenty five trillion dollars and well a million new businesses it up in ... I mean it did everything with the magic and\nA technology that effectively makes everybody smarter than they were before you go to bed tonight everybody on the planet wakes up with ten more IQ points that is going to be more transformative then\nWe're Internet which just connected a bunch of machines together this this is machines think\nReason will they show emotion Byron\n[noise] that is an open question a it is even an open question whether you want them to\nI don't I'm not sure I Want them to\nTell the first question is do you want them to simulate emotion\nOr there there's a couple of different sides to that you know\nI have a desktop device that I talked to and I interrupted and I tell it to stop in a way I wouldn't do a person um you had you had students had kids in Japan there was a robot they let loose in the mall and these little kids would bother would beat it and the robot learned\nBenefit ... bunch of short people kids without a tall person around an adult\nIt needed a run off to a tall person because the kids would abuser now when I asked later the kids said they thought it was feeling distress so they even felt like it was internalizing it you wonder about about a kindergarten teacher you know that the robotic that\nUh the raising children on taking putting you you you just start with that do you even want them to have human voices is that the noble the machine somehow or does\nYou know we've had to call our way to these things called human rights a to a point where we say there are certain things you cannot do to any human being\nAnd because there's something special about the human being\nAnd and do we kind of want to make things look like humans that we do abuse and throw into a scrap heap and and and and destroy without a second thought what that is certainly having nothing effect on people now the question Ken they feel notion\nThat is an open question we\nWhen we have we have something called consciousness which is that we experience the world we feel wants\nA computer measures temperature that difference whatever that is that you feel the warmth of something a computer right now we don't think\nOr can we can measure temperature and even if you make a program that plays a person's screaming at the temperature gets over five hundred degrees nobody believes that computer\nFeels that pain nobody believes the sink shaping or sentient\nNow the interesting thing is we wouldn't know it if I'm if they did really well you wouldn't know if a treat pain and you share half your DNA with the with the tree you should know DNA with a computer and so we wouldn't really even know if they ever if they ever developed a emotions\nAnd even if they claimed that they did that could just be in a way of program running that you know the the the program reasons that it can can achieve whatever objective it once by making this claim I'm so\nIt it's an open question it it all boils down to do you think emotions in the end or mechanical I mean our our ... again it's a punchy back to the original question are we machines and therefore our experience of emotion is just something mechanical\nWhat happens in these machines Byron go rogue and they start doing things to watch to screw up our lives on purpose\nWell I'm\nA little help from two thousand once the sun right I mean look\nIf it ever happened uh we're completely vulnerable of course you know if there were eighty billion devices attached to the Internet\nYou know smart other news just turn all alone and override their safety protocols I mean there are so many ways a malevolent machine would want to um be able to inflict harm but the interesting and and so you kind of have to say what would that happen\nAnd it can happen in one or two scenarios either through countless programming the machine just does it doesn't have any intent at all [noise]\nUm or kinda machine somehow develop goals of its own that are different than ours\nAnd perhaps in conflict with hours and ... and pursue those goals against those they're um they're open questions I mean right now though\nHang up don't make the one eight hundred mistake\nGive you a little auto owners

I think anything that multiplies human ability is\nYou know we took a few exceptions the idea if you can make people more productive that's always good if you don't think it is when you should support a law\nThat makes everybody work with one arm tied behind their back because instantly you create tons of new jobs it'll just take a lot more people to do anything but our productivity will plummet and so that's what technology is just like a third arm it means you can do even more\nSick some calls here for us by Ron let's picking up by going to Jackson, Tennessee welcome to the program to get us started hey Jeffrey go ahead\nHey I've taught and before I Love your show jailers thank you John ... and not let him once or twice and I've got some ... and fire [laughter] than I Am right here I tell you what they don't have them back on the show\nYou know saying that don't say that but what what's wrong told me that\nI Am disabled down low and that had to say that jobs are maintained the technology that taking out the white\nWell Byron you're saying that it creates more jobs\nPer right I mean\nLook at\nYou you can look at the un unemployment numbers in this country are you know good I mean they're they're down a there are some people who say the workforce participation rate is lower which are the number of people who actually are looking for work I'm almost all of that can be accounted for by\nA baby boomers retiring [noise] um [noise]\nYou know technology I always empowers people to be able to do more there's this kind of like an infinite number of jobs you\nYou can make a job instantly the minute you take something a lump of clay and you apply labor and technology to it you make something worth more of age and whatever value you were able to add that to wage\nAnd because technology lets you do more technology increases wages\nIt it's really rough when it when it happens in a localized area and ah so you you get pockets of places where it takes a long time for it to kind of shake out and and that's rough and I think we should do a much better job kind of facilitating that\nUp because you know if you can say well it's all going to work out in the long run but people live and the short run\nAnd and that's that's hard and and so we we got to be very mindful of that how we train people the kinds of safety nets we\nWe provide but to turn against technology to say\nSomehow knowing how to be more productive is bad for for people or I think so hard case to make\nNo I'm opposed to and I've said this before driverless trucks I Want to displace truck drivers uh they're hardworking dedicated people and I don't trust the driverless truck I just know what do you think of that\nUm I think that's one of the biggest kind of a myth\nThat uh there there's going to be a huge a shortage of truck drivers I think that that goes you know without kinda without saying first of all they're kind of facing a demographic disaster that every year\nThe average age of all the truck drivers is going up because everybody's like you know young people don't go into it because everybody's like there's a future in that because of self driving trucks\nSo most knowledgeable people in the industry are predicting we're going to have this this great shortage of them and even when we get over the technological hurdles then when we get over the legislative turtles they they still are only going to be able to do part of of the hall\nI still don't want to see a driverless truck jeeze put it in Los Angeles traffic it'll go crazy [laughter]\nWell I agree there's a long way for the technology to go it's interesting that thousands of people\nDie in car accidents and president but if there's one accident with a driverless car makes\nIt's a huge ... in in in ... Arizona driverless cars kill the woman\nWho have been a couple of months that makes the news which you know thousands of other people that die in car accidents don't seem to have to\nBe paid at least ten times better maybe a hundred times better than humans before people would accept it it's got to be so overwhelming that you say uh you know we've got to outlaw people driving because people are just unreliable they're awful\nIs there anything about AI that you don't like\nTo know I mean certainly put simply put if they are effectively makes people smarter\nThan to say that it's bad is to argue for ignorance to say well it would be better if if we all woke up within fewer IQ points tomorrow\nI says what study data about the past and use it to project into the future that's a collective memory for the planet for ten thousand years on this planet people learn something\nA ... and they do it all out and then they die and its forgotten or maybe they caught somebody and they messed it up now all of a sudden your life experience of my life experience become the data to make somebody else's life better in the future\nAnd so no no the technology to say artificial intelligence is bad would be to say intelligence is somehow bad\nWe've got Joe in Long Island New York I'm Joe go ahead\nFire and a couple of questions about the corporate level you look at Eastman Kodak is impact that she and many of these so called act really doesn't exist and they were you know at that height maybe twelve years ago and uh you know they had a lot of good research and uh [noise]\nThey didn't hold on\nA so so at the corporate level I think they they may have to have made some missteps\nAnd then uh if you look at throngs I think uh there's\nAn obvious potential for chaos with them drones flying around here trying to walk down the block and then some drone flying at you or are they can be weaponized and and flowing into a a a ballpark law game is on [laughter]\nSo that's another thing and finally just walking ... mall we I was thinking about that movie late do say veto where the guy was\nThe star was working on the beach and they had the boy help and I'm One of those papers [laughter] and I you know it's really a reason to be at an office most of the time and truck to an office one when he can just get on the computer and do the work or on a beach [noise]\n[noise] wow that's great stuff I'd like to I'd like to talk to all three of those things um until the first one you know you mentioned corporations in Eastman Kodak\nIt's very interesting to me the large companies don't usually make he sleeps on the of the original down companies uh I used to say only ones left and then it was just ...

with us author of the force age Byron Isaac Asimov three laws robotics let me quickly go through them and tell me how they would\nReally transform into artificial intelligence won a robot may not enjoy a human being or through inaction allow a human being to come to harm to a\nRobot must obey orders given to it by human beings except for such orders would conflict with the first law three\nA robot must protect its own existence is longest such protection does not conflict with the first or second law so what are you saying is is robots can't injured human beings at any cost\nThat is kind of like in conflict with they all of you know soldiers set a robotic\n[noise] yeah yeah that's true that's true you know the the the ...\nAre a literary device so you can tell a story they don't actually get us very far you know if I'm going to do something dangerous\nPotentially aren't myself does the robot according to the laws intervene and stop me if I Want her second dessert and I got to your your pounds on native to robots I Know you can out the desert because that's going to hurt you got to save you got to protect\nExactly monitoring your blood being close levels are too high or whatever it\nExactly exactly so like them apart no standpoint the real challenge with robots has no two people\nKind of agree on what moral behavior isn't isn't an even if you just said well we're just going to pick you know Joe\nAnd make use drugs moral code for all the robots even shows moral code is like four provide those and well you don't do that unless it's this but\nThey're all they're all of these ... ... and that so we don't really have a way to make sure robots ... ... and like you said there's a lot of incentive for them not to\nThis is a robot out there called ... which uh I I'm going to try to do an interview with Sophia because it talks and the you know it's styled after a woman but uh I'm going to call it in it because it's a robot but\nYou can ask a question and we'll give you a response isn't that put czar\nI'm unfamiliar unfamiliar with it or you know I think if you ask a question just asking what's bigger a nickel or the sun\nAnd it probably doesn't no no no I mean it it it it'll have an incredibly narrow range of things that he can talk about uh if you ask anything like um\nI Know a wide as Mr T. pity the fool show for a\n... anything just asking anything uh aside from how do you feel or anything like that decides to get anything about live\nAnything weird ... it will be a blue collar end I'm\nEven some things like\nThe kind of thing that you might ask or any other person you meet like I'm given the simplest problem you can\nLeave these systems there there's something called the Turing test which basically says if you can't tell if you're talking to a person or a a machine like through text but you have to say the machines thinking at least a split the desk says if you read the transcripts\nOf actual things that are trying to pass it\nYou would do with one question so they have to put all these rules like you can't ask about current events and you can't ask him out\nAnd you can't ask ... and even then we've never had anything this past it I'm Sylvia looks good because it looks like a person and if you take something that looks like a person and you give it a person's voice and it says words\nYou're kind of in the back of your head going to say oh that's really thinking\nBright bright it's if you if you say no that's just\nYou know that that is not if they made it look like I'm a vase if all of a sudden the illusion would be ... it would\nSure and I always thought maybe they had somebody hidden away in a corner talking through and it was really them talking\nType no no um it's a chat with boys send them an animatronic robot\nMove that software and get better and better and better to the point where you can ask you a mundane question ended laying in will be able to answer for\nCorporate ... near and so there are people who are working on that there's something called um there there's a balance Center for artificial intelligence in Seattle I found about Paul Allen where\nThey're trying to get ... curators to be able to pass I think six grade science test\nA like that's the big thing it turns out computers have a hard time with common sense\nProblems or we don't know how it is that we saw the soldiers on people [laughter] right right well let's do this\nThing we don't know how to get machines to do what's called trends for learning you can take something you learned in one place and apply it elsewhere and we don't know how people do that you can train you could show a kid who cared for pictures of the cat\nThat child knows where the cat looks like and if they see one of those Manx cats without a tail they'll say look a cat without a tail even though they never even knew there was such a thing right\nYou still have like thousands of cats to train a computer and the computer would never say oh that's a cat without a tail just got fed bails\nLarry in Houston, Texas and get us going here Hi Larry go ahead\nHey thanks for the question is is I've been attacked for computer repair\nI guess that was the feeling generic in Nineteen eighty two for a large corporation from a meaning to Superman is the main frames all the way up to now I'm a network engineer my question is other hyperbole about how am I which a uh it's just a modification of what's been going on for the last [noise]\nSixty years with computers they they you know the the technology keeps expanding and expanding because of the way people program them [laughter] so I just really extension of ads nothing new but\nHow does it that they they think mankind there's going to be eliminated okay because you've got to have people to serve and things machines you have to have people that can provide electricity to run the power lines during the power plant the new album is that how do they think that a a ... it's going to eliminate mankind has got to be a planet full of\nMachine is a you know I keep hearing it's hyperbole\nOver and over and nobody can tell me how they're going to do all the time he can't even get a ... machine to walk right now let alone climate power pole and provide electricity or go in and trouble shoot a machine that's broken\nIn their world the machine will replicate itself by rebuilding itself I don't see that happening Byron\n[laughter] I agree I agree with Larry as well uh\nYou know its reasoning from picture will evidence that makes a good movie you know the the the movie the hay everything in the future is really good you know that doesn't get my eleven dollars or something's got to go wrong and some things got a you know a hundred people and Will Smith has the bottle something\nAnd and so you see that enough but you're right that the range of things robots\nCan do and I can do is is actually quite narrow but\nUh but as you keep saying right now oh how will that change that change in the future\nTom in Bozeman, Montana and the wild card blind telling us go ahead\n[noise] yes uh I like gas gas good question George already\nUm well not a question like that make

V. I. T. [noise]\n[noise]\nAnd\nWelcome back to coast to coast we're back with Julie ... her book is called the ghost photographer I loved to the subtitle of course is interesting Julie where you talk about a Hollywood executives true story of discovering the real world of make believe it's coming true isn't it\n[noise] it it it it it definitely is coming true it it it was funny I um when I was sitting with my publisher she was asking me about some of my photographs and I said you know some creatures and then that I that I get in these photographs looked like they ... out of a movie that I marketed\nAnd she goes\nOh my gosh you're living like the real world and may I say there isn't that crazy during the day I'm and make believe and then at night\nYou'd comes true it kind of [laughter] have you ever gotten to the point where you were scared or you felt threatened\nYes I did what happened when\nTimes yeah you know and we can start going we're hearing a minute if he wants to\nGet some of the things I encountered and are are strange and some are scary and you know I found at times and and and if it were that Claire and dance really that bad gift comes in to get it in very handy\nAnd where I can feel and if there is a bad entity and evil entity that around and I learned something really important for folks to understand and and that is if you if they may find themselves [noise]\nWhere they have it go in their house they like they didn't count at something and they they feel that fear and their body all they have to do is be in charge because they are in charge\nOf the fear that they're looking for and so if you stand there and go get out of my house you are not allowed in here leave me can you can use the tools that you want that to their ear human dominance\nIt could dominance like you can get rid of most of them like that and that's what I found because I started clearing people's homes and I started weirdly because I get my Oklahoma upgrade upbringing I was raised in ... and so I knew the Lord's Prayer\nHaven't used it for really long time I'm\nGoing to work for you\n... what's really interesting is that's another way that I could find if there were um you know dark spirits around is it I Would start saying though I like I start St Lawrence for over and over and if any point in time I forget or I stand ... there's something there\nYou're like a magnet\nIt's kind of well maybe [laughter] ... I mean we all are telling the\nTruth while I was gonna say do you think everybody has the capability but you know or are you unusual\nYou know I think that we're all born with different gift that we're able to tap into that\nI have a friend that is the most incredible medium evil ever meet in your life and the specificity of the messages that she gets from the other side are detailed as addresses that you've lived in in your life\nWhen\nBy the number of into the street name so I think everybody has something different you know perhaps I have\nYou know the ... few weird capabilities and and the and in the world so yeah I think probably I Do\nYou actually because you're too of course media a big way you Google ... when you were experiencing this how come\n[noise]\nYou know I think any time you encounter something new in your world right in your kind of yeah becomes your reality you want to see you have a right to know you're not the only one\nAnd I think I was looking to see how common\nAre uncommon specifically the photograph did you get the answers [noise] um\nI started to I started to understand and that's when I started to actually talk about it after that and it was the talking about it that really kind of ease my nerves and then [laughter] and then of course I turned to movies\nAnd there are some really fabulous movies that are based on true accounts and one of them is that movie the witch\nAnd did you do you have and see the which\nHave seen you haven't\nSeen that there was a scene in which it it was based on the Salem witch trials like before the Salem witch trial and\nI'm David\n... who is the kind of a friend of mine who's a producer and and and he did a lot of work at the New York public library pulling you know an original pamphlets from back in the day and there's a scene where the father\nOr the and families circled around I'm the son who is I'm a ... and he says everybody must say the Lord's Prayer\nSo they'll start saying the Lord's Prayer then the two twins are saying it and then they fall on the floor and kind of start shaking\nUm because there was a there was a a like a\nEvil entity that was around and I later talk today about he's like oh yeah that's the Lord's Prayer is how it was like a\nDividing rod\nTo find them to know\nAnd and I'm like oh my gosh that's been happening to me\nSo it's weird how things happen without instructions I think that's a really interesting part about all of this\nIs that all this happened to me and there was no instruction book was able to identify were go swore I was able to figure out how to you know get them out of a space I'm I was able to figure out how to you know help other humans\nUm protect themselves and you know big thing I learned a lot about sleep paralysis\nWhere you would go about that ... ... well it was just like the old ... syndrome\nI did for a little bit on this\nWhile he could be medical\nI could be\nCould be people have woken up here relies basically because they can't move ... syndrome and then you realize you know you you you are where you can get out of it but I've also heard of ... syndrome where you were basically paralyzed\nYeah what I've heard what I read about in well actually what I I experience I I didn't personally experienced it um but I have a very close friend and this is how it all started that he was telling me histories of fleet paralysis and um and there's a an entity called the ... man\nYes you don't hide you almost want to ...\nI I I'm a friend and her on Facebook and I read her book\nThree girls I think Rudy is tremendous\nAnd expert on the house\nShe absolutely is and she is where one of the places I went to very quickly when my friend Alex started telling me about what he was experiencing\nUm and what's interesting also\nIs that I'm a nightmare on elm street you know created by Wes Craven\nUm a friday right um\nHe had Wes Craven um had sleep paralysis and\nHe modeled Freddie Krueger based on that man\nBecause it came to him that's right and nightmares right [laughter] what was interesting with Alex\nIs um I I did a lot of research I I read high these books\nTalked to friends um and one thing that I've also gotten into is I'm a crystals and stones and rocks and I I've taken classes and I'm even now a certified transfer still therapist so I've\nBeen a big way now when I started\nTo yes I Am I mean I mean if you're going to go go big George don't just take a few pictures that go send me go all the way\nTo do it [laughter] no fun\nRight and and also to serve others because that's really where the turn happened and I learned about the stone called black terminally and black term lane is a really powerful rocket is not the prettiest rock and the crystal kingdom but it's really a powerful and it and it actually holds a charge an electric charge\nJust sitting on the counter [laughter] um it's been studied by the theories and also by Benjamin Franklin to the stone has been a\nLot of curiosity surrounding it and it's also been used you know by magicians and those to like you know clear their space back in the day so on and so forth Sean and use it and um and I know what to protect us down so I said to my friend Alex is it out for the funnier night stand\nDo slice and our breaking news when it happened on five Seventy W.
