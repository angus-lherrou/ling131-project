A. W. land air and water and it's jam packed with odd spooky raised the hair on the back of your neck true life stories of people who simply vanished dip into thin air\nThe circumstances in each of these cases are very specific to a pattern that was discovered by Dave and up by now he's looked at thousands of these disappearances and some patterns have emerged on land around ... water\nAnd as we will hear tonight in the air as well so this evening we will hear the latest including a few cases that are ongoing at this moment fresh mysteries that maybe you can help solve a David joins me and just a few minutes and we will jump right into it\nBut those who do not familiar with the mystery we'll start with a refresher on the characteristics that make these particular cases stand out from a standard case of somebody who just gets lost in the woods or wilderness goes way beyond that\nAnd we will spend the next three hours talking about new evidence in cases he uncovered and then the last hour tonight I'm not sure what we're going to do I I think I'd like to hear from listeners your ideas about what's going on here why some people are seemingly taken\nA by whom and whether we will ever be able to resolve this so what you're thinking caps on and be ready to jump into the discussion in our for also tried to save some time for you to interact with Dave as well in our three\nOne news note here in Las Vegas we're on the eve of a somber remembrance one year ago October first but worst mass murder incident in American history unfolded fifty eight people were gunned down that an outdoor concert on the strip hundreds were wounded or injured\n[noise] you know it's a sad note on humanity if that's the case but there is a lot of obstruction so when I started out I was told by a couple of Park Service rangers that they had found\nDisappearances and their parks were they had worked with that bothered um didn't make sense when they tried to find information they couldn't and they thought somebody with an investigative background on to be looking into it [noise]\nAnd that's sort of how it all started and I filed a series of freedom of Information Act of course against the national Park Service they have the largest contingent of federal we train police officers and the national park police\nAnd they're trained at the federal law enforcement training center they get outstanding training they're smart people they understand what should be done\nAnd I asked for a list of missing people or they came back and they said they don't carry any less and they don't have any of us I'm missing people in their parks in jurisdictions and uh we talked about it and it had to be a semantics issues to ... we filed and they came back in the attorney called this time it's like what you want the information [noise]\nExplain to him I said hey you can't ask that as a determining factor in for you and they said oh we're not we're not saying we're going to use that term and we just want to know why you want it and I said wow research and then he came back and he said well we don't have any listen missing people\nSaid well you have two hundred and eighty three parks and monuments that you patrol and you have\nSpecial agents that are that detectives so somebody must be keep it a list that each individual location or a cumulative list at headquarters to understand what's happening and it's only politically correct if somebody calls in and wants to know the status of the case how you ever going to find it\nSaid no we don't have any less [noise] so\n... years ago somebody said well they are just file a request and see how many rules of toilet paper it Yosemite National park I bet they have that I didn't bring tore list\n[laughter] and of course they would but as it happened they came back and I said well I'm a printed author so I Want to use my authors status\nAs an exclusion for fees and get you to accumulate that list for me a couple of weeks later they came back and they said well your books earning enough libraries to qualify there's no such thing qualifiers just some arbitrary thing they said [noise]\nAnd then I said okay well why don't you just tell me how much it's going to cost me for you to put together the lesser I Want to list from Yosemite and I want to was from the national Park Service\nAnd they said well it's going to be thirty four thousand for the list from Yosemite and one point four million from the list from the entire system and I can't tell you how many people since I first said that years ago I have tried to go at the Park Service and get it but nobody's ever been successful in getting the list from their entire system because they still say they don't have it\nAnd I've done interviews on other stations were\nHosts have said Dave I'll say it right now we will buy a laptop computer with the excel spreadsheets and we'll put a clip boards that every park and every jurisdiction they have and let them start accumulating the list\nAnd they can hire an intern during the summer that can screen the monthly reports to come in the Park Service that have these and they could start from scratch doing it now of course they they wouldn't even respond and wouldn't even acknowledge it\nBut as you've stated in many others after you nobody believes them they say that the list exists\nWell or if they're going to charge one point four million more than a list exist um you know it it's it's pretty clear they don't want to cooperate on that they don't want to pay more attention to be drawn to it and we're going to explore maybe some of the reasons behind it\nUp for those who have not heard your previous interviews let's let's get the ... points of the cases that jumped out at you that make it into your books the kinds of things that you look for\n[noise] some people need to understand that if you read the hundred search and rescue reports law enforcement reports on missing people\nYou're not going to get a lot when you read of thousand certain things started jumping out at you and when I went through my third three hundred four hundred and five hundred and read a report it's a start making piles in my office of certain things\nAnd after you hit four or five six thousand then things really start to delineate out one thing that's about a Ninety nine percent hit rate on the cases I write about is when they bring in canine star search and rescue they can't I Can't find a set and they can't track the person down\nNow someone who worked in a canine unit on the SWAT Team for a number of years our dogs had about a Ninety nine percent\nCapture rate and probably the reason why is that our dog's trained ten hours a week and it's directly a relationship between the amount of hours you trained with a dog and how effective they are going to be [noise]\nAnd there's a lot of people out there don't have the time to train a dog a lot\nThere might be a lot of great dogs out there who just cannot find a cent maybe the scent isn't there I've had reports where the dogs are brought to the scent location where the person was last seen they walk a foot they turn in a circle and they sit down or they laid out it's like they don't want to search or they have no interest [noise]\nSo that's a big one at the time the person disappears or shortly thereafter there's a major weather change of weather event [noise]\nIf the victim is located they're located in an area that's been previously searched sometimes hundreds of times the time of the disappearance a high high percentage of the time is three four five PM\nMany of the victims have some type of disability homeless ... congenital abnormality [noise]\nOr if the victim is found and they're able to talk they have no memory or they can explain what happened to him [noise] water plays a key role in this either the person disappears very near water or they're found in or near water\nBoulders and granted play a big role if it's in an area where these exist meaning the number one geographical cluster of missing people anywhere in the world she was Seventy national park\nWell that's probably the biggest conglomeration of granted anywhere in the world but granted plays much more of a role as I explained in many of the books [noise]\nThere's a location in the event called the point of separation\nYou're walking down the trail with your friend your loved one\nAnd they walk ahead of you you fall behind them at that point of separation something happens and that's where things go awry and I can't explain it but I can tell you that in interviewing dozens and dozens and dozens of people and you read these things in the report that's when it happens\nIt's almost like something's watching and when you split off from a group or a family that's when they move in\n[noise] equipment malfunction and this is a this one is not in huge numbers but it's enough to bother me and I've written about it and prior books\nThere was an abnormal number of aircraft crashes in conjunction with the searches and then people talk about other equipment their car other things malfunctioning in conjunction with this [noise]\nAnd then the last one is I've written about many many highly intellectual people that have vanished [noise]\nThe probably the one that's gotten the most notoriety is I've written about physicists of a German heritage that have disappeared\nI'm Talking about us in German but our German ancestry that have disappeared and have never been found it's very strange I cannot find a physicist that have disappeared that isn't German so strange that is but there's also a lot of a\nMedical professionals that have disappeared physicians and things\nSo when when you think about people they just disappear in the woods no I'm not I'm not really interested in that I'm interested in the specific profile that I just laid out here\nAnd there is a this geographical clustering that I figured out why after I started putting pins in a U.S map when I started to track this years ago\nAnd right now we're sitting at sixty geographical clusters in North America us and Canada\nNow there are other locations in Lebanon other countries of the world where these this exact same sort of thing happening a lot of times I found it on my own but many times after the book started to get rolling and people are different parts of the world\nMuseum and we've got a whole series of very true Australia same thing you're K same thing parents same thing now is worse I mean it'd be surprised how the end of this for ...\nUm and it's I think you I read that it's eleven hundred thirty five cases and it's men to women as a form to one ratio correct by any idea why why so many more men than women maybe more men are out in the outdoors and out there alone\nYeah I think that could be one thing maybe men take more risk than women I guess\nWe're talking with David ... about his latest work missing for one one land air water\nComing up in the next segment we're going to get into some specific cases and uh as I said before they raised the hair on the back of your neck of the Beatles take us into the break we'll be right back [noise]\nAll right um talk for a moment about search and rescue\nParameters because that that information becomes key to you picking the cases that you've zero in on I mean there are metrics there are there's data um for search and rescue um how how they proceed and and I are huge database I Would think that gives clues about which cases stand out as being unusual\n[noise] so that the data that you're trying to get to is really in the reports that they generate\nAnd the national Park Service for one won't volunteer up any of these reports\nNow find name as specific date and a specific time and that person has been rural to be a missing and presumed deceased [noise] they're released the report most time a lot of times they want [noise] there is a case from eighty six [noise]\nI'm an era the girl's name was Eris she was missing from Yosemite and I've tried to get that case ten times and I know nobody looked at the case in Twenty years and especially if they're told me I'll never see that case\nIt's a standard missing persons case there is no suspect there's no crime why can't I see it um and just so people understand in law enforcement missing people is one of the few things that they handled it isn't criminal [noise]\nAh everything else in the law enforcement world it's criminal oriented\nAnd missing people it's not against fought to go missing if you want to fall out of society and you can\nAnd it's handled entirely different than a criminal investigation but no prosecution that's gonna emanates from these cases that are Thirty years old that disappeared in the middle you're somebody [noise] but these people harbor it like there is some secret in there that they don't want you to see\nAnd a lotta times I'll grant you that the reports are horrific they don't have much data they don't have much information other times that are really really good\nAnd I don't understand why there and want us to see it but there's this uh called territorial behavior and many of the time they won't grant you access\nNow in the state of Washington they have a mandatory disclosure law that reports have to be disposed to the public comment crust\nColorado has outlaws well sort of like the freedom of Information Act a law\nBut many states stone and law enforcement knows that and they won't give up anything um so the first thing is you got to get these reports to really see what is there because you really can't trust I'm Sorry to say the storage you can't trust the media\nBecause I Would say eighty percent of the time when I finally get a copy of the report the news reports are totally completely wrong compared to what law enforcement said happened\nAnd I like to think back Thirty years ago forty years ago when there were reporters that really dug deep and got to the heart of the story and maybe today they can't spend the time to do it and so there's this superficial job of collecting the information\nBecause it's really not too good at these days\nWell I Would think that uh you know reporters just regular beat reporters who who get assigned to go out and cover a missing persons case you know like outside of Las Vegas ever been a couple that you and I've talked about before\nIt's not something they cover all the time so they defer to law enforcement if there's a law enforcement authority the person in charge of the of this scene um who tells you specifics here the details\nUm you know there's not many ways to take it further or you you defer to them you give them the benefit of the doubt not realizing that maybe they really don't want to tell the story of what's going on because it's too weird to explain\nWonder about the national Park Service whether they don't want to give you this information because they don't want to scare people away from the parks or they don't want to give me the information because they have in a general idea about what's going on and they don't want to uh you know they don't want to have to answer some questions about what do you think\n[noise] I think that the people the frontline people that you see when you go into the parks heart and soul the best of people in the world those rangers that are guiding you in the park and helping you and talking to you about nature those people have no idea what's going on\nIt's the people at the top tier in the government that are controlling really what's disseminated and how it's dispersed in communicated\nAnd it's those individuals that have this\nBig zoo this belief that it's their stuff\nIt's not yours and you're not going to get it [noise] and I don't understand it I Can't explain it\nAnd every once in awhile through a backdoor way I'll get it anyhow I mean sometimes I'll get the reports when a sheriff's office helped on a search\nAnd they had some of the report from the national Park Service as well and mistakenly they just sent me everything and so I'll get a Park Service or a national monument report\nAnd I'm I'm looking through and they got ... I wasn't supposed to get that but then it gives me some insight as to what's going on but it's rare\nLet's talk about a couple of current cases that you you sent me some information about one Samantha Sayers what's the deal there\n[noise] so twenty eight years old high performing person good athlete came from a Gerard Pennsylvania now living in Seattle [noise] she liked to go to this a location or called best burger king ... V. E. S. P. E. R.\nAnd she went there in August first this year it's about six thousand two hundred and twenty feet elevation two miles northeast a spate of lake ... five miles east of the ocean Puerto Suzanne\n[noise] round trip hike up about seven eight miles twenty seven hundred foot gain going up\nAnd a Thirteen hundred foot scramble to the top [noise]\nSo I live in Colorado I can tell you that that really isn't much here but in in Washington that's a pretty good hike and the mountains there that just sixty two hundred feet look a lot like the mountains here fourteen thousand feet well\nSamantha did a lot right she told her boyfriend where she was going when she'd be back and he was the kind of guy that kept track of her well when she didn't check in with him\nHe reacted the right way he went he went out and look for her [noise] while the investigation showed that she made the summit sometime too in between two and three in the afternoon and some other individual man saw her at the summit and communicated with her [noise]\nWell that was the subsequent investigation her boyfriend Kevin arrived at the mountain about ten pm started running the trails yelling for screaming for eventually called the snow homeless county sheriff and the search was on so that was on August first well\nThat search went on for about twenty two days three hundred and fifty seven air operations that is extraordinary that's locked\nHundred and five hours of drone time\nA three hundred and twenty nine hours of difference our personnel the family was on the scene everyday and when you look at the area the majority of the time she was above what looked to be Timberline there isn't much up at the top of desperate to pretty wide open area [noise]\nAnd for them not to be able to find her under these circumstances is really really unusual that cadaver dogs they had sent tracking dogs that everything you can imagine there to help [noise]\nWell eventually when the sheriff and the search and rescue personnel pulled out I mean that's that's a check on reality time if you're the family because you're looking at going back to Pennsylvania without your daughter and basically just Chuck it in with no more assistance\nBut the family had a lot of gumption they start pushing harder they did some Kickstarter campaigns\nAre trying to pay for a food and things for friends that were just staying on site and searching day and night well ... I don't even know how somebody wanted me to get to talk to the mom and the mom and I communicated and I gave them this road map\nAnd it's the same thing I've said is that you've got to get these reports otherwise you're just going to be replicating the exact same effort that search and rescue stung before down a lot of instances that may turn some results because\nPeople are found in areas that have been previously search that is true but if they have a lot of area where they say that they haven't searched at very thoroughly and the state that on the reports which they do and that Syria you really want to give it a big push [noise]\nBut the mom told me that they weren't getting any cooperation from the sheriff the sheriff wouldn't get many reports the search and rescue people weren't given him any reports and they were getting frustrated now this is the same thing I ... every family and if there's one listener not theirs is what you have to do [noise]\nYou don't go to the local news media and you you don't understand this church\nIs the local news media has to deal with the sheriff in that county day in and day out for the rest of their lives they can't burn a bridge they can't get 'em irritated they have to live with them but they national bureaus blocked CBS NBC CBS\nThe national bureaus you want to get one of those people in there and you want them to start stirring it up\nDad accused of putting a girl in a game machine steel prices\nNews twice in our breaking news when it happens on five Seventy W.

Thirteen nights with his credit card [noise]\nThat law enforcement reports state on June twenty of Steven called his parents on their on his borrowed cell phone from them\nSaid idiot arrived all was well checked in things were great manager of the hotel said Steven usually left before the others will look he was last seen on June twenty second or the twenty third and he was seen at night and a suit saying that the residency interviews had gone really well and he was happy [noise]\nOn June twenty second he drove his vehicle from the hostile to the salmon Huckleberry wilderness twenty five miles southeast Portland and completed the trail permit to enter the same in the wilderness [noise]\nWhen I stopped people here right now and tell you that you may think that when you complete those trail permits and put them in a little metal box that somebody's reading those and it's going to follow up and make sure that you come out\nThose trail permits are never reviewed and they're only used to see the load of people on the trail they never checked to see if you came out there essentially worthless some don't ever count on those\nBut on June twenty third a pair of hikers\nStevens card the trail had early in the morning and believed it had to be a day hiker but they were there really early\nAlthough the accident the trail later that day and they still solve the car there and bothered them and they felt so strongly that something was wrong that they call the sheriff and a deputy came out random registration on the rhetoric and the vehicle came back registering to a family\nAnd the registry she hadn't been turned over to rent a wreck yet so the deputy left a message on the machine of the family who still owned the car on the registration system and he left\nWell Steven was return was supposed to return to Detroit on July second the parents were at the airport and he didn't arrive\nWhen they called the Portland police tried to file a missing persons report and they were told that you couldn't file a missing persons report unless you were there in person\n[noise] [noise]\nSo the next day hope and Larry got on a plane and flew to Portland and the ... the search and rescue finally get down the trail and I think that some assistance from the national guard Keenan since our teams\nSearchers face Wayne and wet conditions for many of the days but again the searched and searched for days after he really went missing and are hoping Larry praise the attitude of the volunteer searchers but stated that they were highly disappointed in the deputies [noise] they\nSend it to the search didn't last long and was terminated without finding anything cadaver dogs were later put into that area and never picked up a cent they uh they had a psychic approach them\nAnd the psyche went with them and some for service people down the trail that came to switch back look down the cliff they saw little T. P. structure native little trees lying on the ground\nAnd they said that down there you'll find Stevens classes and that's where he died search and rescue went down there but they didn't bring their medical metal detector and it's like you said you needed that to find it but they never found it nothing was ever from there\nThey are hoping ... said that they are now any communications with the sheriff in years not never with the forest service Stevens never been found\nStarting a search almost two weeks after the disappearance is a very very difficult task and right here I'll say that Carol turned her when she disappeared in hotel park she leaves less left a message on the inside of her car indicating when she was going to be out [noise]\nNow I say this every conference and I said on every time on 'em on with you people need to carry a purse to locate or be can cost about two hundred two hundred and fifty bucks there is no monthly service fee you can get them on Amazon\nYou activated it sends a signal to a satellite that someone needs help immediately they'll find you within eight feet they dispatched search and rescue I carry one every time I go out\nAnd I I Would say that probably Ninety five percent of these cases could be quickly remedied if everyone carry one of these\nOil lot of things went wrong in this case a just a a comedy of errors it's not married to meet him though I mean but I you know search that starts that late you don't have much of a chance of succeeding you\nDon't think you do um personal he wasn't real acclimated to the area didn't understand the dangers\nProbably wasn't dress for success probably didn't have a backpack with them I doubt if he even had a Geological Survey map of the region\nBut when you go in an area like this there's so many things that can happen yeah I mean I tell people that you could go down this trail and if it's a trail that isn't very active you could be on the trail five or six miles down and break your leg on the trail and die on the trail\nAnd I think that doesn't that hasn't happened because it has and something very simple like this can just flew in your life when you could just have this little device that could save your life\nYou mentioned about the psyche that got involved in this case have you ever employed the services of a psychic or have you ever in the end it decays worse like it was used and they provided information that turned out to be accurate\n[noise] tell your story is um there's a remote viewer who's on coast to coast fairly frequently he will go unnamed\nBut he he claimed he contacted me that he could find missing people [noise]\nBut I asked him if he had ever found anybody and he gave me the name of this person and I listen to 'em and I said okay I'll I'll give you a case and during that week that I didn't talk to them I contacted this victims wife and I said hey that this person to help you in finding your husband\nShe goes can't do anything he never found him he notes\nPeople information my husband was found on other means by other searchers doing other things blah blah blah on and on\nGeorge I'm a guy that has really open mind will use anybody when somebody lies to me I won't use them ever again and that person blatantly lied to me and\nOther remote viewing cases there was one guy did a card for a couple of years ago really nice guy\nAnd the information he gave me wasn't even close in the realm of possible\nNow there's another guy who's a remote here I'm trying to work with right now hopefully have better but as far as psychics I did a conference in LA about two years ago and there were very psychics onus row is outside area at the conference [noise]\nTowards the end I Walk down the road to introduce myself to every one of these psychics what I Would I could use their services for each one of them said\nYeah yeah yeah we want to help worn out for sure yeah we can do this email each one of them the next week when I got back and I never got a response from one of\nCourse talking with Dave polite about his newest book missing for one more land air or water Mardi Palan a pioneer of the San Francisco rock scene died at the

Fifteen his wife with kids uh went to California and it was a\nPlanned vacation on Sunday night Henry went out with a long time friend who is a very diligent guy always on time very respectable and he and his friend went to the early\nEarly on that Monday morning Henry ... states have you dropped him off at a location and frankly at the super gas station or a Seventy third avenue\nTo twenty three am phone appears corrupt pocket dial this wife while she was asleep when California and what the wing the voicemail strange sound screaming ... paintings growls et cetera\nAnd it's hard to determine when you listen to it if they are all human or their animal found what are they\nWe we have a recording of a news report that was done based on this includes uh some of the clips from that phone call so maybe we can play that right now and then on the other side you can tell me a little bit more about it\nIt's a voice mail unlike anything you've ever heard before [noise]\nThey were two minutes' worth it [noise]\nVery little actual talking what are you concerned did disturb the middle of the night call came from Henry McCain Celso it with labor date September Seventy two twenty eight in the

I Hope for\n... minutes at a community services is a nonprofit agency at accent they go between but police in the Liberian community leader is trying to get held the family in some sense rewarding\nRoles tell him to hide it [noise]\nAll lightning moaning and pay like moaning and [noise]\nStation\nThere in silent didn't sound like either Henry or another person's head down and try to show where he was [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nLike that now is a stark contrast to other articulate recording ... speaking at an event he state auditor\nWhen he was in\nThe ... is one piece of evidence now in college at reviewing police chief tell me even the FBI is analyzing the recording and voices for Clinton did she says the investigation to get here on Tuesday\n[noise] right see part which borders you write in Mountain View and certainly all areas where Medicaid which were forty scene for cell phones teens skiff fancy county water control search they came up and\nSo that's a news report from Minneapolis television station or she the reports\nYeah I was analyzing it the police were trying to make some sense of it have you ever seen any of that analysis or reports or did they come doing any kind of conclusion what the heck that was\nNever it claimed up so tight but one thing that I've written about in past books\nIs that the FBI follows these cases there's no reason for the F. FBI to be involved in this it's a local jurisdiction missing person that's it why is the FBI sticking their noses in this\nUnless they are interested in it for some other reason [noise] now\nThe last tower that they pick up that phone was near Silverlake road and Mississippi street new Brighton one mile east of the Mississippi River\nAnd many of the cases I've written about in the past in missing four one on a sobering coincidence dealt with men very healthy men that were found and bodies of water many times in the Mississippi when this happened I thought he is going to be found in the Mississippi orange something else really close [noise]\nWell the location where he was eventually found was searched multiple multiple times canines helicopters ground teams everything on November second this is almost two months after he disappeared for twenty in the afternoon a kayaker was on Russia lake\nOne mile south east of the last time they can that phone and they saw body in the water and they recovered it there was no violence at all to the body according to the corner [noise] such termination on the count on the cause of death was freshwater drowning\nSyria had been search multiple times and the FBI had that recording for analysis why was Henry McKay in the water [noise]\nNow one of the things that I presented in sobering coincidence about all of these young healthy men\nWas that many times the family did not accept\nThat determination by the corner on the cause of death and they paid for secondary autopsy several times when they did the second autopsy they found very high levels of GHB in the system of the victim and they were an level so high it didn't make sense\nSo GHB it's commonly known as the date rape drug people get it they pass out they realize that they're awake but they can't move and they can't react and if you think about this\nMany of the times that these people have disappeared never has any of their friends relatives et cetera seen the point where they disappeared [noise] sometime they disappeared amongst friends\nThey couldn't explain how they got from point a to point B teenage couldn't track point to point a lot of times that happened in the winter and there was no marks and the snow point to point [noise]\nAnd if you think what GHB does to you it puts you in that state were you realize what's happening to you but you can't react so if they lead lead you saying a a bank of snow\nYou would die from hypothermia you wouldn't die from GHB intoxication\nIf they placed you on the water you would die by drowning not from GHB [noise] and you see GHB is not one of the twenty sixth drugs that are screened routinely by corners across the United states\nIt's only caught if you pay an extra him out to do this much more advanced screening for drugs\nAnd so it's a very very rarely if ever found in systems because most people can't afford a second autopsy and I'm not saying that that is what is in all of these cases but\nIt showed up too many times to be ignored\nThat are recording it certainly seems like he realizes he's in trouble or painter agony\nAnd then as the reporter mentioned it sounds like there's somebody out there that says something that's um\nThat's ah that's difficult to get your head around\nIt is in in many of the other cases I've written about that are related to these water unbelievably the victim is on the phone as they are going through this transition of disappearing [noise]\nOne time not far from where this incident happened or college kids walking down the street he's on the phone with a girlfriend has and says where are you I Need you here now I Need you here now phone cuts off he sound days later in the Mississippi River another time a kid in east a western Minnesota\nIs missing and his parents are trying to find him and he's on the phone with him and he goes I don't know where I Am blah blah blah blah blah blah boom phone goes dead he was never found yet his car was found\nTo these incidents that happened were there on their cell phone is something new and different but when you listen to the incident as it evolves it's a very uncomfortable\nI mean it seems like they're being abducted kidnapped um and sometimes the bodies were found and sometimes they aren't and\nThey're they're just like snatched by persons are known by things unknown almost like no one gigantic bird swooping down and matching them up um you know so many\n... agrees is calling me all the time and saying well you know we talked about the ... or ... or\nJoin this YouTube say this this is I don't say that [noise] and I want people to understand that this is not a conspiracy theory topic because I'm not giving you and your theories I'm giving you All Facts\nAnd that's the way I Want people to understand this is that it's an unusual topic that's tied together the way an FBI profile or will profile a series of crimes\nWere linking together a series of facts to show that there's continuity here\nThat there are patterns say in this book\nI wouldn't think that you'd have cases in the air um uh that would qualify under your criteria but you do you have a bunch

of\nCourse we haven't really dug into the historical archives or to the extent that you have but I think that some of that work is being done right now\nIt it was a it struck me as a significant that that the person who told me that in D.C had brought up\nYour books and and your subject matter I Want to try to get one more of these air disappearances in before the bottom of the break because I'm I think I'm going to open up the phone lines you know people are gonna want to talk to you a little bit the Scotland cases guy Norman Peter games can you summarize that when\nYou're a December twenty fourth Nineteen Seventy five nine thirty [noise] occurred on the island of mall if an island in Scotland and fifty five years old guy gives was a war hero he was an intellect and he was a pilot [laughter] spit fires in the battle of Britain in Nineteen forty [noise]\nHe was staying at a place called the Glenn force a hotel and it sat right on the ocean northeast side of the island the mall and there was a graph airstrip there and the rooms were right next to the airfield looking at the water [noise]\nIt right but the hotel on December twentieth on December twenty thirty contacted the owner of a Cessna one fifty parked at the airstrip tenacity could fly it\nIn Hamilton was the attorney negotiated a price to fly the two seater [noise] and on Christmas Eve Nineteen Seventy five at nine thirty\nKept walked out to the plane with a hotel guests named ... city Granger [noise] and she thought she was going to go with him on a flight but he told her no she had to lay off the porches suit can fly inland\n[noise] so she exits the plane places the torches out in the field and he or she sees him taking off the plane flying out over the water [noise]\nNow some reports say that after he took off they saw strange lights on the water\nSome people said and it might have been a fishing boat but they could never identified the boat and they can never see where the lights went will make a long story short Gibbs didn't return on the plane\nAnd there was a major search on and off the island for days and they found nothing and they found a sheep herders and ranchers the church all their property they got nothing\nWell on April twenty first Nineteen Seventy six is about four months after the disappearance\n[noise] gifts his body was found on a normal\nAnd this is an amount and it's like an oil near the airfield\nAnd he has a small scratch on his chin nothing else and a shepherd took part in the original search and he walked by the spot where the body was found multiple times and never saw it now if given the jump from the airplane there should have been more injuries and broken bones\nAnd they never found the plane [noise] nothing physically what's wrong with him so he could walk back to the hotel the best everyone could tell\nThe corner stated the cause of death was exposure meaning hypothermia [noise]\nAny gift that he probably died two hours after take off they examine his clothing and it was no salt or marine organisms on the body that means he didn't go into the ocean and crawl out unanswered questions or is what were the lights on the water\nReally how did you get there\nReally how long had he been dead where was the plane\nAnd then my notes on this I write down GHB again because there's no reason for a man to die of exposure on the top of a mountain when people get cold they get up and they walk you don't lay down and die\nObviously the top of a mountain and it's colder than the bottom or where you could see humanity from the top of this mountain\nStrange case you know I've seen a some people respond to some of your cases that the weird ones where the clothing is missing\nAnd I've seen people trying to explain in a way of saying people do weird things when hypothermia sense and they'll take off their clothes and and walk into snow and and do things that seem logical um\nHow would you respond to those kinds of ah remarks and would sit here\nOne of the things is I look for cases they're insurmountable meaning that explanation doesn't fit I have several cases where somebody leaves the house and within a hundred yards of the house they find a pile up close\nAnd personal left the house and it was Seventy degrees out later that night it get down to fifty but the person left the house and in a hundred yards all their clothes is gone and they're in a\nStack in this field [laughter] happened multiple times also I've had other cases where a parent's says my baby couldn't take off their clothes so if somebody saying they remove their clothes and they died of hypothermia good luck with that because the kid couldn't take off their clothes\nSo the cases I Try to include try I Try to explain this rationally\nNow there's a group out there that don't want to understand this and they want to explain it away with ... you kind of stuff and that's fine but the reality of it is is that there's there's usually no rational explanation for why this stuff happens\nYou know in the alien abductions field I don't know if you've read any of that there are some cases that are almost humorous or that or there'll be somebody who's taken\nBy some entities and they come back in their clothes Ron backwards or she was missing or I'm thinking of somebody else's underwear on a or they're rare cases where multiple people say they're taken and their clothing is switched when they wake up in the morning\nI'm now there can be all kinds of explanations for why people take their clothes off a that don't involve aliens but it it reminded me of some of the cases that you have in your books where\nPeople's clothing is found it kinda folded up it said it neatly placed somewhere away from people and um it's not torn up as a by bears or something it's just weird\nI've written of cases in this book and other books\nWere special no tour made that the clothing and the body was him packet bleak clean like it just came out of a laundromat and the body just came out of a shower and they couldn't explain why everything was so clean\nAnd you have cases where bodies or kids are found they'd been missing for a couple of days they've been in the wilderness no food or water and there's not they're not really they they're not whether there is not like they've they've been out in the in the open up for very long at all\nCorrect so where are they where they go\nThe same thing applies to the water related cases\nWhen when the bodies of water if there are certain things that we know certain things to the hair loss of hair rink wing of body fingernails things like that and when these bodies were pulled out\nCorners of made statements that well the person disappeared on Monday but they've only been in the water for twenty four hours but they've been gone for six days\nSo were they were a victim for all this time\nAnd that's the importance of behind finding\nIt shows things that it wouldn't show otherwise\nIt's almost like it's a ... or a harvesting that whoever whomever or or whatever is taking people it needs something from them unless it's just malicious it needs something from 'em and and some\n... some of these people never come back at all and some are just disregarded or when they're not needed anymore um\nI mean I I Know you're reluctant to go that far but it sort of what it feels like\nOne of the questions I get all the time is are these people ever found to be abused sexually abused things missing from the body not the case\nAre found some pretty much intact without a lot of injury to him I mean one of the things that people have said a lot is that what they what they're doing so\nWell I mean I don't know how you measure that\nBut I've heard those kinds of allegations of uh what some other\nIntelligence what their interest in us might be and it's it's a tough one to prove I don't know what it would take for you\nWhat kind of evidence that would take for you to reach a conclusion I guess it it would take maybe film or video of one of these um incidence\nWhere or when we first started this trip together ... years ago people said oh he knows what it is you know it right gotta be something mundane it may be from the topic that he just doesn't want to talk about what come a long way\nAnd I think if you start shut the door to early you can't really make the obvious years later and that's one of the reasons that bin ... anything that\nYou know may be a possibility 'cause it may cause that door for me I mean I thinking where we are today versus where I was six years ago a huge difference [noise]\nIt granted grandfather granite and boulders creek forever if you have to cross through the creek is that\nUm [noise] anyhow um when we went um ... came back out of the mountain and you met up with a couple of other researchers and I'm One of my head found some future panty 'em\nAnd they tried calling the nine one one non emergency number and they tell

guys had sounded like big but here like a big fight before\nWell do you know we're going to get Dave to react to you dropped a lot of stuff on there and we'll get Dave's reaction to some of that I

here and everyone kind of just left it off and says well you know maybe it's just the technology we don't know maybe it's not that good there's some reason we're getting these things in these areas

the German connection so I wondered if you've ever looked into mysterious ... Germany if perhaps they're more common there\n[noise]\nSo German Germany is tough I I don't speak German I I don't have a contact in Germany there are a couple of people who have purchased the books that have ... and I've never gotten anything back out of Germany indicating that it's more prevalent there than not\nWhat about the mines being a race or you have written about about problems that people have been remembering where they've been\nCorrect [noise] and uh that could obstacle especially with kids it's a touchy one uh I don't think that many parents want their children to go through any regression hypnosis to try to figure out what happened because they probably want their kids to keep the memory suppressed\nNow parents adults that might be a different idea might be something to look into if there happens to be somebody that window of the claims that and is willing to put her a lot of butter hurdles right there\nYou have some cases where kids are taking their very young and their explanations are pretty weird so no one takes them seriously about you know I was taken away by the big talking bay or something along those lines right\nYeah those are those are hard to explain and [noise] you know a lot of people who are recorded we'll put it in the article or you know that's just the kids imagination the search for sick now is it or is it not\nOn the wild card line Carolyn North Carolina hello Carol\nMy I had a question in the end of their bodies they have recovered have they haven't done enough autopsies to look very very small mark his needle mark or something that would be related to the tools of nanotechnology\nAnd I wanted to tell David to facts that I Know this sure one and the U.S government since Nineteen eighty two has had the ability to feel like things invisible I Know that because a friend of mine [noise]\nUh flew a experimental yet up to Washington DC over the White House and having the Pentagon undetected\nUm anyway\nWell that's interesting um there there is some work on the visibility cloaking a devices and equipment and clothing even um we had that discussion on the program before you ever gotten into that topic they\n[noise] you know I I think you are the ones that had the author of community along right yeah that\nThat some some real interesting things as far as cooking and it's been brought up to me before that there's some belief out there that special forces have that ability and the practice when they're in the woods who knows if it's true and who knows if they do it but I've heard that before\nBut no indication that there is some kind of nanotechnology involved than any of these disappearances based on marks on the bodies that you've heard of\nSomeone corners do an autopsy they look for the marks that's one of the things that can be a contributing factor on deaf so they're looking for that but as far as they are technology I don't know if they would be\nEast of the Rockies John in Virginia Hi John good morning\nGo I can date it um [noise] I don't know I tell you tell us just on this one person's story that happened in Nineteen forty seven um uh my grandmother told me this story at when I was very young but uh you'd have to know her and her sister both at the very religious and brand truth truth list\nBut anyway um that was where I live close to my home is a a place called the creek it used to be following that could be anything back in the forties\nAnd earlier than it actually but anything I'm\nA I'm a it was a farmer and his wife that we have to have a rather large farms and I'm One night the animals in the long range and heck why it was really upset or something anyway she went out and let them put she found a box to\nInfant senator and paying that six months so and they had their things tend to they had a blanket one of his name with see one of his name ...

Mr ... uh\nAbout a missing people are in the uh Bellingham uh area of a Washington state\nUh that uh over several years at least a recent down in the past uh have turned up missing a and a later on some of their body part and mainly their feet have shown up in the ah [noise]\nIn a water are in different areas and uh [noise] and since uh during that time period or my wife and I had a\nHad the misfortune of happening in a missing son and he was a very well trained a boy scout and we pay your debt the you know the uh since it's been two years now a\nA you know a a well nothing ... nothing has turned up in terms of evidence or anything like that so the uh the local law enforcement closed the case and uh and because he's an adult so we can't go\nOr with it because of his wife\nAnd a and so we're we've been kind of stuck with that but I wanted to find out if I'm Mr ... says are being aware of this a phenomenon of a\nOf the the issue and uh it's it's been a well publicized and newspapers and ... and over there [laughter]\nYeah I'm I'm sure you've heard of that and ah you know if you wanted to try to contact and we have a we have links on the coast to coast website his website is candy I'm missing dot com that's where you reach a Dave\nI I Know he knows about the defeat story because it was so widely publicized but your son um what are the circumstances where did that happen and when\n[noise] okay uh if it happened in Bellingham in it happened or just on the outskirts of town [noise] and uh he basically what happened a and this happened two years ago October uh\nHe uh he had\nLeft home and uh we believe that maybe there may have been uh\nSome friction at home but uh he has left home and he got into this vehicle and evidently it ran out of cash and a and didn't have any money to get cash so he took up walking\nAnd it was nightfall at the time and he tried to call him and his wife back in a that was the last that they had heard from him\nA ... when he had stated that his phone was dying and he was lost and lost in the woods somewhere\nAnd couldn't find its way out in the end and then we had a a massive search uh for the next two days in a row with a with a law enforcement we also had a\nHad helicopters they had dogs shed a drones are I mean they covered or that area over ten mile stretch and nothing at all showed that period and a waiver to show\nA broken into over that uh\nAnd uh\nAnd since then uh I have actually personally myself I have called in and talk to a few times to some of the people that they actually investigated on it\nAnd they just basically told me that uh that they were a a ... ... they were basically are held by the laws of the state in and of course the\nThe wife [noise] uh [noise] uh that uh any information given out to would be specifically on a given to her and uh and then the parents couldn't find out anything you know after that so [noise]\nWhile under the reason why yeah I'd like to try to uh maybe a get a shot at a you know talking to David I'm is provided and she would uh see what he thinks\nI I Would just you try that website that okay that is but also you can leave your name and number with Donna and uh I'll pass it on to Dave\nI'm that's a that's a rough story to to uh tell on the radio I'm sure I thank you for sharing it with us and you know I can imagine that that's a whole that never going to rain and the fact that you just don't know it was just a is a brutal\nI thank you Roger thanks for calling in with trying to get one more call in before we go to a break a Joe in Long Island on the east of the Rockies Bonnie Hi Joe Hi\nGeorge ah I did a couple of seasonal gigs to national parks a glacier and canal in Alaska and one thing I Would say a specially looking at the rally the infrastructure of the park is very limited\nUh they have like a road that goes to mount McKinley that ... is winding mountain road that bus it can take a bus no real hiking trails\nAnd if you go off the uh those roads like the flooding would be bad for hiking [laughter] so\nI I Would say it and I will correlate the ... glacier ah they really on the play shows how treacherous a trail could be for example in glacier you would be on wages on actual trials that are like twenty miles trails for like two three four miles [laughter]\nSo I I think a lot can do wrong ah and ah you know if someone was like say by themselves and they hurt their ankle and couldn't proceed\nUh then I don't know anything could happen with the wild animals for the one thing now I don't think\nAh what's happening is some sort of Charles Manson group that all looking to just fine isolated hikers and do something with them I never really got the impression although I read that like criminals with hideout in Yellowstone for example I don't think\nThat people go to those parks to like\nA just a pounce on someone that's an isolated hiker so uh I I I Would speculate that that's not what ... what is happening [noise] ah but ah I I think what David saying about the national parks is very little supervision people are\nAre you know are just off on their own toward the gray and I've done that including myself or any number of times where something happened on the trail uh nobody would have no where I was at a one more thing on that is my ... theory is what you said about the birds\nA swooping down I did see a Glacier National park like these tiny birds but they almost right on the ground myself what it says it looked like something from Jurassic Park\nSo I Do wonder if that ... idea of some sort of prehistoric bird that might be out there but that's my coast to coast theory [noise]\nUm you know the idea that they're criminals and national parks national forest I think that's probably true you know there are criminals pretty much everywhere that humans go uh in addition you have a lot of people who uh grow and grow weed out there in in the\nWilderness places and uh and would do anything to protect it and um you know but those kinds of cases are generally weeded out of the David database if\nWe're talking about people who banish I'm under very strange and specific kinds of circumstances and there was no tracks there was no indication that people are around uh you'd think you'd vanish within a few feet of their family members or the people or hiking with so\nIt's very weird and I don't think that the criminals being out there could explain pretty much any of the cases that are a boiled down and David ... books but uh I appreciate that thought\nOr we're gonna take a break now and there's a lot of folks on the phone lines of we'll get to do as many of your calls as we can I noticed a couple of folks have their own stories with a encounters strange and counters in the woods and\nYou know it's been a while since I've been a hiking out in in the wilderness areas but um but I can understand how the elements skinned or can sort of\nIt it gets pretty creepy out there sometimes the we're going to go to the break the champagne taste take us into the break and we'll be right back\nAnd there was like strange noises stuff even feature of like a greyhound or pay this locking on a plane and paying for the park later on a couple of weeks later because before the break out of their sleeping bag\nAnd it never was ever nothing was ever headed out every year\nYou know anything about that or\nI don't know anything about that specific a creature or creature report but I Do know that uh the act I'm a I'm area has been a hotbed for really weird stuff for a very long time or the guys who investigated the skin Walker phenomena in Utah\nSpent some time on the ground up there collecting information and stories rumble locals including the tribe and had reported the number of different kinds of creatures and it's always been a UFO hotspot or at least for the last fifty or so years so there's a lot of weird stuff concentrated in the area you're discussing uh but no I hadn't heard the story about the\nThe um things pulling people out of their sleeping bags at room rock like thanks for sharing that do appreciate it we're going to go east of the Rockies to Roy in Youngstown, Ohio morning Roy\nDoing All right what's on your mind\nHey um I remember um this evening or are you guys were talking about a day but ... you were talking about ... right and uh\nAnd I literally stood up and said that and I point out the radio because I've read all the books I read all the full on one books I've read the skin or ranch book\nAnd I've been calling this thing for some time for several years\nA ... say when you guys were talking about that all kinds of things to come to mind a rich lived a certain number of uh disappearances are a lot of parents had happened on or near Richland and I just couldn't walk ranch that's on a ridge like\nA C a hundred percent success rate every time an individual is taking no one ever see them being taken\nOver the skin Walker ranch we're dealing with with with something that is highly intelligent and it knows whatever's somebody's on the property or on around here just to me I'm just saying to me uh in my opinion I think that you know that this could walk ranch\nIs very close to the the phenomenon surrounding the Fort one one\nWell I you know I think there are some similarities and that it is whatever it is it seems to be intelligent and it seems to know what people are doing before they do with themselves and it's still the that's for sure the only difference is there at skin Walker to my knowledge no one has disappeared animals have builder here but not people you\nKnow there has not been any people are saying but there has been a you know yeah I mean that's the other side that we have had animals missing but then we've also had mutilation\nIs saying that doesn't fit there would be that ah when people have gone missing there's been no explanation of the um gouge marks on them other than ... things like that no no kind of like ... or something of an alien would do and you read the directions stores things like that\nBut that that doesn't fit but as far as a rich lines go um and uh and the high intelligent or is it\nA hundred percent success rate a no one ever she sees it uh that that to me is uh some goods from our share\nBut thanks thanks for sharing your impressions with us that's a lot to chew on ... you calling in we're going to go to the wild card line Mario in San Antonio Texas a he has a citing he wants to tell us about welcome\nWelcome to think of it taking my call for I Want to remind me\nMy experience a sheer at a park and says Anya which they added another ten miles of bike trail\nConnect a couple of parks and um this wooded area where even do with daylight at the time was the new me and my wife were you know by going down to turn on the course of the little head over and uh you got started one area where it got\nKind of dark even though it was daylight but it was so what is that it was\nThe sun was shining through as much as I started kind of got kind of dark and that area or when I stop to\nAll my life with that I noticed some kind of something just staring at it and it was that go on the stump and they look more like a bird about but ah you know we never do I mean it kind of felt like it was like\nSeven feet tall they see\nAnd just and then on the stump just a staring at me and my wife when she approached a mean looking at something she load and we kind of look kinda thumb at each other and I said that you see that and she's like yeah so when they saw just pasta and we just\nSaw them back a bit flying away but the wingspan was so large that wasn't a\nIt was like a regular bird you know what I mean we have ducks in a news and all kinds of stuff and I spend a park nearby but this is a real heavy area would it\nMean tweeting parts where they had made a bike trail and that's all it is and so I just want to share my story 'cause I Know we didn't record it to the pastor or any park rangers anything\nBut why don't we didn't have no evidence that too it's kinda hard to believe that they are to be that there are just two people just to riding bikes than a a\n[noise] a lie down some kind of record about something that we just saw\nSo ah you said this thing is seven feet tall did it have just like a regular bird's face or or do you remember what coloring on the animal ours all you\nSaw was kind of like a maybe something ... eyes kind of like blowing just like if you just see a beer in the dark school wall or something like that you knew staring at you\nBut you you could just see us up like a form of shape but you couldn't really chilling exact details especially when there wasn't that this that and I and the first thing you see I noticed with a sense that something was staring at me\nAnd that's why that's so it made me up\nAnd we're not going to cut my wife and I'm looking at it and I was at that point so a close second\nShe turned around and just try and fly away so I couldn't really tell a bad like tens of arms of the detail all I knew it was huge because we used to have chickens and and do stuff like that it was nothing like that\nA Mario thanks for sharing that story that's the amount of uh that's kinda creepy stuff appreciate the specific detail that you had on that a while that's quite an experience uh Jason in Portland, Oregon has inexperienced to share it with a patient welcome\nFlowed George it's an honor to talk to you I'm always nervous when I call in [laughter]\nNo need your you're among

that overrides thing Jim so it wasn't until years later I started putting\nAll the facts together [laughter]\nSo the facts are I'm going I'm hiking into one of my favorite little fishing lakes\n[noise] that's basically off of an old blogging ... road\nWell when the forest service closes a logging road what they do and this logging road had been closed for a long time they bring in a major excavator and they dig a huge trench on both ends of the logging road\nAnd pile up a big mountain of the debris and boulders and things like that show it's impossible to drive a car or any vehicle down that road again you can kinda hike around it and even at times on your own two feet that can be very difficult because it's heavily wooded dishes in the\nCoast range and it's basically
