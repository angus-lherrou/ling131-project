very very dangerous\nIt has to do with what's happening in the middle east we have to special guest for your let me introduce them first Fred burden for it as the vice president of intelligence and counterterrorism at the Stratford leading geo political intelligence for him and he's one of the world's foremost experts on security\nTerrorists in terrorist organizations easy former State

Israeli conflict\nInternational counterterrorism military and law enforcement special ops and Palestinian and Islamic fundamentalists tour as well Samuel welcome to to the program\nThank you so much for having me and their book is called bay road rules the murder of a CIA station chief in Hezbollah's war against America a friend and Sam ... of the Lebanese a heritage and I'm very familiar with that\nTour blown the country now be used to be the jewel of the middle east there isn't any more for it is it\n[noise] no I'm afraid not a George ah we've watched it deteriorate for several years now and of course a Hezbollah has become a very strong and country and a operates as an Iranian proxy\nIn how long Samuel has this been going on with Iran backing Hezbollah and who are the are these Lebanese people or the Iranians who are they\nWell Hezbollah the Lebanese party of God the Shiite religious militia [noise] um [noise]\nUnderground Iranian proxy group that were formulating around the time of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon and Nineteen eighty two\nUm Lebanon as you know of all we split between the Sunni the Christian and the Shiite population for domination of the country and the sheer were always relegated to third class status\nAnd in Nineteen Seventy eight or one of the Shiite spiritual leaders of murder to Libya and left the vacuum in the country and and that coincided with the onset of\nAyatollah Khomeini and Iran and the Iranian Revolution and they have the uranium for a possible fertile ground to spread the revolution in Lebanon and they sent the salaries they send 'em intelligence specialist for myself revolutionary guards\nWho have been on with serious ... and they said the base and live and on and they established almost that many state within in many states that was very obvious to many\nInside the country for them I interviewed a few people\nWho are journalists at the time in Lebanon and they said that the Iranian influence was everywhere I'm fairly the the two people of the two groups that neglected this this arrival and the amount of money and the amount of influence with the Iranians are spreading I Love it on\nOr the Israelis and the Americans to people that have a vested interest in keeping with the Iranians way out of living a\nFriend is Hezbollah as dangerous or more so than what we have known as al ...\n[noise] well George I think that's a relative a statement to pay for a Osama bin Laden came along a Hezbollah certainly had a more American and Israeli blood on their hands than [noise]\nThan any other group ah I Know from that time period from investigating the attacks on\nThe u._s. embassies and the hijackings in the assassinations and and certainly the kidnapping of the CIA station chief which\nUh Georgia when you look at this from an intelligence perspective and you look back on the on the course of a kind of parts of history\nHas never been done this was an organization that had\nA literally a snatch to the United states of America is number one intelligence officer assigned to the country to rebuild a all the intelligence operations after the uh first a U.S embassy bombing\nUh so uh this was unprecedented its time and um it was certainly shocking for us or that it occurred\nUh but I'm also a a great sense of failure on our part to because\nUh I Know when we were looking for Bill Bill Buckley\nUh we we just simply did not have the human intelligence to be able to tell us\nExactly where he was so um [noise] it was one of those tragic moments in in the course of a of history that are certainly a um I'll never forget and um but I Know that there was a heck whole heck of a lot of us that that certainly tried to find bill who certainly was an American hero\nWas ever get into that story I Want to get your reaction to a jak Anderson article that ran in Nineteen eighty as well for it for what what do we say to Americans who simply say look this is in the middle east it's not here in the United states why do I have to worry about this what do you tell them\n[noise] Georgia and it's a fair question uh you can only look back on the events of ah\nNine eleven and the planes flying into the twin towers and the plane that went down in Shanksville, Pennsylvania and certainly that hit the Pentagon a as an example of we have to be cognizant of the geopolitics of the region or why we need a footprint or in the area why we need to take the fight to the enemy\nOr and or a take out these individuals are so they don't carry out attacks on us soil and\nUh that's the the critical geopolitical reason why we're doing this\nOr we're going to talk about William Buckley you're just a moment we're with Fred Burton Samuel Katz the book is going to be rude to rules next hour we'll take phone calls with them on what truly is\nA very important story that's been going on that is not to a well publicized in hopefully Fred than Samuel with your book be rules you're getting more and more exposure\nTo what's happening over there and if you can say I'm In a couple of minutes we have before the break give us an update before we get into the book and William Buckley after the break give us an update of what's happening in Syria today\nWell speaking of Hezbollah um movie that has all the forces have been fighting from the onset\nWell speaking of Hezbollah um ... as the forces have been hiding from the onset along fine Iranian special forces to help keep 'em president off of um regime in power has ... has been transformed from an underground for\n'em in the Nineteen eighties the period we're for them I wrote about William Buckley in the early emergence of um fundamentalists suicide Shiite brand of terrorism and it has emerged to probably one of the stronger almost conventional armies in the middle east\nUm is it for the United states in Iraq it was it was absolutely in a central player in helping the Shiite militias in Iraq developed there I'm ... I'm strategy and tactics killed so many American servicemen I'm In ... launched\nA um horrific Oregon Israel were late seeing a movie of indiscriminate rocket fire against Israel cities um it does involve the narco terrorism is one of the world's largest cocaine and I'm I'm traffickers in the world and it is a force to be reckoned with [laughter]\nWe cannot ignore 'em specifically because it has if we were so them operatives in this country has for many years\nAnd it is an arm and extension of Iran is I'm a desire to be a regional player if not regional superpower in the middle east region of the world but if I'm all for important in the U.S national interest\nAll countries of course work through straw parties we worked with Osama bin Laden and the mujahideen in Afghanistan to get the Soviets out of there\nGiving them cash and arms and everything else so I can understand why the Iranians are doing this with Hezbollah but why are we getting top with Iran over this why are we talking about sanctions why don't we just say enough stopped feeding these people stopped supplying them we're going to ... year why don't we do that Sam\nI think that this country has been very apprehensive about engaging Iran militarily\nOr hostages were the ... the U.S embassy in Tehran I'm a many many years ago I think there were numerous um declarations of war but Iran has little against the United states\nThe bombing of the U.S embassy bombing of a second and to see the bombing of marine barracks which was on the thirty five years ago to this day hold\nAre hiring with Lincoln jobs today go to link dot com slash working again fifty dollars off your first job pose pointing dot com slash working for your fifty dollars ... terms and conditions applied\n\n\nWelcome back to coast to coast red Burton with us Samuel Katz their book is called be rude rules Sam you were mentioning of course that a Hezbollah may have sleeper cells in the United states is that possibly one reason we haven't gone after Iran militarily and attack them because we're afraid that those cells could be activated\n[noise] no I don't think so I think um we haven't gone after Iran militarily because we're not really sure or a direct military conflict with Iran might bring the Iranian you of groups like Hezbollah to export terrorism throughout the middle east\nAnd the rest of the world is going to end the war um policy planners in this country for generations it was some directly responsible for a lack of response to it with a truck bombing\nOf embassies the Marines and the kidnapping\nA station shave some things that was unheard of in the world of espionage up until that point and ever since I'm William Buckley was the only station is she from the CIA that was ever a kidnapped and murdered in the history of the age of ...\nFred burden tell us about William Buckley\nA bill was a a a true patriot Georgia he grew up in a stone them a Massachusetts and\nBy the way for people just listening this is not the journalists were\nI grew up in a stone them a Massachusetts\nAnd by the way for people just listening to this is not the journalists were talking about\nNo it's not there's actually a funny Side Story to that because the other William F Buckley was also associated with the CIA I and our William F Buckley actually received a few of his paychecks over the years wrote them\nAnd uh our bill thought it was pretty funny and a thought about a cashing them but I'm a bill grew up in the Boston area a seminar we're lucky enough to ah get the cooperation of bills or family he has a elderly companion or that he's lived with for many many years and a sister\nWho just told us wonderful stories about a bill growing up ah\nI'm In he went off after high school into the U.S army and enlisted and went to Korea\nAs a young kid\nAnd um where he was a silver star recipient and\nAlso a Purple Heart um which was an amazing kind of a research task uh we uncovered with the first calvary division where bill first enlisted into\nWhen it comes back on the GI Bill goes to Boston University\nUm graduates or gets hooked up with the CIA or in the early fifties says it was very murky\nA as to exactly what he was doing at that time period and we cannot find a anybody that can tell us specifically what he was up to [noise] uh but regardless I'm a he leaves the CIA and becomes a librarian of all things\nWhen you know didn't surprise me because of of the nature of it as a curiosity and his language is ... to\nTo just I'm a study history and specially military history [noise]\nUh so uh in Nineteen sixty he uh he joins or the U.S army again a an goes on to special forces a and I'm also a associated with the CIA and that time period or he was recruited by this mysterious figure by the name of girl\nUm who was in the Boston area who was a CIA spotter in recruiter and um little goes off\nTo Vietnam and where he is also a again awarded the silver star or for courage under fire a so this was a man George that was always running towards danger and\nUh he he reminds me of the NYPD a cops and firefighters running towards the twin towers\nYou know you know who you're they just did what they had to do\nIt exactly and um and and off the bill uh was uh uh the only guy to raise his hand to volunteer to go to the root uh at the CIA uh after this devastating embassy bombing in Nineteen eighty three where the entire CIA station is wiped out so\nUh that was to Bill Buckley was a you know he was a true American Hero\nAnd that was his assignments bread in Bay roots clandestine or was it pretty well known by people\nWell ah the the station chief or um is usually declared towards the government meaning a bill the local Lebanese the liaison intelligence service knows exactly who he is a although he does have a diplomatic passport or he's known as the or the CIA officer the cheapest station\nAnd of course the other ... intelligence liaison services know that to try and such as the Jordanians the French the Israel was and so forth so I'm Bill is not in a undercover physician during that time period\nSomebody read it on him he'll do well\nUh it was very difficult to operate in Beirut in that time period um [noise] you know in order to do your job you have to get out and about meat sources meat snitches uh and so forth and so um you know bill was that kind of person\nAnd I'm In essence a leading his apartment one day a in Nineteen eighty four you know he's he's kidnapped these overwhelmed by a multiple vehicles and Hezbollah grab them and um they're begins his time in captivity\nWhy didn't you have security around there\n[laughter] it's a good question or I can tell you a first hand from that time period a it was an unusual for station chief not to have security\nUh salmon I did our last book on been God's the uh where you had a whole Qadri a professional uh security personnel to specifically watch a CIA officers backs\nAre in that time period uh they really didn't exist you could request security you could get a you know folks coming over to to help or maybe some assistance from the military at times but uh you can't really do your job as a as a secret agent to use that phrase\nIt with an entourage so ah the nature of the job and that and that time period was so you were a single time you were kind of like a a Lone Ranger you're out on your own\n[noise] he was held captive for what about Nineteen months before they finally kill him\nHe was kidnapped on march sixteenth Nineteen eighty four and um I was part of the hostage de briefing team where uh we were assigned to at the CIA to hunt for Bill Buckley specifically as well as the other hostages\nAnd uh we did not know bill had died um until father Martin Django came out to who was a wonderful man I spoke to him and ... and these button Germany after he had been held in captivity [noise]\nAnd and he told his bill had died and that bill had been tortured and bill was very sick\nAnd it was one of those moments George I'm In life where um we we knew that we had failed bill and it was like the weight of the world came upon us because um we had voted this entire operation to find him and we just couldn't find him so [noise]\nUh then it became a recovery mission you know let's try to find the body and go from there\nWill must have been like looking for a needle in a haystack for it [noise] oh\nMy goodness George I can't tell you how how difficult it was a time period um you know we had a we didn't have a lot of human assets on the ground then\nUm we we didn't have a lot of collateral intelligence of course the Israelis tried to help and and other intelligence services but um it it was it was very difficult it was trying to find a person in a building or in a very barracks um\nWe literally could not put him in a in a neighborhood a at times so are we just had these huge or intelligence gaps and it was extraordinarily frustrating [noise] uh I tell you one of the fascinating things at salmon I turned up in the story a George was\nA at one point or the FBI believed that uh through through their source network that bill had actually been flown to Tehran\nA and another time actually held inside the Iranian embassy in Beirut\nI'm which I'm that's you\nUh and another time actually held inside the Iranian embassy in Beirut while I'm which I'm\nNot you certainly a smoking gun or as to who is directly behind a you know the kidnapping\nAnd Sam ... let me ask you this back in Nineteen eighty eight columnist at the time ... wrote an article about ... William Buckley ... simply saying\nHe was tortured to death and he gave up secrets or you know and I'm not up to slap the man's name by any means but where do you think of your jak Anderson's column

settle um where people go at this point is a ... that's not going to happen\nIs way way too late of its wondering if you should ever had um [noise] you know the the second burrito I'm forty years after you've hit the fifteenth slice of pizza I I I think what's important to understand about the Arab Israeli conflict\nIs that the experts the of the state department diplomats\nAnd everyone has been using a formula\nThat I'm thinking of it all the the Israelis and the Palestinians\nCan be ... tend to go shade of peace like everyone else and they're missing what I Believe is a critical point and that is that the mathematical equation that they're working on is flawed\nAs the state of Israel was um all of creative the Israelis DNA dictates the Jews never again be forced to um to do anything at the point of a gun I'm through force\nAnd the Palestinians DNA because of the establishment of the state of Israel in Nineteen forty eight warrants demands that there'd be some sort of military victory some sort of [noise]\nUm he will Jima moments of raising the flag where they can say that their ... their opinion theory equals if they've achieved they've achieved parity\nAnd both both sides um in in how they approach the world and how they approach their very very small neighborhood\nUm are are bent I'm a ... are doomed to fail so perhaps what might be the wiser course of action for is the change of the mathematical equation and to try something different to try something where I'm different\nSorts of ... of landmarks in milestones can be reached in order to get to a place of coexistence and to this day that really hasn't been attempted\nBrian in Indianapolis Brian go ahead sir hey George morning hay bright\nPaint a man what a what a mess over there in the middle east and an end than it used to ride all the war is wrong or no did over there at ... rail and look at all the American blood it's been spilled over there over the decades and it just seems like nothing has changed but my my question is\nA must William Buckley they should have forgotten the history that nobody you know really remembers\nBut if he gave that secret and I don't know you know begin or not was there any trickle down collateral damage to the field options that she got the CIA that were out in the field or from the information that he might have given up\nAnd keep up the good work and I'll take my answer off the air you got to give you that question\nSure a good question Brian uh answer your question is\nYou got to give you that question [noise] sure a good question Brian uh answer your question\nIs uh uh at the time or the agency the CIA um could not take any more chances meaning a in essence they they removed all the personnel assigned to the station or got them out of a country a tap a they had to shut down or their source network a and\nAnticipate to the entire source chain that that had been compromised their\nUh they had to shut down faith houses are where are you meet with informants are in anticipation that perhaps bill or had disclosed that uh so uh you have that trickle down effect and there's also a damage assessment that comes into play here to\nWhere you start thinking about um you know the intelligence services exist to steal secrets and so here you have a uh the CIA the CIA point man and Lebanon that have access to everything\nOr what value is that to another intelligence service so if you're the intelligence service for example a Kenyan horse trader swap with a let's say a B Russian KGB at the time [noise] so those are the kinds of things that you have to anticipate and you look at it from a worst case scenario\nAnd you shut down everything so uh what was the operations compromise or a operations were are certainly shutdown stopped a until a complete damage assessment is done to see how bad things are\nAnd then you have to restart a year entire um human collection network a which is never easy\n[noise] Sam what's happening delivered on today what's the situation there\n[noise] uh well I'm ... ... is perhaps the most powerful political party in the country while I'm has ... has um stockpile the hundreds of thousands of rockets and missiles that aims that Israel has little fighters are getting on\nThe short on characteristic plea or a crucial combat experience and counter insurgency um capabilities fighting in Syria I'm In the uh the Lebanese fighters in\nIn in Syria have played a significant role in in off of being able to be outside regime being able to remain in power um Hezbollah

and present danger to the United states Israel in western interests throughout the middle east\nGerman why do they deal with the cartels are that are in a you know South America\n[noise] um yes there is a very large Shiite population in South America in Argentina in Columbia Venezuela I'm In a previous work that I did um ... we learned from the government of president ... in Venezuela um\nHad a um a a a shuttle service on the Venezuelan UM Airlines troubling to Damascus and I'm bringing in narcotics to Lebanon of course everybody along the way kind of cut and then from Lebanon B word dispersed\nThroughout um points throughout the um Europe in the middle East I'm one of the month the money from those cells were laundered I'm In West Africa um some of the money was smuggled as a result of stolen car rings in the United states [noise] um it is a global criminal enterprise unbelievable\nI I've always felt we should just legalize all drugs set up ... you know clinics to help people but legalized drugs don't put people in jail little stop people from robbing people because of the prices will plummet\nAnd it's one way you're getting these people who are making all the Germans drugs and distributed um what do you think\nWell a large ... a large portion of his ... budget comes from um illegal activities and I I think that's um you know when we think about that we

want to get your take on these ... situation of course and\nOf course the Saudi royals lied about the case or in the beginning a truly was killed that the consulate butchered ah yeah I guess because of what his uh his writings were about the royal family and about Saudi Arabia a but geez my gosh what's your take on that\n[noise] goodness Georgia I can never remember another incident like that on a\nDiplomatic a facility in the history of time uh now I'm sure the Russians have possibly ah ah disposed of somebody's via similar methods so we're just not aware of just knowing how the KGB operates or\nIn this arena but ah I just uh I cannot imagine how a this operation was put put together a to actually do this or inside a diplomatic facility or with all the eyes and ears that are on every diplomatic facility in the world\nAre you certainly could could have thought of a a a much better operation and and so a either it was done with the purposeful intent to resonate\nUh although it or how it appears that this just was a a a tremendous fiasco and uh I I certainly don't think we've seen the last of this now the curious part to George with this as\nA based on some of the research we've done here at strapped for a there appears to then a few other ah Saudi princes that have disappeared too so I'm\nJust ... since the royal prince basically took over\nA correct or and before a this incident uh and ... so\nUh this just might be part and parcel to ah Saudi a outreach and covert action a to a target and eliminate a dissidents or any enemies of a of the royal family but ah [noise] ah it's certainly an unprecedented a mess\nYou because when he came in with his daughter base when his father basically said hey you're going to be in charge here uh didn't he put a lot of royals away at the Ritz Carlton a in Riyadh and basically held them as hostage\nOr if he did and you know you get back to a you know the the CIA director uh is en route or just arrived there for meetings or\nA which is always very interesting because uh those meetings never happened in a vacuum or I Would not be surprised to see a some sort of a\nA effort behind the scenes to to try to make sense of what took place and and to move forward or you know that's the other interesting thing in these kinds of cases George you know behind the scenes a you know the intelligence services just go about their business\nAnd um they cause you know the the world doesn't shut down with threats with liaison work and uh and the curious part there is you know the Saudis ah for all their dysfunction and chaos ah there's still an intelligence provider\nAh that that gets funneled into the to the big intelligence community so uh it it certainly is a a fiasco though\nIt's like a partnership with a double isn't it\n[noise] well most relationships with governments are uh at times [laughter] uh I'm a fund sad to say and it's just the nature of the business uh you know some\nA rock along steadily without uh any hiccups like with our five eyes relationships um but you know those stone at times working smoothly as a as most people think\nAh because remember a you know there are no friendly intelligence services that's the one mantra that you learn and and basic age in school\nIs a there are no friendly intelligence services each nation state is going to operate and what they feel is in the best interests of their country\nAnd you're more cars Yogi apparently was the nephew of the late Saudi arms dealer Adnan ... uh there was so big you know there's been this power group within the royal family for years what what is he right that was so devastating that they want to kill him over\nWell that's the fascinating part I was talking to a couple of our ah Saudi analysts this morning here in the office and uh one of the analysts actually had a went in and watched him in a in a local speaking of at\nA this is an individual that are really wasn't that high profile ah and you probably could have lifted you know a dozen others that are more vocal against\nUs I mean he's more well known now dead and then he was alive\nWell exactly and you know was at one of these cases where uh you know you look at what the Russian what putting in the KGB did going into the u._k. and [noise] and taking out scribe Paul when ...\nYou know the poisoning a you know so uh you know due to these intelligence services the these are a nation state moves like this and say well heck why can't we do this too I I mean it might boiled down to being something as simple as that\nYeah it's crazy and Fifteen people and apparently they're going to war ... most of them which is interesting because of the big are they going to rat on the person who said get this done for me and I think we all do words leading a or are they going to keep quiet and hope that they get leniency and get out of prison and a year or two\nWell and you don't want to be in a Turkish prison that's that's the one

liked\nAbout it and talk on the radio about it\nDo you ever get any calls or gas that deal with some ... ...\n... oh we love talking about oh my God I never saw\nThem especially down to the Bahamas special around a place called hot tech a which is actually the Navy's area fifty one is actually in the Bahamas and the middle of the ... to try and go in fact a lot of us so reports down there we love talking about\nThem something's happening were sailor see these lights down there the bottom floor of the ocean and then all of a sudden this object just burst run out of the ocean and often goes it's amazing\nThe ocean is a good place to hide and you know if you were up to a you know who knows what a lot of secret weapons and so on but uh it's a big or the ocean is is it does there's been a lot of people who have thing that I think that maybe you oppose come from the ocean you know\nMaybe that's just one of the things that we can't possibly understand right now but a lot of people do see them\nSo why do you think people ... are so fascinated with the unusual in the paranormal hence you show my show I mean people love that stuff they can't get enough of an outcome\n[noise] um [noise] I think it makes our lives seem a little uh all that's all I never you know it makes them a little extraordinary\nThat these things happening around us all the time you know we just don't ... that that

right maybe we're in the one that ... yeah um but um [noise]\nI don't know I've always found it fascinating because you know you look it day to day life it just seems like there's a real pain to life and then all of a sudden you know somebody you know sees that goes to someone you know I've seen a UFO and and then like it's just that kind of unreal part of life that kind of touches you and I don't know I just find that fascinating\nYou think people have a need to be scared\n[noise] I think they I think a lot of people have a need to be baffled you know I Do you know and then you you hear about

not just some\nSlew of nature throwing a plasma ... or anything like that we want to believe that there's an afterlife and goes to the real thing\nWe really get disappointed when I you know the

the first people to think about that but we talk about it a lot\nBut it's it's an endless fascination with us with a lot of\nPeople well and you write about this important aspect not all these people are making things up or lying or mistaken in even if you have a hundred people\nIn Ninety nine of them are making up the stories that they see ghosts and your clothes and big foot you've got that one person who's not blind who has seen something very unusual in that that's what fuels me that's why I continue looking for these answers\nBecause that that one person is the reason that I go after these stories\nAll it takes is one ghost story to be true and they might be true\nIf I tell Linda ... who's a reporter back\nUh she's an expert in crops formations\nAnd are truly believes that most of the crop formations are made from other sources of the man and whatever those sources could be could be UFOs could be the earth's doing it as a vehicle to communicate with us whatever it is she thinks most of them are done that way\nAnd I I've told her I says Linda\nHe doesn't matter because even if all of them except one is the unusual one it's amazing stories it's the story of the lifetime\nCan
