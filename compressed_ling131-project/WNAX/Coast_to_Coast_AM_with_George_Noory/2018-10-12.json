two hundred and fifty miles from their launch site\nMike barrel author of dark mission the secret history of NASA with us Michael ... that was a tense situation but you know what we got to have our own rocketry here in the United states\nWe absolutely do to argument is this just shows how unreliable the Russian hardware really is I mean this is a an old so are you a spacecraft than and boosters they've been using for years they've they've had seven hundred and forty five flights\nThey had Twenty one failures that doesn't seem like much but it's three percent and you know you're flying up to the international space station at three percent fail you around your boosters is a is not acceptable because it I mean most of the time you do not recover the ... most of the time of year like this catastrophic\nOh absolutely absolutely you know I still wondering what are we doing on the eye assess the international space station what are they doing up there\nI think we're watching for aliens mostly I mean maybe that'll British TV show what would the U.S or where they had space intruder detectors said they called it up there I think it kind of our ... said I mean I don't I don't know what else they are doing they're not doing a whole heck of a lot of science and it\nSeems like we're at the point where either we should just build this thing out and expand it and turn it into Babylon five or something or we should just give up and let it crashed down to the markets with one of those two because we're at a turning point I think and are we going to go forward with an American manned space program or not it really past time for us to make that decision\nYou got money to buy things when they're down imagine if you could buy the best companies or the world like Amazon or apple or whatever or Coca Cola for eighty percent off or Ninety\nOff because they're gonna they're gonna comes at a hundred dollars\nYeah oh yeah that will come back and and now we also have demographic research that will tell people which parts of the world which types of companies will come back stronger or not so that's an extra advantage goal you know imagine if you could buy gold at four to seven hundred dollar known in next time it\nGoes to four thousand instead of two thousand so no that that's the real advantage when when they correct as much it happens quickly\nThese big corrections happen on and only two or three years and then you get to buy what what my previous book was called the sale of a lifetime that nothing nothing beats that the problem is most people lose all their money or their house goes down fifty percent of their stocks go down to the person and they don't have any net worth left to buy things when\nThey're on a trip that's right well what did the indicators I mean the market the last two days has really taken it on the chin what's the cause for that is that just panic or ... what's happening\nWell two things in and actually they both relate back to the good old Donald\nHum last week you saw 'em treasury bond you know the yields on on the risk free ten and thirty year bonds\nShoot up I'm rather dramatically and we were predicting this what happened we said look if a thirty year treasury bond breaks up above through three point two percent it's probably going to go to a four point ... percent in in less than a year and that's going to raise mortgage rates and that hurts stocks because now bonds are more attractive and\nStock values are based on\nValues and higher or lower it so\nYou know that that was the first thing that but the second thing is is you know concerns over China I mean is this trade war yes it may be a good thing to do in China may be cheating in a lot of ways by\nChina's been the fastest growing economy in the world it's already stalling and slowing and now it's slowing more in the markets are concerned oh my gosh\nIf China keeps slowing here that's going to trigger a worldwide a down turn and crash and so so it was rising interest rates\nAnd um and then and more you know concerns about China it's market just broke a key point we've been talking about\nFor the last month at twenty six forty\nI'm you know that doesn't sound like much but it was fifty five hundred not you know a few years ago it crashed forty five percent of three months and then I had this kind of limp rally for years and it's been waiting to go back and we said look it breaks twenty six forty\nThat that's a sign that China is starting to go down again and it and it did that and the last two days to twenty five eighty right now so that's another sign that there's something wrong and then again that was the biggest concern a lot of people keep thinking oh it's just more interest rates no the interest rates was the first whack\nThat these last three days had a lot more to do with China and Trump\nIs really pushing this trade war and it is dangerous even though it may be a good policy and a lot of ways and Trump has been to sing the economy with tax cuts and all that sort of stimulus and stuff and that causes inflation to go up which it has and it causes\nGrows to go up temporarily and what does the Federal Reserve going to do they're going to raise interest rates that's what they do it the economy's overheating they raise interest rates\nIf it's slowing the lower interest rates would say now they've done for nine years which is ridiculous\nAnd and and now Trump screaming oh my gosh you know I've created this great thing and the trumps wrecking it no this was predictable he's not\nYou know he's got some you know gut feelings we got to do this and that he's not savvy at all when it comes to the consequences of things in the economic impacts he basically is probably the prime reason for this\nUm pulled back no it hasn't gotten dangerous yet but it came right to that um yesterday's\nClose what happened here ... we had a couple more days of downturns tomorrow we have another five hundred point drop I mean then people started saying there's something wrong here\n[noise] yes yes we were just at that point we we have to remember we had a we had a crush on like this at the beginning of the year ... markets peaked in in late January real kind of like blow off top classic thing and then that that was looking like it could have been a tough\nWe have a correction a sharp correction just like this it was down about ten to twelve percent different markets but then it stopped\nAnd and and it stopped right about here you know where we are now and then it kinda like went sideways and then it came back up that's the trick George I've learned from when when you got above all of this magnitude\nOf what happens when it does finally burst in and that's when the smart money finally says okay there's things over and they start selling ensuring the market you happen to very quickly\nYou'll see you know I've seen this the last seven stock bubbles throughout the history of everything from the Nikkei and the early nineties and the Nineteen twenty nine to thirty to crash and then every other one in the last century including the tech correct in recent bubbles\nThat first crash will be forty two percent on average in the first two and a half\nMonths where people get whacked\nAnd that's the sign that that's the only way you know the the bubble has finally birth the problem is by the time that comes people already in trouble and they're panicking and they get whacked card so that the danger sign as if we keep going down and and and literally I the markets do look like they're going to open up tomorrow but that'd be that's just the balance after\nYou know fourteen hundred points I may open up two to three hundred points tomorrow that's nothing so far but it is bouncing off a critical level we've been warning our subscribers Seventeen hundred on the S. and P. five hundred and twenty five thousand on the ballot\nIf the market breaks that that's the first sign that something's wrong and yes the markets and the traders are going to take that as a bad sign and you'll see another steep so up and then the odds keep going up\nThat this is a top and it it is a is a top we've got not\nFifty fifty four percent like glass crashes can be more like Seventy\nEighty percent or more over a few years and and again the first half of that crash will happen in the first two to three months typically and that's what make bubbles so dangerous [noise]\nUm [noise] uh you know the Rothschild guy Baron Ross child wants to know when somebody asks what what was the secret his wealth in the Eighteen hundreds I think he was the wealthiest man of the world he said you know I always sold a bit early because that was Bob ... this was above all this isn't a normal bull market\nCorrection and nice staircase manner and goes down bubbles go up dramatically and they crash and and a half the time and they crashed twice a is dramatically so so that's why I warn people so hard on this\nThis is a once in a lifetime of vent and it it the signs to me are building we'd been telling people man this looks like a top here and if it doesn't and top here we only get\nThe good part as we can gauge it said we only get a normal ten Fifteen Percent or so correction by the end of the year then we're probably good for one more route one more Trump rally end of next year before this thing blows but the\nRight now though the odds are shifting towards a it's already happening so people should be on alert\nThe two thousand seven two thousand they subprime mortgage crisis will this be as bad as that time period\n[noise] what will this is worse because what's happened is that we did and we of course we were warning about that George ... decades in advance on demographics the baby boom peaking\nAnd in in and causing a down turn off the greatest boom in history but but also the subprime crisis was the trigger and we also had record debt levels I mean I'm Around the world but especially in developed countries won't what happened after the two thousand eight nine crash is we had a big debt bumbling emerging countries\nAnd then of course China's been off the charts for now for Thirty years and then their dad has grown sixty four times just since two thousand just in the last Seventeen Eighteen years so\nLow interest rates in the quantitative easing policies of central banks around the world made borrowing easy for emerging countries hate developed countries too but we were already too much in debt so we just kinda like went sideways and didn't deliver joined it emerging countries want on this free and they added sixty to Seventy trillion more\nOn top of two hundred and thirty trillion and now we're at three hundred trillion in debt and financial asset bubbles around the world and and those are cracking you see turkey blowing up the seat Venezuela with hyper inflation of runs in trouble [noise]\nChina is slowing and and I like I said they have the biggest debt bubble of anybody in any time in history when China blows that weird we're going to be worth ... so my\nView is no this is going to be worse than the two thousand\nTwo thousand nine recession and stock crash because they stop with massive money printing they just literally stop if they just the backup with money that was draining this time more debt\nEverything's more stretched the emerging world is now in debt and they always go down harder than we do and they always have wars\nDebt bubble crashes and stuff than we do so this is going to be worse so instead of like I said earlier instead of a\nFifty four percent crash looked for Seventy to eighty\n... absolutely huge and that doesn't mean the companies are doing bad here we stay with us we'll talk about that when we come back carry us down for the website is his name Harry Dent D. E. N. T. dot com couple of his books include the Democrat demographic cliff the sale of a lifetime and zero out one\nCoast insiders the new version of the coast to coast am map is now available dry bone and know Android poured out on a boat [noise] listen libre on demand anywhere any time\n[noise]\n[noise]\nThen we'll come back to ... with the cherry so if we have quality companies that have solid earnings they've got money in the bank their stocks could still get hit when everybody else gets hit and they go down but it doesn't mean that company is going to go out of business right\n[noise] right again well any time you get a major downturn recession or stock crap like that some companies will get under pressure and they will go under or have to go through chapter eleven bankruptcy or restructure and that's a good thing recessions are necessary the Federal Reserve and government the recessions as bad things\nThey're good things um\nBut and then you want to buy the company that survive you know we had the dot com crash that was a super bubble I mean the tech bubble took five years to build but the dot com crash came in the last year and a half up six to seven times\nKind of like the bitcoin bubble here recently cracked and a lot of companies were not as well which what were the survivors will companies like apple and Amazon if you had a part Amazon there oh my God I was\nYou know like a you know a hundred and fifty dollars it now it's like you know gotten up to the sixteen hundreds or something like that so that's the time to buy the best companies\nWhen you want to look at who are the strongest companies okay those are the ones that are actually get the most overvalued in a bubble like this but they're also\nGo down I mean General Motors in the Nineteen twenty nine to thirty to crash went down Ninety three percent that ended up being that was it ended up being the greatest company in the world for decades after that you could have bought it for nothing so\nThat's the secret and and the other thing is even at the earnings of companies if companies are so good that they keep their earnings flap instead of declining evaluations on stock how many times earnings like people pay thirty times earnings for the typical stock right now or forty and and sixty or eighty for the best tax talk\nDoes collapse just because investors get fearful and so a stock and go down fifty percent even if its earnings don't declined and then of course most companies' earnings do decline so that's how they end up down eighty percent\nHere you say you have a secret indicator for looking at some of the dangers what is that\n[noise] yeah yeah you know it it's called the smart money\nYou know if you tell us it's not a secret anymore I Know I Know but that\nBelieve me Wall Street won't do this any way so you don't have to worry but\nBut what what happened that there are the smart money or the people who who kind of push ups stop and and and then when things go down there that wants to jump in and buy when when when they see the old investors have voted for Bachmann stocks or about they're the ones that short for his\nI mean they're in the know and and and they can even watch what all of us are doing their the sharks they eat all of us minnows that's how they make money they're they're the best traders and stuff\nThey you can measure\nThis action what there's an index from Bloomberg called the smart money flow index\nAnd what they do is that dumb money ... acts in the morning the first thirty minutes\nI mean because the biggest moves in the market come overnight again the smart money that traders have already made their positions in the futures market there ahead of everything and so the market's gonna open down it opens down right\nAt the open or it opens up if it's going to jump most of the moves there may well that's when the dumb money and most people would stop just something to protect themselves that's one of those reactions made that for the money\nThe smart money watches the market during the day they can even running and jumping tested a little bit shorter do this\nThey make their positions and the last half hour end of the clothes so they measure this indicator measures but the smart money is doing versus a dumb money and the smart money\nHas not bought this rally in fact they've been shorting it they've been betting against this rally ever since that bottom February this year after that crap now they bought into the last rally they bought into\nThe Trump rally they bought into the to January top early this year but one sec crash happened they have not bought him this rally and it's been one of the steep is declines and smart money buying and that has been a strong warning signal to me in in recent months into our subscribers\nAre you in Puerto Rico no\nTime in Puerto Rico and I went to hurricane worse than Michael I had to hold my windows from blowing out my condo where it was so bad it was unbelievable 'cause the difference between Maria here\nAnd Michael both of them similar force but this storm hung over us for twelve to fourteen hours and Michael at least pass through so I Know what these people are going through it is unbelievable\nUh to watch everything I mean windows blowing up all around me you know you walk out the next morning and the all the leaves are off trees and you know everything you know blown over and stop it it's just unbelievable it's it's like can you know God got angry or something you know into through a temper tantrum she'd moved there\nWell I moved there because I had a vacation home I've been working on for years and co labor which is one of the Virgin Islands but it's in Puerto Rico people don't know that Puerto Rico has the ... and ... to islands that are like St Thomas and St Croix or St John\nAnd and you know no passport to come there is a U.S territory so I was building a house there in in I was in Tampa we'd been care taking my wife's family\nFor many many years had to move from Miami we're about to move back to Miami but I'm we're down here working on this place\nSpending more time in San Juan which has gotten much better in the last decade than it was when I first started coming in I said to my why don't we move here we're in a condo that's a quarter of the price of beach front top quality kind of\nA quarter the price of South Beach Miami where we're used to live and and we're now I go around the corner from my condo to the small local airport which I get to twenty minutes in advance they don't even check your id they just wait to see how you're going to tilt\nBelow al I'm not sure I liked that part\nWas it's fun to play it it's a thirty minute low altitude plane flight it scenic I'm ... I leave my condo doing and landing on this island in one hour and once I got down here I realized I could qualify for some tax advantages here\nWhich are very compelling I mean anybody that trade stocks or or investments for a living and the crypto guys are coming down here because of that\nAnd businesses that can qualify there's real strong packs advantage so I'm living much cheaper than a man of great climate I can still fly to New York\nIn four hours director Miami and two hours and in almost anywhere in the east coast is now it's difficult to um coming out your way but I have to go out to California which I just did it for so long that that the long haul now but I tell ya I I like it down here they been in a recession there's no civil unrest a recession for twelve years\nWe're about to have a civil war between blue and red factions and we got three point seven percent unemployment they got twelve to Fifteen Percent here and I don't see any civil unrest so I feel good down here for now\nAnd then I'm just going to see what happens in the next uh so many years\nThe big banks down there\n[noise] yeah yeah yeah about in in ... down here and actually a lot of the banks are buying banker popular and Santander are Spanish Banks because this is by origin more of a Spanish\nCountry but you know and we've got most of the big box stores and nice malls and stuff but they there are ... George my biggest problem with a lot of people on the on Amazon and the Internet don't realize that you can ship here on the U.S postal service so people either\nJust because they think we're in Zimbabwe or they charge some huge acts and there's a lot of things a little things I used to get on the Internet free I Can't find here that's my biggest frustration I Can't find my radios special pasta sauce and things like yeah but otherwise\nMan this is a good deal and you know I'm Down here for other reasons but I tell you people ought to be Americans ought to be consider retiring here housing in general is sixty percent lower education for for people's ah kids it's sixty percent lower um\nI Believe they vote in our elections I don't know how many Americans really understand that that they are allowed to vote in our election\nBut will most important they are allowed to freely move for immigrate they don't have to even apply and in most Puerto Rico a lot of young people they get a a an inexpensive good education here the education system here is good\nThen they moved to the U.S where they can make twice as much and have much better job opportunities and then when they get older and have kids guess what they do a lot of Puerto Ricans will move back to Puerto Rico to put their kids to colleges or dental school or medical school here and save a ton of money and then\nSometimes a lot of times I'll just stay and retire here but but also a lot of older Puerto Ricans now are moving\nTo the United states why sixty two percent of all Puerto Ricans are in the U.S and most of them now are moving to Florida\nAnd so these these older people realize their kids and or their grandkids are in the U.S and they ended up moving to the U.S so the U.S is getting highly educated good immigrants from Puerto Rico in Puerto Rico keeps losing people match why\nThey have these tax programs the IRS decides and the government decides the U.S is better to help create good jobs down here the tax advantages rather than just out now subsidized Puerto Rico because\nThe U.S has always always rubbing their best people and again it it's they're more professional educated people that are leaving not the not the everyday people so it's actually a good deal for the U.S\n[noise] so I Want you to you is your best impressions on what you think will happen economically over

S. like there is in Puerto Rico now and that is one difference\nThese Puerto Ricans are not\nUm don't have that sort of tension and that polarity that's the one thing I can tell you because I'm sitting here and I haven't even seen a bar fight there the last any crime where where I Am\nHere is the fact that the Hispanics in most African Americans you wrote in a democratic\nBig deal ... ... ... what was his point\nHe well he's saying that that you know the the rich people don't like that these are people who are going to vote blue and we got this blue red or so when they see Puerto Ricans he's saying come to Rochester well we don't like him and he said they're not as high skilled while I'm telling you in Orlando they're not saying that they're they are basically\nA reinvigorated Orlando there's four ... four hundred and fifty thousand Puerto Ricans now in just Orlando and a million\nIn Florida and those million which which he is right about or tilting the boat all all the key Senate races up and guess who they're appealing to those Puerto Ricans the Republican and the Democrats Rick Scott and Bill Nelson running for Senate in their boat courting the Puerto Ricans because they're five percent of the vote and that's enough to swing an election\nAnd they do and using that won him a crowded isn't that what our democracy ... yes\nIt is it is\nLet's go to Greg in New Jersey taken away Gregory\nRight yes my question Georgia and good morning I'm just like to say I live in a congressional district in northern New Jersey\nWe get thirty percent of our federal tax dollars back the ... states subsidized they're red states and the state to receive the most was Kentucky where the idiot McConnell with the stresses me nuts and it's been like this for fifty years we subsidize the south in the southwest the northeast us until the mid west\n... for your guest I've been reading Financial Times for many years and what you're saying this was a column every week scaring the heck out of all of us with with what you're saying [noise]\nOld will be closer to home I'm about four years from retirement if only thirty five years for almost forty years far entity which was nationwide but some through New York\nOr pension was over funded in the late nineties it took a horrendous hit with the ... the tech stocks and then in two thousand they almost ... why don't we have a meeting with thousands of it's about to retire right goal high tech guys and gals the whole thing\nWe have a meeting in about three weeks another entity can I don't trust any of that but you know Wall Street I think there should be a ... team up there if you will again and I'm ... and rose bushes should come down from heaven and come back\nBut the thing is what do we ask our financial people who are running our pension fund with their fancy suits what are they doing to anticipate this problem and I'll take your answer off the air\nYou know real quick they these two ... not only the stock market starts collapsing everybody's been driven end of the stock market because quantitative easing monetary policy's push down long term rates that you can get on safer investments like treasury bonds and corporate bonds and things like that which pension plan should be more end but\nBut you can't get your seven to eight percent returns they used to get with a conservative combination of stocks and bonds so everybody's gone more stocks and in stocks start collapsing\nThan they are in trouble the truth is as much as it's counterintuitive pension plan today the best thing you can do what we're telling people right now this this break up and ... is going to make bonds\nA corporate bonds and treasury bonds long term more attractive if that thirty year treasury bond goes up to four point three percent we're telling our subscribers this is likely to happen in the next several months and the next year at the most\nYou're going to want to lock those and not only to get a four point three percent return is way better than almost any stock dividend but those bonds will appreciate\nWhen stocks collapse and the economy slows down and interest rates go down bonds like falling interest rates are right now is not the time to buy these bonds but there's going to be a huge opportunity for investors\nAnd pension funds to locked in quality bonds it's only the quality bonds that did well in the great depression triple a corporate [noise]\nTen and thirty year treasury bond lock in those things for appreciation and for higher yields and don't be in stock the worst place to be for pension plan is to do with everybody that run into stocks and collapse and you also write about blue states subsidizing read\nThat's why I think this time around it's going to be the blue states that succeed against red policies that they don't agree with but most of all they're like okay see what happens to your red economy when New York and California or when the northeast and the west coast succeed from the union and they'd be would it would be a problem\nLet's go to Thomas in California he Tom go ahead\nHey George thank you for taking my call sir Harry your research is really appreciated um [noise] I mean you know\nYou brought up earlier that a corollary to depressions and major recessions his war and\nYou could argue that the world today than\nA third world war that's a proxy war\nYou know in places like Syria Yemen the south China Sea et cetera and when global corporations cannot compromise their differences in the global boardrooms\nThere's a shooting war just like World War one world war two Korea Vietnam and on and on\nSo don't you think I mean a limited nuclear exchange could turn the United states into a third world country in\nA day or two you know with a lecture magnetic poles cetera what is the probability of a shooting more [noise] you know I\nThink that's much more likely between emerging countries like India and Pakistan [noise] um but but what we're seeing in zero hour we we trade global trade back to the Eighteen hundreds and there was a big surge in World War one people don't realize globalization global trade collapse sixty per se\nBetween World War one\nAnd World War two and ... the great depression and mental with a big trade war with rising tariffs just like we're seeing now everything's happening\nLike happening this works ... it's it everybody does the selfish thing as a country but it works against the old everybody loses or at least most countries loose and and that's what's happening now this trade war with China whether ends up a shooting war or limited like you say in the south China Sea they can definitely be stopped there there's no question\nThere's problems they're Middle East I don't see a major war between like say the United states or Europe and Russia there could be limited because\nNobody is big enough to challenge just the one advantage we have\nIt is there's there is no counter bailing our that could really take us on one on one somebody hit us they would be a long before we watch so I think that kind of a good thing or in in the early Nineteen hundreds midnight you know there were major countervailing\nPower that's how you can have one or two we're going to definitely have\nA political huge political jeez this trade war we said it's zero hour before this became obvious this is going to last two to three decades exactly what Jack Ma just said and maybe there could be some physical or but there's certainly\nGoing to be a huge political and trade wars and\nThings like rain

amazing information you're always give us\nThe richer people George people need to hear this\nJason in Portland, Oregon welcome to the program Jason go ahead\nYeah Harry I Want to ask you about a particular sector of the market at the new secretary has to do with the Dutch and I happen to get in mid July just before the huge and in the canopy ... but the beverage company\nWhich apple it'd be pretty good timing and I took a portfolio and actually doubled in value but I'm about fifty thousand up two hundred thousand portfolio\nBut my question is what you want this kind of be bought for a little bit particularly and kill the uh election this November because\nThere are several states that are looking cue that have it on the ballot and if they legalize usually when that happens there is a kind of an upswing or would you pull out of that now because of this danger of what you're talking about taking place\nOr you know yeah that's a good question because I mean first of all this is a long term trend and even block chain and crypto currency is our but\nAll of these industries above all these these are hot sector like this will get hit strongly when we have a downturn because first of all everything gets hit\nBut that that the strongest sectors getting hit the most 'cause they bubble up the most and people don't understand that same with high in real estate is the best places are going to crash the most and history has shown that so [noise]\nYou know I mean I I Would say in this case you may want to hold on just for the election of the there's a ... but yeah I Do think censure and such a hot sector take your games see what happens the next few years especially the next year is going to be critical and then yeah if things crash that is a good sector to get\nLong term social political trend it's gonna go in that direction\nAlthough there may be some backlash and the downturn just because people get a little more conservative for a while but but you are in a good actor but yes I I don't want to be an actor when when things crash and and and that's what a lot of people miss a lot of people say well this sector all do All right because\nI went and the great depression than tire thirties and look for one any major sector toilet paper\nUm utilities movies you know ... you know things that people would maybe use more than a downturn\nAnd and because of that collapse and valuations in that fear factor everything went down I couldn't find anything any major stock sector that made money in the Nineteen thirties only the high quality bonds that so yeah take your games\nYeah again in your case I might just see these elections pop and then and then go the other way or do fifty fifty you know it it's up to you but there is danger there you're right about that\nPeriod when the when the bottom falls out of you know what should the blond oh you're how do you know when the boss back in\nWhat will again I mean we have clear we look at past corrections I mean everything is different this is not like you know the eighty two thousand eight to nine correct and it's not like the seventies corrections stock corrections back then were fifty percent\nThat's more typical this is more like these great resets\n... de leveraging of a bubble debt and financial assets which of course stock is are the leading ones when that happens Seventy percent as kind of the minimum you look for in up to eighty and in in the Nineteen twenty nine crashed eighty nine percent for the Dow\nEighty nine percent so I'm looking for levels like that I think my range\nIs Seventy five percent minimum up to eighty five percent that's when you start\nLooking to buy and again we have the same thing on the flip side for bonds right now if that thirty year treasury bond which has been a three point four percent recently\nThat gets up to over four percent between four and four point three percent that's when I started by even though that's the best thing in the downturn it's too early to buy that right now if you're going to park you might just be unsafe short term bonds or in CDs and T bills and stopped to preserve your money\nNext step is moving the long term quality bonds and then\nAnd and and the sectors I mean commodities while in emerging markets overseas will probably bottom first\nAnd then developed countries stocks and then real estate so there'll be a succession of buying opportunities so I mean and stuff like that you're in a good market like like like like marijuana and pot industry especially the medicinal side which is a\nSlam dunk winter long term [noise] wait for the ... you may get to buy into that a little earlier\nThan something like you know home builders\nNext on that one has to do good Kentucky first time caller for civil Whelan\nHey George a lot of the show you Sacramento correct me if I'm wrong here but red states are Republican yup OK blue states are Democrats were Democrats\nA mission that they do not siren or did I miss I understand you've made you said the south was ran during the civil war\nYes they they would have been they would have been more even though you know they called Lincoln a Republican back then the Republican Party was not the same I Know my father help build the Republican Party in the south and help get Nixon elected through southern voters\nAnd that's a whole different party he had to convince a lot of democratic politicians in senators that they were really Republican they were Democrats traditionally all the way back to the civil war so the Republican democratic label actually was the opposite back then no you're right I mean read\nIs Republican blue is Democrat in the present time frame and then the Republicans in charge now if you do see a major downturn I Am just have to tell you from history it is going to favor\nThe Democratic party just like it did in the thirties where you had Republicans who were coming into that when things crash they go to the people that are going to hand out money to the people there that you know the Democratic go to the Democrats\nIn a downturn in a book in a bull market and the rich are getting richer and a lot of innovation that favors the Republicans we are\nOur long term research shows we are going to switch from Republican era here to democratic one for a number of decades and that's just something you know the blue people are gonna like that the rich people long but all I Do is report the facts I'm I'm not\nPart a son and my work Republicans are always going to be or Democrats or it's a play of opposites that's just as important as men and women and booms and busts and inflation and deflation and every other play of opposite\nAnd it goes back and forth the same thing the west has dominated the world uh since since the industrial revolution well guess who's going to dominate in the coming decades and even century it's going to be the east and that's another trend and we can clearly show to cycle so so what we do\nIs just show people here's the trends this sector that sector inflation deflation\nThis country that country blue red I mean we can do all this stuff the long term it's surprisingly predictable\nAnd that's where Congress get it wrong comments think the short term predictable I'm guessing when I tell you I think this thing's going to top no or so many months from now on making an educated guess that may make me sixty to Seventy percent right but never a hundred when I told told people Twenty years ago baby boomers going to peak in two thousand seven\nIn the

I was just thinking about you right that's very common um and I think everyone has the ability\nIf they're interested to nurture their intuition or their ESP or the tell a path a fence but a lot of people aren't interested in it as I said when\nFresh them off I didn't think too much of them [noise] it was really only after I got sick that I start to think that maybe there was more to it than meets the eye\nWith with the psyche grown out there in the ability to tap into it have you found that certain people are better at it than others\n[noise] yes definitely [noise] um well I think the most important thing is whether the person is interested in it and whether or not they are paying attention to that but the other thing I've noticed is that the second ability often runs in families [noise] um\nYeah that's true someone who say they'll say oh my mother or my grandmother had that ability\nIt seems to come more from the female side doesn't\nThat's right that's right yeah [noise] I in fact I had a great great aunt that an experience where she fell asleep in the world cup and she said her brother had died he was living in another country and certainly afterwards\nShe found out yet to bet he died while yet but I mean it does happen to men as well and I suspect that men don't talk about it as much as women do [noise]\nBut you know people talk about a woman's intuition so it does seem to have that connotation that it's more common and women and I think that's partly to plus the fact that women are more likely they talk about it than men are\nDo you think Dr these psychic experiences are from the brain or outside of the brain\n[noise] I Would say both I Would say that they had sort of cooperation between what's going on on different levels are different dimensions and these experiences a protest in the brain\nSo for example if you take the example of an out of body experience which I have had myself and it was just completely spontaneous and I was quite young\nI had one eleven I've never been able to duplicate it again but it was one of the strangest\nWonderful little sex I've ever had I mean there I was bouncing on the ceiling may looking at my body and bad I had stayed home from school I never miss school but I had a fever that day and I didn't go to my mother said that George you don't go stay in bed\nAnd I took a nap and I woke up again and this time I was looking down at myself I thought it was a dream Manny right at the at that point it's lamb ... back into my body\nI woke up part was jarred um eleven years old I don't know what the heck happened to me yeah but eventually I got my way into a library you know weeks later\nShe stumbled into the psyche grown section I guess and found a book on astral projection and sure enough I said that's what happened to me but I've not been able to do it since at least in my awake moments\nWell in my case also with the ... it was completely spontaneous I wasn't trying to do it I didn't know anything about it um I just like you I just found myself voting on the ceiling looking down at my body and then\nYou know there there are ways to produce and out of body experience how there was a neurologist in Montreal Dr ... who is able to his mapping out the different areas of the brain and he if he put it on to co stimulation on the right tempo cortex he's able to produce and out of body experience [noise]\nThat that doesn't tell me the out of body experience originates in the band that tells me that the that ... will protests yet of body experience [noise]\nUm and you know the types of out of out of body fences we had was quite straightforward\nUm they were in complicated but some people as you say it can be called astral projection around ... novel people can leave not just their their body but they can leave the room they can leave their house you know they can actually traveled to different locations\nAnd absolutely now do you find that to the people who tend to have these kinds of experiences are believers in the paranormal or not\n[noise] I'd say no not not not initially because when this happened to me I certainly wasn't a belief or I didn't even know such a thing as possible and I've just kind of learned about the paranormal as I go along and as I have these experiences\nUm another strange experience I had when I was a student um when I was Nineteen years old that and how it's affecting your medical student I had done the last ... examined the night before the exam and when I went to the exam the next day the first question on the exam at the same as the first question in my dreams\nSauce you have the answer to that you knew\nExactly so I felt like that dream helped me past my exam but I didn't tell anyone about it because it seems so unbelievable in fact if someone had told me that story I probably wouldn't have a belief that\nThe name of the book is called the borders of normal with the subtitle clinical psychiatrist you by the way de stigmatize just paranormal phenomenon told me about the book\n[noise] well one of the reasons I wrote this book is you know as I say in the subtitle I'm trying to de stigmatize paranormal phenomena\nBecause what I found and this is my own experience as well when people have these experiences they tend not to talk about them because they think people think they're weird or their strange for there's something wrong with him or they're losing their mind is something like that [noise]\nI'm trying to say that a lot of people have these experiences it's quite normal to have these experiences\nI mentioned that the word parent or a month for example the ... parent means beside so we have paralegals working beside lawyers have paramedics Paralympics and so on so parent normal means beside normal it does mean have normal\nAnd there is still to this day a lot of stigma attached to talking about these phenomena and I find when I give her reading or if I give a talk somewhere people come up to me afterwards and share with me things that have happened to them which they've never told anyone [laughter]\nSo I'm trying to make it more acceptable for people to talk about these things and I was really what motivated me to read the book\nYou ever come across research from a psychiatrist who has died named Dr shift ... curricula\nNo I'm not familiar with him who she or her\nHer in a it was my aunt and she was she went to a Oxford University and she got her degree in psychiatry yeah and specialized in all kinds of things and then decided she was giving all that up to study telepathy\nAnd when that's all she did she wrote a couple of books was called breakthrough the creativity of but she was convinced totally convinced\nThat the ... the was the real deal and uh and again the psychiatrist seen that in so you're the only only other psychiatrists I Know that has really jumped into this\n[noise] I don't know I'd like to look for that book ... that sounds very interesting I'm\nBreakthrough to creativity I'm\nDefinitely look for it but you know they're being on books written by physicians but near death experiences for example even Alexander vote who for having me up and he's a neurosurgeon and marry the Neil ...\nI haven't been back you know it'd be the surgeon and of course Oliver Sacks he's in Iraq just he wrote a book out of the nation [noise] he'll conditions have written about things but I haven't found another psychiatrist who who's written about Aaron\nYeah you're going to enjoy that so I mean she she just did the devoted her entire career to that uh she uh she passed away and very bizarre way she was in the bath tub in radio\nFell than there oh no I Hope to God I wasn't listening to my show no that's terrible it was just so ... how did he get interested in ...\nShe just always was and there were some things that had happened to her and she just decided there's something to this and she's going to study it and she she went into it in a big way\nBut I Know there's been some studies done on telepathy at my monitor these medical center in New York\nWhere they were getting into like the the\nThe ability to transmit information to people who are dreaming and in that study they had Sanders and receivers\nAnd maybe the rates were in a sleep lab and they were hooked up to any teeth I'm the AG could measure what we call him sleep rapid eye movement and then when the ... state the Centers for giving random images\nAnd they were told to concentrate on the images I Try to send them anything and they found that people were more susceptible to lead to let the when they're asleep\nAnd it's also true that people are more susceptible to the when they were under hypnosis [noise] so there are ways to augment telepathy but in my case and in most people's cases it just happens spontaneously\nDo you have a lot of patients that have these abilities\n[noise] no I wouldn't have to fill\nAll right stay with us Dr we're going to take a quick break we'll be back with the ... more Dr many major is with us his book the borders of normal\n\nAnd\nWelcome back with Dr many major U.S we're talking about his work the borders of normal a clinical psychiatrist de stigmatize is paranormal phenomenon many let's talk a little bit about to death bed visions and your thoughts about that though you believe they're extremely common don't you\n[noise] that's right a lot of studies have shown that it it's very common for someone who is dying to see a deceased friend or relative um that actually happened with my dad when he was in the hospital he saw his late sister he mentioned oh they don't tell you mentioned her name she was out in the hall\nAnd there was one study that was done in a hospital with dying patients and they found a lot of these patients I'm Helen was coming to take them and they called they didn't call them visions they called them visitors\nAnd as they got closer to death is visitors became more frequent and these visitors are these vision print disturbing at all they were very comforting\n[noise] so\nYeah I think those those deaths that vision to very common now one interesting thing about death that vision says that sometimes\nThere are shared by people at the bedside there was one case of a woman in India who is dying and she says someone a ... who came to take her to the other side and every three sisters who are at the bedside also saw the same person\nJeeze that's that's unusual though isn't it\nIt's unusual but there's been several cases like that or even in some cases where the medical personnel at the at the same vision that the dying patients on\n[noise] and that's interesting because\nYou know people who have death that vision the skeptics would say well that's because they're on medication or because they're confused or because they have a shortage of oxygen the lack of oxygen to the brain they tried to get some kind of physical explanation part\nBut the divisions are shared than those explanations wouldn't be valid because the people at the bedside wouldn't have a shortage of option to their brain and they weren't on medication so [noise]\nUm it's hard to know how to explain that and there again people out of these visions aren't necessarily believers in the afterlife but these experiences are quite common [noise]\nSteve and Steve Jobs from apple computer died many show that he was quoted as saying oh wow oh wow now what do you think he he was\nMaking reference to\n[noise] well I Know some\nPeople who are dying tell their relatives they see a beautiful landscape beautiful vision you know\nI'm a bright white light you know kind of spiritual beings you know I'm a feeling of unconditional love no these are some of the things that I imagine that Steve Jobs was experiencing\nYeah that could be that could be no skeptics course say what the you mentioned that you know it's the body itself is doing all these weird things near the ... how can we argue against that\n[noise] well there was one study of um\nCardiac patients who had been assassinated after cardiac arrest\nAnd this study was done by a cardiologist and he said of of the patients who died and where we start to pay to Eighteen percent of them had a new report in the near death experience\nBut it's that experience is due to a lack of oxygen to the brain than they would have all had it because they all have a lack of oxygen the brain not just a ... a small percentage [noise]\nSo you know that's one thing but then the other thing is that um these experiences are reported around the world not just in the U.S there's a lot of cross cultural studies that show that these experiences are in many different countries them they'd be being reported throughout time\nAnd one study looked at patients who are on medication versus patients who weren't on medication and the patients who weren't on medication who weren't confused and he didn't have a shortage of auction to the brain had the same experiences that mobile to report them just as often as the other patients so [noise]\nUm [noise] people are skeptical I think for a good reason and I think it's good to be skeptical [noise]\nBut it's also good to keep an open mind\nWell that's that's true and you you've talked about under deathbed the vision that they sometimes see a little bit more than just a family member they see other kinds of visitors is well explain that\n[noise] well\nThe other visitors aside from family members they could be someone that they were very close to or sometimes they report angels coming to the others I'm coming to take them to the other side\nUm especially with children and there was a pediatrician males and Martha Stewart just dying children and he said the dying children didn't report\nDeceased relatives because their parents and their relatives and friends are all still living but they've reported seeing angels that we're having to take them to the other side [noise] I had an experience at my father's funeral where I thought to angel is one of the other side of the costs and\nAnybody else either\nNo so I could say I know they were a product of my own brain no one else saw them but in my own mind I saw those angels\nAnd they were just as clear as day standing right in front of me and I had the idea that thought came into my mind that they were called minutes during angels and they had the idea that they were men is doing to my father to help them make the transition it's the next level of the next world\nAnd they made the most beautiful creatures and I didn't know what to make that but that's the only when I decided I Need to start telling people about what's going on because that was too much for me to keep to myself\nThey see you\nI don't think so I don't think they were there for me I think they were there for my father\nRight so they didn't acknowledge you know you know you saw them\n... ... [noise] now the other thing is when you say in terms of deathbed visions [noise] you know um if they were produced by certain chemicals\nThen why would the um visitors only ... the people who are deceased why wouldn't they be other people as well\nThe other thing is sometimes these visions of these people\nThey are the person is dying that's no there may be a a brother or sister who had died is the case where there was a car crash and one brother died and the other brother was near death\nSo the the brother that was near death had a vision of his dad but it but he hasn't been told that his brother had died in the same accident he didn't know that there was then\nAnd there are cases like that to where the the deathbed visitors the person who is dying didn't know that that person was actually dead but because of the family wanted to spare them the knowledge\nPre cognitive dreams give us your thoughts on what they are\n[noise] well there again I've had the cognitive teams I mentioned one above the very powerful above yeah exactly they're very powerful and the question is how do we know of a dream is a pretty cognitive team or if it can anxiety dream\nBecause often and you know when people are sleeping during their dreams they try to protest things that happened during the day or things that they're worried about [noise]\nSo you know for example I talk about Abraham Lincoln two weeks before he was assassinated he he had a dream that he was murdered\n[noise] that we could say that that was a peak cognitive team that we could also say that could have been an anxiety dream maybe he was worried that someone was going to kill him\nMaybe I think you also had a dream where he was in the White House and he walked up to the soldier who is standing by ... and it was him in the casket\nI heard of that too yeah yeah\nSo that could have been ... cognitive being but another famous person who reported a ... interview with Charles Dickens\nReally I didn't hear that yeah\n'cause when he would put out a new book you travel around the small towns and villages and he'd give readings and so on so one night before he was reading into a new\nTown where he'd never been before he had a dream that\nA group of people came up to him after his reading and a young woman in red Shaw introduced himself to her with far words she said I Am miss Napier so when he woke up he thought that was very strange she didn't know anyone by that name but he remarked that the dream was very vivid\nAnd pre cognitive dreams tend to be very vivid I'm often when we wake up in the morning I Dream start to fade\nBut pretty cognitive dream stay with us I mean remember every detail so the next day he went to give us reading and sure enough after the meeting a group of people came up to him and there was a young woman wearing a red shah and she was introduced to him as ... here\n[noise] so so this stream was pre cognitive dream and he didn't know what to think of it or how to explain it but he he ... he had that the cognitive dream [noise] so um that some people if he ... the the person has written about\nYes ... beans and he's written a boat when should we pay attention to a dream how do we know if it's a peacock into femur not [noise] and he said we should pay attention to dreams first ...\nAn ad or support squirrel\nRemoved from the plane\nUsed twice in our breaking
