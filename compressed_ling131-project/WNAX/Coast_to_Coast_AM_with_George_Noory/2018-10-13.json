internationally recognized professionals psychic exorcist teacher specializes in the clearing of individuals' homes businesses a psychic protection\nJeffrey is also an expert on hunting and homes and businesses psychic ability good go such as spirit guides and as well and we tonight we're going to talk about demonic spirits Jeffrey welcome back\nThanks for having me back on your show the fifth time a in a big hello everybody around are beautiful planet\nSuper you know this is a great time of year Halloween just brings out a lot of things with people but it seems to also bring up ghosts and spirits and strange things doesn't it do you feel that way\nI think\nThe jewels and the media pay a lot more attention to it certainly the time we think about all things supernatural a good and evil are also\nIn tradition um it's harvest time and uh in the tradition of that but\nThere is a male of of energy that seems to be thin or this time of year\nUh I I've found that to be somewhat true but these things\nThat I deal with happen all the time and um but the media pays more attention to it this time of year\nAnd that's fine anytime we talk about it and get a chance to inform the public on what is really happening around our world and also on the other side I think is really important\nFor using demonic spirits and we'll get into what do you think they are but do you think they affect people to the point where strange things are happening like now I mean I I feel people are tense uptight\nAnd yeah you know kind of angry about certain things do you think demonic spirits up something to do with that\nDefinitely ah we are certainly going through a lot of changes right now on the planet earth\nAnd this is a huge target for demonic spirits and also negative spirits and I'll get into the difference between those two are as we go along\nBut absolutely targets on the back of people that have power and can change the world for good or for ill\nAnd uh I think that there's never been a time in our history where demons have a greater opportunity to strike\nAt the common person\nAnd also people who are very influential and so they're around more than ever\nI think so too so let's get you take Jeffrey on what is demonic spirit in your opinion\nOn demonic spirit is a very very powerful spirit it could be said that there was a counter part of angels that powerful they are not regular people who have died and just have a bad attitude into negative things\nThey've been around for a long time they are very involved and may have not ever lived in the physical realm or not to have lived in the physical realm for a long time they're very powerful and they are known to be able to affect\nPhysical reality and also the minds of individuals' a very easily\nAnd uh we're not looking out for it you know we don't protect ourselves properly and we're taught that it's something a from Hollywood movies and it only happens to a few people\nIt's not going to happen to me but that's not true because I get calls every day from people that are under the pack of\nAh demonic spirits negative spirits and a demonic spirits are\nAre able to reach in to the physical round from the non physical route and actually produce physical effects and that is one difference between a a demonic spirit and a negative spirit\nAlso demonic spirits are are much better equipped\nTo ah influence people on a psychological emotional level meaning that they can stand right next to us\nAnd we can see them and tell a path that clearly trans for information into our system or emotional systems make us angry at each other the other people\nAt our cells get us to do things we would not normally do and we can't see them we don't know that there are there\nAnd that's what I think is happening now know are the the biblical version of fallen angels\nThey can be certainly that many\nDemonic spirits are ones were good and there's such a thing as ego I Want to sit on your show that ego is the killer of The Exorcist and it's also true of spirits it's also true that demonic spirits a can change you know once\nThey were you know positive experience in the eagle got so them and\nNow that they're doing very very negative things and uh the real danger that I see is that uh there are we're we're more susceptible than ever before to attack\nAre so many arguments you know\nBetween people today and they take advantage of that and spirits on all spirit do not have boys boxes they communicate George ... ethically and we all communicate tele ethically it's kind of like a river that travels\nUnderneath our consciousness and they communicate on that level and they whisper to us maybe at night maybe in the day maybe when people are intoxicated when people step out something steps in and it's also very common\nAnd are they trying to get us to do things that we would not normally do violence things hurt our significant others wives husbands people\nAre not all violent acts are due to are caused by demonic spirits\nBut they certainly are around and they are around more than ever and sort negative spirits people who are dead and they were doing negative thing is when they were alive and continue to do negative things demonic spirits\nAre very powerful and as an exorcist\nWhen I'm dealing with demonic spirits I have to be very careful because\nMany of them are more powerful than me that's right that's you know they can come and get you\n... and they do and the thing is is that they come when you least expect that when I'm working I'm really looking for it when I'm helping people deal with negative things in their homes negative feelings negative energy is\nI'm looking for it it's when I'm not looking for it or that the attacks on me or hurt it doesn't happen very often I've been doing this work\nForty seven years now but it does happen and so I've been attacked or successfully a few times for short duration and it's very unpleasant and it happens very quickly demonic spirits are able to assume any shape or form\nAt a moment's notice can you see them I can you tell us\nAnd with the ability to see if I thought everybody could\nIt was shocking to me George when I when I was young in in elementary school in grade school I thought I saw spirits in the classroom standing over students in a century trying to help them with their homework and help schoolwork\nAnd some are looking at me like how can you tell me\nWhat are you doing I don't like this and the other one I had to watch out for me to actually go and start walking toward me in the classroom when I was very on\nAll right stay with us Jeffrey we are going to get a break and we're going to come back and talk more about the demonic spirits or do they come from what they want and

A. dot com or call one\nEight six six six eight seven three pie that's one eight six six eight seven six eight seven three five\n[noise]\n[noise]\nJeffrey ... with us as we talk about demons we'll take calls next to our as well before we get in the open lines Jeffrey what do you think they're in game is what do they want these demons\nThe destruction of the human race\nAh that's all human the human they want nothing from us so many people have come to me over the years and said I can control spirits\nI can control demons but it's not true they have nothing that we want and so ah they attack children in their cribs the ... attack people at work\nThey attack everybody we all have targets on her back and we need to realize that\nUh we can see them if they can see us they generate negative emotional energy they generate hatred and they're all around and they're using this time of uncertainty in our world today\nIn order to amplify are negative feelings towards each other and it's very important to understand what they're trying to do they don't want us to know that they're they're they want us to think that if a Hollywood myth or something like that and how they would make great movies no problem with that but the reality is\nIs that they are around the spirits are around us all the time we just can't see them\nAnd they communicate with us tell a path at the end game is to destroy us to destroy the fabric of the family to destroy businesses\nReason being is that that's how we make our money destroy a business and you destroy a person's ability to make money destroyed their family destroy their live and also\nWay we think about each other right now they have us at each other's throats right where they want to sell you sure do and we have\nTo stop it and there's there's ways to stop it you know and that's what I Do and I teach people how to stop\nWell do you have to realize that they're doing this to us as opposed to people saying it's just the human race it's all screwed up\nEverybody has a story everybody I've talked to has some kind of a story of ah being in a home apartment condo a party a bar in a pub any ... any place\nWhere they've seen or felt something strange her picking up on negative emotional energy something that living humans generate we all generate on a non physical level emotional energy and so do spirits\nAnd they generate huge amounts of emotional energy\nAnd that can influence us by essentially getting into our energy fields are emotional systems and amplifying our feelings so it takes us from being sort of angry into complete road rage where we\nDo things that we would not normally do how many times that people said that I Would not normally do that\nAnd some of them were angry that's when they attack important people making decisions around our world they work on them\nOr they don't know that there are there and they may not believe in them but they are there you know most people believe in some kind of life after death some something that happens not everybody but most people do so what happens\nWhen we simply drop or physical bodies and become non physical entity is their spirits most people are good summer not\nMost spirits are good summer not and so the ones that are not have a tendency to want to continue\nTo hang around our world and get us to do things they would not normally do demonic spirits are just experts at it they have weapons they have devices that they make a lot of non physical energy is just like spirits do\nSpirits change their forms like our our parents die and it's an old age or something they can immediately change and look younger by generating and thinking about generating a form of what they wanted to look like and also generating close because most people do not see\nNaked spirit so all these things are generated on a non physical level\nEmotional energy is generated on a non physical level as well\nSo demonic spirits come close to us or even from a distance and focus in on us and generate hatred enrage\nWe think it's our own but it's not always completely wrong or the under the direction of the double Jeffrey\nI'm not sure if there's one particular spirit in charge of falling negative spirits I demonic spirits are kind of like criminals they really don't even get along with each other they don't trust each other they most often work alone but that's not always the rule\nOr they do work in groups I have found that to be true and all the decades I've been doing this\nBut they really do their best when they work alone and they take their time working on individuals and families are getting them to fight uh getting people to fight with each other or getting countries to fight with each other\nGetting people to amplify what would normally be a small amount of anger into complete rage and very very good at it because the amount of anger that comes out of them\nIs incredible and we just don't see it coming on I Know that when I've been attacked personally\nAh it happened so quickly one moment I see them next moment you know some kind of very negative\nA beam of light will come out on an attack I pulled out my non physical sword they pull out their weapons and there is a fight going on\nBut everybody's not so fortunate the vacancy them and know that they're coming and so there are around us and we don't know it around us that work and at home also negative spirits you know and in negative spirits can work for them essentially\nAnd in sort of modeled themselves after that and like I said most people are good and some are not and the ones that are not are also quite capable of doing the very same thing generating hatred and anger and of course millions of people die all the time\nAnd lots of them are not good uh they were not good when they were living and they continue to do negative things and they'd attack people on a daily basis so\nEssentially the entire human race right now is under attack by negative spirits and uh unfortunately demonic spirits which are very very powerful spirits and like I said earlier\nMay not have ever lived in the physical realm or for a very very long time and they're they they practice and they're good at what they do they know how to generate hatred enraged and they know how to get it through our natural protection systems also known as the aura\nAnd to get us to react to they're angry and hateful feelings and they have no problem they would essentially\nKill a child in the cradle have no problem with that I Know that's a scary thought this was a horrible\nThey have they just have humans and so they attack everybody they attack people least able to defend themselves and in our world right now we're having a lot of changes going on in a lot of problems a lot of anger happening right now and we have to realize\nPM it's easy to get into a GMC when you get into fights GMC in Arlington coming down the road there's no one was taking a GMC and

energy fields also known as the ... but the or it's not just a bunch of pretty light it is who we are it's part of who we are a personality are our emotional systems\nHave an energy field that extends out from the very center of our non physical body which is our spirit\nOr maybe three or four feet outside of our physical body and emotional energy can become trapped over a period of time in just about everybody everybody has the issue\nSo emotional energy this negative that we generate can be trapped in our bodies energy fields\nAnd we can also pick it up in any kind of store restaurant somebody's home I'm watching TV or you know a tubs every place there is a motion energy enter ... energy field to be don't protect ourselves\nAnd most people don't that it actually permeates into our energy field and mix it with our own emotional energy positive and negative and causes havoc and this is one of the biggest problems that people will call me have it's not it was just amount of experience\nThe idea is that we are filled full of emotional energy not a positive energy I don't touch I'm not even capable of doing that we only let go of what we want to let\nGo and so I deal with essentially clearing out the negative emotional energy and negative emotional energy is something that ah people want to release\nI feel a hundred percent better when it's natural\nLet's go to Terry in Houston, Texas welcome to the show Teri go ahead\nYeah George or ideas what I'm ah he was going to the original language or the scriptures and my actually writing a book called that we really know Scott is\nAnd I tell you the Bible they see these big guys dealt with a lot of the party a scene and while I was gonna ask you Jeffrey are you a Christian\n[noise] I don't belong to the Christian religion I Do believe in God I also think that ah the argument over creationist a series and a true scientific physical theories as ridiculous\nThey pull work hand in hand first principle is creation spirits don't just sit around and clouds and do and do nothing\nHigher spirits angels God you know they create almost like a bad or of a cake on a non physical level the design of the universe and then comes the physical ... non physical\nProceeds the physical so the idea that you know creation is does that happen as the universe created absolutely\nBut also the big bang theory why not so it's essentially like I said like baking a cake you know that spirit guide angels are in the business\nOr in a wonderful business of actually creating in designing these things potentially right now as we speak not just in the beginning of time but right now and that filters up it's connected with the physical all things physical\nSo each person has to levels of physical body which is very finite sixty eighty years or Fifteen Years or whatever and our spirit which is completely internal enter personality which never dies and and I'm really amazed at the argument that or not you have but I mean that is\nBeing fostered out there between religion and scientists which I agree with\nI'm I Am a non physical scientist essentially\nSo I Believe in all of this is science to me you know and I think that you know God has a personality you know whether there was one or two I don't know I'm not sure you know but I Do believe that there I Know there are higher spirits out there because I work with them and I work for them\nAnd so I Do believe you know I worked Christians all the time and I respect that religion and so I you know I think what you're doing this marvelous you know I think that it's just that there's a misinterpretation and needless argument between these two are theories that are both correct\nAnd let's go back to the jury you know the question go ahead Jerry\nYeah what I was going to say is you're talking about religion religion teaches at ... beach and the guy go to church give your money do this don't do that that's not from guy the problem is is that we have many ministers out there that teach ah this\nType of stuff then basically do they make money off of\nWith the with the whole scenario at the turn the or why you Jeffrey\nAnd and I understand that I I really do understand that and I feel sorry for people that don't know\nBut you got to understand that the only Christianity is not a religion it it's a relationship between you and God now why is that well to be an arbitrator you have to be God man genes ... the title is Jean\n... Lord Jesus Christ lord need the gene means humanity and cry me the not only did one\nOkay so what happens is because we don't do this in order to be because none of us are perfect on the third in fact\nIn fact ... said\nThat I'm a I I that God is no respect or person so we're on the same boat it would be no matter how much knowledge and we know we're all in the same boat with God because we have a major because we're we're born in stand because of Adam's then because we carry out and then\nAh our entire white way we are and and even all that does that none of us are the glory of God we were all on the same boat\nBut those demons seemed to be every where we're going to come back and take final calls in a moment on the coast to coast am\nNo one can prevent all identity theft or cyber crime or monitor transactions that all businesses\nBut new life lock the door and security provides more detection and more protection against cyber threats go to like lock dot com recall one eight hundred lifelike and use promo code Georgetown\nFor an additional ten percent off your first year plus a twenty five dollar Amazon gift card with the annual enrollment ... dot com promote go George ten for ten percent off and a twenty five dollar Amazon gift card term supply\nYou've ever experienced heart racing shortness of breath or dizziness as possible you could at atrium relation one of the leading causes of syrup mind out before too late with cardio mobile the FDA cleared personal EKG device than just Ninety nine dollars to order with a cardio dot com\nK.

California is with us say Thomas\nHere arch thank you for taking my call sir ...\nGreat work that you're doing campaign my question\nAbout war and the battle field and more so how does military personnel man and woman in a battle situation protect themselves from Monica fault I'm not talking about\nJust battling and search like clay but there must be a lot of demonic can or change in a war time battle field situation and have any advice for men and women in the military to protect themselves\nI was in the air force myself many years ago and\nActually there are methods there are rules on the other side\nOf motion all energy that we all generate and and it is in the battlefield hatred and anger and fear and there's killing going on and so it certainly is a\nA place where negative for sort of tracked it to the manic spirits negative spirit says well terrible things are happening\nAnd so we need to build up and strengthen our energy field there are methods there are rules on the other side like there are physical rules so there are things we can do in order to build shields around ourselves to protect us\nFacts that negative energy that is generated by other people\nFear around us were just natural and the battle situation\nAh emotional energy that just you know so intense on the battlefield there are multiple layers that can be applied that actually work so that negative energy actually bounces off of us\nThis is something I teach people to do every day it's very important and so it's not you know uh you know just about me the idea is is that yes there are lots of things that people can do on the battlefield to protect themselves and the military\nYou just have to learn how to do them they're actually very simple and it can take this stuff I designed over the years with the help of my spirit guides\nCan be brought up in five or ten seconds you need it fast you know the old style was doing things tend to minutes in the morning in ten minutes in the evening I read all that stuff when I got out of the service\nTen minutes for the morning in ten minutes and evening\nBut we need it's very different now it's very different we you know we didn't we need protection right away we don't know when things are going to hit us\nWe need to be able to bring up our protection systems immediately in order to deflect negative emotional energy or this being generated by the end that me by people around us are that are unhappy and are frightened and also by spirits that are trying to interfere\nAnd feed off of the book killing and and also also are off the fear\nAnd so I think that it's very important that we all learn that this kind of thing and it's a science it's not a religion what ... what I'm involved in is not religion I Would not even to say it's really a metaphysical is non physical science\nI have no problem with physical science I agree with everything that they have to say scientists to not call me up and argue with me they are right I deal with non physical science which is essentially is the non physical part of our body\nAre emotional systems are personality everything else butter physical body that is susceptible to attack and also negative emotional energy by negative spirits demonic spirits and also people and really bad and scariest situations\nHave you seen demons attack businesses and why did they do that\nThey do it in order to destroy a person's life hack the fabric of the family and the best way to do it is to pull out the resources the money George to get it out\nIf they destroyed a business and they have a two fold thing going on and they have people that are fired that have to look for a job it can cause arguments at home it can cause people to lose their place\nOr where they live all sorts of problems that can cause them to feel bad and actually react sometimes violet Lee\nAnd also it has an effect upon the actual business environment we're now you have the failed business I think of most restaurants they fail within a year so restaurant after restaurant comes in her business after business comes in\nAnd you have problems of failed businesses and that has an accumulation of emotional energy as well plus you have all the people working uh who don't necessarily get along is kind of like our our second family we're a family at home and we have our family at work and everybody doesn't get along\nAnd so essentially have a lot of emotional energy people at work were sitting at their desks and maybe thinking I really hated here when they're doing that they're generating emotional energy and it can it can be positive or negative emotional energy but sometimes as negative and it accumulates in the environment\nThis also attracts negative spirits and demonic spirits\nBecause if they can get somebody fired by you know doing or saying something uh you know inappropriate for\nA you know simply not doing their job or she'll be destroying the business itself by making of a the business atmosphere very uncomfortable emotionally everybody's got a story about walking into a living environment a pub\nA a business or restaurant and saying you know what this place doesn't feel right what's her picking up on George's emotional energy whether it be good or bad that's emotional energy they're picking up on everybody has the story of that this place doesn't feel right is emotional energy and it needs to be clear it out\nSo they attacked businesses because they can actually make a business failed you might have two hundred or two thousand people out of work and now they're really unhappy they go home and there are arguments with their significant others with their kids\nAnd a and then it just snowballs\nNext up let's go to the Monique in sun ... son ...

thank you so much for having me on the show again\nTo any traveling\nI've been in Connecticut I was in LA uh on Monday doing some new interviews for ancient aliens really excited\nAbout that you should look this up while you were a year\nWhile it was such a fast track and um so I just there overnight and a personal note I had a sick cat who passed away\nYesterday so it's kind of a really emotional you are very very difficult time he was my beloved buddy he's on his journey now how old was he he was eleven\nNow ... that's not too old for a cat is\nNo it's not as I said I was really hoping he'd be here a few more years and um but as time was it was time for him to go sadly and I'm gonna miss miss him dearly\nWell he's out there somewhere you know that he's here with us now yep absolutely tell me about the watchers\nThe watchers incredible story very much very controversial of course there's a broad range of of viewpoints on the watchers ranging from the third demons they're evil they're controlling us people want to know\nA while what why are they here and and and what are they doing a why are they interfering with humanity and people actually blame the watchers for humanity's hills\nAnd that's one very definite point of view but then the other point of view is that\nThey were here they came from the heavenly round from the ground called ... according to the Bible the location of God's throne they're dispatched to earth in order to bring a new teaching to humanity a teaching about\nHow humans can transform into angels and make the journey from the earthly around to the heavenly realm of sigh on\nIt it seems that that what's happened in the intervening centuries and by the way it was the watchers were briefly mentioned in the Old Testament and the book of genesis and that it's the scenes about a hundred and fifty years before Jesus all of a sudden there's this rise of astounding what's known as apocalyptic material developed\nBy the ... the idea scenes apocalyptic simply means that a human man is in contact with an otherworldly being a supernatural being angelic being maybe even an extraterrestrial in some people's view\nWho delivers knowledge about another supernatural world and this then became an explosion of of knowledge about the watchers\nAnd the ability of humans to cross over what the church considers a forbidden boundary between flash and light between spirit and flash\nNow these scenes did they not right to did see squirrels as well\nThat's exactly right the scenes there's no question that that after the destruction of the temple of Solomon and eighty Seventy when the scenes were attacked the Roman army came into\nInto Jerusalem into Galloway the scene bundled up their sacred texts which there were many hit them in caves and they were last until Nineteen forty seven when they were were rediscovered and this is when modern consciousness really begins to [noise] to understand the full story of the watchers\nThe watchers are the angelic ... realm are they from\nTwo schools of thought there's something that believe that they're simply and only human beings ancient pagan royalty who existed maybe going back to the time even before the flood and the that they were able to survive the flood and that continued with new blood lines after the time of the flood\nThe second point is that they are and this comes from the Bible as well as the dead sea scrolls\nThat they are celestial beings light being sued ephemeral beings who had the ability to phase into physical manifestation they could take flesh and blood bodies and face back and forth by the way between flesh and blood and their their light being status and then infiltrated human affairs\nThat sounds to me William\nThey are and this is where it gets kind of disturbing because as you speak it begin to research the watchers it's you're presented with a crossroads you're either going to take the tack that they are purely evil and their demonic as many people do\nAnd if you take that path it's going to lead you down to the path where you're following their offspring who are called them to feel them as these giant beings\nLongate ... and in this whole axis of research which is very interesting but if you're following that path chances are you are not probing deeply behind the tax and into the tax left by the scenes and you realize that the scenes themselves\nWere utilizing ancient texts and teachings that they are developed and synthesize from ancient Babylon Egypt Iran Iraq the teachings of his address\nThat were centered on how do we contact the watchers\nOne and two how do we transform ourselves into angels and in fact this is what the Dead Sea scrolls are all about this this is seen this group of the scenes and Jewish mistakes hundred and fifty years before the time but Jesus who were utilizing these teachings\nTo congregate with the angels the holy ones the angel of the lord\nThe watchers and were transforming their bodies\nInto light in other words into angels\n... which of course in the book of genesis to me either fallen angel I'm not sure what do you think\n[noise] I I don't think so because when you look at the at a mile or G. of the ... the meaning of the word ... it's far far from established fact the term fallen angel is means that they're evil beings or that they are being who were are somehow demonic\nThey their fallen because they came out of the higher vibration or if you will heavenly realms and took human body fat is they're great sin\nThey crossed what the church establishment views as a forbidden boundary you're not allowed to cross over from flash into spirit with out God's permission and this is the whole crux of the question did the watchers when they\nDescended from the heavenly realms and took on physicality ...\nAgainst the will of God and that that's going to determine your whole viewpoint about the watchers and what happened was that early church fathers based on some of the work of the scenes and others\nSimply decided that they were [noise] demonic being that they were a powers that were beyond human control\nAnd certain humans began teaching that we need to avoid the watchers at all cost do not seek to transform yourself into an angel without God's permission because in order to actually what the church terms is a sand or experienced the\nRapture you have to be invited by God and that's the great crossing the line that the watchers\nTranscended are crossed over and came to teach humans how to do how to turn into angels\nWilliam in your book the watches you do talk about a luminous cloud were gods rude on them to me it sounds like CSI kills we'll it sounds kind of you will always doesn't it\nAbsolutely I mean in in the New Testament the Greek word for clouds isn't to feel which is the world where we get the wording to feel I'm from and so these are cloud riders and when you as I did in my book and in the watchers book I collected\nVarious examples of today are Judeo Christian art that shows the watchers including a Jesus riding upon cloud vehicles luminous clouds they're literally levitating on these clouds\nAnd what we learn is that this cloud is actually a symbol for their ascension buddy their light body it's it's not a hardware UFO like a a flying Toyota\nIt's actually an organic light vehicle that is produced by the human body and it enables them to travel inter dimensional ally and throughout the cosmos\nTalking with William Henry whose latest work the watchers and of course we're going to get into many things that he is an investigative menthol it just goes\nAfter these gone that a visited us\nSpiritual or physical\nSpiritual first who had the ability to phase into physicality and their\nBodies are described actually has fluid they can virtually instantly according to these stories\nTransform from their acquiesce adaptable kind of a fluid shape into physicality they can even turn invisible\nAnd this is what we we discover and in some of the ... tax as well as in the dead sea scrolls where there were they're describing looking at these luminous beings who are radiating rainbow light\nWho their bodies are described as full of buys they're covered with feathers and they have certain teams type faces and when you add all this description together it precisely matches what the Tibetans describe as the rainbow body of light\nIn the Tibetan great perfection tradition they believe that humans can morph into a light body that they describe that what they tell us is that are the the\nBody the frequency of our body can be accelerated until it dissolves into five color rainbow light leaving behind only hair toe in fingernails have known nerves to be transmitted the watchers could do this then I Believe that the the Tibetan great protection tradition originates with the watchers\nThere are many different hunting seasons don't forget about the upland slam and there are

us internationally recognized professionals psychic exorcist teacher specializes in the clearing of individuals' homes businesses and psychic protection\nJeffrey is also an expert on hunting and homes and businesses\nPsychic ability good go such as spirit guide as well and we're tonight we're going to talk about demonic spirits Jeffrey welcome back\nThanks storage for having me back on your show the fifth time a in a big hello to everybody around are beautiful planet\nSuper you know this is a great time of year Halloween just brings out a lot of things with people but it seems to also bring out\nIsn't it you feel that way I think that\nIndividuals and the media pay a lot more attention to it certainly the time we think about all things supernatural I'm good and evil\nAre also in tradition um it's harvest time and uh in the tradition of that but\nThere's a veil of of energy that seems to be thin or this time of year\nUh I I've found that to be somewhat true but these things that I deal with happen all the time and um but the media pays more attention to it this time of year\nAnd that's fine anytime we talk about it and get a chance to inform the public on what is really happening around our world and also on the other side I think is really important\nFor using demonic spiritual will get into what do you think they are but do you think they affect people to the point where strange things are happening like now I mean I I feel people aren't tense uptight\nAnd yeah you know kind of angry about certain things do you think demonic spirit ... something to do with that\nDefinitely ah we are certainly going through a lot of changes right now on the planet earth\nAnd this is a huge target for demonic spirits and also negative spirits and I'll get into the difference between those two are as we go along\nBut absolutely targets on the back of people that have power and can change the world for good or for ill and uh I think that there's never been a time in our history\nWhere demons have a greater opportunity to strike\nAt the common person\nAnd also people who are very influential and so they're around is more\nThan ever\nI think so too so let's get you take Jeffrey on what is a demonic spirit in your opinion\nDemonic spirit is a very very powerful spirit it could be said that there was a counterpart of angels that powerful they are not regular people who have died and just have a bad attitude into negative things\nThey've been around for a long time they are very involved and may have not ever lived in the physical realm or not to have lived in the physical realm for a long time they're very powerful and they are known to be able to affect\nPhysical reality and also the minds of individuals' a very easily\nAnd ah we're not looking out for it you know we don't protect ourselves properly and we're taught that it's something a from Hollywood movies and it only happens to a few people\nIt's not going to happen to me but that's not true because I get calls every day from people that\nAre under the pack of ah demonic spirits negative spirits and ah demonic spirits are\nAre able to reach in to the physical round from the non physical route and actually produce physical effects and that is one difference between a a demonic spirit in a negative spirit\nAlso demonic spirits are are much better equipped to ah influence people on a psychological emotional level meaning that they can stand right next to us\nAnd we can't see them and tell a path that clearly trans for information into our system or emotional systems make us angry at each other the other people at our cells get us to do things we would not normally do\nAnd we can't see them we don't know that there are there\nAnd that's what I think is happening now know are they the biblical version of fallen angels\nThey can be certainly that many demonic spirits are ones were good and there's such a thing as ego I Want to sit on your show that ego is the killer of The Exorcist and it's also true of spirits\nIt's also true that demonic spirits a can change you know once they were no positive spirits and their ego got to them and\nNow that they're doing very very negative things and uh\nThe real danger that I see is that uh there are we're we're more susceptible than ever before to attack\nAre so many arguments you know between people today and they take advantage of that and spirits on all spirit do not have boys boxes they communicate George ... ethically\nAnd we all communicate ... ethically it's kind of like\nA river that travels underneath\nOur consciousness and they communicate on that level and they whisper to us maybe at night maybe in the day maybe when people are intoxicated when people step out something steps in and it's also very common\nAnd uh they try to get us to do things that we would not normally do violence things hurt our significant others wives husbands people\nAre not all violent acts are due to are caused by demonic spirits\nBut they certainly are around and they are around more than ever and sore negative spirits people who are dead and they were doing negative thing is when they were alive and continue to do negative things demonic spirits\nAre very powerful and as an exorcist\nWhen I'm dealing with demonic spirits I have to be very careful because many of them are more powerful than me\nThat's right that's you know they can come and get you\n... and they do and the thing is is that they come when you least expect that when I'm working I'm really looking for it when I'm helping people deal with negative things in their homes negative feelings negative energy is\nI'm looking for it it's when I'm not looking for it or that the attacks on me or hurt it doesn't happen very often I've been doing this work forty\nSeven years now but it does happen and so I've been attacked or successfully a few times for shorter\nAnd it's very unpleasant and it happens very quickly demonic spirits are able to assume any shape or form\nThere's some exciting news simply safest now valued at one billion dollars this company used to be just five guys working together\nNow they protect more

A. dot com or call one eight\nSix six eight three six eight seven three fine that's one eight six six eight seven six eight seven three fine\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nJeffrey ... with us as we talk about demons we'll take calls next to our as well before we get in the open lines Jeffrey what do you think they're in game is what do they want these demons\nThe destruction of the human race a\nNatural human\nHumans they want nothing from us so many people have come to me over the years and said I can control spirits\nI can control demons but it's not true they have nothing that we want and so ah they attack children in their cribs they had ... attack people at work\nThey attack everybody we all have targets on her back and we need to realize that\nUh we can see them but they can see us they generate negative emotional energies they generate hatred and they're all around and they're using this time of uncertainty in our world today\nIn order to amplify are negative feelings towards each other and it's very important to understand\nWhat they're trying to do they don't want us to know that there are there they want us to think that it's a Hollywood myth or something like that Hollywood makes great movies no problem with that but the reality is is that they are around the spirits are around us all the time we just can't see them\nAnd they communicate with us tell a path to either end game is to destroy us to destroy the fabric of the family\nTo destroy businesses the reason being is that that's how we make our money destroy a business and you destroy a person's ability to make money destroyed their family destroy their lives and also\n... to change or the way we think about each other right now they have both at each other's throats right where they want to sell they sure do and we have to stop it and there's there's ways to stop it you know and that's what I Do and I teach people how to stop\nWell do you have to realize that they're doing this to us as opposed to people saying it's just the human race it's all screwed up\nEverybody has a story everybody I've talked to has some kind of a story of ah being in a home apartment condo a party a bar in a pub any ... any place or they've seen or felt something strange or picking up on negative emotional energy something\nThat living humans generate we all generate on a non physical level emotional energy and so do spirits and they generate huge amounts of emotional energy and that can\nInfluence this by essentially getting into our energy fields are emotional systems and amplifying our feelings\nSo it takes us from being sort of angry into complete road rage where we do things that we would not normally do how many times that people said that I Would not normally do that\nAnd some of them were angry that's when they attack important people making decisions around our world they work on them or they don't\nKnow that there are there and they may not believe in them but they are there you know most people believe in some kind of life after death some something that happens not everybody but most people do so what happens\nWhen we simply drop or physical bodies and become non physical entity is their spirits most people are good summer not\nMost spirits are good summer not\nAnd so the ones that are not have a tendency to want to continue\nTo hang around our world and get us to do things they would not normally do demonic spirits are just experts at it they have weapons they have devices that they make off of non physical energy is just like spirits do\nSpirits change their forms like our our parents die and it's an old age or something\nThey can immediately change and look younger by generating in thinking about generating a form of what they wanted to look like and also generating close because most people do not see naked spirit so all these things are generated on a non physical level\nEmotional energy is generated on a non physical level as well\nSo demonic spirits come close to us or even from a distance and focus in on us and generate hatred enrage\nWe think it's our own but it's not always completely wrong or the under the direction of the double Jeffrey\nI'm not sure if there's one particular spirit in charge of falling negative spirits I demonic spirits are kind of like criminals\nThey really don't even get along with each other they don't trust each other they most often work alone but that's not always the rule\nOr they do work in groups I have found that to be true and all the decades I've been doing this\nBut they really do their best when they work alone and they take their time working on individuals and families are getting them to fight uh getting people to fight with each other or getting countries to fight with each other getting people to amplify\nWhat would normally be a small amount of anger into complete rage and very very good at it because the amount of anger that comes out of them is incredible and we just don't see it coming on I Know that when I've been attacked personally\nAh it happened so quickly one moment I see them next moment you know some kind of very negative\nA beam of light all come out on attack I pulled out my non physical sword they pull out their weapons and there is a fight going on but everybody's not so fortunate the vacancy them and know that they're coming and\nThere are around us and we don't know it around just working at home also negative spirits you know and negative spirits can work for them essentially and in sort of modeled themselves after that and like I said most people are good and some are not and the ones that are not\nAre also quite capable of doing the very same thing generating hatred and anger and of course millions of people die all the time and lots of them are not good uh they were not good when they were living and they continue to do negative things and they'd attack people on a daily basis so\nEssentially the entire human race right now is under attack by negative spirits and uh unfortunately demonic spirits which are very very powerful spirits and like I said earlier\nMay not have ever lived in the physical realm or for a very very long time and they're they they practice and they're good at what they do they know how to generate hatred and rage and they know how to get it through our natural protection systems also known as the aura\nAnd to get us to react to they're angry and hateful feelings and they have no problem they would essentially kill a child in the cradle no problem with that I Know that's a scary thought\nIt was horrible they have they just hate humans and so they attack everybody they attack people least able to defend themselves and in our world right now we're having a lot of changes going on in a lot of problems a lot of anger happening right now and we have to realize", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "year": "2018", "city": "Yankton", "day": "13"}
