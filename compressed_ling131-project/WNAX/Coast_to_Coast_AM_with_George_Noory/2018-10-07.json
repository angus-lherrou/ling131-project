McGregor so I I I learned that tonight if I weren't here talking to you I'd probably be watching the fight\nThere you go it's gone now is there any way Yeah Yup yup\nOn all the producers were were watching that say hey you guys are going on the air now still well knowing the origin of Halloween talking about the the past and even what you think about the future and they say ten of part and all that good stuff\nNow another element and some people they don't you know their past the trick or treating stage there pass doing the tricks you know and all that kind of stuff and now what they do is they do and to cemeteries and they go into the woods or they go into you know the um um houses down the streets\nMore than in hospitals and things like that and they go inside these places and they use the energy board on Halloween Night or they or they use now all these different devices\nTo call upon spirits in Dallas now you have easily Britain quite a few books actually and you do a lot of writing and oh my gosh good for you I I Do ... and that's why I like to talk\nOf her life I'll just say that all men [laughter] I I Do like\nYour let your latest book is about goes hunting and investigating what to look for what to do and also um what it used to be like in the past and what the difference now I think I found it interesting that you had said to me\nThat people will go into cemeteries and they'll ask to talk to the spirit were years back people would get ... why would you want to talk to a stranger\nYou know maybe call upon your family members somebody now that's true why do you know there's no\nThat was that was ... was one of the things that I uh when I was researching my book are investigating goes to those is basically a survey of of the scientific attempts\nTo to contact the dead I'm ranging from basically pre history a boat primarily through the the the Victorian era up and up with today's you know goes hunters and all that\nAnd what you find is that the the idea that I mean you know people have been talking to the dead for millennia I mean that's you know there's references or in the winter of indoor and the Bible and Shakespeare you know your lady Macbeth I mean banquet so there's\nThere's there's there there's no shortage of go see them in literature and history but you know typically ghost or if it's typically if people if you want to talk to a ghost you'd be talking to them for a reason for example you'd be talking to\n'em your your your great grandfather or your your your best friend that that died recently\n... and the the idea that somebody would go into like a haunted house where there's the Myrtle plantation or a fairly house or you know what what have you go to a hundred location and\nTalk to some random spirit that just happens to be there and say Hi can you give us inside and you don't know me but\nTell me about yourself that that's that's a that's a relatively new phenomena hum and it's it's fast and you know you go back and look at the the the onto that were held in in the Victorian era\nOf upper class uh places and they would have you know a lady they they've Crumpet some tea and the and you know they try to communicate with the ghosts and then\nYou would have the the spiritual Sarah [noise] um and you had people like Harry Houdini trying to research the Marjorie ... and all these spiritual is that you know came to the states and Medicaid Maggie Fox and and and they're you know their their stuff and so\nAnd then your hair your price and his researching all that and then you sort of fast forward to uh the the the ... the idea and the ... the electronic voice phenomena and the idea that you can record you communicate with goes\nThrough white noise and prove based on a broken radio that switches channels and then you sort of fast forward to\nTo the more modern day goes ... with the the TV shows and all the spin offs and goes in ventures and all that and it's just fascinating when you sort of look at the history of these sorts of things and look through techniques have been tried and and you know what works and what doesn't and and how do we know\n[noise] yeah I didn't get a you know it's already kind of creepy enough spooky enough or even scary enough when you do get some sort of interaction when you were going to try to talk to spirit the\nUm it it's scary when you get somebody talking to you but\nPeople take that step further and they hope in a pinch and you don't know who they're poking at ... I mean they're really trying hard to get interaction and you don't you don't know if it's going to be somebody nice or not and uh they go home with you you know that's where\nI grew up in on it how high is the last thing I wanted to go around me I prefer ... or looking at them as a guy like I don't want something going on with me even though people claim that those things go home with them too\nBut you know what I mean ... if you um talked about exercises and things like that one of my friends is archbishop James long changes like you don't click provoking clip provoking you don't know who or what you're talking to\nAnd that's what they were there that you're not doing yourself when you were there by ... whatever it may be there\nRight you don't know what it is if it's evil or not evil or what it is that All right I mean\nUm well you you talk about in your book there's different guidelines for scientifically investigating these reports how you do that same typically [noise]\n[noise] well there's a couple of things you know one of the first things you do is um you establish I mean I I've done I've done you know many goes investigations myself [noise]\nUm and as I said I I come to a more science based uh someone say skeptical point of view that doesn't mean that I dismissed everything it just means that you know I'm not going to believe\nAnywhere you sound as that goes and so for the first thing that I Do want to go into a case is try to establish a water the false viable claims that is what exactly is being claimed to you know if someone saying that there's\nThere's a mysterious sound or laughing or something in the hallway or is there a photograph for me what what exactly is is is going on there and the question is can we tested repeatable right is it\nIs it is the sound that comes up you know every every full moon I'm you know what's going on here and so a lot of times ah unfortunately a lot of the the ghost hunting you see on TV uh is is not very scientific um it it it looks exciting look dramatic you know it's all of course you know reality\nTV and creating TV reality and\nYou know in in scare quotes um and I and I've been on many of the TV shows as you pointed out I was a soft I've done you know on both sides of the camera on this\nAnd you know and my my point of view is always you know I I don't make fun of growth aren't 'cause I I've done goes hunting and I I've I've done a lot of that and so my my point is if you're going to do with and do it right\nYou know bring science to bring good good critical thinking too so I'll give you one quick example so one problem I often see\nHe's the co centers on TV and and not actually just across the board is is are you in the supply us even you know amateur groups across the country is they typically engaged in what's called the anomaly hunting\nAnd that is they're they're looking for they're they're sampling the environment whether it's a ... you know you EMS or magnetic uh frequencies of water temperature drops whatever it is they're they're they're sampling the environment and looking for something weird\nAnd they're saying okay well if we will will go here and we'll be there from you know midnight until you know until six AM and we'll take all these reading and walk around we'll try and promote goes most her things and then they get hours and hours and hours of\nThe tapes and videotape and they combed through them and they try and look for anything we're all look at it it's ... pm I Am you know we saw this thing\nAnd the problem is that oftentimes they're forgetting to investigate the original claims they're you know the first thing you need to do is when you when you talked on a witness and you you you research the history of the house and what the claims are you need to investigate those particular claims\nAnd and oftentimes that sort of gets pushed by the wayside in their eagerness to you know do this sort of the investigating and you know get the get the cameras on we're going to walk around here and all these things\nAnd and and that that's part of the problem here is that is it if you're going to sample the environment there's nothing\nWrong with that problem is that [noise] that in almost all cases they don't they don't have a good grasp of of of a of\nThe amount of data needed to to adequately sample look\nSo for example you'll see goes undergoes location maybe there's team of them and they'll they'll take readings for three hours or sick or whatever else looked all go home and analyze the problem is that that's not nearly enough time to get a good baseline right in order to know what's\nWhat's what's um more abnormal you need to know what's normal\nAnd whatever reading as you get\nDoes your dog it scratched

dynamite dot com\nV. I. T. [noise]\n\n\nIt's coast to coast am county Willis here will is to wean is\nWhat's going on right now and we are talking with\nBenjamin Radford he also is an investigator of mysteries and an author and one of his latest book\nIs called investigating dose and it's um it's very interesting book it talks about ah well let's bring him back on year been we were talking about uh how you investigate and how you first go in it to an area where somebody says there's these things happening\nAnd I want an here's a question\nThat I Want to know that I I really don't know and a lot of people I don't think they have any clue either but everybody tries to be cool you know um when you look at a picture of photographs\nAnd someone says this is a picture I took a you know some uh there's a lot of really great people out there that they really had things happening and they have great pictures of possibly something and I love that I mean we all want that but then there are some people out there that want to say things\nSo when you do see a picture how do you know what his photo shop what is not photoshopped what might just be a glitch\nWhat might be a maybe a light reflecting off or the difference between an orbit and a piece of\nDust how the analyzing of photos\nTell us about that I Know that that's a good question I have to say that um you know I've always looked at two or three hundred and photographs over the years people sent me I'm\nI'm a similar to recover [laughter] on the on the recipient of\nA trip [laughter] many dog in Texas but I I have to clean up afterwards\nAnd I I have to say that I rarely encountered um I have on occasion but I Would say probably Seventy eighty percent of the those photos of them sent by people who just photograph something weird and they yeah\nOutlawing it or not oh two minutes not up on me they're like oh\nThey're just like hey we're you know can you help me figure this out [noise]\nUm and so you know I like going to age ... you know trying to figure it out and to help them as best I can answer one thing that I encourage them to do and I I Can't always do this\nSo because you know I I if if someone sends me if a photograph I Can't just drop what I'm doing fly off to you know to Denver\nTo [laughter] go researchers go sort of much why not\nBecause I haven't trademark Willis lean and gun is often [laughter]\nSplit it with me that's all I ask you know as\nA no but it's um [noise] so so there's a couple of things one of them is the is I Want one possible I Try to go to the the location or was filmed and try and figure it out so all you mentioned earlier um one case Saddam known for which is the Santa Fe courthouse coast case\nThat happened about I don't know maybe ten years or so ago and it was in in Santa Fe New Mexico the capital or which is about an hour north of here\nAnd it was a video taken outside of a a courthouse and it was really strange glowing orbit thing that the cross this this real and camera [noise] um\nAnd it was you know it was it was seen by deputy uh so you know that they're probably [laughter] that would that make that gave credibility right [laughter] it's a deputy on the courthouse\nCameras so the likelihood of this being a hoax was was that dropped off considerably at that point [noise]\nUm but what I ended up doing was ... I went to the story um who's made national news and people read all of this weird thing of law\nAnd because I live in the state again them about an hour away I ... I went up there and investigators night I went and then I went to the courthouse I looked at the camera and I talked to the deputies interviewed people\nAnd I had some ideas of what it might be\nUm and I did some experiments I eventually you solve the case and figured out what it was and so part of the answer is you you look at the the the the video or the photograph and he tried to figure out what or alternative explanations right so I\nUsually I make a list of three four or five different things you know could be could be an insect could be a hoax could be a ghost is or is there are some I mean so you just basically any anything that he is even remotely possible I Try and lift those\nAnd I tried to rank them terms of what's most likely which which things can I find typically test which things can actually you know investigating falsify\n'em and you just basically go down list and and that's that's one of the things I Do so so one key thing that this important uh and it's not always possible because sometimes you know it's\nThe the photograph is you know Thirty years old and it was taken in you know in in Poland and you know who knows where the hell that came from [noise] but but when possible it's good to try and replicated so ... for example a woman sent me a photograph that she took in a hotel in Deadwood\nAnd I said you know are you are you still there should know this was a couple of years back I knew it was a sort of image does he she saw in a room in the mirror and I said well again ... ... it's it would be I could I could be more help if this was a recent photograph not just a couple of years back in different states but I said\nBut you know if you if you do go back there if you were still there go back and tried to replicate it you know take take take the photograph\nAt the same place ideally at the same time of day um and see if you see if there's something in the background that that you know might might be you know it might be mistaken for a ... a an image of her face or something\nI sell ... and I get that I get that and\nYou know I guess that that thing whatever that might be just they're like you said and it might be people might say\nWell I'll give you another example of what\nI was gonna say you're one of it is I'm a ... if it's on the one question comes up as the other people see it right and so this is right\nThere is often the case of where you know there's there's an extra for example behind sanding behind somebody [noise] ah and actually I was sent to an example this a couple of months back and said oh this was the weirdest thing you know my cousins here and there was this there was a sort of weird goes the image or remove just behind her to the left [noise]\nUm you what do you think it is I said well again I I wasn't there it's kind of ... you know it's hard to beat conclusive about it without\nMore information but I noticed\nThat no one else around them noticed it I mean there there are other people who are you or nearby and no one is looking to see you know strange image to their left and so that suggests that that they probably didn't see the time and it may or may not be a camera artifact\nI got ya I got you hey you know it's hard because some things are picked up on camera that we don't see what the eyes some things are picked up from a certain angle and not another angle um they just\nYou know there's some things that are seen that he just the way this shadow in and just that second you know you can take something out but then there's some really crazy things that are picked out that\nThat's ... yeah look like no way it could be anything else but something creepy or you know we're the\nSame at this place was hunting for sure that you talk about or do something to Clinton it man has it changed a lot so what works what doesn't work\nAnd by the way I think in the future we're going to have a whole lot of different types of devices that will measure some of the things we're looking to measure that that we can't measure right now new science you know\nWell yeah I mean they you know one of the interesting aspects of ghost investigation is um is the uh you know a ... for example I was I was doing a teenager who called the mystery quest a while back and I was there was some uh goes for ... um the flu is out to California to investigate a haunted place there and\nAnd they live on all this all these uh those go swinging equip and then just you know there's cameras in him after all is like you know probably Seventy thousand dollars with the gear\nAnd it was all set up and the cameras and lights and I are all that sort of thing\nAnd and I talked to one of the guys who brought all that stuff a little bit later I said you know I'm just curious and we weren't on camera ... this was in like a gotcha moment we're just hanging out with we were finished shooting or going back hotel and said I said why do you think why do you think it is that that we don't we still don't have good quality evidence of goes\nUh I mean even to this day and again this is you know six seven years ago said you know even the the evidence of getting a better it's all these blurry or businessmen and he said well I think that I think the problem the basic problem is that ... that we don't have the technology to does that ghost\nIs easy to get into a GMC when you get into fights

Nineteen sixty seven well we know we've got an proximity could've been sixty eight he could've been sixty six but we've got sixty seven and spoken to these guys\nTo men coming home on them to buy you know ... well after nights out in the seaside town of ... which would be about six miles away\nAnd the only wrote into ... and the eight ten three nine that's why a lot of the stories of the ... will

perceive some kinda ribbon moms to to do what they said he had red eyes and he was it was a dot browning cooler I'm a very big bleeding very big [laughter]\nI struggle to believe there's a breeding population of these things you know off and I honestly believe that we were seeing a glimpse into some other time mentioned and wet at times but did they say there is this area allows these things to slip through into our sphere of existence\nAs you know talking about the portals right\nYeah I mean they've they've got so we're we're going to use for Tony yeah yeah\nBecause you know this this definitely there's got to be some reason because otherwise we wouldn't have such a\nSuch gaps between the science things you would think he'd go watch credit to such as they say we obviously would need to feed you would see the carnage that he left even if he was living on wild games which is dead and they're plentiful around around these ...\n... you would still find some kind of evidence

throughout the years throughout the decades and the\nPeople that had been encouraging Kelly\nI thought that is correct Tony actually might be in a lot more I mean like the old guy in Nineteen forty eight he\nTold me to the story ... knew nothing about it when I spoke to him and he was only when he realized that I was taking a serious and I was doing some deep research I did actually said to me said if you lived in this village fifty years we wouldn't even consider yellow ...\n[laughter] you know so so what's the downside to it I mean they may read about these things I mean I ... in the Nineteen seventies where I mean we've come to that now because there's a story from the Nineteen seventies or any well first written about I didn't research they swam\nA in a book called the ghost

them mind of a magazine when corn and things like that but\nI Am unified from that I just love mysteries um and I just I just think they're and they're fascinating and I try to go into an open mind and I try to use science and look you know look at it from a critical thinking or point of view\nAnd so one so the answer question one thing that happened but if I'm traveling somewhere for if I'm going with my friends and family they just\nKnow that I've been looking like again like we're going to be going going to go to the beach and like that's really cool are you a monster wandering over there and people taking photos and\nThat that that's part of it is I've been able to do a lot of my travels and South America and Africa and elsewhere [noise] uh you know I I haven't either anyway and so I turned into investigation one I can\nLove it love it do I do the same thing you know I mean it it just is what it is you just can't help but it's it's in your mind you that is what you do you you would if you were at that beach hanging out there with them you would just be you're just dying\n[laughter] [laughter] I can actually commit the despite you know despite well my brother to tell you I can relax I can show but you know I'll\nOne quick example it was in Finland about ten years ago and I was there with a friend of mine were traveling looking icebergs and every time I went there when because there's been a series of lobsters are the washed up you know curious you know the creature or whatever they are in the wash up there but [noise]\nAnd there are also Spring Hill jak signing up there but as I was up there I came across um up a place called lake crescent um and it's this little you know ... it's beautiful it's just you know it just Craig crevices and everything and it turns out that there's there's a local lake monster there and so and they actually have a like a twenty foot\nA metal sculpture thing for this thing as you enter the town and the town is the populations

All right\n[laughter] well it's better than stopping the biggest world's biggest ball of the arm or something like that Frank I'm looking at all [laughter] that's great okay\nI'm I'm looking for I go on you know this week I was like okay you know what I Want to talk about the origins of Halloween science I Googled that them down your article that even written 'cause you you do a lot of writing you're not there of course\nThat you do a lot of writing for our life science dot com Discovery News skeptical inquiry magazine and um and some others out there too but I saw this crane articles for Neal and I was like oh my gosh here's the game you know\nAnd it looked into your background so you were legit you weren't just somebody who's writing from somebody else's book or anything like that you actually research so\nSo tell me about the origins ... we're just now learning the origins of saline the gal is the origin of wean\nSee ... I I I Want the two hundred years from now when people were researching the orange is the will of free and they are going to come up\nWith this conversation hurried I'll love it my grandkids will be be all over it there'll be like that I Know\nOne of the things I Love about about you know to to to be honest with you I'm not I'm not big on the on the holidays meaning of Christmas is fun ... but but you know to my mind the one that I really look forward to Halloween\n'cause it's it's you know it it secular a you know people of all religions can enjoy it uh you know sometimes the fundamentalists guess all the the the conservative from time to get all touchy about that because they think it's really the the cult which not but it's it's it's\nBasically something that everybody can sort of jump into [noise] and that's why I really love Halloween is it's it's more than just costumes and candy as a fascinating history\nI'm basically Halloween a ... you know as as with most of these sorts of sort of folklore Rick\nDay's events on holidays there is not just one street lined back right I mean there's there's different influences that come in overtime but basically we can trace it back thousands of years to an October thirty first\nA Celtic or deal with festival called a so when [noise]\nUh and uh we don't we don't have that much human French about just because it was that it was so long ago and there is no the the ... records are pretty sparse fragmentary\nBut it was basically an annual communal a meeting at the end of the year of the harvest and it was a time when of course you know it's wintertime the sauces\nAnd it's the time when I'm you know the the the snow's falling in you know plants are dying [noise] um so it had this connection to uh to darkness\nBut it wasn't sinister by modern standards mean when we can we think we think of the darkness as being you know something after but to them there was very it was ... an analyst point of view wasn't about death or evil it with the changing of the seasons\nAnd so that was so ... so to the people that were celebrating it so in ... scary it was like yes there was a time to you know to a store or grains and to you know give thanks to to to to the gods and and the the spirits and this man [noise]\nUm and it was believed that uh that on that day that the um uh the the the separation between the world's with a sexually thin porous\nSo the rest of the year you know we we were in our happy little world and you know the the other creatures the other Ken [laughter] you know the the ferry folk or what have you know in the world and they leave us alone and we leave them alone but on this day be the the er the barrier between them becomes more porous [noise]\nUm and so this is why are they the began talking about how\nTo steer it toward the would come come forth on this day and it ... people were much more likely to be able to uh see spirits and they were basically all around us\nAnd it wasn't just the um it wasn't just the the idea that the the world's are porous\nUm you know the barrier between them but also\nUm in leader incarnations of Halloween it was also that uh time is porous\nAnd so what you find is that uh the whole would later become Halloween I'm there would be a it would be basically a time when\nI Would be for a time for prophecy so it was this notion that uh you know there's our world and that there are there other worlds but it's also the barrier between the president in our future\nAnd so ah for example in the Eighteen hundreds or there were different customs that would that were involved Halloween which are basically abandoned today people don't really talk about them\nBut there were ideas for example that um that ah ah for example woman born a Halloween would be able to tell the future [noise] um and there would be this a proxy and oftentimes the prophecy\nWas um either dealing with like people who might die the following year or oftentimes it was about marriage and so is there you know often times there's there's very superstitions about young women\nWho would on on Halloween Night or for example they would the would a light a candle in front of a mirror a and a and it was said that you that the the with a look at look in the mirror at midnight and they would see their future husbands reflection [noise]\nUm and so all these sorts of and another one example was bobbing for Apple's you know every now and you see apple bobbing and there was there was a particular Halloween tradition that if you cut the pie appeal than apple in one long continuous strip unbroken\nAnd he tossed it over one shoulder and it was intact when it when it landed it would spell the initials of your future husband so there were so there's this really interesting blend of you know two worlds coming together and past and present coming together\nOn line waiting I got to write them down and and and do this on Halloween Night side doing midnight\nRight on willfully night that's right we'll see [laughter] well\nYou may you may have your own little um I'll give you your own little outline of what to do but I Want to know about you know trick or treating and where that came in but I Want you to use your own timeline to get that and I want to\nYou know I get there are people that say Halloween you know same same thing and and um you know I like I Know a lot of conservative people that they're they're cool with it you know um but um you know I always see it is fun I see it and uh I\nAnd we think of cold Jack o lantern that you get to make I think of fall whether I think of orange and black colors I think a fake little cartoons that we would watch like which is an led goblins\nAnd and they're very fun fun thing that's how I see it and it's terrible I thing and you know people get really deep into it and and all of a sudden they take the fun out of it in the traditions out of it and and uh I I don't know I just we wish we could just all get along so\nHang in there for a little bit okay we're gonna have to take a break here but what we have is a banner rapper\nWith us he is an investigator and an end to all the things that were into a as coast folks here is that want to learn everything\nUm but he also you know there's a lot of writing and he looked into the Oregon so talent lean and we're going to learn more from him about that and also goes hunting too so stay with his county well let's hear it's Willis ... hang on and you don't know what you might here tonight\n\n\nWelcome back to coast to coast am county Willis here discussing the origins of Halloween on Willis ... talking with Ben ran for Ben so as you tell us about the origins of Halloween\nIt really does have um an interesting history very rich in history um it's silly it's scary and gets St panicking gets kind of crazy I enjoy watching the\nAh television shows around the time of Halloween or that were the fun ones the little peanut characters that's always fun with the ah great pumpkin and all that kind of stuff um but I like the fun ones and and I like when people dress up you know like the vampires and the Frankenstein I like the really good scary stuff\nI don't like that sometimes it gets pretty lame and people just dress up like somebody else which to me they can you know it it they dress up like you know just a regular kind of normal like Superman or something like that they can do that any time of the year\n... you don't pay any creativity to go to target and put on you know a Batman masking make make I'm I'm Out of it you know yes\nThat greed and and and do you know make a Jack o lantern and put a real candle in there and let smell that smell of burning pumpkin is so cool I Love it love it all\nAbsolutely you know I mean that's that's one of the beyond that that's really what's the course these days um although you know Halloween was never really mainly a children's holiday and it really didn't become focused on Capitol Hill about Nineteen fifty\nBefore that it was I mean kids were involved but it wasn't really a kids' kid centered as it is today\nA it was more of a community thing again sort of you if you go back to go back to win and the the theory\nA Celtic version of it which were very antagonistic and and again sort of dealing with the changing of the season and darkness and snow and all that [noise] um but you know so you you had that and then that sort of what happened was that\nUm that that someone got mixed in along with offing state which was November first which was you know obviously the next day\nWhich was a to honor that the church a church going to have gone to heaven\nAnd then also got wrapped up to a whole day was November second which bills are wrong for the phone purgatory\nAnd so there was this it was interesting transition from an early purely pagan meal ritual which died out long before you know the the church was even writing about ... anything like that\nAnd then you have the the influence of the Catholic Church with all the and the whole day\nAnd and again they were the ringing a bell and some time to do her own to keep away a demons and scary things could loud noise were set to scare away the evil [noise] um and that sort of transform a little later on into the modern costumes because what happened is\nA you know could we are talking about you where the coffee come from and one one part of it is the ah it believe that a drink so and the leaders would wear animal skins I'm there and sometimes the animal heads like handlers want not during the ceremonies\nAnd they weren't there they weren't doing it to fool anybody of course everybody knows that they were but it was a ritual thing in terms of honoring the land and the animals that were given to them [noise]\nUm but then later on during the late Eighteen hundreds and England was customary for the wealthy remembers in town to offer a small payment or food um to the poor during Halloween bring for the dead and this again the ties back into all folded because the idea was that\nUm that on that they are the folks that were important or you know they were they were basically trapped between ... and now the\nAnd so the the the wealthier members of the communities would basically a higher out there were ... it was sub contract the prayers if you will to these numbers and so these these people would go from house to house asking for what were called ... which uh type of bread\nAnd in return for paying for praying for those purgatory so they would they would do dances and songs and rituals\nAre going from house to house getting little tokens of of of food\nOr or coin hum and often times they would care with them how to turn up of course that would lead or translate into uh the the the the uh the public and I'm looking\nAt a candle at the land from the candle in it and the candles light represented the soul the person they were pray for\nThe idea was that they were these numbers go as far as to how so you know yes will pray for if you're a member of your family who's a who's passed on I'm with you know holding up this this turn up with a candle to think of this late as the the soles but don't you wants to pray for them they would say yes\nAnd then of course when that came over with the Irish immigrants to to America\nUm the turn of the sort of got lost by the wayside which is just as well if you ask me\nTo read when that's when the pumpkins came in\nBecause the pumpkin associate course they're they're bigger they're they're more fun to carve and associate with the harvest and that's that's sort of how the the trick or treating after I came along\nOh I like that yeah I agree with you turn now move on sale Munch on little olive oil salt pepper um\nCandy I guess I guess it all turned into candy at one point in that like right after the ... like you were talking about\n[noise] yeah well I mean it ... it was interesting because again the sort of the things things sort of parsed out along gender lines for a while because of what happened is that if you think about it you know again that was the ... the mom and going on this and that\nAnd then uh the the ... during this time the the genders had pretty strict social world and so um and as I mentioned earlier during Halloween by the time when when young girls would\nWould pining away and with ... think of you know who which which cute boy they would marry and the next town over who probably have three or four teeth of the time who knows\n'cause that's what they did\nUm but you know so that that's what they were doing so so ... ... if you think about like during this time this is when people would go from house to house in the ... the mom and get sort of gone away but the tradition of going to people's houses to knock on the door and you know sort of trick or treat and give us give us a little token or something [noise]\nUm I mean you would be inappropriate for young women to do that they wouldn't really go out alone by themselves during during that era\nSo that was typically sort of a young man ... you know ... a mixture of this young man's project in the the the girls and women would tend to be more indoors and that's where you get the apple bobbing and rituals in terms of you know the prophecy in those sorts of things so [noise] so you know by the late Eighteen hundreds of the traditional playing pranks on Halloween was pretty well established\nAnd and that's when ah you know as as the religious aspect sort of faded away right I mean they were [noise]\nPeople were no longer you know going from house to house asking for little bits of bread to to pray for you know sold in purgatory [laughter] that's all that's a little that's a little a little outlandish for for a little too much work for these days\nSo that's when that's where it came down to treats and even even today I mean I remember when I was a kid a not so long ago I like to say\nUh you know they were it was a member of you know every now I get to get a silver dollar or are you sometimes you get an apple you're like\nReally really a capital okay and I like it was like it was like some really tart apple was like you went out of your way to find a nasty apple did you I didn't say that I'm like Oh thank you but anyway [laughter]\nYou know well I you know I remember when we would go a long time ago it was great you remember the good house together since they were there were years where you get full sized candy bars and by the way if you came up to our house which was on a hill and it was scary and we would play that all\nHaunted house record where you heard the green and she is right and it was very dark so you can risk if you were brave enough to go to our house he would get full size bars you know marathon bar and you get in a handful\nYou're the only ... I Love that I Love the marathon bars but they were like growl and chocolate and they they were like a foot and a half long yeah and they were just great they're great harm does I I haven't heard anybody mentioned those in decades oh that's\nA horrible ... you got a full on you got a phone lines you can't replace\nA wish I'd been there\nI Can't believe they don't make those any more of those are fantastic but but we were when we would go trick or treating and and we had to kind of far up on his way money all the other way and you had your son that's when they had those nasty nasty you couldn't breathe or anything but at the time\nWe would never want him at all you had homemade popcorn ball they were delicious it was the only time we ever had on there were awesome and you know back then you could trust the people\nAnd then of course you know you hear about razor blades in apples and things like that but then there was another person's house that they were a dentist and they only gave away toothbrushes like we don't want to go there you know thank you yeah drinker tree thank you [laughter]\nI I should mention that because of all three answers the the ah the more modern scares a and you know you mentioned the the the the classic a poison ... and the reason the aspect and\nThe fact is that that I mean that's that's there's there's almost no truth to that ah it's it's widely talked about a friend of mine ... best wrote a book about that um and and you know so when you actually look at at the cases where somebody who's actually tainted these sorts of things\nHustler super the lawnmowers have been built for speech\nHe delivers superior quantity of much less operator components humidity than ready to go reliability year after year too much more is our first and last all about getting the job done fast\nMe for believing Fifteen mile an hour which is that no other ... in America\nThe hustler supersede seats a hustler ... governments formed supply five miles west of South Dakota\nSomebody more now everyone is using drugs and the other one sports all the time for the American as best selling brand it's five o'clock [noise]\nHe's CBS News on the hour sponsored by the recruiter\nJailer the president gets his way Brett Kavanaugh confirmed by the post is built on a Supreme Court nominee and a hundred and fifty years Republican Senator Susan Collins the deciding vote telling CBS face the nation I\nDie judge cabin Hans ... second herring what's very powerful his anger and as the anguish I think it's understandable given that he's been accused of being involved in gang rape when\n... got his man on the Supreme Court and Saturday Night at a Kansas political Raleigh President Trump did not spare the ...\nWe got ourselves the finest legal mind one of the finest human beings and again what his family took the the horror that they had to endure not\nStopping his political blast over that at a rally he later tweeted Democrats have become too extreme and too dangerous to govern Tom Foley CBS News Wall Street\nBelieves eleven dead earthquake in Haiti Indonesia five thousand reported still missing after the earthquake and tsunami their search for the missing will end this we better can authorizing a thorough study of how ex cardinal Theodore ... through the ranks despite repeated allegations he had sex with young priest\nPush for transparency includes one retired archbishop call for instance to step down BBC's Danny everhart says\nTrump's declined to respond directly to ... begin to those claims of African statement doesn't mention specifically but he repeated a ... made by the pope three years ago we will follow the positive truth wherever it may lead\nDeadly terror in Israel\nA Palestinian gunman opened fire inside a West Bank factory killing two Israelis and wounding a third the gunman who had worked at the factory escaped\nPolice are calling it a terrorist attack it follows the killing of three Palestinians by Israeli troops on friday during violent protests um the Gaza border Robert burgers CBS News Jerusalem\nThat the world of mixed martial arts got a little crazier last night in Las Vegas to time champion Conor McGregor beaten by still undefeated copy but normally go up he jumped into the stands to punch wanna McGregor partners at the same time\nA couple of number government of the entourage entered the Cajun sucker punch McGregor Dennis new ... with ...

the mind of radio well he's out and about all the time\nHe's roaming around having a good time talking to people singing doing all sorts of nice things and one of the next stop is going to be march twenty third its way out so you know you can think about it [laughter]\nRight and you can go ahead and plan ahead because that's not till next year that's going to be at the historic ever theater in Everett, Washington\nThere back they had a great time before so there there again and if you'd like to learn more about who the people are going to be what the event what's going to happen you know you know it is a Tommy Dan ... or an Wagner entertainment special so don't give me a call and you just go ahead and look at our website\nYeah they were and they came in that was like a red and black rapper written or something yeah\nAnd the ruler on the back\nOh man I I mean anything to go after we're done here\nAnd uh and uh I I didn't know that um that er what's his face it last year by McGregor so I I I learned that tonight in fact if I weren't here talking to you I'd probably be watching the fight\nThere you go it's gone now is there any way Yeah Yup yup\nYup member on all the producers were were watching that say hey you guys are going on the air now still well knowing all the origins of Halloween talking about the the past and even what you think about the teacher said panic part and all that good stuff\nNow another element and some people they don't you know their past the trick or treating stage their past doing the tricks you know and all that kind of stuff and now what they do is they doing to cemeteries or they go into the woods or they go into you know the um um\nBanned in homes or a ban in hospitals and things like that and they go inside these places and they use the energy board on Halloween Night or they\nOr they use now all the different devices to call upon spirits in Dallas now you have you in Britain quite a few books actually and you do a lot of writing and oh my gosh good for you I I ... and that's why I like to talk\nOf her life I'll just say that oh I\nI Do like your like your latest book is about goes hunting and investigating what to look for what to do and also um what it used to be like in the past in what the difference now I think I found it interesting that you had said to me\nThat people will go into cemeteries and Dell to talk to the spirit were years back people would get ... why would you want to talk to a stranger\nYou know maybe call upon your family members somebody now and that's true like I don't know\nThat was that was set up with things that I uh when I was researching my book are investigating goes to those\nIs basically a survey of of the scientific attempts to to contact the dead I'm ranging from basically pre history a but primarily through the the the Victorian era up and up at today's you know goes hunters and all that\nAnd what you find is that the the idea that I mean you know people have been talking if it did for millennia I mean that's you know there's references or in the winter of indoor and the Bible and Shakespeare you know you're leaving Beth I mean banquet so there's\nThere's there's there there's no shortage of go see him in literature and history but you know typically\nGhosts or if it's typically if people if you want to talk to a ghost you'd be talking to them for a reason for example you'd be talking to\n'em your your your great grandfather or your your your best friend that that died recently ... and the the idea that somebody would go into like a haunted house where there's the Myrtle plantation\nOr a Wally house or you know what what have you go to a hundred location and\nTalk to some random spirit that just happens to be there and say Hi can you give us inside and you don't know me but\nTell me about yourself that that's that's a that's a relatively new phenomena hum and it's it's fast and you know you go back and look at the the the onto that were held in in the Victorian era\nOf upper class uh places and they would have you know a lady they they've Crumpet some tea and the and you know they try to communicate with the ghosts and then\nYou'd have the spiritual Sarah [noise] um and you had people like Harry Houdini trying to research the Marjorie ... and all these spiritual is that you know came to the states and Medicaid Maggie Fox and and and they're you know their their stuff and so\nAnd then your hair your price and his researching all that and then you sort of fast forward to\nUh the the the ... the idea and you know the electronic voice phenomena and the idea that you can record you communicate with goes through white noise and prove based on a broken radio that switches channels and then you sort of fast forward to\nWhom the more modern day go ... with the the TV shows and all the spin offs and goes inventors and all that and it's just fascinating when you sort of look at the history of these sorts of things and look through techniques have been tried and and you know what works what doesn't and and how do we know\n[noise] yeah I Need to get a you know it's already kind of creepy announcer spooky enough or even scary enough when you do get some sort of interaction when you are going to try to talk to spirit the\nUm it it's scary when you get somebody talking to you but\nPeople take that step further and they hope in a pinch and you don't know who they're poking at ... I mean they're really trying hard to get interaction and you don't you don't know if it's going to be somebody nice or not and uh they go home with you you know that's where\nI grew up in on it how high is the last thing I wanted to go around me I prefer ... or looking at them as a guy like I don't want something going home with me even though people claim that those things go home with them too\nBut you know what I mean ... if you um talked about exercises and things like that one of my friends is archbishop James long changes like you don't click provoking clip promoting you don't know who or what you're talking to\nAnd that's what they were there that\nYou're not doing yourself when he favors thereby ... whatever maybe they're\nRight you don't know what it is that the evil or not evil or what it is it All right I mean um\nWell you you talk about in your book there's different guidelines for scientifically investigating these reports how you do that same typically\n[noise] well there's a couple of things you know one of the first things you do is um you establish I mean I I've done I've done you know many goes ministry since myself\nUm and as I said I I come to being more science based uh someone say skeptical point of view that doesn't mean that I just miss everything it just means that you know I'm not going to believe anywhere you sound as that goes and so\nThe first thing that I Do want to go into a case is try to establish a water the false viable claims that is what exactly is being claimed to you know if someone saying that there's\nThere's a mysterious sound or laughing or something in the hallway or is there a photograph for me what\nWhat exactly is is is going on there and then the question is can we tested repeatable right is it is it is the sound that comes up you know every every full moon I'm you know what's going on here and so a lot of times\nAh unfortunately a lot of the the ghost hunting you see on TV uh is is not very scientific um it it it looks exciting look dramatic you know it's all of course you know reality\nTV in court t._v. reality you know in in scare quotes um and I and I've I've been on\nMany of the TV shows as you pointed out I was a soft I've done you know on both sides of the camera on this and you know and my my point of view is always\nYou know I I don't make fun of both arms because I I've done goes hunting and I I've I've done a lot of that and so my my point is if you're going to do than do it right you know bring science to bring good good critical thinking too so I'll give you one quick example so one problem I often see\nHe's the co centers on TV and and not actually just across the board is is are you in this applies even you know amateur groups across the country is they typically engaged in what's called the anomaly hunting\nAnd that is they're they're looking for they're they're sampling the environment whether it's a\n... you know you EMS or magnetic uh frequencies water temperature drops whatever it is and they're the they're they're sampling the environment and looking for something weird and they're saying okay well if we will will go here and we'll be there from you know midnight until you know\nUntil six AM and we'll take all these reading and walk around a little ... things and then they get our\nHours of audio tapes and videotape and they combed through them and they try and look for anything we all look at it it's ... pm am you know we saw this thing\nAnd the problem is that oftentimes they're forgetting to investigate the original claim they're you know the first thing you need to do is when you when you talked on a witness and you you you research the history of the house and what the claims are easy to investigate those particular claims\nAnd and oftentimes that sort of gets pushed by the wayside in their eagerness to you know do this sort of eating and you know get the get the cameras on and we're going to walk around here and all these sort of things\nAnd and and that that's part of the problem here is that if it if you're going to sample the environment there's nothing wrong with that problem is that\n[noise] that are in almost all cases\nThey don't they don't have a good grasp of of of a of the amount of data needed to adequately sample look so for example you'll see a ghost hunter go into the location maybe there's team of them\nInto you know do take readings for three hours or sick or wherever else look they'll go home and analyze them the problem is that not nearly enough time to get a good baseline right in order to know what's\nWhat's what's um more abnormal you need to know what's normal\nAnd whatever reading is you get\nThought from Geico motorcycle he took Fifteen minutes to purchase the gas station ... [noise]\n... [noise] I don't regret the gas station ... as you presented numbers to the board [noise] to add insult to injury you could've used those Fifteen ... minutes just what your motorcycle insurance to going go\nOh\nTwo minutes ... percent or more on motorcycle insurance\n\n\nIt's coast to coast am Connie Willis here\nWill is to wean his what's going on right now and we're talking with\nBenjamin Radford he also is an investigator of mysteries and an author and one of his latest book\nIs called investigating dose and it's um it's very interesting book it talks about ah well what's what's bringing back on year been we were talking about uh how you investigating how you first go in it to an area where somebody says there's these things happening\nAnd I want to here's a question\nThat I Want to know that I I really don't know and a lot of people I don't think they have any clue either but everybody tries to be cool you know um when you look at a picture of photographs\nAnd someone says this is a picture I talk to you know some ... there's a lot of really great people out there that they really have things happening and they have great pictures of possibly something\nAnd I love that I mean we all want that but then there are some people out there that want to say things\nSo when you do see a picture how do you know what his photoshopped what is not photo shop what might just be a glitch ... what might be a maybe a light reflecting off\nOr the difference between an orbit and a piece of dust how the analyzing of photos\nTell us about that I Know that that's a good question I have to say that um you know I've I've probably look that up to three hundred and photographs over the years people have sent me I'm\nI'm the same with the triple crown on the on the recipient of\nTrip [laughter] dog in Texas but I after we left them afterwards\nAnd I I have to say that I rarely encountered hoaxes um on occasion but I Would say probably Seventy to eighty percent of the the goes photos of them sent by\nPeople who just photograph something weird and they yeah they're not lying and they're not too much much help one over on me they're like oh\nThey're just like have weird you know can you can you help me figure this out [noise]\nUm and so you are going to each other you know trying to figure it out and to help them as best I can answer one of the things I encourage them to do\nBecause you know I I if if someone sends me if a photograph I Can't just drop what I'm doing to fly off to you know to\nDenver to [laughter] go researcher go sort of much why not\nBecause I haven't trademark Willis lean and gun is often [laughter]\nSplit it with me that's all I ask you know as\nA no but it's um [noise] so so there's a couple of things one of them is the is I Want one possible I Try to go to the the location or was filmed and try and figure it out so all you mentioned earlier um one case I'm known for which is the Santa Fe courthouse coast case\nThat happened about I don't know maybe ten years or so ago and it was in in Santa Fe New Mexico the capital a which is about an hour north of here\nAnd it was a video taken outside of a a courthouse and it was really strange glowing or the thing that the cross this this railings camera [noise] um\nThan it was you know it was it was seen by deputy uh so you know that there's probably [laughter] that would that make that gave him credibility right it's a deputy on the courthouse\nCameras though the likelihood of this being a hoax was was that dropped off considerably at that point [noise]\nUm but what I ended up doing was ... I went to the story a bit was made national news and people are all this weird thing over\nAnd because I live in the state again I'm about an hour away I ... I went up there and investigators night I went and then I went to the courthouse I looked at the camera and I talked with the deputies interviewed people\nAnd I had some ideas of what it might be\nUm and I did some experiments I eventually you solve the case and figured out what it was and so part of the answer is you you look at the the the the video or the photograph and he tried to figure out what or alternative explanations right so I usually I make a list of\nThree four or five different things you know could be could be an insect could be a hoax because it'd be a ghost is or is there are some I mean so you just basically any anything that he is even remotely possible I Try and lift those\nAnd I tried to rank them terms of what's most likely which which things can I find typically test which things can actually you know investigating falsify\n'em and you just basically go to a list and and that's that's one of the things I Do so so one key thing that the seaport and uh and it's not always possible because sometimes you know it's\nThe the photograph is you know Thirty years old and it was taken in you know in in Poland and you know who knows where the hell they came from [noise] but but when possible it's good to try and replicated so ... for example a woman sent me a photograph that she took in a hotel in Deadwood\nAnd I said you know are you are you still there should know this was a couple of years back I knew it was a sort of\nImage does he she saw in a room in the mirror and I said well again it it's it would be I could I could be more help if this was a recent photograph not just a couple of years back in different states but I said\nThe you know if you if you do go back there if you were still there go back and tried to replicate it you know to take the say take the photograph\nAt the same place ideally at the same time of day um and see if you see if there's something in the background that that you know might might be you know it might be mistaken for a ... a an image of her face or something\nThe cell and I get that I get that and\nBut you know I guess that that thing whatever that might be in there like you said and it might be people might think\nWell I'll give you another example one of\nAll I was gonna say you know one of it is um [noise] you know if it's on the one question comes up as the other people see it right and so this is right\nThere is often the case of where you know there's there's an extra for example behind sanding behind somebody a and actually I was sent to an example this a couple of months back and they said oh this is the weirdest thing you know my cousins here and there was this there was a sort of weird goes the image or ... just behind her to the left [noise]\nUm you what do you think it is I said well again I I wasn't there it's kind of ... you know it's hard to beat conclusive about it without\nMore information but I noticed\nThat no one else around them noticed it I mean there there are other people who are you or nearby and no one is looking into you know strange image to their left and so that suggests that that they probably didn't see the time and it may or may not be a camera artifact\nI got ya I got you hey you know it's hard because some things are picked up on camera that we don't see what the eyes some things are picked up from a certain angle and not another angle um they just\nYou know there's some things that are seen that he just the way this shadow in and just that second you know you can take something out but then there's some really crazy things that are picked out that\nThat's ... yeah look like there's no way it could be anything else but something creepy or you know we're the\nSame at this place was hunting for sure that you talk about or do something to Clinton in men is it changed a lot so what works what doesn't work\nAnd by the way I think in the future we're going to have a whole lot of different types of devices that will measure some of the things we're looking to measure that that we can't measure it right now new science you know\nWell yeah I mean they you know one of the interesting aspects of ghosts investigation is um is the uh you know of ... for example I was I was doing a teenager who called the mystery quest a while back and I was there was some uh goes for ... um the flu is out to California to investigate a haunted place there and\nAnd they live on all this all these are the gross telling the equipment and just you know there's cameras in him after all is like you know probably Seventy thousand dollars of all the gear\nAnd it was all set up and the cameras and lights and I are and all that sort of thing\nAnd and I talked to one of the guys who brought all that stuff a little bit later I said you know I'm just curious and we weren't on camera I mean I ... this was like a gotcha moment where just hanging out with were finished shooting or going back to hotel and said I said why do you think why do you think it is it that we don't we still don't have good quality evidence of goes\nUh I mean even to this day and again this is you know six seven years ago said you know even the the evidence of getting a better it's all these blurry or businessmen and he said well I think that I think the problem the basic problem is that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory",
