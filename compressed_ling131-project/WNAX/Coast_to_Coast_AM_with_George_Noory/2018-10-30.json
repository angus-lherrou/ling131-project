you know they no longer have any consideration for hot wheels are Barbie dolls\nThe real problem is there are fewer kids about twenty five percent pure kids under ten now than there were ten years ago maybe just maybe that has something to do with their ... their sales decline\nIt could be it makes me\nCrazy and you know seriously Georgia if you have a twenty five percent decrease in the size of beer market I don't care if you're if you're in General Motors or or Amazon by your ... your sales are going to decline it it they're just they weren't born they don't exist [noise]\n[noise] you know they don't but how do you look into a crystal ball can make these predictions if you're running a business\nWhat it what you do is is it the what's the most important question for any business a business you know I I I was a\n[noise] an opportunity to speak to the chief marketing officer is in the hospitality industry about two years ago\nAnd and everyone was there and at a shark him as their Hilton was there and Google was their American Express was there these are all people that have to do with with the ... the industry\nAnd I asked him I said what's the most important question you need to ask yourself right now and and I'm In the ... you know come on marketing folks ... million dollar salaries in this room and it was about twelve people in the room and sitting around and round table\nAnd and they eat their answer\nWas you know a Google said it's it's the uh understanding social media and how to advertise hundred market on social media and and the American express said we have to get into their heads we have to we have to understand this new generation y I'm you know how they think how they buy\nAnd Hilton says it's it's about new products it's about making your room smaller in your lobbies bigger\nYou know what the answer is the answer is is how big is your market and it's getting bigger or smaller\nThat's right it's all about demographics isn't\nAs it because if you are market is getting smaller I don't care how good you are Levi Strauss called me up and asked me what was going on with their market ... ... you know it it for about Twenty years they could make their product fast enough they literally couldn't meet the demand\nAnd all of a sudden sales started trailing off is was Nineteen\nNinety eight [noise] and I and I said I'm\nSo your your sales are are are going flat and he said yeah what do we have a demographic issues as to the chief marketing officer in San Francisco Levis and and I said a Hoosier customer and he said and Eighteen to thirty four year old man and woman Eighteen to thirty four and I said what happens at thirty four years old that they can't buy your product and he said well we could they don't fit in the product any more\nYou realize you're a boomer business and he said yes I said they'll act baby boomers born Nineteen sixty four Nineteen sixty four I said I Am thirty four years to Nineteen sixty four where you come up with and he said it was a pause and he said Nineteen Ninety eight\nAnd I said we're in it and he said Nineteen Ninety eight\nThey said what does that mean and what that means is to be you know you're you're laughing gas just checked out of your hotel and their their sales one from eight billion get this George eight billion to two and about three years while because they're not paying attention to demographic\nYou know if you want to count money count money go ahead knock yourself out\nBut if you want to understand where money came from it came from people count people and you will understand\nWell is it is simple to Ken to talk to that demographic you need to go after a bench ally and find out some of the things they enjoy\nAnd look at those trends in you find out that you know if there are kids Eighteen to twenty four years old younger people find out from them what did they do what do they like where do they go do they go to movies do they not and then adjust yourself to that\n[laughter] Georgia too smart [laughter]\nBut but that doesn't that sound like like logic yeah common sense it's not so common ... said that\nLike you know I I Do um I'll speak to an audience of five hundred people and and I'll say everybody stand up and then I'll say everybody born before Nineteen sixty five sit down that's an I say that's the boomers everybody you see that the boomers all sat there and I'll say okay if you were born before Nineteen eighty five sit down\n... and another large groups that found it and I said that's Jenn ... about three people standing and I said this next Gen y that Gen Y or the millennials are born ... or eighty five to two thousand for this eighty seven million of them\nI said you want to know about the new market you you have to hire these people and you don't have a clue because they're not\nThe two thousand for this eighty seven million of them I said you want to know about the new market you have to hire these people and you don't have a clue because they're not here and it makes me crazy [noise]\n[noise] well it's it's ... you got to adjust because if you don't you're not you're not going to succeed yeah what's happening with what's happening like companies like McDonald's are they on top of things they used to be marketing geniuses something slipping\nBut I Know you don't want to tell people I'm McDonald's same store sales are off you know they're they're held their increases are coming from um their overseas operation [noise]\nI I I tell folks I said listen generation y is now fourteen to thirty three years old it's eighty seven million people are just now starting to have children [laughter]\nI said and they realize what their parents were feeding them for the last Twenty years [noise] you ought to three ends up of a food\nCalled nutrition nutrition nutrition and what is McDonald's famous for its not nutritious [laughter] no it's it's for French fries\nGarden lists of what they tried to say heart [noise] people have the impression that it's not nutritional food\n[noise] exactly correct and and so that's that's their problem and they they ... if you if you want to sell food now if you want to sell food\nIt in the supermarket and if you want to sell food in a restaurant you need to sell good food he can't tell you you can't sell stuff that's going to stop people's hearts\nWhat's going on with population trends are are they shifting down to\n[noise] yeah well you know it's funny you say that uh in Nineteen ... if if we we have a new generation is called Generation Z\nAnd Generation Z started in two thousand five and they will they will be a but it will end around two thousand twenty four so they're not fully born yet [noise]\nBut in Nineteen eighty seven excuse me two thousand seven we had a record year in the United states we ... we have four million a three hundred and sixteen thousand babies were born and that that was more than Nineteen fifty seven which was the previous record fifty one years earlier [noise] by\nWhat's happened since two thousand seven is is the the population has dropped like a stone we we've gone from producing a over four million babies a year down to a just a little over three million babies a year and and so this Generation Z will be smaller yeah\nThat's a big trend can stay with us we'll talk more about trends when we come back we'll take calls with you next hour here on coast to coast am get\nLearn to grow learned to succeed and learn to thrive at Arizona State university to learn more about an see one line degrees tax base to three five five seven that's S P a the the the three five five one seven\n[noise]\n\n\nThere and walk back and brought back with us as we talk about trends the incredible trends that the I guess can not just businesses should be using things like this I Would guess anybody who's doing something marketing niche you name it should be aware of these things should night\nYeah absolutely it does [noise] it it it's mysterious to me well why everyone doesn't take about this because it precipitating ... almost everything that we have in a market economy\nHow much has the smartphone change these things\n[noise] well it has to a large degree um\n[noise] the [noise]\nYou know and what what I tell people when when they asked me a question like that people are still people when when you have a large number of people that are consumer a specific product at a small number of people that consume a product the large number of people will consume more though I Know that sounds ...\nBut the the the smartphone has only aged folks and their ability to consume\nSo it's it's a good thing from from that standpoint\nBut you have to keep in mind that the thing that drives commerce of the thing that drives you know consumption is the number of people in the market period\nThat that [noise]\nBut the thing that drives you know consumption is the number of people in the market period\nThat [noise] that that simple isn't it\nWhat it meant it almost sounds ridiculous stuff in it but I'm ... I mean who is out there saying well okay so large groups of people consume a lot of stuff and then there's ... people consume\nSmaller amounts of stuff but if I read the wall Street Journal every day and I read the marketing section and I know that the wall Street Journal just based on what I read doesn't understand that\nBecause they they look look let me give you an example that you know SUVs actually these were were bought by baby boomers are Twenty years ago in in vast quantities\nAnd then the the um [noise] I'm I'm a bill companies had to figure out how to sell the same number of SUVs to a generation X. as they did to the baby boomers and they couldn't do it so they they kept on firing their marketing departments that have kept on firing their\nTheir chief marketing officers because they couldn't come up with the secrets to selling as many SUVs to this other group but nobody bothered to count them and this other group of generation and now you find that they can be for small\nGood point my my twenty four year old granddaughter Ken was talking to a couple of days ago and she said pop on you know kids are age she calls herself ... but she's young woman now we're not getting married like you folks used to and that's another trend can isn't it\nYeah and in you know it it's funny 'cause I'm trying to figure that one out because you know half of the kids that are born today or the babies that are born and that's all about you know demographics are born outside of wedlock and they're they're born outside of a of a marriage um\nMarriages seemed to come after the kids are born as opposed to for before a and there are certain cultures like the African American culture a where Seventy five percent of the kids are born outside of the the uh\nMarriage ... it's just it's a different time George\nNow if you could understand that so whether it's a you know we're talking a lot about business but if you can understand that how much can you affect change\n[noise] well you know that that's another good question I'm not so sure that you can I I think you mean in terms of changing what the culture is doing\nI think the culture is going to do with the culture is going to do and right now we have the largest generation and history of our nation is currently fourteen to thirty three years old eighty seven ... million generation why millennials and I think they're going to do what they're going to do just like the uh uh you know you go back to the forty years\nAnd ... ... you look at the you know what happened in the sixties and early seventies but the hippie culture they did what they did they just simply did what they did but then what happened they grew up uh you know I I actually spoke to my audience what happened to the to a sex drugs and rock and roll what happens in the ... the boomer hippies\nWell it became Republicans\n\nIn all cases\n[laughter] no not at all cases but you know if if you if you look at it this this is ... let me back up a second because this is something that that people need to understand [noise]\n[noise] ah [noise] between the ages right now I'm thirty four and fifty three we have a diminutive puppy population of of indigenous people that were born here\nThey were there were only about sixty nine million people born between sixty five an eighty four as opposed to the boomers that were that were roughly eighty million born between forty five and sixty four [noise]\nWhat does that mean that means that that that particular population could not a support the labor needs that we had in our country and it sucked in immigrants like like a a a vacuum\nThat particular generation right now is the generation that is make making people think that we're a nation of haves and have nots when when what we are as a nation that has a small indigenous population\nOf superimpose over where the heavy lift or should be with the with the you know our our strength should be in our population it's actually smaller\nSo the net result is a you know\nIt's interesting it's kind of having a you know ... ... and they should have haves and have nots with with a cushion in between of generation X we don't because they were never born we're losing a cushion\n[noise] yeah well what we did in ... so if you have people saying that the the United States is is broken because we have the have nots but middle age and and I'm In a middle income\nOr our occupy exactly the same space so\nIf you're middle ages small and then your middle income is small as well but it's a demographic issue is just simply a question of of how many babies were born for that particular period\n[noise] can't let me ask you this to me let's use Facebook as an example you know they they've got the billions of people on line or they've got huge amounts of advertising dollars because of what they do socially\nBut I think they're starting to lose that I think they're starting to there's becoming a change there or I think advertisers you begin to say I'm not sure we're getting the bank for a dollar a year or more converting these into sales\nBecause the market may not be what we really want to what's happening with that\n[noise] a Facebook has kind of strange [noise] entity if you will and I tell folks listen it if you're if you're not paying for it you are not the customer you're the product\n[noise] um as far as I'm concerned and I and I've got Twenty one years experience in the marketing industry the Internet are um advertising is a bottomless pit you have no idea what your pie none and there's no way\nTo reference any kind of success except return on investment so you you spend money on the Internet and and you just cross your fingers and hope that your sales go up your for your sales go up you know you don't know if it's if it's\nA relative to how much money you spend on the Internet but about what what's happening with a a ... a enterprise there is is not good it really isn't\nI mean it's huge but there's a trend here and to me the trend is very negative that it\nIs involved in what's negative about it is is uh I I think he's totally disingenuous\nI I don't trust 'em a Facebook at all I really don't I don't think I I think you have to understand George that everything that anybody writes on on Facebook can be analyzed\nAnd then the ... and and that analysis puts people into categories and those categories are are syllable and and what the soccer Berg does with that information is sell it to anybody who pay for it\nUh are syllable and and what the secretary does with that information is sell it to anybody who will pay for it so there there's there's there's no security and anything that you put on Facebook nothing\nAnd well what about you know some of these wacky job so you know the idiot that killed eleven people in the Jewish synagogue the guy who sent all these bombs these pipe bombs they use social media to kind of spelled their hatred how can we can't catch them a little

know this dirty laundry in public I just wish it wouldn't happen\nNow all of them but ... let me ask you this devil's advocate in by the way I've commented on his tweeting too because I think he needs to be a little more presidential he's got some great ideas I'm a a lot of great ideas I don't agree with everything he says\nBut I'd rather be a little more presidential a little more dignified when in back off the tweeting and stuff like that but\nIf he let them spot what they did without defending themselves then what happens to them\n[noise] I I think that would in their punishment will be [laughter] what they've said and and um [noise] uh I I don't know I I think what he has done is dignify it in the argument and I and I don't think there is one I really don't\nKnow what I mean somebody got paid a lot of money to to do what they did and she got it and I mean there was a reason for that could lead to it who pushed it who knows but\nYou don't get me a and you know on one hand you got to defend yourself on the other how much do you hire yourself in it and just move on and say you know folks I already said it I'm done with it and end it like that\nIt exactly George ... and I respect the the um the criticism I really do of of ... my comment because when I stray outside of demography\nMy position on the ... and my ability to forecast what's next based on demography is based on a very macro view a very thirty thousand foot view [laughter]\nWhen it you know you you asked me a question about the president I'm I made the comment about the president but that was really subjectivity on my part that I mean that's what I feel\nRight to know arguing yeah kind of\n... what's what's going to happen going forward if it is it right now we have a polarized country in the country is polarized\nJust like it was in the sixties early seventies because we have a huge population of young people in a huge population of old people and in between there is a small population that does not offer\nMe the a ... of either of those too so uh\nWell what I like about Dana's remarks though is she's she said how she felt without screaming without putting you down for your views and that's what it's all about that's the way it should be exactly\n[laughter] yeah so so my my comment today and it would be thank you for your position it's like for that yelling at me\n[laughter] that's good though in Long Island New York Hey Joe go ahead Hi\nKen two questions so it it talked about the wall Street Journal having more HIV patients that are ... and one issue than ... people have it you know than\nThan how the system that slashing explosion basically people pick and choose a their information or even at a a professional level what what are the size of a sense of the few look at Japan people used to like\nTwenty years ago the people\nJust for twenty four seven almost a year and it just hasn't worked out it and then the federal level in Japan for people with that high octane a drive to a stay at the office told them that night or whatever [noise]\nAh so maybe they're lacking creative conscious something my second question will be about Amazon ah\nI Know they get criticized putting out small ... prior to send I can understand that but at the same time this stuff you can find on there that you can find locally even even in New York for example I got I got this great gloves the shoveling my neighbors snow\nAnd that's the main thing I made but I couldn't find them locally I got 'em on Amazon from like Minnesota [noise]\nI go for the first question again\n[laughter] ... inside just boiling on Long Island [noise] hey I'm from Long Island too but what was the first question\nGo ahead and give us that's an odd cents again Joe Joe\nYou know now that that is for example and explosion and video you know like half with everything people get on a small and fall and I think as this video base [laughter]\nJust how should people if they're trying to move ahead in the world just pick and choose how they consume information what to emphasize up because it doesn't necessarily work out to put this clandestine into something one that's just so so much information like\nHe's like a kernel of sand on on the sea what good does it do the ... it's just too overwhelming\nBut where's your name on an interim measure quite a lot of information that we get as it is overwhelming so what do you do with it you know if if I'm a uh a lot of aid that the Gen Y kids the millennials are actually tuning it out you you can ask them simple questions about you know what's going on in the world and they can't answer it\nBut so how do you sift through this which you have to do is you have to compare several sources that's and that's what I Do when I Do research and when I Do presentations I\nFor this what you have to do is you have to compare several sources sects and that's what I Do when I Do research and when I Do presentations I really don't come to any kind of conclusion unless I've compared a variety of sources and that's what helps me with information\nAnd in terms of Amazon I think Amazon is just you know ... what we did when we open the Internet we opened up the world we we just that but it's our view to the interests of the world and I think what's what's going down with Amazon is just something that's in naturally transpiring and I think if there's going to get nothing but bigger [noise]\nYou're going to see commerce is going to change everything about commerce is going to change\nThat we've got a company that shift radios they make radios and they make darn good radio ... company and I I used to get my radio from them long before I started doing this show\nAnd it was simple you you go on line you order what you want it's delivered to your house in some cases it's free shipping based on the deal that they've got at any given time\nI mean you don't have to park your car you don't have to spend money on gasoline you don't have to find a crowd it's a it's it's amazing that's amazing I mean\nIt's infinitely easier when you look at the boomers what how do you do business with a boomer you save them some time you make their life easy and you don't rip them off this was perfect and so Amazon is is is going to do nothing but a grow\nA ... you know and that online retail ... will exceed the tempers that where it is now I Would probably go to twenty percent thirty percent\nI think so too they hurt bricks and mortar but I mean the the the goods are still being manufactured\nUm they Amazon employees zillion people um some of which complain about their job there\nI'm more conditions and things like that but I mean they're they're retired people so there's displacement tea so when the bricks and mortar stores go really the only big thing to get hurt and you know some people are out of work but they can find jobs elsewhere\nIt's the real estate that just sits there what's gonna happen with that stuff\n[noise] that's the question you know I Know that a a commercial real estate is [noise] you know ... you know suffering some issues right now some serious issue\nI mean if you were an investor would you buy a mall right about now\nNo no no but but but I certainly would buy residential you would\nI Would buy residential every day of the week yeah it's a seller rent out [noise] yes\n[noise] [laughter]\nYeah no in fact I'm you know I I have a house in them but either Springs Florida and and I and I have a house in in ... Connecticut [noise] and I'm In the house and had our Connecticut's four thousand square feet I don't know my wife and I just read all around it\nAnd what we've decided to do is we're going to rent it will get we're going to come up with an executive rental hard [noise] and and that's going to be necessary because people are going to come into our area that don't want to buy houses people will come into all areas that don't want\nI have the ... got to be very big\nWhile he's got that company like air being beat up the rent a house houses and I mean yeah I Know people who own houses and they solicit through air being be exclusively and they're making a lot of money doing that\nReally [noise] they're very happy ... cool\nYeah and I I Would I Would subscribe to that point you're going to see in real estate across the board it you're going to see dramatic changes [noise]\nOne of the things that it's kind of puzzling me right now and I don't have an answer to it is this working from home and if that's going to you know remain in place and remain as as a major issue going forward because that was precipitated by a small labor force that is actually demanded\nA you know their their own way but what we have now is a huge huge biggest labor force than we've ever had\nIs a very young right now and just entering the process\nCan I Want to talk with you about India when we come back and also we'll take final calls in just a moment how about your books can people still get them can\nOh yeah ... direct dot com K.

said it was it was a miracle and that it was the guardian angel that had had saved me so that was the first experience and experience and I never questioned it I just said okay that's\nThat's what happens and I think that's what open the floodgates and and and and also my mother was very psychic too she wasn't a practicing psychic a right to see um\n[noise] there's always this seems to be somebody in the family who has this ability and it kind of passes down genetically doesn't it\nI I I Believe it does because her mother was also that way she was an herbalist she was a healer so in ... and this was a very remote island at that point in the sixties they're the only way onto the island was by a a small plane or buy a ferry boat\nOr there was no bridge you had to that island so there's very remote there's no hospital so uh you know they they needed the services of folk healers and and then that's what my grandmother did my mother's mother\nWears science fit into this Bruce I mean the you know you're you're you're in academia um yeah ... where does science fiction\n[noise] well I I've been doing a lot of reading and a and you know I'm not a scientist but I did I've done a lot of reading and quantum physics and\nAnd I talk a lot to uh I I have communication with folks that have passed on and and that happened randomly before but now I figured out a way to make it more regular but so\nI've asked an awful lot of questions and I've done a lot of reading and I've met people like dean raven who are just you know wonderful and very easy to talk to and explain difficult things and from what I understand what I Believe is that the the paranormal the paranormal world is actually the quantum world\nSo by studying quantum mechanics and how that works I think I have a good idea of how the paranormal world works and I've come up with a model\nA ... ... how I I fit in what what I understand to be going on\nIn the mail us with that model might be well it it the idea is that ah\nThat okay I I'll I'll look at it this way so I ... in the morning I take these I call them a a meditative walks so so when I'm walking my one way of\nLooking at me and said I'm I'm a a a a particle being I Am a bean physical being but if you see that I'm I'm moving and if you look at uh like in in in fast motion or whatever I Would be like a blur so I'm really I'm a I'm a wave more than I Am a a a a particle being\nAnd I and my my location is is not just in one place\nSo I kind of see that and the and the quantum world that's that's what it is everything is in wave form and we don't see the world that way because you know that some in the subatomic world but if you take it up to the macroscopic world than you think about that ah that\nI I'm not in any one location and then and and that's kind of how how I see it and and I think that that helps me understand how how this works and the ... the other thing is\nThese near death experiences that I've had a like for instance I think we have many forks and what I call forks in the road\nSo and the uh the other thing is these near death experiences that I've had a like for instance I think we have many forks and what I call forks and the road of time I talk about that in the book where we experienced say it may be a near death experience or a close call and I've had a couple of those\nAnd in one dimension I think that's where it comes into you know a different dimensions\nI think that we we might die in that particular thing that that incident and another's we we live on is if that didn't happen uh and and sometimes we have knowledge of what the incident might have been or maybe sometimes we don't\nAnd uh and then we can have many of these forks and the road of times throughout our our our lives and keep going from one life to the next\n... but at the same time that we're doing that there's this spiritual part of us so there's actually two part there's the physical form and then there's the spiritual form a that that is eternal and that's where I come up with the uh the title of the book which is timeless that that we don't really\nDie and ... you have documented thirty four ... cases that happened to you have there been more you just didn't put them all in the book\nYeah ah [laughter] there there's a lot more and I have I've already written the second book he'll come out next year I call it timeless deja vu and uh I have twenty eight more experiences and I I I I kind of wanted to test the waters with the first book\nOkay I saved I saved some of the more well I'll just say a little bit more bizarre stuff for the second book based on the reaction of the first one\nWell sounds like we're going to have your back about the same time next year\nAnd I and I yeah I plan to release it about you know the late summer early fall and and then I I also have a third book plan too so I I there's a lot of the incidents they they they keep happening\nI I was going to ask you about deja vu because symbols save a lot of it for the next book\nBut ah you had mentioned the experiences where you know you may have died in one life but not in another do you think that sometimes we might have memory of other existence is in other parallel universes and that's why we have deja vu\nI I I Believe so in fact uh I I remember as a as a kid and this is interesting because I think\nChildren are very open to the spirit world or the paranormal world but there are ... that's kind of over the years it's kind of a through our education system or sometimes maybe by their parents are different\nOrganizations it's kind of a you know drained out of them but I remember as a kid thinking I Wonder if I've already died and I'm somebody else now I think I Am\nAnd it's and and I don't necessarily remember a previous life experience from that but I I remember thinking that a lot I mean a lot\nAnd uh so I I I think that's interesting that that children have those those ah you know those kinds of feelings but I'll give you an incident that happened just recently with me and my son we were driving here in Southern California on a sub surface streets and I I look down just momentarily I don't know what it was something that dropped onto the floor\nMonument or whatever and I looked up and when I looked up and I thought it was just a split second here it was hurdling through a red light and it was it was terrible and and how will the sun or he's he's Eighteen okay he's sitting in the in the passenger seat and freaking out\nYeah he he is and we're going through the intersection and on either side of us is a car you know two cars coming right out of so what was going to happen that I can see was that we're going to get T bone from both sides and just you know at a pinch between the two\nUh and uh at that moment everything slowed down ... everything's slowed down and it was if I had all the time in the world to figure out how I was going to\nManeuver your way around a\nYeah and the next thing I Know I I I maneuver through and next thing I Know we're on the other side there was honking going on in the cars when everybody was safe and a time got back to normal speed again and I\nI think that I think what what happens is that we had we had glimpse the quantum world at that point and then the quantum world and in the paranormal world as my spirit friends have told me there there is no past there is no future it's all just an eternal now\nAnd and that that's what I felt like an eye and then I thought this is probably this is an example of a fork in the road of time 'cause then another dimension which we might have had this horrible accident\n... knows it it it potentially at least the potential forty five miles an hour oh at each other like that uh you\nKnow that there could have been people killed and it's at least seriously injured and ah and we were unscathed and so or the other two cars thank God I'm so it so I I I I that is what I'm Talking about and I had other experiences that you know when I was younger I I at eight years old I had another uh\nExperience where I I uh uh was playing around it was in ah I'm up at deception pass I'm from Washington state and deception pass in the north end to with the island there is a a to bridge spans that go from the mainland too\nWhen the island the north end and there's a middle island called past silent\nAnd we always used to stop there when when we went camping and and we we'd run around and it was beautiful you know you could overlook the narrow channels that that that separate the island from the mainland and I was running around and of course in those days early sixties there were no safety fences or guard rails to speak on for them\nYeah exactly and I was running right towards the cliff and I remember running off the cliff and then everything was I was just like suspended in in in in in mid air was like everything stopped and once again I felt this this light and the warmth\nAnd the next thing I knew it was like everything it stopped and then all of a sudden boom like in fast motion I was back on the trail and my dad was grabbing my shoulders and was\nYelling somebody's watching Uber's there's a there's some helpers up there for you I Want to come back in a moment we'll talk more about some of these others thirty three experiences you had a or any of them

Bruce ... book is called timeless Bruce what about any demonic situations you've stumbled into that\nYes unfortunately the way that it\nThat is also out there in the paranormal world and the spirit world and ...\nThings as far as I understand have never been human never will be human but they are very real and very scary out to a couple of them\nI'm One of them was a ah when I was about Eighteen years old I was in a very low place in my life very uh down I was a not very successful I dropped out of school a out of the University of Washington as living at my brother's garage sleeping on the concrete floor on a mattress\nAnd a ... just the night before this incident happened I I had cut across\nYou know I I was Eighteen but I was still acting like I was a little kid I'd still cut across the yards and jump fences and stuff because just to you know 'cause I it it just an old habit anyway I went through the yard of of an old lady who all of us in the in the neighborhood thought she was a witch\nAnd uh she lived alone and there was a story I don't know if it was true that her husband had died and she left him there for a month and told the neighbors complain that you know there was something\nSome kind of odd smell and then uh anyway so she their legend grew by leaps and bounds size ... I was cutting through her yard and I saw a candle light in the window and I just momentarily look in there she was she was very scary looking person she had you know this gray hair that was kind of shooting off and all the direction\nYeah you had this sledding old hag syndrome right\nYes she had the ... camp as it turned out cancerous or on her nose and\nShe had me I felt like a deer in headlights I was just frozen and I was just staring at her and she had it was either a it was a candle yeah she had a candle in the window and she was just staring at me and it it just scared me and finally I broke away from her gays and I ran to my brother's garage and I\nAnd I and I you know went in to to I fell asleep well\nLater that probably early in the morning I woke up to\nA very frightening site at the foot of my the mattress bad that I was sleeping on the floor there was like a a call him a fire that was coming up out of the floor and I thought this is the worst during this is a horrible dream and so I pinch myself I slap myself\nAnd no I was awake in this column fire then spread over me in an arc from head from foot over my head you know probably six feet in the air and kind of like an art and like pulsating fire like a current a fire going over my head\nAnd it and if that wasn't scary enough there was also this this very dim what I Would classify as the demonic low gravelly voice speaking in in ... just these guttural tones\nAnd I'm not sure how long it lasts that it might have just been a couple of minutes but it seemed like it it took forever\nAnd ah it it was very very frightening and it was it was horrible and and I after it was over I was you know my heart rate was way up I was sweating I immediately called my my girlfriend and and uh I told her you know something terrible happened she said well\nYou know why don't you come over in in in the morning and I did and I explained it to her and she looked at me and she said uh\nWell you know I think maybe we should call a psychiatrist what do you think and I said well just forget it you know maybe I just made it up but of course I didn't write it did happen and I I think it had something to do with this this old lady I think that I had frightened or or made her angry\nAnd some thing had been some and and I it was a terrible terrible thing\nAnd that that that's one of the experiences I've had it's one of the most scary things that's a that's ever happened to me and just as as I Do remember it as if it would just happened yesterday I could feel the heat I could hear that gravelly voice that just seemed to fill the whole room and yeah it was it was it was horrible\nWouldn't want to go through that again would you\nKnow no it was it was it was very real very real to Rio and uh nothing that it it's like I think what happens is that these kinds of things you know when you're at the lowest point in your life and that's when you're susceptible a and I I think that they seize that opportunity\nI think so too I mean they they know when you're down they know when you're on\nI I think that that that they seize that opportunity\nI think so too I mean they they know when you're down they do when you're on drugs or you're drunk\nYeah and that's when they get to and they get you a good time I don't want to dwell too much on the demons but tell us the other story\nWell the other one ah also of a foolish kind of thing or are there was actually a um I was in Germany I was a soldier in Germany at working at the prison the military prison and Mannheim West Germany when it was east and West Germany where West Germany\nAnd uh there was a a a counselor at the prison of all people of counsellors like a senior and CEO and he\nWas into a a a witchcraft\nSo he had invited me and my girlfriend to his his room to ... because he was bragging about what a you know powerful war locker which or whatever that he wasn't\nAt the time I was kind of I'm kind of interest that kind of you know skeptical but interested\nSo we went in there it into his room and he had a this very frightening set up you know the very typical Satan worshipping kind of stuff upside down across a goats had kind of thing going on and candles and\nAnd that stuff so I said well I you know I don't think this is anything that I'm interested in and I got my girlfriend and we left and\nAnd he was being very very spooky and very scary about this whole thing and and uh so I decided that I was going to look into a a you know this\nKind of thing so I I\nI thought maybe as a defense you know I maybe I should try to one of them you know and try to scare him or something and and uh and I also felt like maybe he was trying to move in on my girlfriend too so I had a little bit of that you know kind of thing going on competitive thing\nSo I I went to the uh you know for soldiers they had a art rooms or like arts and crafts areas and and uh there was a a um [noise] uh ceramics instructor there and he's I asked I'd like to you know do something with some clay and he said gave me some clay and\nI had been looking at a diva knowledge the book and a or no no he had a demon algae but that's what it was and I was fashioning a a what I thought would be you know some kind of scary looking head then it turned out to be a demon head\nRhode Island fashioned and this was just you know very stupid to be doing this and as I was doing this this guy took notice of made this instructor then he had the steam analogy book and uh he said you know I'm very interested in this what is this your doing I said well I'm just trying to make this scary looking ahead to scare this guy and he said well that's\nThat's very very interesting you know I'm very interested in in ... he started to get really strange you know just like the counselor at the prison he was acting very strange like they were maybe birds of a feather or something\nAnd uh so I finished this demon head and I got out of there and I took it back to the barracks and I took it to my girlfriend's room and she wasn't there at the time but her ... her girlfriend a roommate letting in\nAnd I set it up on her night stand and there was like this mirror behind it and I said okay I'm going to freak her out and then I'm going to freak her out and then we're going to go on freak out this other guy and get them to get you know get away from us\nSo I set up these candles surrounded stupid right\nSo uh I was there and listen as the intent was good right\nIt it was it was maybe a good intent but it was playing with stuff I didn't understand so I'm sitting there looking at it and the girlfriend left or I mean the the uh the roommate left and that was just there by myself sitting there staring at the sing all of a sudden it's lips started to move\nAnd it started to say things in that same kind of guttural voice that I had heard that before I joined the army\nAnd that that other incident that I told you about and uh it was it was it was pretty scary and I thought at first this isn't real but then it kept happening and then my girlfriend walked in\nAnd she immediately so what are you doing and I said well your roommate Libyan and then she says what does that and she pointed to it and I said oh that's the thing I made to scare the you know this counselor guy\nAnd she said you know that's very interesting because when I was in and she was telling me when I was in high school I made something that looked exactly like that and I had to throw it away because it started to interact with me\nAnd I and I said well that hey that's what this did you know and she she freaked out she grabbed it she opened up the window and from the third floor she threw it out the window into the dumpster that was down on the in the parking lot\nAnd she said you don't ever play around with that kind of stuff and uh so that was the other to kind of demonic incident that I that I had so that the the big lesson there's don't play around with things you don't understand even if the intention might be somewhat good\nAnd on November eleventh at eleven o'clock I Am in houses of worship\nChurches schools town halls firehouses police

I Am able to to to do it\nAnd I I share this with my friends and family members and and uh people who um you know who asked me I don't do it for money or anything just do it because I feel it's a service to my fellow a human beings\nAnd it provides them with comfort and and it doesn't work every time you know a ... and I know they're Charlotte's ... out there and then and there are some real people\nThat do for a living and I don't I don't ah you know the grudge them to make a living of it you know fair living as long as they're providing a a a decent service for people but uh it it is it is real it's very real\nAh they've tried to that is one of them are difficult things for scientists to research although they've noticed\nThat when people say they're having a spiritual connection that later proves to be you know you know they got some things right about this person's a loved one a there is certain parts of the brain that they can pick up I guess some kind of image and I don't know if they use an MRI or what they do but\nUh so there is there is something that doesn't prove necessarily but it does show that there is something going on\nIn in there is a a a connection being made 'em and uh so I that that that that is the mission that I'm On the mission I mine is too is to convey what I've found out and what I asked my friend Jean and [noise]\nAnd ah there's another lady that passed on three years ago she was a colleague of mine and a good friend and and I also had some contact with her and I've asked them a lot of questions when I go on this walking meditation that I Do quite often\nAnd uh and connect with them and and the things that I've learned are are are are pretty amazing and I I Want to share them with people and I and I I feel uh that I have to do it and I want to do it but I feel like I have to do it too it's kind of like all the books I've written all the plays that I've written\nI felt compelled to do it it wasn't just something I sat down okay I'm going to write a play or I'm going to write a book it's always I feel compelled to do it I have to do it\nAnd I'm more than happy to to you know to to do this and and help people and I think I\nI have helped some people let's go to the phones for you if they have a story I'll have you with bell you waited for is Bruce of it's just a question than they could always tell them is a lawyer to California I tell them\nI George thank you for taking my call and Bruce go wild Hi Thomas my question Bruce I'm you spoke about your near accident and the intersection and job comment and question\nThe comment is angels appear to be non denominational they appear at\nChristianity and Islam him doing some voters some Taoism and and all of the indigenous\nTraditions or around the world whether they're called change also being supple light whatever my question to you sent to metaphorically dodged a bullet in that\nIntersection how can the average man they average woman develop cultivated a few will close personal relationship\nWith their guardian angels day by day even\nHour by hour or something bad is tangible with absolute certainty\nWell that's that's a that's a very good question and I I Will uh started off by saying that that everybody has these abilities are often they light lie dormant\nOf you know ... when we were children we probably had you know pretty equal abilities and there's some people that have a little bit more than others but then\nThrough the experiences that people have they they accept it more and more and they're closer to the the spirit world so I'd say doing whatever you can to get a closer to that spirit world some people do it through meditation\nI just let it randomly happen because the door seem to be open since age for so it never quite shut so things kept happening but now I've\nI've learned to through meditation or ... when I called walking meditation all explain it I'm I Can't sit still very very long so I I have trouble doing the lotus position you know kind of traditional meditation so I I go on a walk and uh that's when I can get into the I guess what scientists would call an alpha brainwave state\nAnd at that point is when I can I say a prayer a and I I I Do believe in God and they say prayers even when I'm not meditating but any way I Will I Will ask my guardian angel or some people practicing a professional uh mediums will say these are your spirit guides you know\nUm and I will ask them to help me\nTo connect to those that are that are passed on and to receive whatever messages they have\nAnd uh and and to help people if they have messages they want me to pass on to their loved ones which is usually what it is\nAnd I I Would say just having a practice of that I Do it almost every day my foot has hurt right now so I haven't been able to do it so I feel kind of stifles but the last couple of days but uh making a practice of that type of mindful meditation and what\nMy spirit friends tell me that in what they told me to tell my students in the class\nIs to have what they call focused calm\nTo be focused but be very calm and as you're doing this meditation and it will it will happen it might happen slowly it might not be you know like a an immediate you know like an epiphany or are very profound at first it might just come slowly might even think it's your imagination but it's not\nIt'll it'll keep building day by day and before you know it you you have you're more in touch with these things and you can also when you when the door opens\nYou'll ... you'll go back in time and see oh my gosh I've had these experiences before\nThat's what these things and you can also when you when that door opens you'll you'll go back in time and see oh my gosh I've had these experiences before and maybe I didn't I didn't recognize it so it it goes like backwards in time as well once that door has opened\nFirst go ahead yeah no that's the best way I can I can explain it I think it's a it's a life\nLifetime journey and and everybody's had their own pace you know like I tell my students you know some people say\nYou know I'm like thirty five years old and these kids are
