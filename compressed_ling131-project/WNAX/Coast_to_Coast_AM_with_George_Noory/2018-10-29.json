us\nThese are heavy topics but we have a great guest to help us get our heads around them Christopher white earned a PHD and religious studies from Harvard He's written a brilliant book called other

the things for me at least I mean no you know different people different responses from from reading his books but from my perspective I I kind of type the view that he's most important [noise] um [noise]\nRevelation and feel like all conclusion was that many of these phenomena seems to be multi connected if you like to connect to and by that you know you have a lot of reports where people have seen big foot type creatures on in the same location and timeframe\nOr say for example UFO activity I'm the most money point plants in West Virginia in the sixties um when there was ... when they ... around the [noise]\nThe skies above ... point plants and he'll settle a lot of encounters with men in black and you were following cancer so I think some of these creatures at least some of the the we're the ones like my mind and the dog men and things like that I think I'm not even sure that I should fall into the category of\nCrypto zoology ... or ... just say can cause I'm not entirely sure that they are creatures or animals in the way we understand it um you know when you get reports of say a big foot vanishing in a flash of light\nOr you know the dog mine roaming around sort of sacred sites and that kind of thing\nIt makes me think that we daily we some things that we saved as an animal that night may not be I don't think Kael was I'm someone who is insightful enough way back in the sixties to make these connections but a lot of people\nJust didn't think just turn their heads I just did not want to know or at least didn't want to handle and Dale with the the way the site of these phenomena\nIn this book the book of monsters or several reports early in the book but sort of blend together at least in my head you got ... men go ugh men are where wolves where cats sheep gestures are a lot of differences between the these creatures that are seen but also a lot of commonalities um\nOr or is it possible there all the same thing are we talking about something different\n[noise] well I mean it's difficult to say really but I mean you know I I don't have any reports\nAt all I should stress where somebody is you know at the turn of the full moon has changed into a wet well from a regular person you know that sort of all the [noise]\nThe Hollywood imagery butts the fact pays a painful to report saying I'm sort of large wolf like animals that seemed to have the ability to walk onto limbs unfold limbs\nUm I've got a lot I get a lot of reports like that but I've never gone to reports of someone you know literally shape shift the like in America can handle the London or anything like that\nUm but in a lot of these cases that I Do receive what I've found is that\nThe the locations where they dug men type creatures said is intriguing it very often these\nAncient burial grounds I'm Native American land um some of the the the mysterious all mountains in Wisconsin and so on um so I find the fact that they seem to be tied to certain locations is intriguing rather than just saying that random\nYou had one where we'll case that was from a military base it's not ancient either it's more recent times you remember that yes\nYeah they saw some of the British a bicycle royal Airforce how to break and uh I actually was able to speak to the witness personally this case went back to Nineteen Seventy and he was um\n... an American guy but it's working a overseas or you can break in the Nineteen seventies when there were a number of issues which had\nI'm an American presence there was a high to the Cold War and he he saw that he saw this creature that was like about five to six feet tall covered in ...\nAnd would have sort of kind of look like a big foot type ... was it not for five the just the the face was very different\nTo how you're describing nights\nAnd it was more like a lung muzzle with point today is very much like a German Shepherd so if you imagine sort of big full body with a with a German shepherds head on it that's pretty much what he described and um\nYou know I didn't see any reason why he should know creates a story like that will fabricate the story like that he was um I was able to confess I mean he's a background in the mail a tray and he said we just wanting to share this story because they've never forgotten about it and it was so if\nYou've got a lot of stories in this book instances where people are record\nThese huge dogs I mean right out of ... you make that comparison in your book\nAs well as these gigantic cats and the you know\nYou can see All right maybe it's an animal scape from the zoo or maybe somebody's dog that got out in his living wild but\nThese things are seen over centuries over and over again running wild in the ... the u._k. countryside and some of the encounters have been really dramatic can you share a couple of those start with the the dog was\n[noise] well yeah I mean\nWhere is it over here you know we have the dog mine which kind of looks like a a dog like animal but it's you know clearly is not\nWell in England or the okay we have what are known as find some black dogs now I'm Conan of Conan Doyle who wrote they show combs novel ... end of the ... he actually by stays novel on a pre existing legend\nI'm of one of these many black dog stories that you can find in the u._k. um that typically a much longer much larger than regular dogs are like these fiery blazing red eyes I mean a lot of the ...\nBut typically a much longer a much larger than regular dogs are like a fiery blazing red eyes\nI mean a lot of the elections and traditions if he would just say one of these um find some black dog see what are the main that you would die or you know a close family member or friend would die\nUm and like the dog my entire often sane at the same places like um crossroads graveyards 'em by sea like that in moderation is I've got several\nReports of people saying the fence and black dogs in the vicinity of stone circles in the ... not at Stonehenge which is obviously the most famous one but you know there are many many I'm ...\nI'm full nations around the a K and I've got two cases from Scotland where witnesses saw one of these large black ducks fan and like they okay she's going back centuries the dog was that one second but then quite literally gum and next second you know just vanished into nothing\nUm and again it's hard to determine what based things all you know that clearly not normal dogs I mean all the ice the spirit of\nDogs that was a slave to um I guess the only downside with that is it that much bigger than regular dogs you know you would imagine a fight with the\nSpirit of that dogs would resemble their dogs they look like in real life um\nAnd then the cats are even harder to explain in the u._k. I mean there's no big cats lived there right now you\nWrite and they become known as I said I Am big cats\nAnd ... every year we get dozens and dozens of reports of papal saying large black cats robbing the K now the occasional sort of ask I ask I pay you know from a zoo or menagerie whatever might explain a couple of cases\nAnd you know there are cases where I'm wild animals actually had a guy from shows but I've always been rounded up very very quickly the problem is there are these large black cats roaming around the K which simply by explanation because\nThe sheer number of reports from the bottom of England to the top of the top of Scotland needs hundreds every\nNow for that many reports to exist\nYou know that must be anti colonies of these creatures roaming around that is a ... a flesh and blood regular animals which not every race which are the phenomena and things that the case\nYou know what we're going to get into some of the more exotic explanations in a moment talking with Nick red burn about his the monster book creatures obese and beans of nature of this could be the rock and roll theme song for Halloween a C. D. the hell's bells we'll be right back\nAnd it was a particularly weird case but what was intriguing about it was it was taken very seriously by the local newspaper the ... post and somebody saying they saw what looked like a humanoid figure sort of literally flying or a soaring would be a better term tears\nOver the ... which are at high speed you know kind of like a flying man I'm not unlike I guess they you know the stories coming out of point classrooms\nIn the sixties or with a ... some kind of power outage in that respect there were there were a number of independent witnesses who came forward and spoke to press one of the name and spoke to the local police so I don't really know what the police can be done about it it's um [noise]\nBut I mean trade in that you know you have this by too weird activity in the area which he'd already notorious for sightings of things interesting a lot to do mine and the ... black dogs and also a large black cats as well\nYou have a story or in the book about the terror you call it the terrible old man thing Nineteen Seventy seven at surfaces at a wind chills of all places in Sunnyvale, California\nOh yeah that that's really crazy story I guess

sort of ... this old black suits and just gave off these really I'm sort of intimidating creepy ... but it didn't really come across as being completely human\nAnd didn't something I mean the thing is

um Chicago last year it was very interesting from my perspective all though I didn't really invest the guy the ... sign things because um there are a lot of people\nUm who are already looking into it

perceived as being a wishful thinking on the part of Sonia villa suppose\nAll you know it was a really weird aspect of the phenomena and\nNow there's this little I'm known aspect to the story a which place who's an entirely different slant on it until now if you read carefully Antonio ... says a report that he put together\nFor um a Brazilian a UFO research or an adult to named a love of funds has\nUm he talks about how they craft that he was taken on board um came down and he started to feel weird to see the pain drugs somehow and he said he was taken aboard spacecraft which he described as being sort of long rectangular\nAnd um he had like some big on TALK like a dish that was spinning around very fast\nAnd he was making a Beijing noise that kind of sounds not unlike a helicopter you know the the shy they the ... the ... and the ... noise\nSays like the classic Saturday you get with a helicopter now mine came forward um in the late Nineteen seventies but he's story didn't get very much a publicity is your name was ... and he had ties to the CIA and various other agencies\nAnd um he told a racial or give a research rich Reynolds of what he said was the real story namely that um they the abduction was a fabrication\nAnd that's going but he really did evolve alley call to but they talk and said I'm Phyllis powers he was out to the ... lights at night\nUm they release some sort of Arab ... average so\nAh which incapacitated in Tokyo rumbled they highly cup to and they a woman was really there and the power was played out um but he is in a sort of an old to state wasn't sure what was going on and that was then soda and ceremony asleep dumb back on the ground\nAnd they the the re oh the story was but the agencies within governments that may well in vain rarely duck shows but they were also fabricating abductions to try and determine\nA bunch but might well a pain rail abductions but they were also fabricating abductions to try and determine how bad management the fifties or the CIA eyes and ... and things like base the plan was to try and determine\nTo what extent ... my mind to appeal to it and you know in other words if we can convince people that can say I aliens we can convince them anything that was basically what it came down to so metal ... which claim but um [noise] they they the abduction a few like was played out\nAnd buy kind of just bend sat back and white hate to say how much of the story was taken and I went I realized that the story of being embraced by you follow Jay and it was a parenting books it was the case of a job well done and\nMakes you wonder you know you have several examples of these are pretty well documented abduction cases where the um the principal targets I think that it's it's something beyond just some alien presence that there's military or government involvement I mean they should\nWhere it gets confusing eighth but you know if they're on January and I didn't have adoption and then you have agencies fabricating them to try and determine out of the human mind can be altered and I use the UFO and go as the ... to try and you know I'm just saying how it works on paper doesn't work\nSo you know it gets really confusing when the Kobe rail abductions and fabricated ones as well\nIt makes you wonder I mean is it possible there are agencies that are investigating the abductees messing with them a following them around listening to the phones but not investigating the abductions themselves the phenomena itself or are they doing both than just not telling us\nWell yeah I think there's good evidence that it's a it's actually both because some of the duct tape that I spoke with\nSaid that they found a number of occasions I'd actually paying a visit to buy military personnel and he wasn't like a a traumatic threatening at my base situation it was more but these military personnel were actually approached should be up to page quietly\nRequesting that I didn't talk about their experiences and some of Dayton and some of them have basically they ... it was as if the military were asking questions\nUm along the lines of well can you give us some insight as to why they should be done so in other words I was trying to get to the hearts of what the abductions where why that were being done\nBut you know the case is there is good evidence also of um ... they have they have to pay a good example\nAnd somebody um I was tied to coast to coast I'm ... I'm Greg tell me how um he had to pay to correspondence and the Nineteen nineties a duck to college or who wrote a number of good books on abductions and she was an apt to pay herself\nAnd Greg tell me how you know back in the early nineties you know sort of pre Internet here um all of election as I wrote to each other back and forth were open and sailed back down with type\nAnd I'm now they can clearly be done you know a family without making it look like they ... I was taught to open a race failed\nIt was all ... says hey if whoever was doing base wants to Greg and call it ... to know that someone was opening their mail in other words he was sort of like an intimidation hey you know we're watching it and that went on you know for for quite a period\nA Greg is working tonight as our Web master by the way so uh yeah I I saw his name I was going to mention that in the book and ask you about it I mean there are a lot of people in the UFO field who you know are are not as credible as Greg who are sure that the government's watching him I'm\nAnd I'm not sure I Believe all of them I Believe him though he says it and you\nKnow I think sometimes you know there's no doubt that if you have a traumatic experience like an abduction then I think sometimes people can become sort of\nParanoid of every little thing in their life you know and which is a dangerous road to go down um but in saying that I mean another example is the whole issue of black helicopters which I think many papers so Shiite than we've ...\nI'll tell you what network let's wait a second we'll get into that on the other side a save some time so people can ask you a couple of questions when we got some other ground to cover before then we're going to go into the break with a deep purple demons I think he's Seventy one\nOr in other ... other kinds of creatures but a channel or the the ones we know best that have been publicized most I Can't imagine what the total dollar amount of losses for the livestock losses for ranchers and farmers could be but it's pretty substantial\nAnd when you look at how the government has responded the FBI had some ... agents who looked at it a very cursory examination investigation that really didn't get to the bottom of it and then nothing so what do you make of that and in combined with the the black helicopter phenomena that you're discussing this book\n[noise] well I think you know the the black helicopter phenomena and um he clearly a real one\nUm they do seem to be tied to both complementary lesions\nAnd I'm In abduction phenomena and one of the things such as being no taste and I think there's probably some truth to this is the idea that these\nWhoever's flying these helicopters potentially I think he's part of an organization that operates outside of government you know my actually my sort of do research and work for the government\nBut it's not you know the CIA or anybody like that ... I don't think I think it is sort of um [noise] you know almost like a like a black budget ... kind of program designed to do the work\nAnd and most people in government don't know anything about it at all because it might not actually operate under the regular confines of the government itself you know my pain even\nSort of ... to private corporations which again would make it more difficult to get material for the fate of Information Act when you're dealing with private corporations which on covered by\nAh by the fate of information request\nSo in that sense I think you know the the phenomenon these rail and I think whether it's ... or abductions the Gulf seems to base of islands to try and figure out\nWhat's going on you know there there's so many cases of black helicopters and Mark Kelly ... just\nTurning up near the homes for some time precariously there the homes\nOf a leading up to ... and and again kind of light with college entering Greg\nBase might be a degree of um intimidation but also it might be an attempt to just keep an eye on the abductees 'em and be able to to respond to that high speed a fit in the\nEvent that they have that the papal climatic ... were actually able to catch it I'd abduction going ahead you know in the sense of that very time\nSomebody who's a tune in tonight for the first time has to think we're all crazy alien abductions cattle mutilation black helicopters and we're saying yeah stuff happens\nBut the files that you've obtained from US government from the u._k. government\nSheds light on these things and someone takes it seriously maybe the scariest part of this is that there isn't any one really knows what's going on in their agencies different agencies and government small groups of people who are looking at this but really don't have answers about who's responsible and why this stuff happens\n[noise] well yeah I mean that that that's a good point George because I mean government agencies don't always know what another agency knows\nA you know many many cases agencies came the information to themselves unless they used to be shed and if we daily with I just had a group that actually isn't technically part of the government but the ... to\nA private companies and things like that that's going to make it even more difficult\nBut I mean in terms of the files on the um on the black helicopters I've probably got about three or four hundred pages\nI'm so that that includes the FBI stay classified files on Capitol mutilation is\nI'm a wave of encounters that occurred in Seventy five and some of the the ... native and know of and I'm bored of the United states in in ... to Seventy five\nAnd and just various other case it including some from the u._k. when there was a wave of activity of UFOs in Seventy three and there was also a wave of black helicopters in the same areas\nSo I think we're seeing a pot and and then I think some violence and intimidation a sort of the the mine coal and cause the you know I'm explain why they're flying around\nYou know trying to figure out what's going on with these abductees experiences or to literally physically real or not it it's tough to to even though there are some really well documented cases it's tough to figure it out and it's got to figure out what\nSomeone else is looking for when they put people through this stuff you mentioned you bring up a bizarre in the in the book\nAnd I should mention that there was a film coming out about those are it'll be the thirtieth anniversary of when that story first came out the German because bill is going to come out in December and then there was a book that's going to be published I think after the first year\nAnd a lot of interest in the case but your angle was kind of an interesting one on one how it fits into the whole abductee aliens scenario\n[laughter] well yeah I mean you know ... story is always intrigued me I Know a lot of people dismiss you our rights but one of the things I've always found about ... saw is unlike a lot of pain flu hoax things and you follow the J\nYou know when the story runs out of feel um you know they suddenly out a new angle to itself I can get back on the lecture circuit and so on\nUm you know they are and I think that the big difference we lose our case he never embroidered on the ... the original story be told as it was she's never expanded on it to the tells the same stories you'd have to tease ago\nHardly try to put himself at the forefront of you follow Jay and you know polling and however many you know dollars and so forth it doesn't you know regardless of the the controversial nature of the story eight doesn't come across like your average hope so [laughter]\nSo that's one of the thing that's always intrigued me but um you know the in relation to the book I talk about the connections\nBetween the abductions\nAnd people who claimed that in some way or another they put the graze the Iranian Gray's who do the abductions that somehow they have these\nThey put in sort of sinister and disturbing entrenched in the human soul 'em and they sort of ties in with ... when he claimed that he was given a bunch of a briefing papers to read it I suppose this is supposed to vary fifty one he was working at allegedly [noise] and um\nThey said that with the V. I. aliens or whatever they are viewed us as containers and um any speculated on the possibility of containers of cells in other words if the ... had some sort of\nOf ... in the human cell and one of the things I talk about in the book is I'm a number of ...\nOh say they try to stay in in the human cell and one of the things I talk about in the book case I'm a number of abduct pays who were approached climbed steadily by these military agencies\nAre private corporations\nI'm Still ask questions about you know did you have any dreams afterwards if you bought a veal salt leaving your body um date you have any sort of like a religious confession after the abduction thing really weird questions but some of the questions kind of\nDo child wave the story that was always telling as well\nYou know you you look at recent developments in regard to\nThe UFO topic in general and then of course we've been told since Nineteen sixty nine the U.S military the air force they stopped project Blue Book they're not studying it is no threat to national security we don't care we're not looking at it and now of course you know I don't know that anyone ever really believed that but\nThat was the cover story and and now we've learned last ten months that wasn't true but there were on going studies that were more than one in fact that they were collecting information on what seems like you know presumably is ridiculous stopping\nUm in light of the kind of files that you bring up in this book where there are surveillance and there's counter intelligence and there's um you know just information and things that sort\nOf do you have concerns about the recent revelations I I I Would think that people who are suspicious lunar wary of this you know they ... there's some history behind why they need to be careful\n[laughter] well yeah I mean I think you know it is such a confusing angle George you know they ... they sign angle of em [noise] whale abductions fabricated abductions the ... the government itself trying to get its bad around what's going on\nYou know you put all this together and um [noise]\nYou know a a a rainy sort of a a a difficult area which to work to try and figure out you know watch true what he is and so\nOr is it somewhere between the two you know and um and again that's why you know went on the way I've written a book is to demonstrate what we know the says you know what we speculate as to why the government or an agency might be doing this why might they be fabricating\nAnd abduction events but then at the same time also investigating a legitimate events\nYou know it's it's it's not know where um [noise] you know being a just black and white you know it it's the the lines of rarely blood in trying to figure out what

scientific paradigm tells us that when we die that's it that's the end\nIs that all there is that the current scientific paradigm tells us that when we die that's it that's the end at the many of the experiences that people report over the centuries things that happened to them for real or not real they can't exist and therefore they don't\nYou know the disconnect between centuries of human experience\nAnd rigid doctrine is\nMaybe one reason why so many people have given up on science in ways that are probably inappropriate and unfair and also possibly dangerous is there a way to reconcile the seemingly bizarre experiences that people have reported through the centuries out of body experiences missing time time slips\nNear death in shelters other realities of science versus spirituality science and religion\nIs their way to bridge all of that well Dr Christopher white has written a remarkable new book\nThat offers a unique and new understanding of topics that we often discuss here on this program but can't really explain\nUm so this this is the possibility raised by math mathematician and actually others some philosophers I'm In the\nGoing back to the Eighteen century but really on the nineteenth century mathematicians raised the possibility that seems like kind of a strange thing to think about what ... how could there be another direction or dimension to reality [noise]\nUm you know and why would there be one well mathematicians in the nineteenth century start to use this idea within the context of their mathematical equations and the reason they do is they want to they want to make the mathematics of of the universe of its forces in laws more simple and more elegant 'em and they find that\nThey find that it works um [noise] they find that they find corporate in an extra spatial dimensions fourth visual dimension that the the mathematics of the universe is a law enforcers look that are on the equations look clean or they seem simpler and more elegant um um and so on\nSo and in fact just skip forward to today today you still have mathematicians doing the same thing um you still have mathematicians incorporating within the context of their um [noise]\nUh within the context of their mathematical equations higher spatial dimensions not not just for the spatial dimensions but even fifty six Seventeen and more and these are string theorist I don't know um if you are your members of our audience a part of string theory but\nSure Yemen um he's made their string theory M theory brain theory so these these are basically mathematical theories that incorporate these other dimensions and they do it again in order to make make simpler and more elegant the basic equations that govern from the universe their\nString theorists and I'm theoretical physicists mathematicians who do this are really trying to wrestle with one problem that really is the the biggest problem in modern physics\nAnd the problem is that we have two sets of equations that seemed to govern reality um and we know that both sets of equations are correct but we also know that they don't fit together\n[laughter] we have we we have\nWe had a set of equations that govern very small things in the universe and I'm like governor governor some atomic world with the er the atomic world world of quantum and we know those equations work we know they're correct on the other hand we have a set of equations that govern the movement hum\nOf the of the very large so planet and sons and galaxies and song hum and these are ... times [noise]\nA theory of general relativity we we know both of those sets of equations are correct but we also can't see a way for them to fit together they don't they don't fit together so string theorists and others are\nAssuming that there are additional spatial dimensions and they're using them in order to come up with a single\nSet of mathematical equations that would be encompassing\nAnd that would put together the other the other equations that we have it\nIn between sort of the ... version and the quantum version you have things like spooky action at a distance or which scientists have struggled to explain entanglement theory right\nAbsolutely absolutely yeah I mean you know a mathematicians who who work on on these subjects I'm also have to wrestle with other mystery is right there are other mysteries revealed by quantum mechanics for sure [laughter] you know they're they're definitely trying to wrestle with the problem of having two sets of equations that don't fit together\nAnd they're and they're using higher dimensional concepts to try to try to work on that but as you say yes there's there's other strange and uncanny um implications of of quantum physics that um that that have found their way into pop culture for sure you know and and\nAnd he um implications of of quantum physics that um that that have found their way into pop culture for sure you know and and ... and all these ideas I think to some extent have found their way into pop culture and I try to talk about that in the book as well right and the book is not just about scientists working on these ideas the book is\nAbout scientists who work on these ideas but then I'm a scientist who then have religious experiences and then try to use these ideas have to think about them and then even other people who\nWho have religious experiences and start to talk about them is higher dimensional or our somehow related to some some concepts and physics\nOr maybe we could use flat land as an illustration it's both an illustration and sort of an inspiration for a lot of the people who you write about in this book or tell us about flat land and I guess it was a pop culture phenomenon when it came out\nYeah absolutely yeah piling the great little book um [noise] so it's kind of classic science fiction or math fiction book written a long time ago a written in Eighteen eighty four\nHas quite a cultural life and in fact I remember reading flatland in high school calculus so ... you know math students\nAll over the world still reading flat land as a way of kind of expanding are thinking about you know what is it what does it mean to live and are the kinds of spaces and kind of dimensions we live in so\nYeah it's a great little book written by an Anglican priest named Edwin Abbott he was British she was she was raised in the middle of the nineteenth century I'm coming to come into age in a\nIn an era of science and wrestling with what it meant to be religious and scientific at the same time\nUm you know it was a time you know this Eighteen fifty nine with Darwin's origin of species and there were a number of\nUm there were a number of a challenge is I guess you'd say to Christianity and Edwin Abbott time so he he ended up writing this wonderful book flat land\nWhich is a book about a lower dimensional two dimensional world and he wrote it in order to get people to get people think more about the possibility that\nUm other kinds of worlds could exist um embedded in in our own may maybe we live in a higher dimensional universe\nBut habits flat world was that was a two dimensional world the book takes place and a two dimensional world this is a flat world that might exist you know on on the surface of your table pop right so this this is a world that's completely flat and his populated by\nTwo dimensional objects as objects with just lengthen with some of them were flats where some of them were black circles are flat triangles and and even even lines they would all slide around on the surface of this flat world and of course they believe that uh they lived in a two dimensional world until\nThe climax until the climax of the of the novel when\nA three dimensional object a sphere inserts itself goes down in in in in ... into the plane of flat land and there's a square character who looks\nOut on his his fight when the rise and sees the appearance of this mysterious object he starts talking to him and the fear says I'm I'm I'm a three dimensional object then I come from another\nAnother world and the spurs says this can't be possible\nAnd the sphere just cannot convince the square that they're flat a two dimensional world there's been some better than a larger world so the sphere resorts to a more extreme measure and he he reaches over and pull the square off of the plane world of flat lining up into three dimensional space and\nOf course the than the square looks around and looks down on his flat world they can for the first time the the whole world spread out in front of them [noise] so the square it becomes a sort of a believer\nIn the existence of a higher dimension but there's a there's a third dimension and he goes back to his flat world of course in is pretty enthusiastic about this and can't can't stay quiet about it and unfortunately in ... and it's forbidden\nIt's forbidden by the by the high priest to talk about the existence of hired mentioned so he's put in jail where he\nWhere he stays for a number of year years and and the story ends with us for five square languishing in prison [noise] I'm hoping that the his readers ... some of his readers will be visionary enough to accept that there might be a more than meets the eye to to their reality so he sort of like\nThe idea that the high price of flat land wouldn't allow or anybody to talk about the other dimension I'm In a commentary on sort of maybe rigid dogma of our time\nYeah yeah exactly exactly he and he was he was very interested in commenting on the\nSort of as you say the rigidity and and the social norms of Victorian England you know when he where he lived he sort of had to stay in your line and not have any wild um any wild thoughts but ah but the square character did have these wild thought and and even at the visionary experience right where he thought that that was\nThat there was another space or direction to reality and and I'm\nSo happy I wrote the book just to kind of encourage people to [noise]\nYou know think about the possibility that above our free spaces are three spatial dimensions there might be others um that we don't see we go through our life I'm thinking of our world is the only world but you know may maybe there's something beyond\nWell it's a it's fun to to talk about and fun to imagine um but when you combine higher dimensions and the multi bars it gets pretty complicated [laughter]\nUm [laughter] I tell you what we're gonna we'll take we will jump into that will take a break first and we'll come back and get into that the inspiration or some of the stories that you tell about people who were inspired by this idea\nA very sad I mean people who embrace it and uh they they go through\nTrials in turmoil in trying to get their head around it as as I have a ... but we'll we'll get into that in a moment or we're talking with Christopher white about other world spirituality and the search for invisible dimensions of the doors break on through take us into the brick\n... speaking ... website you can scroll down to the bottom and click your just humid or\n\nThe religion of their childhood and still feeling spiritual for sure and and having a spiritual and tuition and\nGives me and mine was wanting to find wanting to seek out other ways of of being religious and many of them turned to these you know fantastic scientific concepts like higher dimension that has a new as a new more scientific way of thinking about\nUm you know the existence of other spiritual up levels are worlds to reality I Am an intimate mentioned story as you say he he grows up egos Oxford he\nFalls into this kind of depression he's not sure about anything anymore and then he he makes he makes a move that I think not a lot of people would make [laughter] right and the situation as he he embraces mathematics and geometry as a kind of a\nAnd he kind of hangs onto that as the only sure thing that there's a way in which the map provide certainty 'em to him but I think is his story a little bit unusual in that sense but then he developed\nI must say in the book he develops the whole way of\nThinking about higher spatial dimensions and he gets very interested in the end the mathematics of higher dimensions which I mentioned earlier in our conversation and he he starts to think you know what if these what if these mathematical variables in my ... and you know these higher these higher dimensions but I'm using\nWhat if they actually have a real existence somehow um\nYou know what if the math points to the real existence of these kinds of\nFaces and he he thought a lot about that and he he does something unusual and kind of unique he he develops over way of what he thought of as a sort of re educating the senses in order to catch glimpses into this\nInto a higher dimensional world so he developed a system of re educating the senses it involves um no it involves a set of twenty seven cubes that are labeled a all twenty seven are labeled and they're stacked up into like a Rubik's Cube you know it's three by three by three\nUm and he and then he he memorize the positions of all of the squares and the Rubik's Cube and then he'll uh and then he'll rotate a Rubik's Cube and then he'll memorize all those positions for essentially sort of an imaginative\nUm exercise but he believed that by doing it you're able to train yourself to perceive beyond the normal range of perceptions that we have so you know his mathematical colleagues sort of shook their heads I think ah [laughter] you know he was he was he was an assistant professor of math at Princeton a for a while\nBut he didn't he didn't get tenure you know when you're trying to get tenure you should be publishing and um and doing a research but instead he he was doing things like putting this this uh this cue these Cuba to gather and helping coach the prince and baseball team and he actually he actually also invented a pitching gun which was one of the first\nUm um you know automated pitching devices I'm ever invented so he did that and so he didn't get tenure prints and he uh he didn't do what he what he should have been doing but he went on to the University of Minnesota and then from there he just started writing popular books and articles about this idea that\nYou know that there may be higher spatial dimensions and and these [noise] you know our ways of thinking about these things might be a new way to a new scientific way to talk about spirituality but as you say he was just one there there are many others in the book who are\nSeeking for new scientific answers to their spiritual questions\nWell as you document and trace I mean the this idea catches on it gets into pop culture you've got a ... in ... and I I Would think con men and religious leaders who grab onto it yeah they\nAll use this idea for their own purposes\nYeah absolutely absolutely I mean I think a lot of people then you know and now a lot of people in the last hundred years are interested in scientific ideas as ways of\nUm as as new ways of thinking about spirit or spirituality or afterlife or heaven and so on and so I'd Hinton ideas and then a Abbott's ideas of course and flat land both of 'em both of their um [noise]\nNo they're writing really become important so modern artists take up these ideas a spiritual writers take up these ideas a lot of religious people and the U.S and then in Europe pick up these ideas a number of Christians take up these ideas as well um you know another person in the book chapter seven\nChapter ages is cs Lewis right which I'm ... who I'm sure many of your listeners have heard of cs Lewis are learning\n... the famous British a Christian I'm Christian apologist and Christian writer probably the most twenty century is most famous Christian writer he uh he incorporates these ideas as well you know he incorporates ideas about higher dimensions\nTo rethink Christian ideas such as the trinity um and he\nHe incorporates them in a number of sermons ... and and his right and then of course many people are familiar with the scent fantasy writings and the same ideas are on there as well he's got he's got reference to hire the mansions and um and he uses these concepts there and and he he was interested in them spiritually to you know he\nHe was he was raised in the church but then he becomes an atheist\nOr like many many characters in my book actually um he goes off to war\nBecomes an atheist\nOr like many like many characters in my book actually um he goes off to war\nAnd becomes disillusioned there's a number of people in there you know precisely is in there and James Bennett and I'm a number of people go off to World War one or World War two in the book and they have that they get into combat situations OJ W diamonds and they're also also in combat\nOr an out of body experience right\nYeah right exactly a number of those people have these kinds of experiences that really shake them to the core and\nCause them to sort of rethink a reality and rethink religion and for some of them those war experiences and disillusioned them and turn them off from religion but others are like like James Bennett a he has this kind of out of body experience right but I talk about in chapter six um\nWhich is a chapter really about dreams that seem to predict the future I'm kind of a kind of a cool chapter I really like the chapter on so he has this out of body experience and then his his journey is trying to figure out how mathematics and science and especially the science of higher dimensions how that might help explain what happened to him\nWell let's talk about dreams a little bit I explain it to me how how this would work how the idea of dreams are they coming from somewhere else higher reality another reality\nYeah yeah yeah no dreams are fascinating and um\nDreams seem to be important in just about every culture around the world um you know and in many cultures people have dream interpreters you know a special people who\nAre you tell your dream to and then they tell you what it means um and we have that in our culture too right we have all kinds of ah [laughter] we have all kinds of dream interpretation books and we have people like the Swiss psychotherapists Carl young who many people know about who\nIs is really important for people as they think about interpreting their dreams and so yeah uh people have long thought about the spiritual meaning of of dreams and in my book uh especially in that chapter six\nPeople are also wondering about the the spiritual meaning of dreams [noise] um [noise] in that book uh there's a figure who is his name is Jay W done who was a British\nAeronautical engineer of the soldier and and goes into combat and the second bowler war in South Africa right around the turn of the twenty century he's he's in combat in Nineteen oh two [noise]\nAnd he starts to have dreams that\nThey're not surprised him he starts to have dreams are and nightmares really about terrible things happening and the dreams are then seem to happen in real life so he has\nHe has predict of dreams or ... what are sometimes called pre cognitive dreams his dreams that seemed to predict the future [noise]\nAnd these these surprise him I'm like I said they they do begin as he's camped out\nWith his with his platoon so they they seem to begin in combat situations and he started having them and he at first he wondered if he was maybe going insane I'm from the stress of battle and these kinds of things but he would have dreams\nAnd then he would wake up generally what happened was that he would have dreams and then you wake up in the next day or the day after that or the day after that he'd open the newspaper and see the event and the newspaper so one of the dreams that he talks about in one of his books\nHe has a dream where he sort of standing on a hill he's looking down the hill towards the ocean and he's obviously on an island\nHe recognizes the island as as an someplace he's already been into streams you notice is that there's cracks and fissures in the ground and the decisions are venting gas um that the ground is rumbling people seem to be going about their business they're speaking French\nBut he's panicked and he's he's he's trying to alert people he's he knows that something is going to go wrong he knows who's going to be a volcanic eruption so he's running around trying to get people's attention he doesn't speak French\nThey don't seem to speak English he ends up talking to one official after another official after another no one really believed him and he ends up waking up and kind of a sweat in a panic a couple of days later he opens up the newspaper and he reads about this a catastrophic volcanic\nEruption and the island of Martinique the French speaking island of Martinique 'em and several of the details from his dream or correct um than some of them aren't some of them aren't as well and he tries to think um you know how could this be how could how could in in my dreams how could I have seen an event that hasn't happened\nAnd he he keeps it to himself for a while but there's venture discharged and has back to the u._k. where he he actually is a early inventor of airplanes um and his his

you know you you're raised into a higher spatial dimension and then you can suddenly have this incredible powers the vision that you didn't have before right you can see through walls right you can see in places that you're not um\nSo yeah people people in Moody's book um and and many others you know there's a lot of literature now about near death experiences they people do um sometimes use the language of higher dimensions to talk about what they experience\nI'm not to say on says in the same category but you do are addressed say on this end up people's attempts to reach a\nHigher a hour or an another world um [noise] you know what's\nGoing on with those folks are they is there any legitimacy to that or or do you not want to pass judgment on it\n[noise] yeah I don't know um you know it's funny it's funny writing a book like this because\nYou know I've never had any of these experiences [laughter] I've never had a dream that seemed to predict the future um you know I've never had an out of body experience right or some of the um some of the experiences I've talked about [noise] so have\nYou know I Know deja vu\nDeja vu for sure yeah\nYeah I'm so in the book I Try to talk about a lot of experiences that other people are happy and um\nYou know and I tried to put them play their voices and and how they understood\nOf experiences that other people are happy and um\nYou know and I tried to put them play their voices and and how they understand what's happening [noise] um but I don't I don't know about finances you know I I wouldn't rule it out as being as being possible you know I mean I think that I mean if one thing if this book taught me one thing it would be that\nI think that the the world is is a much more complex and ah\nAnd amazing really than than we now uh you know I think there's much more to the universe than meets the guy um [noise]\nYou know I I Do believe that a man and I think we know that from science I mean when you when you look at the or the business is a cosmologist and read their\nRead their narratives about the universe read they're popular science publications I mean there's just there's more to the universe than meets the eye and so I really wouldn't rule out um spirits are ghosts are all those kinds of things you know I\nI I wouldn't be so arrogant as to as to you know sit here and say oh you know you definitely there is no way that anyone could have an experience like that um\nI guess I Would just remain open to the open to those possibilities\nAnd you know I think what people would want to know is a is there a higher dimension that happened that would count as an and if so do we go there and do we live live on beyond this\nYeah yeah right that's another big question that I Try to raise in the book the book is has all of these big questions um [noise]\nYou know and and I don't answer that question the book I think that's another question like your question about spirits and goes and found says I'm I'm certainly open to the to the possibility there and and personally I I I Do believe that there is a nother world that we go to after the world I mean personally I Am I'm a believer you know I'm\nI Do believe in God and I do believe in spirit so I think I'm I think I'd line up more on that side of things with a kind of an openness to these different possibilities I'm like I say in the book I Try to put different voices in there and who have different opinions and the reader kind of defined what they're saying you know I'm\nTrying to think what goals as a bunch of folks on the phone to talk to you will go east of the Rockies Moses in Tallahassee Iran with Christopher white\nYou're you're more than ... ... go door to mourn and thanks for calling\nWhat's on your mind or of course to go do are you familiar with the customers during a Bible cold milk cheese Burger King you know so I'm a ... I was maybe they'll have to stop it all the\nUh right now I'm not I'm not real familiar with that but maybe you can tell me a little bit about him\nOkay we're going to do what you bring during the word middle to the middle of this show quote that were black or a bird dog ... most people know choose me industry\nFolks who'd meanings produced it starts with a teacher there is to the real ... character ... mother love Baba ... who are in a very crucial to assign book into the\nInto the Duke and got recreate ignore the stroke care for them so I Do want to have produced over two songs about what you're talking about murder of ... ... ...\nIf a quarter and send it I Would open my dog ferrying upon according to\nOur dog ... pro bowl\nMoses you ever do you have a question for Chris ...\nWho are getting all this all involve the shock was will do that will give them the cold call though so I won't get one guy was principal going in a conservative ...\nThank you for the call on thank you yeah no I'm not too familiar with the ... the deck and these characters from the Bible I at the end I thought\nI heard you say something about ... I'm incorporating shock or is into the comment um and so yeah I Do I Do talk a bit about chalk Rosen energy fields in the book you know that that's another that's another language that people use for\nFor spirit right and soul and and spiritual energies in a in the body and so on and and people do use higher dimensional language to talk about those as well\nA wildcard Charles in Texas good morning Charles\nGood good morning a and it is definitely the more you're going to get laid off\nBut anyway my um my question is well I I tried to narrow it down as much as a kid you know for I guess for diamonds they have a ... but it just really this is sort of an issue where you can you can't really narrow things down this way you know and really we're\nGoing to narrow it down 'cause in two minutes we're going to go to a break so\nWell anyway I I guess I could ask this question I don't know if you've ever read that J. D. priest leaves on national Christopher here and if you've ever read the pre ... a sort of a big essay on um it's called man in time it was published along with uh with one young books\nAs the head of the wonderful book you have to a great book\nYeah yeah oh how could you do you have read it will very good well I think you can say about it um [noise] one of the biggest issues I been happening is is with the I guess with the ... the particularly the game to still be attached to get on the anthropology of physics it never really\nExamine they're that they're sort of preconceived their prejudices that come from their ... says this is why I suppose\nI don't know about toward a about time about the issue of a time and and you know sort of what it is how it arises how would it can be even a fundamental dimension of our ah reality you know and also the whole perception or not just the time but I mean\nI when I look at things in a quantum level we we see that everything is\nEverything is is a sort of waves and I mean of course people don't even have waves are frequencies are but but time becomes very essential 'cause it gets the existence of matter that you do an art project or a perception of it anyway so I mean they just\nAnyway do you have any comments or thoughts about\nThank you Charles appreciate the call\nThat's a good that's a great question and that's a that's a wonderful book come J. B. precisely I talk about in chapter six quite a bit he's a fascinating character I'm a very famous British writer playwright twentieth century and BBC broadcaster\nHe gets really I'm interested in higher dimensions time he read his hands and who we talked about he reads Jay W done who have talked about um and he comes up and did all his own theories interestingly Priestley like some of the other figures in the book has a combat experience he also fights in World War one\nA young person and as um as an injured [noise] um and he also has some he also has some unique experiences of feeling like he's out of time or feeling like he's out of the body and then he writes this great book that the caller mentioned\nExperiences of feeling like he's out of time out feeling like he's out of body and then he writes the great book that the caller mentioned are called man and hina [noise]\nUm and in the book you have all kinds of testimonials from people who have written about their ... cognitive dreamed a dream that came to predict future then um he actually gets on the BBC\nAnd Nineteen sixty two or three member\nAnd he he asked the the viewing audience to write him letters if they've ever had an unusual time experience I've ever looked at a time if they've ever had a dream that predict the future and he got over Fifteen hundred letters I'm from\nI'm not going to be when I Am but like many letters still extent still at the University of Bradford I've been married to read through all the letters and I I incorporate\nA number of time in my book especially will be a Christopher white will take a break we are talking about other worlds with Chris white and Tom Petty things as it into the break we'll get to more of your calls and questions minimum\nAnd all of a sudden you'll have the moving pictures because light changes and you move and you have ... and people and co chairs and own hair styles and it's just the love they have you ever tried be flashing exercises\nYeah no I I've never tried reflection of exercises although in my book I talk a bit about um [noise]\nAnd actually some classes I teach of after college I talk about meditation on reflective surfaces so you know there's\nAn iPhone crying you know I don't know if you've heard that word is crying before but that is sort of meditating on a reflective surface it could be a computer screen or television screen or selective water or a crystal ball or a number of different services but I Know that that is a spiritual and and visionary practice that a number of people use\nIn order to you know what what we say reach a higher consciousness or um [noise]\nYeah but that sounds similar to the kind of practice you're talking about\nUh Marcia I just wrote down I'm going to give that a try thanks for the suggestion that\nDollar [laughter] than reading from\nThings for the idea right east of the Rockies Michael in Connecticut I'm Michael\nWhat happened to me is I uh I started writing the dream journal [noise] and I I wrote a dream that my mother's husband who was dead was going to give them a used car [noise] and all that money so [laughter]\nI didn't believe it was gonna happen but it did happen and I'm now drive and whose car and I got the money too so it was very strange to me that a dream I wrote it down when when the gate and everything and it came true like months later\n[noise] [noise] yeah yeah that's right yeah there's a\nThere's a whole technique that GW done talks about in his book experiment with time that I talk about in my book about dream journal and how to do it sounds like\nYou did that you know you keep a journal there you have a dream up you write it down right away and and um keep a whole journal and think about your dreams and he believed that you know like you you believe everyone would start having these experiences where they would see these Clinton says I'm going into the future and their dream so that that's a cool experience\nThank you Michael for sharing a wildcard lined Joe in Monterey, California good morning Joe\n[noise] good evening George I'm I was about to ask your guest if he ever meditative but I\nThought that it might be better if I introduce another concept to him as a what they call a super conscious mind [noise]\nI'm not I'm remote a few in remote viewing has it's drawbacks this is a mental or is this a mental travel or sold travel but it's also in a higher state of Seoul travel a call ... conscious mind and you can access the entire world\nUm I Do this with my clients and are they going to a different world for different reasons whether it's hailing whether it's me to love one uh for other reasons um it's an extremely um complex\nA multi inverse and there's so many different things out there doing so much so many different things\nI was wondering if he ever a contented also a kind of a higher shelf of remote of writing and say it's not like you're writing automatic that automatic writing it's really listening to your higher shelf as I call it like taking dictation\nAnd all it does or you need to do is go into like an alpha state or a train stayed and just start writing\nPatients and all that does all you need to do is go into like an alpha state or a train stayed and just start writing but listening to your thoughts not thinking but listening to what comes to you and after a short time it will start to come out and you'll be channeling your higher shelf\n[noise] yeah yeah I liked that comment because it reminds me of um [noise] you know sometimes the ways that people talk about higher dimensions as ... as a as a dimension of consciousness right um and and you definitely have this and\nTwentieth century psychologist and Carl young ... and many others um you know when we talk about there being three spatial dimensions to our world and if there was a fourth direction or dimension where would that be some people say well it's going in you know it's going not going out somewhere it's going to end\nThat consciousness sort of um occupies this this sort of a new direction um\nAnd yeah through meditative practices I think it is possible to\nTo access those those dimensions um you'd asked if I meditate I Do meditate you know I Do sort of mindfulness meditation and I definitely get into a right into his own or do you feel sort of peaceful and quiet and calm I haven't had any visionary experiences while meditating if it's much more a\nMuch more mundane unfortunately but um but I Do I Do meditate um and and do some of those practices and in my book I talk about others who have these kind of visionary meditative practices um sounds like what you do\nThanks show for the call you know you read about the musicians and writers who suddenly get inspiration from just out of the blue McCarty has written about you know writing yesterday you woke up with it in his head yeah or or or other songwriters entire songs already written it came from somewhere else\nYeah and you talked and talked to scientists about scientific creativity and scientific convention and\nMany scientists why these same kinds of stories some of them will talk about during some of them will talk about other forms of inspiration some of them will say that these ideas came from somewhere else and I don't know where they came from some of them will talk about different there ... there's different layers of consciousness um so I think there's a lot of mystery isn't there\nA Gordon in Lakeland, Florida good morning Gordon on the wild card mind your own with Chris white\nYou know George had a I don't think I've ever\nCalled in the year so I I usually call them to know each other and Dr ... thank you for taking my call the class not question I wanted to just\nReference ... hailing it's found in Hebrew chapter seven which makes reference to the king of failing on the top and I uh genesis fourteen so I'm going to end up for ...\nFor the listeners and ... and ... and you didn't want it now I I Want to plan on getting your opinion on not not feeling in my theory that you up it was the angels and the BLM are usually the same button from came from a different name for I'm a Christian\nThey'd hold to the um Enron and the Eighteenth prohibition against contacting the spirit world but not in contact with then I have a theory in most cases and and ... I Want to ask your opinion whether\nThe you saw that video up there on on the post has left by I think that they may be using magnets\nTo make a that pot shops a pencil or pen jump around but I also think it's possible but there are genuine demon angels\nUh parents which may may actual I don't think it's likely they are the parents but in kidney or maybe you're controls eating from another dimension and some out there you hold in most cases the game on a map grading\nAnd you can eat team but in some cases there may be Eighteen trying to stay on the line in case you want to ask you a question\nOr something because this is pretty deep\nWell that's a lot on their Gordon let's let's get their take on some of that\nYeah there there's a lot there um there is a lot there and there's a you know there's a whole all of the uh all of the science fiction literature and um\nAnd even alien abduction literature uses that language of other dimensions right that that these that these beans came from another dimension hum so there definitely is a lot of that in my book and there's a lot of that in American Pop culture\nAbout um other dimensional or other dimensional beings um you also raise the question of\nYou know what is the relationship of UFOs and extra traditional cultural beings to ghosts and spirits or demons and that that's also a question that people raise 'em and I'm not sure I'd be able to shed any additional light on that I I Know that\nFrom just some of my reading and and not literature and here I'm thinking of like ... I don't know if you know what at least drivers and stuff on ... on communion or yes she has a new book um [noise]\nI'm On the subject as well but he he talks sort of like you do I mean he he also wonders um what the relationship is between\nAlien abduction and extraterrestrials on the one hand versus um spirits and goes on the other so he I think Whitley it's come to come to believe that there's there's a connection and it sounds like you've you've come to believe that as well that there's a\nConnection somehow you know maybe departed spirits hum are aliens or aliens or departed spirits\nDo we think we explore the idea of a unified theory of weirdness on the program Chris I'm looking for his actions\nAnd you'd be amazed how many scientists or a behind the scenes are interested in those kind of subject as well whether there's a connection yeah looking at the idea of the universe and many worlds theory and you talk about it in your book of course\nThat wasn't that long ago that that would have been too far out for just about any of them to accept and now it's it's not all that a controversial anymore\nIsn't it crazy yeah it's really crazy I mean yeah and there's a number of ways of thinking about a a world or a universe with many worlds right I mean you mentioned the many worlds theory quantum mechanics and there's of course also the the multiverse idea right the multiverse ideas that there's\nYou know I'm a large number or an infinite number of other universes in addition to our visible universe and [noise]\nYou know I um I Believe now that that's a that's a very mainstream I'm sort of conventional wisdom now among cosmologists in theoretical physicist that that there is a multi versus you know which is", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "Yankton", "day": "29"}
