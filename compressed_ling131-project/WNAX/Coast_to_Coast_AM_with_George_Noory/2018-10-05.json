I mean I don't know if I classify shining the slasher\nUm but it's certainly a horror film and and and and ... and ... and a good one and I think it's what I mean forty years old or something now right you know these these are these modern horror films are pretty how are you know the ring is Twenty years old\nYou know so um [noise] you know it's a ... ... you know they'll do a lot of 'em are are are ah you know whoa hold up pretty well um with age and I I really I think a Halloween was\nIs really a pretty suspenseful movie and Donald pleasant this really excellent that was kind of like the cap and a half trying to stop there is a woman I call a killer actually not even ...\nThat's the one from Nineteen Seventy eight man\nNineteen Seventy eight is a forty year anniversary of the original hollowing ... managing it's been that long like gosh [laughter]\nAh and John Carpenter who of course gave us a the remake of the singer and less came from New York Ken how bunch of other of\nHorror films a science fiction a heat of the original concept was that it was going to be an anthology is that every Halloween they would do a different theme or different type of a scary movie and the first story was called the babysitter killers\nAnd and they were the babysitter killer and that was the ... that was the Michael Meyers story Halloween store kicked up and uh the character became so popular um\nThe mask he's wearing they were trying to come up with a scary math and and what they ended up doing was taking my William Shatner Star Trek mass spray painting it white\n[laughter]\nSo that's ... that's a lawyer ... wearing um\nI Wonder if we'll feels about that\nYeah I don't know uh but uh you know ... and ... you know it's the fact that it took a blank [laughter] you know expression on the mask and and and not deliberately scary face\nA you know I think that that made it more uh more scary you know I think a lot of times they are newer movies they try to heart you're talking about the conjuring and\nSome of 'em there was a family of failed there's an a bell which uh you know the original dog that the war and uh have in their basement full of uh object\nIs Iraq at the end all and we all know what raggedy and looks like and the one that they hand ended up doing in the movie\nThey tried to make it look scary a it looks like something out of spirit Halloween you know and they and and it's just it's it's a you know they don't want to trust the stop or to stack and you know they're like oh what a beautiful dog with its like horrific looking right off the bat\nYou know much scarier when it's something you least expect you know no one would think that\nThat their little ... gonna\nGonna try to possess them or haunt them her birthday\nComing up on fifty years Rosemary's Baby can you believe that started early\nThat either and that's ... to\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI was terrified of these I mean I I was like\nIn my Spiderman pajamas a you know just sweating under the coffee table\nShaking with here I'd have to go into the other room I was the kind of a kid that when the skipper were yelling Gilligan during Gilligan's Island I Would have to get out of the real you know it was a little too little too hot when skipper ... Gilligan whether it's ... you know\nAnd we were watching my dad and I think what a lot of movies that bonding thing you know fathers son\nKind I'm the same way I was going to talk about that and I I Will but you're exactly right and\nAnd I think it kind of a rite of passage you know and and I think originally I was watching the movie the kind of be with my dad and I think it would be in the recliner watching creature feature right next to him or hiding behind the recliner sometime\nAnd you know it ... I think it was maybe I don't know if it was calling hand or just the hand but they have the very convincing and crawl embodied hand crawling by itself\nAnd I and and um I I I haven't bothered me so much to my dad you know if the rubber hand their faith bill with great jelly and you know are manipulating liars and ... and I'm sure his explanation was dead wrong but but put into this perspective a white\nThere they're fine kind they're playing the show this is this is the game you know this is something can make a ... this is just the torture me that I'm doing fine\nAnd I think it was a kind of an a ha kind of moment and I think from that point forward\nAh I couldn't get enough you know I was a high ... if it ... and not just for all you know I feel is is that under our anti fi I think are under the ... of fantasy though uh\nI think the horror is an offshoot of fantasy and so it's by by I I like all of that I like a John or movie by like a you know ... a month and a robot than injured and pirates and all\nMy dad used to bring me God rest his soul to all these movies when I was a kid\nI remember him taking me to see the ... when I was seven years old Mr long ago yeah and then of course the scary one for me I was nine years old the house on the haunted hill than when the original one with Vincent Price right\nI mean how hard wired\nBlind woman in the cellar man I thought\nHe would bring me to all these movies I don't know if he brought me because my mom didn't want to go or\nWhen he just wanted me around but\nI mean all these all these movies he would bring me too yeah and then the the TV shows he would love to see\nScience fiction theater in in ... in those kinds of shows right you know you'd have them on all the time I think he's one of the reasons why my mother is one of the reasons why I got into broadcasting and I'm you know indoor UFOs and the paranormal\nBut my dad got me into these movies and all these science fiction shows he loved those things\nWill sure you know and all of those and I think it all ties together you know because I think that curiosity you know I'm just the fact like just like a like a show like Star Trek my you know kind of brought us the cell phone\nAnd ah you know all sorts of thing\nYou know I think that the curiosity for this a cult supernatural you know I think it's probably the janitor or the Steve although a lot of um your your guests on your show who started watching these ah movies and and decided to go hey let's dig deeper\nI think so too what do you think of the Texas Chainsaw massacre Nineteen Seventy four [laughter]\nYou know the the Texas Chainsaw massacre ... has had the heaviest wrap everyone was trying to do the Texas Chainsaw massacre there is hardly a drop of blood in that whole movie\nYou'd think there is you think there is I\nThink the areas right you know and you go back and watch it\nAnd you know it's all still murky sixteen millimeter and he took the chainsaw and the the how weird their house was all over the mold mobiles made out of bones and\nYou know the the psychological aspect is really what clicked with that movie and I think that everyone that what came after it was not really I think they're really sloppy slap dash\nYou know a bunch of teenagers waiting to get ... kind of movies but really as the original Texas Chainsaw\nThey were they were they were heartbroken when they got an R rating they were trying to get a PG E because there was no one was going to go see it\nThe Nineteen sixty Alfred Hitchcock movie psycho loose shower scene you would think yeah you were looking at ... moons every second not one to stabbing did you see in that shower saying\nNo no no point does the knife a entered Janet Leigh body at any point a unit\nYou know it's happening but you don't see\nThat the sounds I think out a lot of that and there were a bunch of other ... there were a bunch of melon but they had laid out and they were stabbing different types of melon Hitchcock is ... ... channel watching this pound guy you know making all these weird hollow strange down stabbing all these different fruits and vegetables [laughter]\n... doesn't say a word in ads he's walking out the door he just says to stop a\nBlair Witch project started with pennies but that was a scary one to\nBlair Witch project is really interesting because you know a a you know they were uh unfortunately I had a friend who was ushered when a when that movie came out and he was cleaning up bomb it every single night in his job he couldn't handle it\nBecause it will and it wasn't because it was scary it was because people hadn't had become accustomed to the pound footage\nFirst person you know just a just a handy cam or a camcorder filming a whole movie [noise]\nUm you know so uh you know that was kind of a first of all sort of found footage types films\nAnd an independent film it went really big and you know and it's like okay well you can tell you what you want about that movie but\nYou know that in that movie was a that was the director have final cut and they made the movie they let the way they wanted to make it and they created this whole legend that much more I mean I live in Pennsylvania not far from where the Blair Witch supposed to happen and people still\nDrive in they're looking to uncover this thing that never happens so they really really great job of not only are making of a a found footage film but but creating a a a a story that people wanted to believe in and uh you know he had nowadays I think I'd be hard to do\nBecause of the Internet it gives you can't keep a secret for twenty second but in Nineteen Ninety nine a full day everybody everyone thought the Blair Witch was the thing\nWhat did you think of Freddie Krueger then nightmare on elm street\nYou know it's interesting I didn't like it when I saw it originally uh you know it just it was kind of just greedy and\nCame out in Nineteen eighty four right\nAny for but you know I I've gone back and there's a lot of humor in it and and it's very marriage that said you know he's not just stabbing people going into their dreams [noise]\nUh which I think they pretty liberally ripped off from the movie dream scape which I mean kingly near before which is an excellent movie that people should seek out where someone was trying to assassinate the president inside of his dream right ah but ah yeah ... it's actually very clever movie and and uh\nAny any are no more than ever they\nGo five six seven equals yet they're getting pretty bad\nThere was a movie out two thousand fourteen I never saw it as kind of weird movie it shows up as one of the horror films have you ever heard of the bottle do [noise]\n[noise] yes I have you know and I did not like the bottom do very much for the

it it just a John Carpenter again we've mentioned several of drunk carpet assumes Halloween being one of them uh they live being one of them the fog lawn of one of them so\nI mean John John Carpenter you know next to Steven King I mean John Carpenter dominated the eighties or with a lot of really wonderful imaginative bill\nWere these inexpensive movies to make\nA comparatively I mean we weren't like Star Wars movies you know I think the great thing about a horror film um the beauty of a horror film is that you know you can scare some even think sixty thousand dollars and make fourteen million dollars\nFrom the ... absolutely so\nSo so that I think that that's why it's such a hearty genre because you can make it on the cheap [laughter] usually the darker you make it and the more

I think if a horror movie has too much money at it\nIt seems protected you know you look at the second Terminator movie you know if if it doesn't play out like a horror film like the first one of the shift too much money and it feels like a franchise\nSo um you know a horror film you know you almost need the cap the budget because if you put too much money and do it [noise] it stops them like a surprise and and if he can keep the train coming down the track no one is going to knowing shouting blue is going to scare you you know so you it has to kind of be\nA slight of hand it has to appear spontaneous and I think that's why\nA lot of low budget horror films like neither the living dead for ... grand a are incredibly scary [noise] and they're cheap\nActors like Bruce Campbell has made a living doing lower budget horror film seven thing\nAbsolutely yeah he's like the Olivier oh\nReally is\nAnd uh you know and and I you know I got to interview him and he's charming guy and ah you know he uh he loves a you know he pretends he doesn't like it but he he he likes it he likes the attention than\nHe likes to check the likes\nOf paycheck absolutely you know and ah I'm evil dead is a is a great a film for an actor I mean he pretty much just carrying that whole movie on his back he's putting himself through\nA you know all of these ... it's almost like a Chapel Hill where it just hits you just following through all of these tap blows that they've created for him so it it you know ... not too many actors can can carry a whole movie on their back\nWhat do you think of the Stephen King movies from his books that all seemed to have that horror type feeling for in a cemetery in things like\nThat yeah yeah I mean I I like Stephen King films a lot more than the books I mean but I mean I'm a film guy you know people always say oh well the book was better it's like they're not exchange commodities you know I mean like Dan is different than a sculpture you\nKnow ... book is different than a movie or just you know when you're in the mood for a movie you you you're not in the mood to read a book and vice versa and\nYou know what works in a book doesn't work in a movie and I I think that a lot of my favorite Stephen King stuff is all the short stories [laughter]\nI think his novels or to a padded too long winded you know what I understand about Stephen King and I you know I've never met the man\nBut you know he doesn't know where the story ends when he starts he just he just keeps righty he he's just a surprise is we are because he just keeps writing and drinking and writing and ... same issue you know and and then uh you know five hundred pages later it's done\nSo there's NO PLAN going in a ... which I think allows for him to the ... you know again there was no formula so I think that I think that that's why his books are so surprising but I think if the same time [noise] you know a good director can kind of oil back down to its asked him\nYou know he hated the film the shining and the film a shining I think stands as one of the best pieces of art you know the twentieth century so I you know I don't know\nWhat about TV shows that are dealing with horror like the walking dead and things like that\nAh yeah it's interesting 'cause you know I mean the walking dead has definitely I feel like oh these everything tonight of Olympic that yes and you know now it's kind of come down to the mainstream come down to the front line you know you go into the wall Mart and you see the you know\nThe rubber ears the true hanging around your neck or the you know the whatever dead inside the signs and\nIt's a very commercial [noise]\nUm you know I think that you know so um and I think it's kind of cowboys and Indians to walk 'em in modern zombie movies you know and this year the animals that you can you can go out\nAnd we don't you know we're we're in the world of revert politically correct world there there there aren't many a screen feelings that you can kind of indiscriminately um shoot mowed down with a gun\nAnd have no uh we you know a record percussion\nWe're going to come back and take some form of phone calls and I'm all about what Mr ... she'll give out a couple of your Web sites\n[noise] Ah yes cinnamon dot com and five Seventy four dot\nCom and we've got that linked up for all of the U.S coast to coast am dot com so stay with us those have you on hold will do the best we can to get up to all of you when we come right back on the coast to coast and the next hour we begin to talk with Dr Merrill Lynch blitz about the other side life after death\nOr her latest book is called death makes life possible how 'bout that so we'll be back in a moment to funnel calls with Mr ... on the coast to coast they\nSign up now for coastal zone or pre email newsletter did it today at coast to coast am dot com\nApple TV grown cats us on the dot com and download the U.S ... and I do go to U.

you wrote back in two thousand Fifteen makes was possible told me about the time how did you come up\nWith well I like to say I did but I was working in partnership with Deepak Chopra a for a film we made a\nFeature length documentary by that title and he was the one that I was giving a lecture at one of his workshops and I was showing a little video that I had done with some of the scientists who are working in this area of you know after death reincarnation\nAnd he pulled me aside after I was done and he's like Marilyn let's make a movie and I thought well wouldn't\nWant to make a movie with Deepak Chopra and then I went to bed at night and I woke up the next morning completely petrified you know the whole idea of having to fundraise and all the rest of it and\nSo at lunch I think Tim very profusely and explains that I really wasn't going to be able to do it and he said oh Marilyn stop worrying about the money the money will come\nAnd I'd like to say it wasn't just that easy but uh we did accomplish something that now has been all over the world translated into multiple languages and\nAired on Oprah about two years ago so it's been out there and making 'em an impact with people who are struggling our goal in both the film and the book was to help transform that fear that people have into an inspiration for really living well\nI mean I was told people I'm not in a hurry to leave but I'm not scared to do it\nRight and we will eventually all\nOf the world that's a whole interesting thing to in terms of the future science you know we see now that\nThis cloning is happening

start to see the future of humanity\nWhat'd you say to people Marilyn hogwash life after death does not continue when we die schools what do you say\nWell I'm very respectful that people have various different perspectives different world views and my inclination is to think that what we really believe is probably what we're gonna end up and\nUh so those people who believe in reincarnation may well reincarnate and those people who believe in sort of the Buddhist journey of enlightenment um may end up through in a\nYou know maybe in a black hole somewhere you know alternating at the [noise] the threshold of some event horizon I mean I think all of those things\nThat seemed completely farfetched in the past are now something that we can really start to grapple with when I made the film I interviewed a Michael ... who is\nIn the ... the well known skeptic he's also you know a really smart guy very interesting and and I use the guy yeah I Would say so and I had a really great time interviewing\nHim and what was fascinating they were two things first of all I he acknowledged that when his mom died he heard her voice\nAnd I you know with a little surprised that he was telling me this on film and I said well really lets you know go back to that and he said oh well you know it was really nothing but yeah I heard her voice\nAnd I thought well that's interesting acknowledge Mitt and he had a good psychological justification that was just some kind of hitting the gods ... experience right at that threshold of of sleep and dreaming\nBut it was interesting that he acknowledged it and then the second thing that I I really loved was that um he got married shortly after my interviewing him\nAnd I guess they got married in either his house or his uh now White House and her father grandfather I Can't remember the details exactly but had left her a radio\nAnd uh it didn't work and Michael had tried and tried to fix it and eventually in frustration he stuck to the radio in a drawer and didn't think about it anymore and then months later\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOr going bankrupt if you will but thousands dollars or more in credit card debt you know have the right to

with Dr Merrill Lynch ... makes life possible also consciousness and healing as well and the Marilyn would you tell us the story of the reincarnation of the little child\nWas so many stories that I'm just want him to step birth march or something like\nWell Stevenson was a very unusual psychiatrist who developed a very strong interest in trying to document cases of reincarnation\nAnd he collected about a thousand case studies of young children who had had a some experience in the past life that they report it to their family he went in and investigated um did corroborating evidence interviewed people read medical report\nAnd in about thirty five percent of the people that he identified they had some kind of unusual birth mark a so it's not a typical mall but some kind of unusual birth mark\nAnd it was often associated with the cause of death of the person that the young child remembered\nSo there were numerous examples where for a for instance one child remembered being a man from a different village\nOr in Asia and he um [noise] in Stevens and then went and investigated the biography of this person that the child remembered being and it turns out that that person was shot through the chess in the same place\nEntry and exit a where the bullet ostensibly went through the body and soul\nThat becomes a kind of biological source of evidence for reincarnation and these young people you know it's not absolutely evidence but or evidence Shaw but it's still compelling\nIn our film we interviewed Jim Tucker who now works in the same Institute at the University of Virginia that in Stephenson had founded and he tells the story of a young boy who uh you know very early just about the time he learned to speak\nRemembered being his grandfather and he would tell his dad when his dad was changing his diapers or I use to change your diapers\nAnd it was kind of shocking for these parents yeah sure and then this kid's started\nRemembering other things about the kind of car that he used to drive and so as a little testy a parent's got a bunch of pictures from the dad and the first of all they had a class picture when he was in elementary school\nAnd so this would be the child grandfather and they asked him to pick out which one was him and he had no problem finding himself in the line up\nAnd then uh they were going through some of the other snapshots and he saw his car\nAnd he said that's my car that's my car I used to drive their car and so again it's not even definitive evidence that there is a kind of um [noise] survival of consciousness or identity after ... death but these instances give us really compelling\nIdeas about what is possible\nIt's truly remarkable in the remember the study of the little boy who claimed that he was a World War two pilots and the new things about the plane landed too hard the tires would blow up and really nobody knew the other than the crew and the pilot\nAnd he was telling us ... and the and the doctor verified and they took them to a reunion a World War two veterans and she knew several of the people from his unit was an amazing story you remember the Jews\nI'm I'm vaguely remembering it I don't remember the details of it but I think you're right these things are phenomenally intriguing and it's very exciting I Know that the University of Virginia right now is hiring a post doc to work part time with them and part time at the Monroe Institute\nTo do some psycho physiological research on this\nAh we're right now setting up a lab here at Sophia to look at the cycle mantey um um this was a a technique that was used by the ancient or colds in Greece and say I'm ... ostensibly were able to identify and communicate with spirits\nBy looking at are gazing upon a reflective surface and Raymond Moody develops this protocol where he put people in a darkened room\nPut a mirror on the wall illuminated the mirror and such a way that you couldn't see your own reflection but\nBecause we're kind of going into a ... state people start to see things and hear things and experience things\nAnd uh you know there have been a number of experiments looking at people's ability to make contact with their departed loved ones and they have those kind of conversations that they never had a chance to have\nAnd it has been shown to be extremely useful for a brief moment counseling so people have an opportunity they have the conversation they can see it\nThey can see there's the spirits and so what we're doing now is bringing that idea into a virtual reality environment so we'll have people sitting with the virtual reality goggles\nUh looking at a mirror in a sensory deprivation procedure and we're going to record and try to understand what it is that people are experiencing when they enter that states\nOne of her birth special guests officer and a researcher Rosemarie Ellen ... uses black mirror ... to do a lot of the\nCountry really strange uh-huh sort or be interested in talking to her yeah\nYeah just to do with the charm if you were the marijuana and to get you in touch with her or her website is visionary living dot com you might be more straight through there\nOkay but what you're saying even that title for website is really not so much about what happens after but\nHow those ideas and beliefs and form how we live in now\nAnd you know we know that people believe different things even within a common culture a all we have to do is look at the political debate that's happening right now to know that people justify their beliefs based on different kinds of evidence\nAnd while in our culture we tend to\nUm hold in esteem the idea of rations rationality about reason about the idea of objectivity and we we make appeals that if we have good objective data that that then is the evidence it's going to shape our beliefs\nBut what we see is that it's most often something else it's most often a personal direct experience something emotional or transformative and that's what really shaped our belief and then we just rationalize the rest of it in the name of objective data\nAbsolutely or social doctor Marilyn ... we're talking about the
