down in the lead to two thousand sixteen period when he was exposed to world changing science\nWhich suggested that country the mainstream assumptions consciousness has not produced by the brain now after researching extensively he wrote this book an end to upside down thinking to introduce all of us to these cutting edge ideas and your use on coast to coast I've got this really shocked you wouldn't actually more didn't it\nAbsolutely shocked me thank you for having me on\nI'm looking forward to this too I always ask questions of scientists and people who are experts on the brain\nDoes consciousness exist outside of the brain or not know the pure scientists June the medical professional folks mark would always say you have to have the brain in order to have consciousness of the brain dies it all goes with it\nAnd I've always thought no there's something else here which consciousness you finally found out did you\n[laughter] I did and I I was very squarely in what's known as the materialist science camp which suggests that the universe is fundamentally made of matter there was a big bang about Thirteen point eight billion years ago killing the universe with physical material that we call matter\nAnd when you have enough matter in this big universe you're bound to get interactions between those pieces of matter we call that chemistry\nWhen you have enough random chemical reactions you're at you're bound to end up with\nA self replicating molecule like DNA chance says that would happen and DNA leads to the evolution of living organisms like a human being the human being developed the brain and consciousness awareness comes out of the brain that's the perspective\nAnd if you buy into that which I used to and then when the brain dies consciousness dies memories are gone than when you think about meaning in life\nIf you take the material is perspective very strictly there can't be any meaning because once one of the dead there is no memories there's no consciousness and that's the prevailing perspective as you mentioned in science and most of science today\nKnow looking at your bio I Would lose money in a bad scene that you would write a book about consciousness how the heck did you do this\nI Would have lost money too [laughter] so it was\nAbout two years ago when I first learned of these phenomenon as I said I was totally materialist that's what I Would call it now in hindsight [noise]\nUh but I I randomly stumbled across pod cast that started talking about these ideas I was actually listening to a health podcast called extreme health radio and the next one and the cue was a woman who talked about energy and psychic abilities that she had and at the end of it her name is Laura Powers\nShe mentioned that she had her own podcast called healing powers and I said oh that's interesting and I just decided to put it on driving from San Francisco to my office down further in the peninsula and I listen to different episodes and people there were many different people have talked about things that I Would have considered to be paranormal like psychic abilities\nThe ability for consciousness to survive ... things I had no familiarity with\nAn overtime just hearing enough different people describing similar perspectives on reality I got curious and so I started looking at the research and then discovered a whole body of science that put into question everything that I thought was real and this was a very jarring and disorienting realization for me because I thought life was meaningless\nAnd here I was discovering that maybe the brain isn't the producer of consciousness maybe the brain's more like an antenna or a filtering mechanism that processes consciousness and the identity that we have is not tied to the body so that totally freaked me out [laughter]\nAnd uh changed my world view completely led me down the path of intense research because I Need to rethink all of reality spent about a year of basically nonstop research outside of the office outside of my day job in financing consulting\nAnd as I was doing that I told friends overtime at first I was kind of afraid to tell people about it because it sounded so outlandish but once I got a hold of the research I told people about it and the reactions I got were actually very positive and these were people who like me didn't have any familiarity with the topics\nAre men and people told me that their lives are actually shifting in a positive direction after we had these conversations and after they heard about some of the science which will discuss tonight so after hearing enough of this feedback and also seeing that I had intense passion for this topic I decided to put my thoughts on paper and just organize my thoughts and see what happened\nSo it was July Fourth weekend in two thousand Seventeen which was a four day weekend\nAnd I said okay let me see what happens I locked myself in my apartment in San Francisco and decided to write and I kind of channeled my inner investment banker I used to be an investment banker in New York during the financial crisis so I just worked nonstop for four days and ended up\nWriting more than half of the book is now out and then finish over the next few weekends so all of a sudden I'm here at the end of July twenty Seventeen with a manuscript\nAnd ultimately a cold email bill Gladstone who's now my agent at my publisher multiple people recommended that I reach out to him I sent him a cold email and I was fortunate to get a positive response from him and bill represents Eckhart total a\nMuch deeper Neal Donald Walsh um and so that's where we are\nSuper now what do you mean by an end to upside down thinking\n[noise] I consider upside down thinking to be the material is perspective that we start with matter and we end up with consciousness through a brain so the brain creates consciousness [laughter]\nWhat I now see to be the more likely picture reality is one in which consciousness is primary existing beyond space and time so instead of saying we get we start with matter and end up with consciousness\nConsciousness comes first\nAll right with all the brain does consciousness exist at all and the answer is yes correct\nThat's what I think the evidence suggests do with science back us up\nTo my book is the scientific evidence suggesting that that idea is true and there are a number of phenomenon that suggest that there is a consciousness existing independently of a functioning body so one example is chapter nine or I talk about near death experiences\nAnd if you'd asked me a few years ago with a near death experience I Would have said well isn't that just a loose nation that happens when someone is about to die it's like a evolutionary mechanism that allows people to feel better before they're going to die\nI started looking at the research and realize that it's not that simple uh first of all what's described in the near death experiences is typically a very lucid enriched type of consciousness it's not one that you would expect when there is minimal or no brain function at all\nAnd even more than that we find instances in which people accurately report what happened during the time that their brain was either not very functional or it was completely off like in cardiac arrest\nIt's known as they ... out of body experience so the person is out of his or her body when they're\nI didn't know how you know and they're seeing things in the room they come back to their body after near death experience and it accurately report what happened is that it to get some kind of consciousness existing independently in the body\nMarks website mark Goldberg dot com is linked up for you and coast to coast am dot com

in in the upside down thinking\n... ... ... what did your peers say in your colleagues when you wrote this book did it surprise some\n[noise] it's a great question I'm often asked that I Would say yet they were very surprised to hear that but I think I Hope people about the evidence but I was referring to people parked up and we're interested in the fact that I was taking the time to research and write a book on this topic\nNow let's talk a little bit about some of the things you uncovered that you didn't really know about before until up at the pre cognition tell the ... cycle ... says you you of course we learned a little bit about them but you learn more as you did more be research didn't you\nAbsolutely I mean prior to I Would say two plus years ago I hadn't heard of these topics beyond science fiction I had no idea there was actual science and controlled study that hadn't been done on these topics and I have a chapter on each of those topics that you mentioned where I go through what I think is the best evidence that exist today\n[noise] now let's talk about ... what did you uncover here and let's find out your explanation my aunt who was a psychiatrist at the time devoted her entire career to investigating telepathy and uh she ... she came out with some astounding things but what did you find\nIt yeah I thought but he's a very important phenomenon it's it's mind my communication and just taking a quick step back the reason that I then each of these phenomenon is that I read them that the material that perspective that consciousness comes from an localized to the brain\nThat perspective cannot account for things like ... the and the other things will talk about and I read in that if any of these phenomena are real the material is perspective is not work well whereas a consciousness centric picture does work [noise]\nSo ... the to me the most compelling evidence is a a procedure known as the guns held experiment and the basic design is as follows and I should say that these studies have been done over many decades by many different experimenter and when you combine the result\nThe statistics are very compelling mhm\nAnd Dr dean rate and who just wrote a book called real magic he has a section in his book called the stigma\nHicks take my refers to tickle odd against chance when you get a kick stigma result the odds that the effect has just happening by chance is more than a billion to one\nAnd in telepathy we have six sigma results or the gun thought experiment the study has one person in a room will call in Bob and very very relaxing state listening to relaxing music\nThere's another person let's call her Jane who's in another room chain is given a picture by the experimenter ... an experimenter state game I Know that sounds crazy but I Want you to mentally sent\nA picture of this thing that you're looking at to Bob while he's in the other room cicadas mentally sending this image to Bob Bob is then at the end shown for pictures he doesn't know what picture game was looking at\nWe would predict if there were no effect at all that Bob would get correctly one out of four times twenty five percent\nRight now I'm going to be the ... the law probability would tell you that\nEspecially over many decades and different experimenter as we would expect that we would approach twenty five percent with more and more trials\nBut instead it's closer to thirty two percent\nSo from the typical standpoint even though it sounds like a small effect twenty five or six thirty two this is math is distinctly if something is getting through and it actually can forms\nCommon sense our everyday experience because if we were one hundred percent ... then we would know each other's thought all the time you're\nInstead it's actually more subtle where you think of somebody and then they tax you or they call you and that might be what we're seeing here with thirty two versus twenty five percent that it's a subtle effect that everyday people experience\nWhat could increase ... percent mark is at the center or the receiver\n[noise] this is something that that needs to be explored much more ah but what we see with people who tend to be more psychic for example people that had been a have been involved in the U.S government studies which we can talk about later they tend to go into a trance like state and\nPeople who are better ... seem to have enhanced psychic abilities that seems to be an emerging finding\nI've always wondered though if somebody is really tuned into certain things if they can pick up all kinds of different events\nWithout really having the send or having much to do with it I I I think that the receiver might have a better effect in changing the outcome\nI think that's probably true people that tend to have heightened abilities whether it's ... ... communications with the deceased\nThrough medium ship these are people that tend to be picking up information\nAnd if we use the analogy of the brain as being like an antenna which is not per se but it's helpful metaphor where there's a consciousness that not localized to the body and those who are able to better configure their antenna so to speak are better able to pick up signals whether it's from a particular standard or from something else\nNow what would have happened had you gone to the receiver person in the room and simply not show them any of them for pictures but they just had to tell you what they think she sent to them\nWhat do you think would happen\n[laughter] ... well I think we'd have a distribution first of all we had an everyday person versus a talented psychic if we had a talented psychic\nThan we'd probably get some some pretty strong cats and that's what we saw at the U.S government uh but if it's an everyday person I think it would be a more difficult study to examine because the effect is so small\nLet's talk about the U.S government studies and the the things that they've conducted we know that they've been very interested in this for very long time\nYes and again this is something that was very new to me I'm the program is sometimes referred to as\nThe Stargate program and used ... for national security purposes many of them wearing a been on this show by the way\nUp during the Cold War and and the people who have more involved in it were a laser physicist at Stanford University there were many remote viewers who are involved to say this was a real so there are many people talking about the fact that this was real [noise]\nI'm In my book I I have some documents from the CIA which have been declassified recently\nAnd the phenomenon that that was being studied was typically the telepathy was won by remote viewing is the primary one which is the ability to perceive something at a distance without being physically so it's like you could see something in your mind that's far away without even being there without seeing with your eyes\nIt sounds completely paranormal consciousness is localized to the brain but if consciousness is non local then it's at least conceivable documents\nUm say explicitly and I I'm looking at it right now remote viewing is a real phenomenon this is from a declassified documents that has been released recently [laughter]\nSo I mean for someone like me who's just trying to objectively look at evidence if I thought something like that in my business world that I had a consulting case for example\nThat's really strong evidence whether one wants to believe it or not that to me at least made me question things um even further than that there's eight page on a science and all and there are some very credible people including someone from Cal Tech\nThe next page in the document says science panel's report principle findings either direct quotes implications are revolutionary evidence to impressive to dismiss as mere coincidence\nYou know in many cases many cases we have looked at these tell a path studies\nAnd I've always wondered if the government really never stopped doing it but continued now I'd ask some of the people who've been involved in these studies\nThat just that same question and they said no it stopped because they would have kept us on there would have used us I'm not sure what the government has found other people and they've continued these kinds of mind the studies\nWell certainly there were some successes reported in the program during the Cold War for example former President Jimmy Carter confirmed that remote viewers were used\nTo find a downed Russian bomber in an African jungle that they couldn't find so there was some utility to the program whether it was reliable all the time or not is another question but sometimes it was useful\nSo you'd have to think that if if it were a useful thing to be doing that organizations would be trying it\nPre cognition mark the very valuable tool for people in their life because of the ability to sense things make decisions based on those gut feelings and to react to them now a lot of people don't react\nThey don't do it it's something happens when they go oh I should have done that and I knew what\nWhat is your view of pre cognition\n[laughter] are there are some studies which show a very subtle pre cognition known as pre sentiment toward the body is sensing something very subtly and we

differentiating between the spirit\nOr the saw the person it's it's outside and inside or either or but um I I kinda think of it on a spiritual level what you're saying as well\nI Would think more than ... maybe one in the say what do you think\nThank you for your question on ... um I tend to agree with you George and there's an analogy I Love also from Dr Bernardo Castro which summarizes the way I think about things\nWhich is to imagine reality as being like a stream of water where water represents consciousness and each of us is like a world pool within that stream so we're having a localized individual experience within the broader stream but we are fundamentally still made out of water\nSo what happens when the physical body dies that's like a whirlpool dissipating and the water does that leave the stream it just transitioned into a different state\nAnd so the water to me as consciousness and consciousness is having this variety of experiences whether localized in a world full or otherwise in the stream\nDo you think the consciousness\nIs a normal process of living or it's a supernatural\n[laughter] the way I view consciousness is that it's like max ... she said I regard consciousness as fundamental regard matter as to rebut if\nFrom consciousness meaning that consciousness is the basic underpinning of reality and quantum mechanics and other things points to that but I Do everything that we experience as being a basically a modulation that is happening within consciousness\nHow is this new knowledge for you more changed your life\nIt's changed it massively [laughter] so I alluded to this earlier that the material is perspective that I subscribe to a leads to a very bleak outlook on life once your brain's off it's over\nI mean I understood the implications of that and I think that's what our education system is teaching um now I think that that consciousness that does not die when the body dies because it's the consciousness isn't dependent on the body\nSo I see much more uh ... meaning in life there's another phenomenon that I think is really really important and I I think I Wish this had been talk to me a long time ago but going back to the near death experiences what people often report is known as a life review where they experience their whole\nLife in a flash and again this is when their brain as either offer highly impaired and they're judging themselves for how they acted during their life\nBut this is the kicker that really I think about this every day is that some people\nReport experiencing the life review through the eyes of those they affected so let's say Bob harm to change in his life and Bob is having a life review he might experienced the pain through chains eyes and he comes back to his life forever changed carrying much more about\nUh how we treat people rather than material goods\nSo it will we talked about meeting in life the life review as a potential lens if we take that as the literal phenomenon about you know the purpose here is really to treat one another well\nDo you think in our life that we were given the gift to be able to do these incredible things\nThrough consciousness\nPretty cognition\nTelepathy\nAnd things like that well yeah I I think that these are natural abilities that we tend to have in the ... the study I mentioned earlier where people are thirty two percent rather than twenty five percent there's a subtle ability even ... in people who aren't trained\nI think their abilities that are just simply not harnessed in modern society because these ideas are considered a novelist and totally paranormal and this is one of the reasons I wanted to write the book itself so compelled to do it is that an understanding human potential and these abilities that we have\nCould revolutionize I think the world but also our science in our medicine if we understood how to incorporate them into what we do\nFirst time caller John in Flint, Michigan welcome to the show John go ahead\nYou doing sir great\nI'm an ex military and I will tell you I don't believe in ghost UFOs and everything else but I Will say that again retired military I was a cyber multinational units two thousand six in Iraq\nWell by the way to preserve it for ...\nCase that I was assigned to an empty every intelligence unit\nAnd we basically we're looking for a bomb maker\nUm we were able to use what I understand the remote viewing from a section of the free intelligent shop where there was a coal location for a boss and some building\n... to find that very UAB and the person I Believe who was the remote viewer there was brought in a was ball and I believe he wasn't no by no\nWhich is I Know it sounds odd but uh he spoke broken English I Believe he was Israeli descent from what I can get of blue light dealt with over there mhm\nMy question is that again I don't believe in any of this other stuff but I Do believe in the remote viewing\nBecause of his I guess you would say non English or non American uh I guess it's ... nationality is there any research or anything where there's a culture or a nationality that is more in tune turmoil viewing\n\nNecessarily not not not because\nAnything like that I haven't come across that mark I mean there are ... there were great remote viewers all over the planet or but it doesn't skew anything specifically\nI Would say that what what I've seen so far but I think more research it deserved on this topic in research widely enough to understand if there are certain trend there are certain brain configuration that make people more able to do these things\nAnd in your case mark the definition of remote viewing would be what\nThe ability to proceed something where the mind allowing\nIt's almost as if the mind alone has our eyes outside of the body\nCorrect the going back to the world or an allergy it's like somebody is able to accept another part of the stream even though there are localized in their individual whirlpool it's like they open up their whirlpool and they accept water that outside\nI Want to go back to John are veteran here and ask him a question John you're still with us you know sir uh\nSo you do or you you believe in remote viewing\nBut it's it's it's tied into all these other things it's all part of the whole so what would it take to get you to believe the other things outside of UFOs 'cause you know that's that's subjective to everybody\nOn unfortunately it ... me only because of my personal experience a lot of things that I that was including those sightings and everything else I've been able to do something else\nAnd TV M.

brain the physical body\nBut it's there it's out there in the ether I mean can we categorically all agree on that\nTo me the evidence points in that direction more strongly than any other direction when you put together the phenomenon that we discussed tonight a psychic phenomena like collapse of the cycle can eat as pre cognition\nNear death experience children with at like memories when you put all these together combined with certain phenomena of quantum physics\nTo get that consciousness is playing the fundamental role in the universe beyond space and time\nWe've got George in Corpus Christi Texas now hey George welcome to the bird ...\nGeorge ah may God Bless you and your show and thanks very wonderful and my uh my question is do you ever got hundreds of hours a reincarnation as a result of consciousness living outside the body and each of us\nSo they can consciousness moves on to affect another human being good or evil out the street will play a part in fact consciousness and I'll take my reply\nOn rent free will have anything to do with a mark\nVery tricky question I think the question of free will get ultimately\nDown to who is the agent that we're speaking of that has the free well\nUm are we talking about the body having free well are we talking about the consciousness itself\nAnd if we think of consciousness as being like the stream of water\nThan all there is is consciousness so at the level of the fundamental consciousness it would appear that there is a infinite pretty well but at the level of perhaps ... an individual that is considering it felt to be separated from that consciousness\nOr at least appearing that way then perhaps the free well does not exist at the same level that I make that\nYeah it does it on a very difficult subject\nIt's very difficult and I think there are some of the concept that we are talking about night I think are beyond what what are linear human mind can't conceptualize sort of like insanity we all know infinity exist that we can we really understand what it means I think there are certain concepts that our brains just limited us from understanding falling\nYou'd think somebody like Jesus understood the ability of consciousness and da da da da da da da da and the ...\nI think there were probably people throughout history\nUm who really understood the nature of reality and I don't know the details of how Jesus might've interplay with consciousness but from the pieces I I've heard it's ... well that he was one of these individuals\nWho really understood how things work and it seems that when one understands reality perhaps we can do things that seem totally paranormal but again they're not paranormal under this alternative framework\nAnd we have a guest his name's Joe ... a gallon burger and he's a he's a professor and he is conducted experiments in Las Vegas one of his books is called liquid luck he has concluded beyond a shadow of the doubt\nThat the ability of the mind and attitude will determine whether you win or lose and his studies in Las Vegas where he's tested\nAnd ... and ... and he said it's uncanny soon somebody goes in the Las Vegas offbeat positive\nUh there's a high likelihood they're going to win but if they go in we're going to lose this isn't going to happen they're going to lose and and he said the results are on candy\nI think that's all tied together like consciousness is all part of the same don't you\nKnow I'm not familiar with those exact studies but I'm very open to the idea for the reason that you just stay out of consciousness is the basis of reality where everything is just the stream of consciousness then the reality we're in is almost malleable\nAnd sometimes it's very subtle where you have a random number generator that's behaving slightly non randomly in other cases we have reports like he talked about a metal being and using the mind so who's to say that outcomes which is just a part of this physical reality couldn't also be affected by the way our consciousness is acting\nEast of the Rockies Beaumont, Texas we go James waiting for a cello James ...\nAh yes real quickly before oh make my favorite I like the respect of this this agree with a that a few of a bill above the effects of drugs this Bush and the phone to mind or if you know it's an indicator\nThat consciousness is a product of the mine ... um you know as you the person speak him into a tape recorder as an example um you know with that example would be a consciousness\nAnd ah the play back of the tape recorded a you know the papers wrinkles clinical do something [laughter] would end up playing this started a Moore's law you know distortion that would be an example of the drugs mind\nYou know it's not the consciousness but the best effect of the apparatus there's I'm bringing about a distortion\nCope with consciousness put in it so it's not coming out this to clarity that's you know or the wholesome consciousness that went into it [noise]\nUh but anyway uh uh I think the prime example of a spirit living outside of the body is that the self when you have a Gulf hunting so you have a the example of an active consciousness uh this existing outside of the body that\nI'm able to live with paid have knowledge of events that you know maybe it shouldn't ah otherwise until it could nieces and everything else I think that's the prime example of consciousness so outside the body right there\nWhen you think of that mark\n...\nThere are studies using on mediums people who can communicate with the disease is related to what James was just describing and they're actually controlled studies that have been done at the ... Research Center and these studies are use five level of blinding where the media and the person who allegedly can communicate with the deceased\nIs speaking on the phone to the researcher and all that person knows is the first name of the dead person and they're able to bring in non chant information and there have been to peer reviewed journal studies on this thing Jeff thing that the mediums are able to obtain information we need more research on it but that's an example of\nSomeone who appears to be to the east and a living person getting information about someone who is deceased\nWhat do you think of some mediums do you think some of them are very effective\nErasing an important point I think there is a tendency um I think in the mainstream to say that there are frauds out there that are who claimed to be mediums and maybe there are some fraud I think there are some people that have real abilities and the ...

just fluffy bunnies\nHave you concluded marine the the the ... hill but hell does exist\nYou know I personally don't believe I mean I was brought up Catholic um sometimes I Believe if there is a hell

because\nI don't feel I can stop sometimes you know I over the years um I've\nYou know you are like addicted to it\nYou know not addicted to it but to me when I'm\nIn you know investigating a lotta times I'll use energy and expend energy when I'm doing that\nUm and if I don't I feel like sometimes if I'm not doing what I'm supposed to be doing\nMy life kind of it's like wreaking havoc right I'm like a buildup of energy and if I'm working I Do a lot of technical work I Do a lot of work on computers um and occasionally when I go to the span of time and not actually use that energy\nI Would

difference and to not just you know all about me all about money it's all about how you're going to serve and help other\nWhen you're on an investigation do you go to quit mentioned a number of people\nBS yeah there is a team on over the years that team has changed and has grown and we have a you know\nMedium is at work with us um we have people that work specialize on the electronics they work with the M. F. meters on you know we have those that use the quarter is and I think it's just a good team of people that have worked together for so long\nAnd just have a routine down\nHave you ever been on an investigation Maureen were you what are we better get out of this thing and get out no more than once really [laughter]\nYeah there's there's been a couple um live there's been a few and when those moments happen there even though they're rare misstep one nerve and you know I mean one would say well I'm not afraid of anything that's you know he'll say but to me\nYou know you have to just keep aware and uh I don't intend to feel the effects of an investigation let's say over a period of time has no joy if it's taking energy for me it's feeling you know I'm literally like I have a pain in my chest or I'm feeling all\nThe uh [noise] you know after effect let's say um I still have to work a day job so it could interfere and that's one thing I always have to kind of be aware of\nWhat would you see is the most fascinating case you been on a date\nOh jeez fascinating um to me we investigated the Portsmouth White House um one time and there was a the last\nWhite House keepers wife Connie small I Believe what's her name and to me it was fascinating because this was the sweetest woman that had come through I felt for energy and it was nice for a change you know so I wasn't I wasn't in fear for feeling um painter having any ill effects\nAnd it just was a pleasant feeling and what was even nicer it was\nAfter we were done and I was investigating she came through she was so excited she I channel surf felt like she just was so excited to be alive again 'cause she can talk to the people around her but to me what really was fascinating was you know we investigate and a lot of times it's you know ...\nCentury afraid that you're dealing with so you don't necessarily see the person face to face that you can overcome you know communicated with\n'em and so we had done a talk after this investigation um and once we did that time you know here's this woman Connie small her picture of life size in front of me and I just I didn't expect it but I literally just broke down because it was again the first time I got to really see a woman I just felt a connection to her that I\nCouldn't explain [laughter] that's kinda that's got to be emotional sometimes\nWhen you see things like that and I bet when you were in the ... you know you look at a gravestone\nDid you actually think here's a person who lived and died and you know ... means are right here and then there's some kind of grossly operations attached to that that's got to be emotional for people did you ever have you ever just broken down\nOr you know I've broken down on\nWell I Try not to break down but when I'm done reading for people um you know and I've actually you know you talk about the loved ones you talk about I mean these are real people you're talking about you know their pain than is ours and it doesn't help them really to break down but you can't help it sometimes because if you're a compassionate\nAnd you have a hard it's hard not to\nUm [noise] as much as you probably try to try to stay focused ... you know you get involved in these things\nWhen you do definitely down you can put yourself in their place and and realize that you know our own you know mortality right so it's ... you come face to face with dealing with death on many occasions if it can be hot breaking\nWhat would you say is the strangest thing you've come across strangers\n... okay [laughter] okay well when Ron would take me out to investigate many times in my all the time you would never tell me where we were going on because they keep me honest right who I'm not Googling line that information or or\nUm the one day he gave me a call and say hey marine you know I have this case that tend to morning you know can you come with me it's really only take\nAn hour you know ha ha ha ha ha so yeah exactly um yeah I'm sure are on\nYou know he's very creative right so I said\nOkay you know I guess I can go for a couple of hours so we go to the home it to you know little ranch style house and we we get there and then that's meant to guys there one day that was really rough and tumble you know and this one guy you know like run I think his name was ... and the\nBig big guy covered in tattoos and he gets credit you know\nOverwhelming right to sit there and so why is just looking at me and we get in the house and he said I think I have a little girl in here spirit and you look around and then there is a shattered glass table been busted and it just looked like someone to the house with a bat\nUm it was just torn apart and they were terrified and he said you know\nMy phone's been ringing with all heroes on it and my wallet went missing and\nNow he's telling me all the things they kept saying I think it's a little girl and I'm like okay well let's see what we can pick up so after a few minutes and thinking

I actually don't like me and when you give them a body they for\nYou know they they use it sometimes says she's thrown out and run [noise] she's throwing me across the room before dislocated my finger and a couple of things so we're always going to be here it can be nasty but I I think that most of them are really not\nIn not you've written about Ron heavy in your back what does that mean exactly\nYeah you know ... have made that we work together because so many here and so on and in the beginning you know if I started to trance channel you know he tried to call me back meaning away you know whether you're weightless coming up for him army and what's going on you know it's getting too dangerous\nAnd you know it took us a little while to get that rhythm on where I Would talk to Iran and say you know in my mind and know what I might appear to be out of control but in my mind\nI'm actually you know talking to the spirit or trying to you know to\nConnect more or get into more of what they're wanting and what's going on so now I Know I Know that if I Need him to pull me out to help me in a situation that's not safe um he's right there so that having my back and and then if not he'll kind of make sure people don't kind\nOf touched me to go near me to allow me that space to do and I need to them\nLet's go to urban and a state of Maine urban welcome to the program\nAll right thanks for taking my call your thing do you show 'em how long have you called because ah I live in a house\nGets you a hundred and five years old and my dad's ... I'd rather do Monday haunted experiences that houses crazy [laughter]\nThey've actually kind of funny rarely 'cause I yeah I uh really only have an eighty bite hope the guys that activity when I I'm trying to fix the house we thought but Jay do something on the inside a one time we had gone I've been doing some\n... ... the majority in the house and I come home and uh the the cup adore freaky the way for much though that have been ripped off in driven down Mubarak laptops though it was like to pick him up\nOut of there she's probably\nLike to go into my bedroom and it gave me one of my TV things ... and you know the ... the guy and kind of set up in front of the couch you know if they could set it up on my bed\nAnd I think my wife said my kids have actually seen a chip and a lady I I actually haven't seen those but I heard um I've heard like the footstep effort slamming doors\nSo you're pretty convinced that are there\nOh there there was no doubt about it [laughter] or absolutely [laughter] my back I guess my question is\nWhy why when I got to do something to fix the house he was ... when they seem to get angry\nWildly they probably don't want any changes to the house who do you think Maureen\nWhen you are right on George um think about it if you put all your effort into a home and you made it what you thought was the best thing it was wonderful and then you know you're still there and you're looking at it from a different side and now people are starting to change it you know sometimes that can actually stir things up\nNo question about that it's just amazing how many different kinds of entities are out there to do whatever they do summer fun summer having a good time or the evil what decides whether they're good or bad to Ron in terms of that\nI think it's who you are and this this way for the funeral change you're pretty much who you are and the next life so if you have to deal with the court accordingly of there are some times [noise]\nOr like the um [noise] and don't speak vice lead to of as as some people like in ... but they don't deserve that respect it's it's you know if they're a or B any annoying or being\nA offensive to to those who are running this realm now it's it's you know they don't deserve and they you know super respect the\nTuna Giovanni in Los Angeles alone Giovanni\nMay have gone jarred says well thanks I'm and I'm Glad to be back what you got caught again here they are wrong\nRene ... up there and be careful with with uh with all the stuff that you guys are\nYou know you guys are exploring with uh I Know it can be really dangerous I just wanted to share a little story in mind that really quick [noise] uh I ... truck driving right now but uh I I still do security from time to time one of the places I carry with our cat was a um\nA building called the mall that building and here in downtown LA it's pretty old building it's one of those buildings that kind of stood the test of time beautiful architecture and all that stuff\nBut um it's you know definitely haunted I Know I I Am one night especially I was I was working we have these monitors that have cameras set up all around every floor building and there's several floors down before\nUm and the monitors are set up to be motions sensitive but every time somebody comes in or out as the cleaning lady or something like that the monitors will switch on and I\nHave you ever caught one on tape\n[noise] you know what I mean shadows\nI've totally things chatter side thing and it always happens around the corner of your eyes how does this quick dark yeah\nIn an age and hackers in data miners are being more important to protect your personal information you can with my thing that the only thing that you ran\nOn line and when you give me an incomplete control my combined sincere communication with private brown there virtual credit card border security features that you can sell more personalized but how can you get out just down the mail for credit card to use the right to do I need to stay here\nDown them my you know some sort of get more than your free\n[noise]\n[noise] we\nAre back what's wrong the collection Maureen would our final segment here ... more ghost chronicles Ron where do we get your book\nWell it's a sold everywhere Amazon and um all the major bookstores so\nI was certainly not Maureen that our dear friend Jeff ... Roche you're a forward to the ...\nOr ... or you go way back he he was always been my mentor when I first went into goes type thing on the Web site on the Web which was new and there was the ... village so that's a sense that and we've become really good friends\nUse technology continue to make ghost haunting easier\nUh probably easier but not better not better\nQuicker that there's a lot of [noise] um\nThings out there some of them are really junk science but a\nA R I don't know I mean the spirits of around for you know hundreds and hundreds of years and the they didn't have a water technical stuff back then yet people still had experiences though had great experiences and seeing them and everything else I Know of no we need to\nYou know it reminds me of a you know all the physical meaning ship stuff the lead you boards and\nThose were those were designed so that they could eliminate the medium because people wanted to go directly and that's kind of what these electronic the rights is doing there\nThere are trying to get the goes tons of the deal directly what's fair and not have to go to a meeting or not have to you know almost on demand type of thing but it's yeah I mean there are there are some\nUm better pieces equipment up there and there are some that are across but you know there's nothing wrong with the good thermal imaging camera or a good of a camera or a good record of\nMemory and how about you will technology or change things\nAre you know I honestly don't think that technology has reached the point that makes it more sensitive than human being you know and then what we can parents ourselves on that we may be getting close with some areas that they're you know they're finding out but honestly I don't think it could have enough yet\nSo you're not going to be replaced by a robot ghost investigator I anytime\nSoon [laughter] I don't I don't think so\nHer and let's go to a final calls here let's go to Hastings, Florida bill's with us and bill are you in a safe haven there were ... hurricane headed your way\nOut of the other side of the state we're south of St Augustine so I think we're uh we're probably going to be safe on this one\nOkay let's pray that everybody else is going to do\nIt a ghost story for you or when we came down here about eight years ago in Florida\nWe were at the paranormal investigation and the old Spanish military hospital in St Augustine [noise] which is known to be on it and why we were there a ghost this was in the middle of the night and it goes to actually made it table moved slightly up on the second or\nSo after the second floor and we were able to communicate with goes oh I see them and I and some other people that were there and we eat any um any man flashlight on the table and that goes good answer our questions by making like link\nAnd so ... various questions and to get it to indicate that its name was among men it was a was had been a nurse said at the hospital at one time during the Spanish period\nCheese ... and up at the time my Andy am I in a briefcase with me and I was carrying around a large amount of money and then subsequently um for about the next year so I'm trying to time I would hear clicking noises that goes for teasing me that he was opening if we can [noise]\n[noise] I Love it\nNow while I'm On what would happen is um if I drop like little\nI don't care of a chair or something um last last about not last July but the one before that in the middle of the night having a little tiny bottle campers something off the chair and it's fun and like I was hunting being poor\nWhy are they mischief makers wrong what what are they trying to accomplish by playing around like that\nSometimes the the just the tension seekers they they just want to be seen or heard the words that you know where I Am here pay attention to it if you have a a cat for instance the cats are pretty much like that to a you know they'll they'll come in and do silly things to\nDo with what you know they're there and hey pay attention to me so I I think that's that's primary it [noise]\nBut uh I have to tell a funny story about the a book I went to my next door neighbor and ... and the\nNext day I came back I met her and she came back with the book and she said hey take it back she says we were reading the or the first chapter and I was having a glass of wine and my glass shattered oh so she says I don't want anything\nTo do with it [laughter] it's like clash shattering books is dinners and the interesting\nThing to do anything really what they want to do I believe\nText and tweets Tom what do you have a the swimming from Sarah in Rochester I'm curious to Iran or and Maureen\nBoth from coming to a person's life evil into someone's life let's give that to you more you know\n[laughter] okay so I think given me the wrong one\n[laughter] we'll get on they really will get to yeah\nHonestly I Believe are with the St Michael so I Know for me that's on the things one is intention is to you know if you're looking for that and you're believing that evils coming in life and you know it's very possible that your credit invited in\nOn the other thing is I ... I had a granddaughter who is you know too young to do that sort of thing but she's picking up spiritually she thinks there it's already um so what we're doing is we had to St Michael's prayer kind that I put underneath you know her mattress and in her pillow and I have a different varying crystals around the room\nTo how many hands on\nAnd she's doing a lot better so I Know you know and again it's an belief right so I Believe it works on its intention networks I think if you believe in yourself as well and you can tend to to walk out bought got out last time I\nWould say you were on what about it\nI I agree with it away and and you judge because you talk about the the hurricane on in your intention sure make good yeah so contentious as a hundred percent but being a good old Catholic boy I rely on my religion of course and so that's that's what I always recommend [noise]\nYou know and I've seen this happen before I've seen hurricanes go from a category four down to two down to one and you know who's to say prayer is the cause but hey you know what it works\nYeah crank Korea hundred percent with the judge\nTaken any way we can let's go to bill in Idaho west of the Rockies Hi Bill go ahead\nNo one wanted to say first that are on I think we should all get centered and our heart and intend to dissolve\nThis her yeah I agree [noise] like my\nQuestion is probably more ring\nA heck of a man serving their land for the last six years here and feel it's time\nFor me to go back to serving man attempted to move in April when I have a series of events that showed me there was a time yet so my question is would it be time for me now to leave all did\nYou do a quick little reading here Maureen sure any one moment\nOkay while you're pulling out to lunch and when you were on on this what what are your next project Ron How often do you get called to investigate\nWe're taught a few uh you know I Would say if you like it used to be daily but it's it's probably weekly now and uh we only choose the ones who really want to do basically uh uh\nYou get flooded with requests ...\nWait to get a lot of 'em be honest with you judge so a year and you've got a screen them somehow so which is a difficult ...\nOkay well let's go back to bill in Idaho when a marine go ahead\n[laughter] alright ... bell actually called the ... ... and one was aspiration paying you know ... to go after what you want right it's almost like a spiritual kind that you know you need to be empowered you there um and it's getting a good idea right you'll know when that moment is right\nTo actually make a change and it seems like it's been working on hanging off and kind of a nice I'm working really hard and it's time to kind of read those benefits and actually to move for when I'm obviously I Can't tell you what to do but", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "year": "2018", "city": "Yankton", "day": "10"}
