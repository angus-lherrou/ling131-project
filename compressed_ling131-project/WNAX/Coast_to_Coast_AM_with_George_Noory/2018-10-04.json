traveling I I was traveling into the deep red state of Arkansas uh-huh to do the our client is\nConvention and also on the way I met a lot of really beautiful people from Arkansas\nAnd it always it always strikes me as somebody who is a free wing either blue or red and my in my tribal political identity that seems to be polarizing the country as your reports said\nWorse than ever before um but when I actually go out on my blue range into the red range of Americans I meet really decent beautiful people [noise]\nWho and I listen to them and I can see so much potential if people would just

predictions twenty eight team but you just mentioned and uh I was just reading it again after many months [noise]\nAnd I can't really say that I Would change anything that I put in is a that was basically is happening is\nA a level of if you're gonna defined it in planets there's two major planted some strategy and political strategy their plate right now one is a is Iran and some just recently come in to tourists\nAnd then there's also newly into its home sign of Capricorn Saturn long story short it's a struggle you're honest finds itself in the ... sign which means it's dealing more with focusing on personal needs and desires and expectations [noise] whereas\nThe earth the sign of Capricorn Saturn is is the arbiter of the establishment of the bigger powers bigger than the individual and so you have a long story short it's it it's\nFavors the establishment more than it favors those who are resisting the establishment [noise]\nUm because you run into horses in its fall and it's in layman's terms that means um this this ruler of Aquarius is in the least comfortable sign\nThat it's transfer that you're going through now last time it did that was back in the early thirties and when it did that coming into tourists it ... to ... major changes in political astrology it brought the German the third Reich into being under adult Hitler [noise]\nAnd it also uh aged Franklin Delano Roosevelt new deal to\nBe stabilized established a banking ideas and things that were restructured that in in a positive sense created a this this longest a profitable wealth a period of the ... in history [noise] uh that happened because of the reforms of the banks\nThose reforms have slowly been shipped part by Reagan and Clinton and his two terms and Bush and now we were almost back to where we were almost the same kind of demographics of the of the separation between the few wealthy and the\nMajority who have not so much wealth\nIs almost exactly where it was in uh Nineteen twenty eight just before the crash\nAnd so we are repeating a cycle and uh so the the issue is their Iran as if ever I saw something that expresses itself in in the Iran is in the fall the revolutionary the innovator the person was original thinking [noise]\nIt's affecting a what's called the resistance to the current situation in the White House some and it is a it is expressing itself with great passions\nAnd unpredictability button and its negative it's about destroying from getting the house by\nGetting the Senate back but for what it cannot really defined itself is what we know what the resistance is against when I hear it all every day here because I live in the very heart of it here\nBut but we I always keep asking them I understand your problem there but what are you for\nAnd if and if you follow this pattern\nWith much more energy to it then it happened before because I remember this happened in Nineteen Ninety six when I was telling people who couldn't believe me after Nineteen Ninety four and the Republicans won the house and sent back I said don't go to the Clinton is going to be reelected in Ninety six I was on a show in Portland [noise]\nFive hundred thousand Oregonians watched it and the man who had a meltdown said you're absolutely crazy that can't happen\nThen of course four years later I said well no it will happen because if you're ... anybody but Bill Clinton you're you're you're you're fundamentally a you don't have anything to replace him except you're on tearing down and then what [noise]\nAnd it won't work um it didn't I see it ten times worse now than it was before at least\nAt least and and it's being I mean it's being the people of this country are being so terribly played by the corporate owned media avenues [noise]\nThat that is really quite and it's classic um Iran is confusion and its fall and tourists you know where you should be grounded you're just you're your emotions your attitudes are just a lot of mud or sign some muddy place a swamp the muddy place [noise]\nAnd unfortunately it plays similarly to the chaos that was happening in Germany it plays to some kind of savior that's going to come and save you from your cells\nYou know I've been home not long long time first with art and then with the huge orange I've been\nTalking for twenty five years now about how the danger of fascism

November it's most interesting [noise]\nWe have a unique thing happening where Iran is this going retrograde back going backwards in in the sky which means that it's a turn to recollect where you ban and go in and kind of resolve what is the mechanics of what you're doing on the outside world\nEspecially if it isn't working and you're honest is leaving Taurus around just shy of eleven o'clock Pacific Standard time on election day and starts backtracking into areas that what that means is if if ... voters threat American voters ... early\n... and a lot of the areas which will be in early

want but\nSuperb workers by the way John ... with us as we talk about prophecy predictions John we've got to get into your two thousand Eighteen productions how many have come true already\n[noise] well uh there have been a number of the more the most shocking and been my my eighth prophecy what I did is is basically short um chapters that takes a theme and looks at it fully and\nWant to give us some headlines of of of the ten real quick\nWell you see the were the the definition of the year being the year of acceleration\nThat definitely things have intensified that way the second prophecy was a year on us and the last chance effect style that looked at a play between Iran is in Jupiter that made it possible for actually the government to come together and have more common ground but that petered out\nBy may ... and that seemed in a way where there was also\nThe third prophecy will Trump be impeached or not in twenty eight team and it looks like that's definitely happening [noise]\nUh I've always said that both candidates in twenty sixteen were afflicted astrological we both had the danger if not if they did not survive their first two years in the first term they may not survive the term in office that means belief office\nNothing nothing of physical or violent nature I see in this but that they could leave and scandal or something like that so you know we're we're entering a point now where the president will be two years in office at the end of January\nSo it will really be very interesting to see what happens in this mid term like I was saying before that the first half of the day goes to the red states and the red voters figured out early vote early\nAnd eat is really going to probably be decided in a week or two while people are doing their absentee ballots [noise]\nBut there is a possibility for a surprise to happen in the west the delegates that the legislators that will be a battling for dominance in the house representatives\nWill uh see a surge towards the blue in the afternoon so it'll be interesting to see those battles states in the west that uh might see at ... eleventh hour or\nClose to the polls a turnaround so with that um you know before I go to the fourth ... CEO simply say about President Trump but if he survive this um these two years\nAnd she'll be two term president Scott what's what's so hard for the polarized people like my family of readers it's like I have this family they're all arguing at the table with each other and I'm just quietly watching this and try and make you know\nTaking notes and it's like ... I mean literally is a large family members and other things are are getting involved and passionate about it and I'm going well [noise] um every everybody watches their own tribal news and this is classic Iran is in the fall and tourists\nUh they're they're they're just watching the news and there's assuming that the other side is hearing all this and this is going to change their mind the truth is both\nSides of tuned out each other the red the red side watches Fox the little blue side watches MSNBC and CNN\nAnd the Twain shall never meet so this the other thing too that I look very carefully and it is that so many of the Democrats who once felt white working class Democrats that really went and voted for Trump because they've been neglected for few presidential cycles [noise]\nI Do not see a change in their opinion they're going to hold with Trump until six fear if he's a two term president\nTo my interpretation of the strategy they're going to give them a chance when I talk to them and the red states I see it's very clear that they're not going to budge also the other thing that uh once again Democrats are overlooking is the power of the evangelical vote like I said\nA strong very strong\nI said ten months before Trump was elected I said it's a big upset could happen through their\nUm and so it's it's my sense is that there will I don't really honestly see a lot of budging a lot of moving\nIt's almost like it's it's a musical chairs that we've had before where it's the same numbers even if the Senate goes to the Democrats at the same number of seats\nJust switching back and forth and in that there's not enough to create any significant legislative advance so it's it's just more and I my sense is the next two years are going to be even more\nThis functional than anything we've seen before\nIn is almost unbearable now\n[noise] well it's I I hate to say to everybody across the United states coast to coast but we're entering a period we're not we're not the end of this this this crisis that's going this evolutionary challenge that's happening to the United states\nAnd the world is just going to get more intense and we're not at the point yet where people are ready to break out of their tribal identities and actually think of a way to get out of this merge and say it's kind of have to get much worse and frankly astrology are saying that\nYou're not going to see a a tide shift until the middle of the next decade and we're\nWe're we're just entering the worst part but we're not even to the other side of this this prevail [noise]\nBut yet we're not even close it's going to get much worse and what's going to happen which kind of brings me to the issue of ... and all of the small fighting about that [noise]\nIs it I said very clearly in my back in August eleventh in my article send the Kavanaugh would be picked that um [noise]\nI I think people are stabbed pushed in that and I think the thing that most people on the left are afraid of it it's really not saying they should be looking at according to their needs [noise]\nIf you if your candidate on the stars and what he's done and his record I don't think there'll be way it has any danger any of the social issues are going to be upset by this Supreme\nCourt no I I don't think so why a lot but I tell you\nThese this time with the Iran is and Saturn the defining planets so next year and into twenty twenty\nThese these planets the way they're positioning the way they're going to move in and out of harmonious affects and that means harmonious two major corporate establishment wheels of power [noise]\nThat you're going to see with a man like Kavanaugh he will he will vote a hundred percent in favor of the corporations\nAnd you're going to see who is creeping coup d'etat of corporate uh hedging money which started with Citizens United in January of twenty ten [noise] this will be resolved crystallized by some time in twenty twenty when Saturn is about to leave\nA Capricorn it's her sign and go into the sign that the last time it was in an Aquarius those were the great masses and sometimes violent citizen mass revolutions like the French Revolution that's the last time it happened and so it's\nPossible that after twenty twenty with the American people or or the working people people started really starting to get riled up about situation a there will be basically in a completely corporate elite control the United states [noise] and so\nThat's that's my call I Hope I'm wrong I Wish I was more than I recently\nWere on the

with John about and he's writing a book about the late celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain and boy you sparked my interest John because it sounds like you had a very a similar situation what happened\nI did it's really a a tale of two suicides a and both of us committed the suicide the reason I Am speaking to you is because [noise] my experience with\nSuicide was a spiritual suicide rather than the usual what I call mundane suicide most people\nAnd counter [noise] um basically in the mundane suicide I contend that you end up with your pain destroying the body mind that you that you're mystery of Seoul is living in\nBut in the suicide that happened to me rather than the one that I was in the mundane ... going to do [noise]\nI saw my misery and my pain commit suicide and remained and\nSo this is one of my most intimate autobiographical tales of the whole other dimensions of my life\nOf all these years I've never known this\nWay I was I was I was walking through a golf course in San Pedro California I just come back from India and I was still in the tender opening kind of broke out of my shell of\nMany lives being with my my teacher in India for the first time and when I came back in the world the world it was not\nPlace that supported this kind of individual flowering and it was having a very bad day and so I was walking down this beautiful beautiful a golf course adjacent to the trailer park I Lived in a overlooking Santa Catalina island in San Pedro cliffs and as I was walking it just\nDawned on me says I could just keep walking or beyond these cliffs and plummet down three hundred seats into the rocks\nAnd I was going to do it because suddenly\nIce had this amazing unexpected experience of life and death suddenly being very tangible unclear I got to see how they're really one they're really\nThey're play of complement trees or in our fear they're a play of terror and opposites but\nWhat was happening to me the feeling was trying to describe it but it's beyond where it's really beyond belief\nIndeed it was like um it was descending on me faster than myself and I thought okay this is happening because I have made the decision to throw myself walk over this cliff [laughter]\nIf I turn away from this I'm going to lose this amazing experiences over taking me this mystery of life meeting death [noise]\nSo I saw this little eucalyptus tree and I sat up against and I said okay for throwing myself over I just wanted to feel this and take this with me over the edge [noise]\nAnd so I sat there just going inside and feeling at some point I felt this electrical energy just rise above the ground through the roots of the tree and throw me forward face down into the crab grass or I just began sobbing sobbing and suddenly\nAll of that thank God all of that so that otherwise I wouldn't be killing ... no not at all and uh\nAnd and there was this moment after I cried it all out I turn and there was a little eucalyptus trees and it was just shivering its sleeve and the Santa Ana wind and it was just this moment where ... sky the earth tree\nExistence love me existence sees everything that's created out of it as a phenomenal creation rising and falling something absolutely integral significant [noise]\nAnd I had this feeling that so much of what society does to make us feel insignificant [noise] when you go in and even at that moment of life meeting death insignificant becomes in significant\nI it's so the story is really an a it's a it's a jump from what I usually right about what's a whole other level of talking about these things that I haven't done since I did the ... book back in Nineteen Ninety nine\nSometimes my these books you see I I don't write these books they right they use me to write themselves and\nI had no idea until Anthony Bourdain died [noise]\nHow deeply he his his suicide how much he was loved and how many many people were shocked in the story I talk about the moment that inspired me to write this book signing the cashiers line\nAnd there's this old lady and she's doing something that looks like she's never done before she's pulled actually magazine out of the rack and looks at it and it's a people magazine of an seaboard Dane and I watched how she touched his cheek on the picture the way she did it was\nSo intimate and beautiful and that's when I realized yeah I Love him just as much and I think I think I understand what he was going through he was not a man to bullies or in\nFairy tales and imaginary stuff and that Santa Claus is going to save him from his Sims\nAnd all about it's really pretty ... and\nAnd and and people like that when they die and I always feel there is a person that has the potential to become a an away can fly and I as I have been in my private life which I'm sharing more and more now in this period especially now when there's so much turmoil when there's so much [noise] I'm\nA mixed and polarity my inner life now as a meditate or is now coming more and more into my work because it is is still ... point this center of silence and peace in the cycle of life that's becoming stronger and stronger that\nIs what I can share with all of you to meditation the science of self observation\nIs is what what more and more I always thought my my work with evil more and more and it's still prophetic but it's going to have more of my own authority through my own experiences\nHuge on let's take some calls here in the ten minutes we got left Thomas in Europe with John Home Tom\nHi George thank you for taking my call and job while it's hard to follow your sharing your experience on that but my question John yes prop person to walk in the world to be a participant in the world\nHow can they develop their own centered mess so to speak such that they are not enough for dead on a fact dead on touch my personal and planetary astrology well\nI can only suggests and I think only anyone who's honest and heart to heart with anybody is all I can suggest is my own experiences some meditation techniques that I've been using since Nineteen eighty [noise]\nAnd uh so my answer to that is if any of you listening to this resonate with what I've been saying [noise]\nEspecially with the issue of suicide in life meeting death [noise]\nUm I Am on a path where I can say there is a way to look the on and not be touched you can be passionate and deeply into life but you're not overwhelmed ... you can be a Buddha and the marketplace but not of the marketplace of the world\nAnd that was my teacher taught post show and that is what I've live since Nineteen eighty since I went to India to see him for the first time and so with that said if you go to hold prophecy dot com and if you click on the contact um menu button", "show_name": "Coast
