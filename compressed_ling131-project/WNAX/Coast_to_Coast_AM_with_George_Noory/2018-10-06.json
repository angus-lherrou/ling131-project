right so and at least I had grandma to go to and talk to and get her dog straightened around in my head [noise]\nMost of these kids don't camp that something to fall back on now all they had you know well it must be a cult thought because I saw it on a movie or [noise] um I saw him walk through the wall or their blood dripping down the wall\nYou know George if I felt something like that I probably never gone another person's house\nWell you went to a lot of funeral homes sometimes as an invited guest because you could see the ... the person who died\nRight and that's what I mean in all honesty I could probably go to three funerals a day seven days a week that's how many people want to talk to their loved one for the last\nTime he was the deceased always near their cash skipped during a funeral or are they\nNormally yeah standing at the foot of the cast it because that's usually where the ... family is standing and people come up to greet them and then they walk over to the casket and pay their last respects\nAnd so anything that that they can hear because they're very very known them as to what people are saying about them or how they look or you know they they like to know that stuff and but in the last seven or eight years\nThis business where there's table set off to the side with all these photos in and their life in pictures and if there's a group of people standing around by those pictures\nAnd what they're saying and it's funny because I've already been there where a man said the that lady with that had on over there I said yep he said well she's saying that that picture happened when we were in Missouri she's at her mind we weren't in Missouri when that happened we were in Pennsylvania\nAnd it's like\nOkay you know I'm not going to go argue with your lady friend over there so so they're very interested in what goes on it is very interesting usually well it has to be an immediate family member that invites me you just can't believe how many nosy\nNeighbors their heart and mind at any rate I go to this ... this particular funeral the man was standing at the foot of his casket\nAnd he looked at me he said you can see me I said I can and I told them why was and he said I bet my daughter bounds you she would find somebody crazy like you\nAnd I'm thinking\nOkay [laughter] and so I said well I said yes your daughter did call me and he says I met my son doesn't know anything about this and I said to the to the daughter I said does your brother in law you called me she says oh yeah he's really into this and I just\nStarted to look to your father and\nGave him aside law and so he said will call my son over half recall my son over so he says to me tell my son to go home right now that my brother bill is in my basement trying to break open my gun cabinet\nOh boy and I looked\nAt him and I said now you're telling a crazy person that I mean you know he called me crazy\nWas it was the brother going to try to do so thin or what was his wanted the collection of gun low he wanted people from Salem right\nSo I said to the sun I said your uncle bill is in your dad's house right now in the basement trying to break open the gun cabinet and the sun looks at me he goes no he's not I just saw the half hour ago and I said point them out to me\nHe's lucky he says you know I don't really see him\nI Am the father said my house is two streets over I says apparently your father's house is only two streets over and he would do this to her and she\nSaid I didn't tell her and I said please go home and then go down the basement and see what your uncle's doing I'm sure enough this world who bill was breaking open the gum\nKim and I'm right on ...\nSo it it's interesting when things like that happened or were they told me were money's hidden or a I Can't tell you how many gifts I found for wives that the husbands\nDied right before their birthday or an anniversary and you know it's like look in this covered in his shoe box you going to find a really pretty necklace that he's out for you you\nGive them closure\nI Do I Do and if you think about it you know\nIt would have been really nice to talk to a couple of your loved going forward you couldn't do it anymore and I think people like that and it's not always wears the key to the safety deposit box a lot of times it is but not all the time\nWhen a when you're dealing with the deceased how many of them are generally know their debt\nEvery one of them\nHow do you not come out of your body and look down in ... leads the body and look down and go holy smokes I Am dead\nSo they're not in denial they are not and I know there's some psychic send me the and say that they don't know they're dead but I mean\nNot all of them you don't know how do you not know he was on I Would agree with you yeah non though you can do\nThis now I'm not saying they're happy about it but that's I don't really know that they're dead\nYou know not everybody who die moves on thinking this was all fun and games ha ha I'm dead and I'm going to happen to be depressing even for some of the ... I Would do\nWell it's adds a lot of them are sad because they think\nThat they won't be able to see what's going on with their family or watch their grandchildren grow up and it's like no no no no no one to go into the light you can come back and forth you're not gonna miss anything plus the fact there's proof of that\nBecause if you take pictures and you get or um send pictures\nPerfectly round circles they can be little they can be big they can be any color they can be sparkly though there's fears that have crossed over in our back for a visit\nIf there is a design in the middle of the orb\nEnlarge it you can usually CSI profile or a face of who it is\nIt's the or is blank in the middle is the dust particle don't worry about it\nYou have looked a lot of negative energy pursue what have you concluded a bump no [noise]\nWell I really believe it's pretty easy\nAnd you hate to put this out there but I it's actually pretty easy to put negative energy on somebody it's not as big of a ritual as people think it is\nI mean if you think about it you don't care for your neighbor and every day ... what are you fighting about you're fighting about the property line\nSo every day when you see him come out of his house and go news garage to leave or cut his grass you're sitting there in your kitchen watching him going oh you cure I Hope you break your knee or I don't like you why don't you move\nYou know look at it this way if I said to you George tomorrow morning at ten o'clock I'm going to have some minor surgery say a prayer for\nMe I Will say a prayer for\nExactly and that means sending positive energy to make good energy to me but it's this lady is sitting in her kitchen every time she looks at her neighbor and thinking negative stuff why couldn't deaths yet\nNo chance that person one realize this is happening to them and to fight it off\nThey can eventually but remember karma you know be careful who you credit for a while under the bus it and you never know\nWhat goes around comes true right but I mean the the recipient of the curve for example oh okay do they know that it's happening to them\nI think if it's done with enough intent or if you actually go to someone for his cheapest five bucks and tell them to put negative energy and somebody they pretty much know it easily\nThree things that negative energy will effect and it can affect one two or all three of them and and no particular order is health money or relationships\nAnd you know of all of a sudden you're twenty two years old and you never had any problems dating and you always had a good time and all of a sudden now you're going out with a new person and after the second date is Joel right\nThe toilet so something's going on but if you you know if you go to somebody like me or you look at my one\nDo we move negative energy once that's taken off and anybody can remove negative energy or somebody you can't do it yourself\nBut you could definitely have a friend do it\nAnd once that is released and gone you're fine the same thing with hell if a person has a curse from them and they've got a bad health problem and you go to the doctor you go for an MRI you go for the peace and you have blood work done but Dr ... know\nEverything is normal there's nothing wrong with ... we can't find anything\nBut gosh if you have a curse newer negative energy and you\nKnow what is wrong with

individual\nAnd what happens to them but do they feel something did they see I think someone put a curse on me\nWell when things start going bad and you don't feel good or your relationships go down there too but you lose your job and you can find a job um then they start thinking that when you hear on the born loser I must have a cloud over my head\nA ... if I didn't have bad luck I wouldn't have any luck and people don't realize it especially if everything was going fine in their life or normal in their life\nAnd everything gets going down the tubes and eventually they figure it out or they go to somebody or somebody that they know go team but Heather fish rotten luck for the last year\nWhat the heck's wrong when you [noise] and then you start thinking about it and like I said it you know what nobody has to live like that you don't have to be a martyr do something about it had it removed [noise] it's not hard to do you can do it\nAnd it is long and you know he actually if a person doesn't even believe they have a curse\nBut um and I tell them that they do sit down in front of me I'll take this off of you they don't even have to believe that all they had to do is give me their permission\nMy grand daughter got a promotion where she was working and apparently she got a promotion over somebody who saw they were entitled to that job and she did it fair and square and you know decent and everything is great girl\nAnd strange things started happening to her I mean things that would always go well things were really kinda screwed up and sure she called me up one day it's a ...\nI think somebody put a curse on me and and I should ... let's let's think about this for a moment ... who would want to do this to you I mean you're in good fun person you're nice person you don't hurt anybody\nAnd we started talking and she mentioned the promotion and she mentioned some people but they gave her the job over\nAnd I went oh huh and I said oh look couple of these people is there one there that you would think would be capable of that and she said yes and sure enough it ended up being a person who apologized and took the curse off apparently and everything's fine\nOr stop sending negative energy to her even though ... because\nI Am so my question is when someone does get hit by a Kurdish how easy is it for that person to try to distinguish who put the curse on them\n[noise] that's a little bit harder and the main questions that I ask when I'm actually doing the removal is\nUm [noise] did you take somebody away from their spouse in other words that you have an affair with a married person believe you me a woman you know ... you get a man gets angry at somebody and they're going to find somebody in the nose a woman gets angry at somebody\n... women meaner than men she's gonna curse that person\nAnd because she was hurt and more ways than one and the job thing is exactly right you can't believe how often that happens\nAnd but the bottom line is this who cares who did it get and get it off\nHow do you get it off can you do it yourself do you have to call ... ... how do you get it off\nAnd don't you can't remove it yourself but you can have a friend do it for you and they can't they don't have to believe that they just have to go through the ritual and and when do speak the whole last chapters how to remove negative energy anybody can do it you just can't do it to yourself\nUse every buddy susceptible to a curse word about someone who's got so much energy and positivity can they put up the force field to kind of block it and she you\nKnow unfortunately the only thing that I personally know that his work forever because once the cruises removed that doesn't necessarily stop the person that was putting it on they're not going to know it's off\nThe end there's so many different kinds of curses I mean there's one that that may be has to be and do something at every full moon or generational curses they just automatically go with generation to generation like the Kennedys you have to know they were first\nAnd so there's all kinds of different kinds but once it's removed most people as long as they you know I give them that Quincy to carry as long as they have that they never have to have a curse removed off of them again it does not affect them\nAs a matter of fact think about in ballplayers let's use um baseball players for instance\nOkay there's a game between the Cleveland Indians and maybe New York and so all the fans and the Cleveland Stadium every time there best hitter gets up the whole stadium is going to lose you jerk don't hit the ball getting out and then they clap as he does\nGet an energy thrown on that person's\nOh yeah absolutely and that's why the home team is an advantage\nChats exactly right but that doesn't mean when they get on their plane to leave Cleveland that he left the negative energy here it's going with him it's going to be added on every others stadium that is not his home state yeah\nSo and that's why I Do so many ballplayers all kinds of all players will\nHer ballplayers in a slump let's say and the really\nGood a slum or they just you know they don't feel good they're out of sorts they're tired all the time and the other thing too and says specially ballplayers\nLook the dead fans that goes that hanging out stadiums you know you couldn't walk up and stand next to LeBron James at a basketball game you would never get on court the guards\nAnd everybody would keep you away sure but gee if your ghost who's going to stop you know exactly\nWhat about the dream state visiting the dead and for other things\nOne person has crossed into ... they can absolutely come in and out of your dreams you can talk to them you can get all kinds of information from them you can get a dog\nA kid I mean it is so comforting to be able to talk to these people they look good they look at the uh happy they look healthy\nAnd but if the person has not crossed over you

right now that I I think it should be doing this kind of\nMass anxiety and maybe that's part of what what um you know I'll be talking about tonight with with the tower oh because uh [noise]\nUh tools like a tarot cards or believe it or not [laughter]\nUm are very very helpful for remembering who we are and [noise] um letting go of all of the\nPolice in programming and construction soon opinions and a cultural biases and all of that it's it's a way of suspending all of that stuff [noise]\nAnd taking a deep breath\nAnd receiving um through images two pictures that\nCome to us from a really a

we've been able to track the terrible\nUh Thirteen Ninety I Believe is the earliest evidence\nOr fourteen twenty is the first full deck that we know about in the Italian Renaissance\nBut no one knows who the first desire was actually [noise] and I I really like that and I think it's part of what tarot is ultimately it's it comes from the human imagination\nMaybe it was given to us from above song\nUh from above or from beyond or or below below\nOr within and you know I'm a union psychologist so a ... than it is the place that I look\nLet's explain to her all the people who probably knew what it looks like but they might not know exactly what it is\n[noise] um\nIt's a tool for self exploration it comes out of the Italian Renaissance um it's not it was not bought a\nTo Europe by the gypsies is awesome ... misinformed [noise]\nUh actually the gypsies chain quite a bit after the first tarot decks uh started to emerge in Italy and Spain um other places in Europe [noise]\nUm [noise] it is a deck of cards um and uh in in some ways it's it's not clear which came first the playing cards at the ... actually\nIf you think of a standard set of playing cards that is equivalent roughly to what's called\nThe minor conduct of the Cairo\nTyrone has an additional twenty two cards that is\nMajor are coming up and these are the cards um that people commonly uh think of when they think of tarot cards you know they have they have the magician\nCard and fool and the wheel of fortune and things like that\nAnd that's your favorite card George yeah it is because I'm fascinated by\nIt I Know I Know you are and it is it is an extremely a beautiful cards the jets card them as is the devil card\nAnd the tower ... usually three cards which people think are the most ah uncomfortable cords of the major continent but every card in the ... as a positive and negative aspect\nAnd the modern tarot which is really my forte um has really moved since uh you know ... it can vary a cult oriented in the\nUh nineteenth and a early twentieth century in England with the society of the Golden Dawn and that's where the modern tarot really was birds with the weight jak the Arthur weight\nBack the writer weight tarot and what what uh what happened then was very exciting in the world of Jericho and that [noise]\nFor the first time the minor are con which are like playing cards a deck of playing cards each one of the pips or the miners were finally illustrated with rich\nDynamic pictures that tell a story [noise] before that time only the majors only the pardon the expression Trump Card\nWhen we're going to talk about that on the right\nBut I'm only those had pictures that you could actually just look at directly and\nGet an impression of who you are and kind of just kind of get a sense of what was going on there the miners before or the twentieth century um she's had geometric design so if they're forced suits\nYou know like like hearts clubs diamonds and what's the other one a page\nRight those are equivalent to the ... the ... of\nA cups or tentacles ... won ... and all of those minor cards she's had geometric shapes on himself it was a seven of cops\nThere would be a just

We're not really interested in Kavanaugh's or you know drinking habits as an undergraduate or high schooler\nLike you learn when you were a kid\nExactly that's exactly right so and at least I had grandma to go to and talk to and get a dog you know straight and ran in my head [noise]\nMost of these kids don't camp that something to fall back on now all they had you know well it must be a cold about it because I saw it on a movie or um I saw him walk through the wall or their blood dripping down the wall\nEven George if I felt something like that I probably never gone another person's house\nWell you went to a lot of funeral homes sometimes as an invited guest because you could see the ... the person who died\nRight and that's what I mean in all honesty I could probably go to three funerals a day seven days a week that's how many people want to talk to their loved one for the last\nTime he was ... always near their cash skipped during a funeral or are they\nNormally yeah standing at the foot of the cast it because that's usually where the ... family is standing and people come up to greet them and then they walk over to the casket and pay their last respects\nAnd so anything that that they can hear because they're very very known them as to what people are saying about them or how they look or you know they they like to know that stuff and but in the last seven or eight years\nThis business where there's cable set off to the side with all these photos in and their life in pictures and if there's a group of people standing around by those pictures than the barrel\nGo over there and listen to what they're saying and it's funny because I've already been there where a man said see that lady with that had on over there I said yep he said well she's saying that that picture happened when we were in Missouri she's at her mind we weren't in Missouri when that happened we were in Pennsylvania and it's\nLike okay you know I'm not going to go argue with your lady friend over there so\nSo they're very interested in what goes on it is very interesting usually well it has to be an immediate family member that invites me you just can't believe how many nosy neighbors there you know how much at any rate I go to this ... this particular funeral the man was standing at the foot of his casket\nAnd he looked at me he said you can see me I said I can and I told them who I was and he said I bet my daughter found shoe she would find somebody crazy like you\nAnd I'm thinking okay [laughter] and so I said well I said yes your daughter did call me and he says I ... my son doesn't know anything about this and I said to the to the daughter I said does your brother in law you called me she says oh yeah he's really into this and I just started to look\nTo your grandmother and gave him aside law and so\nHe said will call my son over half recall my son over so he says to me tell my son to go home right now that my brother bill is in my basement trying to break open my\nGun cabinet oh boy and I\nLooked at him and I said now you're telling a crazy person that I mean you know he called me crazy\nWas it was the brother going to try to do so manner where we just wanted the collection of gun you want to keep them from Salem right\nTies to the sun I said your uncle bill is in your dad's house right now in the basement trying to break open the gun cabinet\nAnd the sun looks at me he goes no he's not I just saw the half hour ago and I said quaint amount to me he's lucky he says you know I don't really see him I Am the father said my house is two streets over I says apparently your father's house is only two streets over\nAnd he would do this\nTo her and she said I didn't tell her and I said please go home and then go down the basement and see what your uncle doing phone sure enough this world who bill was breaking open the gum cabinet\nRight on ...\nSo it it's interesting when things like that happened or were they telling me were money's hidden or a ... I Can't tell you how many gifts I found for wives that the husbands died right before their birthday\nOr an anniversary and\nYou know it's like look in this covered in his shoe box you going to find a really pretty necklace that he's out for you you\nYou give them closure\nI Do I Do and if you think about it you know it would've\nBeen really nice to talk to a couple of your loved ones before you couldn't do it anymore and I think people like that and it's not always wears the key to the safety deposit box a lot of times it is but not all the time\nWhen a when you're dealing with the deceased how many of them are generally known but their debt\nEvery one of them\nHow do you not come out of your body and look down in ... leads the body and look down and go holy smokes I Am dead\nSo they're not in denial they are not and I know there's some psychic sent me the and say that they don't know they're dead but yeah I mean\nNot all of them you don't know how do you not know he was on I Would agree with you yeah I Know you can do\nThis now I'm not saying they're happy about it but they definitely know that they're dead\nYou know not everybody who die moves on thinking this was all fun and games ha ha I'm dead and I'm going to happen it's gonna be depressing even for some of the ah ... you see so I Would do\nWell it's adds a lot of them are set because they think\nThat they won't be able to see what's going on with their family or watch their grandchildren grow up and it's like no no no no no one to go into the light you can come back and forth you're not gonna miss anything plus the fact there's proof of that\nBecause if you take pictures and you get ... or send pictures perfectly round circles they can be little they can be big they can be any color they can be sparkly\nThough there's fear that have crossed over back for a visit\nIf there is a design in the middle of the or\nEnlarge it you can usually see inside profile or a face of who it is\nIt's the orb is blank in the middle it's a dust particle don't worry about it\nYou have looked a lot of negative energy pursue what have you concluded the ball so [noise]\nWell I really believe that it's pretty easy [noise] [noise] and you hate to put this out there but I it's actually pretty easy to put negative energy on somebody it's not as big of a ritual as people think it is\nI mean if you think about it you don't care for your neighbor and every day ... what are you fighting about you're fighting about the property line\nSo every day when you see him come out of his house in going his garage to leave or cut his grass you're sitting there in your kitchen watching him going oh you jerk I Hope you break your knee or I don't like you why don't you move\nYou know look at it this way if I said to you George tomorrow morning at ten o'clock I'm going to have some minor surgery say a prayer for\nMe I Will say a prayer for\nExactly and that means sending positive energy to make good energy to me but if this lady is sitting in her kitchen every time she looks at her neighbor and thinking negative stuff why couldn't debts get\nNo chance that person one realize this was happening to them and to fight it off\n[noise] they can eventually but remember comma you know be careful who you credit for a while under the bus it and\nYou never know what goes around comes true right but I mean the the recipient of the curve for example oh okay do they know that it's happening to them\nI think if it's done with enough intent or if you actually go to some one for his cheapest five bucks and tell them to put negative energy and somebody they pretty much know easily\nThe three things that negative energy will effect and it can affect one two or all three of them and then no particular order is health money or relationships\nAnd you know of all of a sudden you're twenty two years old and you never had any problems dating and you always had a good time and all of a sudden now you're going out with a new person and after the second day to your show right\nThe toilet so something's going on but if you you know if you go to somebody like me or\nIt should have been removed negative energy once that's taken off and anybody can remove negative energy or somebody you can't do it yourself\nBut you could definitely have a friend do it\nAnd once that is released and gone ear find the same thing

want to talk about the dream stayed what can be conjured up that way\nBut when someone puts a curse on an individual does the individual and what happens to them do they feel something did they see I think someone put a curse on me\nWell when things start going bad and you don't feel good or your relationships go down there too but you lose your job and you can find a job um then they start thinking that when you hear on the boring loser I must have a cloud over my head\nA ... if I didn't have bad luck I wouldn't have any luck and\nPeople don't realize that especially if everything was

have it removed [noise] it's not hard to do you can do it [noise]\nAnd it is long and you know actually if a person doesn't even ...\nThey've they have a curse on them and I tell them that they do sit down in front of me I'll take this off of you they don't even have to believe that all they had to do is give me their permission\nMy grand daughter got a promotion where she was working and uh apparently she got a promotion over somebody who saw they were entitled to that job and she did it fair and square or you know decent and everything she's bright girl\nAnd strange things started happening to her I mean things that would always go well things were really kind of screwed up and sure she called me up one day some papa\n... I think somebody put a curse on me and and I said ... let's let's think about this for a moment ... who would want to do this to you or me you're in good fun person you're nice person you don't hurt anybody\nAnd we started talking and she mentioned the promotion and she mentioned some people that they gave her the job over\nAnd I went oh huh and I said oh look a couple of these people is there one there that you would think would be capable of that and she said yes and sure enough it ended up being a person oh I Apologize and took the curse off currently and everything's fine\nOr stop sending negative energy to hurry they'll ...\nSo my question is when someone does get hit by a Kurdish how easy is it for that person to try to distinguish who put the curse on them\n[noise] that's a little bit harder and the main questions that I ask when I'm actually doing the removal is\nUm [noise] did you take somebody away from their spouse in other words that you have an affair with a married person believe you me a woman you know ... ... you get a man gets angry at somebody and they're going to find somebody in the nose a woman gets angry at somebody\nWins meaner than men she's gonna curse that person and\nBecause she was hurt more ways than one and the job thing is exactly right you can't believe how often that happens and but the bottom line is this who cares who did it just get it off\nHow do you get it off can you do it yourself you have to call Murray and when ... how do you get it off\nNo you can't remove it yourself but you can have a friend do it for you and they can't they don't have to believe that they just have to go through the ritual and and when do speak the whole last chapters how to remove negative energy anybody can do it you just can't do it to yourself\nUse every buddy susceptible to a curse what about someone who's got so much energy and positivity can they put up this force field to kind of block it and she you\nKnow unfortunately the only thing that I personally know that his work forever because once it curses removed that doesn't necessarily stop the person that was putting it on they're not going to know it's off\nThe end there's so many different kinds of curses [laughter] I mean there's one that they may be has to be and do something at every full moon or generational curses they just automatically go with generation to generation like the Kennedys you have to know they were cursed\nAnd so there's all kinds of different kinds but once it's removed most people as long as they you know I give him that Quincy to carry as long as they have that they never have to have a curse removed off of them again it does not affect them\nAs a matter of fact I think about it ballplayers let's use the baseball players for instance\nOkay there's a game between the Cleveland Indians and maybe New York and so all the fans and the Cleveland Stadium every time they're ... gets up the whole stadium is going to lose you jerk don't hit the ball given out and then they clap if he does\nGet an energy thrown on that person's\nOh yeah absolutely and that's why the home she has an advantage\nChats exactly right but that doesn't mean when they get on their plane to leave Cleveland that he left the negative energy here it's going with him it's gonna be added on every other stadium that is not his home state yeah\nSo and that's why I Do so many ballplayers all kinds of all players will\nHer ballplayers in a slump let's say damn\nGood a slum or they just you know they don't feel good they're out of sorts they're tired all the time and the other thing too and says ... ball players\nLook the dead fans that goes that hang out in stadiums you know you couldn't walk up and stand next to LeBron James at a basketball game you would never get on court the guards and everybody would keep you away sure\nIt's like gee if your ghost who's going to stop you know exactly where the\nWhat about the dream state visiting the dead and for other things\nOne person has crossed into ... they can absolutely come in and out of your dreams you can talk to them you can get all kinds of information from them you can get a dog\nA kid I mean it is so comforting to be able to talk to these people they look good they look at the uh happy they look healthy\nAnd but if the person has not crossed over you will never dream of them earth spirits can not getting dream [laughter]\nNow if an earth spirit is in your bedroom while you're sleeping you're going to have bizarre dreams technicolor Lao flashy", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "Yankton", "day": "06"}
