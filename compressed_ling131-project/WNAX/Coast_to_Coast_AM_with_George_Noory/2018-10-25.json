which aren't you\nKnow well I I Hope so [laughter]\nAs opposed to ban which I guess but no you're you're you're an upbeat person you're you're friendly you care about people absolutely know how to dissolve start for you how did you get involved in witchcraft well\nYou know I started working with a ... and she's also happens to be of I I consider her to be a very powerful which and\nUm she introduced me to magic and instead of doing the work for me because you know she I feel like her healing and like I I feel like whatever she does with the only just so amazing but instead of doing the work for me she empowered me and taught me how to do it myself [laughter]\nSo I just you know I picked it up really quickly and I I mean the rest is history I feel very very confident with with\nWhat I Do you know with the cells that I've been executing so that's how I got started it was it was more about healing and then that's when she just introduced me to it and now I feel like I probably don't need a healer because I'm I'm using magic as a form of killing\nHave you ever cast a spell on somebody you\nKnew that her and I want to make that very clear that I Will never ever ever cast a spell to hurt anyone um to try to bring love my way to try to win the lottery [laughter] isn't that what\n... what what what good are spells that if you can't win anything\nYou know I think that the\nPower of our minds because I have discovered the one thing I have discovered with magic is that in my mind is more powerful than I realized [laughter] so I think that when we start healing on so many different levels\nThat we will be able to tap into unlimited amounts of financial abundance and spiritual abundance [laughter] so I I mean maybe at some point you know maybe I Will conjure up on my knee spell and work that but right now I've just been focused on doing the um healing and crossing and reversal\nWhen you talk about magic what do you what are we talking about there are we're not talking about David Copperfield we're talking about something else are we absolutely\nAnd it can be used by anyone I think people you know use magic every single day with the power of their minds so when I talk about magic I'm simply cantina cell and when I work my rituals I chat between anywhere between one and two hours I don't just trying to say really\nThat long I really do I mean I think my

throwing charge salt water and the candle and every single corner of my home and it's really really works and then I'll ward all the windows [laughter]\nYou know the the ceiling and the floors and everything else so um that's fun it's really really fun and then when I when I chat spelled like when I Do and crossing\nRituals which I think everyone should learn how to do and and do it very often

[laughter] well it's it's not as tragic as that but I have\nHad one experience and I I Will share that with you I Would say about Nineteen Twenty years ago and this is my first experience with a real live Damon demand this wasn't like a porn all it was in my house and came out and you know wanted to play it was actually a demon that was summing up by a very evil sent that off and he sent it my way\nWhat's on federal I I think there is somebody I is the religion and um they can either be good or bad I don't know much about this on the religion but I Do know that there are some powerful\nSunset or some sort of you yes I'm betcha it's a religion okay\nAnd so they work with magic and they work with the Audi shots which are different spirit\nAnd so this son battle had sent that intentionally\nOf course it sent a team in my way and this was after I had had a reading with him a psychic reading and of course I was so naive and I didn't know I didn't know anything about the occult or anything about metaphysics I was just you know whatever just living my life and I that same even in that same day in in the evening\nI um [noise] they turned off my life so I Can't even blame it on a train as soon as they turn off my light on I was ... down to my dad and I was terrified I didn't even know what it was because I didn't know anything about demons and um\nIt was\nJust like I couldn't move so my first reaction was to pray the Lord's Prayer out loud and it didn't work so I you know after a few words my job locked and I felt like I had something\nShut into my now you\nThat healthy looking dot com or toll\nFree eight hundred six so for thirty one twenty nine eight hundred six though for thirty one twenty nine or ... healthy looking dot com looming out at a healthy looking dot com [noise]\nJulie Leslie seal oh to Howard grew up with my fourth interview for directors operation or it was overwhelming running to ... below it puts a new job on Lincoln in there about what really connected with the passionate about something logical it's operation\nWe started to get the next town that led to prompt us databases child development when he became a geek out ... and knew we had to hire and\nI don't know how we would have found out there without Lincoln job to\nFind your next tier which Lincoln jobs will reach people you won't find anywhere else we look beyond job title to learn how you're looking for and then we match people with the right skills can experience to your role\nI thought we were looking for a ... operation we were really looking for a\nStart hiring with Lincoln jobs today go to link dot com slash working to get fifty dollars off your first job was pointing dot com slash working for your fifty dollars I think ...\nAre you considering a safe to secure your valuables or firearms let's face it seeps are not very attractive they usually end up getting stuck in the garage or in a closet wouldn't it be great if there was a seats that had to look a beautiful antique so you could display it in your living space as an ... while also having easy access to it while there is check out the rhino\nIron works shakes at rhino safe dot com American Made an antique styled our shapes up part art part furniture and all security and if you like the classic ... states we also features\nTroops are part art part furniture and all security and if you like the classic car running alarm or exchanged we also read your beautiful measuring tools chess and furniture with hundreds of thousands of satisfied customers and those huge network\nAcross the U.S we've built our reputation on having a best best best looking and most convenient shirts with great service and Warren ... and you can get on line for Nancy show go with the Bush\nStyle convenience security improves piece of mind ...\nGum today ... dot com dot com\n[noise]\n\n\nAnd we'll come back we're backwards a practice in which the good which groups are rip the real younger website is linked up the coast to coast dot com right now we'll get your calls in just a second with her courses so we're talking about is demonic situation and use it wasn't going well what was happening\nSo I at that point I was pinned down on my bed and\nThen all of a sudden it felt like hours of course all of a sudden I fell on my ear going up and down I don't know but it's a pall over a hand for it but it was going up and down on my left ear and so it was really really crazy so at that point it was either fight or flight and I obviously couldn't sleep because I was ten down\nSo this wave of courage just came over me and I just thought you know I ... I mean nobody knows what you're going to do in that situation so I just thought and as soon as I\nI made that adjustment in my mind right I said I'm going to fight it felt like it just\nPeeled off of me and at that moment with my right arm I just warmed up and went up and I'm not kidding George I felt a hairy leg that is insane it's so crazy I didn't really tell anyone\nBut it just like it flew away obviously\nThat's right it is so freaky and I didn't even tell my mom because I Know she probably wouldn't believe me but I did go back to that psychic woman that look like what happened but yeah it's so freaky and I will say it never happen again after that time so I Know that this man is something that even and sent it my way but I did not sleep\nWithout the light off for about three months after that\nIt totally terrified me it was\n... who is susceptible to demonic possession and in situations like that it helps\nWell you know I'm not going to list does that say the obvious ones like people doing drugs or having a cocktail\nFor drunk or shine yeah we're we're\nGoing to the ... the cemetery it you know and having a cocktail at midnight [laughter] but I Will say that um there is one reason I think that\nMany other were you ever to laugh you don't have a ... which uh which should have a capital you won\nA which is actually a wise woman so that's the definition of a witch but yeah I think you [laughter] I'm\nKind of one of the chemical sensor and [laughter] I Can't do it even if I\nTried so one of the reasons that I think is not so obvious um but I feel that can be helpful to many for them to understand\nI'm considering we've all lived thousands of lifetimes I'm and I'm Glad I haven't remembered any of them\nUm some of these lifetime so we were not the best of people and um it's very possible but this is my theory and it could be wrong but\nI have proof from ... to kind of confirmed my you know my thoughts about this it's very possible that some of these people these victims or experiencing what is known as karma so they can be\nYou know harassed and molested in this lifetime with the demon the danger with in in a previous life time now this is the thing I think most people don't consider the people who make packs with humans in this lifetime\nOn the team in the past is is usually for the life of the demon and that's usually a long time I mean I don't think I've ever heard of a demon die unless you've like slate\nCast them all but they don't buy exactly there's\nThousands of them so it makes sense if you think about at Georgia it makes sense that like people make a pact with the demon that that's going to be for the life of the demons and what's going to happen when we ... incarnate and the demon is going to probably harass him and molest him now that's one one theory and I can say\nI'm with confirmation that it's it's it's probably very true because my sharman has a lot of cases it seems like it's more common these days\nHas a lot of cases of of people\nWho are being molested harassed\nAnd just you know that possessed by demons and what she does and she's very gifted she will take a ... journey into their past lives and nail it and nine times out of ten these people have made tax would demons or they were maybe a big\nPowerful black which and you know I don't know it's it's it's different for each of them but for the most part they were doing things that they probably shouldn't have been doing and so she does is\nShe just\nBreaks that agreement that they can finally be free\nAnd um I think this happens to a lot of people and I think most people for those that are listening if you find yourself in the situation and you know these demons or not bothering your neighbor it's probably a good idea to contact a qualified showman who can really just put an end to this\nWhat are these dark for she wants crucial what what do they want with us\nThey want our light and they want to destroy humanity duty we'd also\nAbsolutely and I'm sadly a lot of black magicians will cast spells against people who they feel they can steal light from and they can do this collectively with a bunch of people\nUm and they look into us however they do it\nAnd what this does it will make their incorrect magic more potent\nSo this is what it is extremely important especially right now\nUm to to really really really really clear ourselves on a daily basis and do vanishing rituals prayers and and ... our homes and everything else because I I don't know I've been hearing more and more cases\nOf of the human intrusions in people's homes but also how the demonic forces can definitely um manipulate our thoughts\nLet's go to the phones for you know jumping in Redding, California to get us started I just go ahead\nI George how are you are

about how ... ... what's going on in terms of energy creation it's not just for the stars we know how the stars work who used to live in a hundred years ago\nAnd it stars or a man some burning gas and of course what else could they very\nWell or they could be clear fusion going ... in the lure of misleading graders source of energy and therefore in greater dinner dream a danger in energy there is a

well stance with us for about twenty four more minutes or so\nStand you wrote a book with Kathleen Martin was the niece of Benny Hill called captured which is still for me one of the greatest UFO stories of the abductions I've ever read it is one of the reasons I got into this business\nBecause it wouldn't look magazine came out with the interrupted journey or the story of Barney and Benny Hill I mean I was just mesmerized even at a young age how would you categorize that case the Barney and video case\nI think it's a very important case and for several different reasons I'm\nOn the people are not talking about people who don't have a reputation and we're not talking about people who are trying to seek ... for attention and say that he was a social worker or respected member of the community [noise]\nShe had a mixed marriage with Barney aims ... she was white that was very unusual nearly sixty though it took guts for them to come out and that's right\nAnd they were very concerned about what the reaction would be\n... this was in the early sixties and you know if you got to ... if you're going to have people who set a new standard of what's going on you got to have people who can handle the heat so to speak [laughter]\nIt's unfortunately Barney didn't limb terribly long time when a Nineteen sixty eight I guess and uh [noise]\nA buddy of mine I'm Around a long time for which I Am glad [noise] and uh it was a good case of set the ball rolling so to speak on the whole business of abductions and interactions with him [laughter] not sensationalized [laughter]\nI mean only traits you stand back and say betting Barney where specimens for somebody at the\nEnd they weren't treated but they certainly weren't going on for the glory and claiming all kinds of not see things as being part of their interaction with the ... ah [noise]\nAnd you know I I was fortunate to have the opportunity to meet them early on [noise]\nOn my ... and I I was very impressed and I was impressed by something else a ... in that case a ... pei and Pittsburgh biggest station in town and the\nUh you know I I that's where I made my view on the air so to speak\nAnd may call me and told me that they were bringing Betty and Barney into town\nAnd told me where they were staying\nAnd which is very unusual yeah and I contacted them we had dinner together\nOh just the trailers and I had a chance to you know one on one kind of thing and I was very very impressed and I had known what to expect because I hadn't bell and stuff like this I mean\nIt isn't that crazy story alien to grab the couple a an interracial couple\nIn those days you were just getting into this field weren't you\nWell yeah I mean you'd have you done it pretty early on I was early yeah\nAnd the sixties and it fell on her in the sixties or seventies or eighties [laughter] that's right\nNo till I was very fortunate to have met them one on one so to speak and something I'm like conferences didn't get too many meetings with Barney because he died within two years when I first met him a lesson left\nA very he was caught on it and of course I worked very closely with that he's nice Kathleen Martin we've done three books together and ah\nLet's run a pleasure to a if not often you find it can break with people uh have a co written ... books will will with other people but we seem to be compatible\nYeah you you you too clicked and she's great in the field and you follow due to\nA hurry she super person you don't see him\nWhen I was that Twenty one year old reporter who interviewed you one of the other interviews I did was with Dr Benjamin Simon who ... who is the psychiatrist who\nWho studied Betty and Barney hill and this is I'll I'll always remember this because she was in Boston I interviewed them over the phone I'm In Detroit\nIn Barney hill and this is I'll I'll always remember this because she was in Boston I interviewed them over the phone I'm In Detroit and in the ... you know I'm I'm obsessed with the story and I asked him I says so what do you think Dr\nA ball they're telling you the truth or not what do you think he said I I don't know if the story happened or not but I Will tell you what I Do believe\nThey're they're not lying whatever happened to them both of them on under hypnosis separately told the same story\nAnd they they believe whatever they saw happened to them and he said based on that I cannot say what happened but I can tell you they aren't lying to me and uh what an amazing story\n... we have to remember the doctor Simon random facility for three thousand shell shocked war veteran\nYes called put them through America for\nA long way before anybody would get involved and stuff like that\nAnd have learned to use a ... means of bringing guys who've had terrible experiences you know your buddy said falling off next year and a battle [noise] ah that's traumatic to hate but weeks [laughter]\nAnd so he learned how to handle this and so they were very fortunate and winding up in his hands\nAnd you know I I I'm Still not sure exactly what he finally thought about the whole business\nBut he surely thought that these people are not in line that's right\nThere was not looking for attention to the center and center I was impressed with ... and uh\nI was a personal but even born into Barney ideal forties and uh unfortunately but when they were they had the same to gain a mixed couple in the United states in the early ...\nWho was not breathing itself around the world when they were asked to come out so to speak to resist to put a reporter for two story out [noise] much to their surprise I'm relieved for the were treated fine\nAnd they found out around the world and that's the thing that I have a little look I lecture to Nineteen countries\nHas given me a pretty good handle on a whole lot of people think about the subject of flying saucers aliens or you know losers from someplace else\nAnd I found I just haven't had bad reaction of the people\nYou know and if anything it's getting even stronger I think let's take some calls for instance let's go to John in Virginia Beach east of the Rockies go
