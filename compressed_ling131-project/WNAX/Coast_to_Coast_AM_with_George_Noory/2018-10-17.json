[laughter]\nAnd um my guess is if it's painted with a lot of a good subject matter interest it probably worth some decent money\nWhen I'm On a picture of like George Patton or something like that one would that be worth\nA lot of money because George Patton was such an interesting so George Patton was you know they made a great movie about him and uh you know he he was just he was just a guy who stood out I'd love to have is up Pearl handle fiscal\nOh my gosh that would be worth something wouldn't it wouldn't that be something ...\nSure would also didn't he have like a ... not not again but he walked with something that had like a little leather strap at the end of it or something like\nThat yeah I kind of carried little like you know the way people ... yeah yeah I carried a little law
