you know about two very\nDifferent subjects [noise] in the second half tonight a story\nThat involves incredible acts of heroism treachery incompetence and sheer terror it is the true story of the worst disaster in us naval history the sinking of the USS Indianapolis\nIt's taken more than fifty years for the full story to emerge from behind and official wall of secrecy and blame\nTo remarkable journalists have worked for years to tell the whole story I was totally blown away by their book it takes you right there into the water with the sailors as they struggle to survive shark attacks and the elements for days and days wow what a story\nA coauthor is Lynn Vincent and Sarah bladder will be here to share what is already a or run away best seller of a book\nA but first I had hinted last month when ... was here that he had something else in the works I'm not sure when the guy sleeps but he returns to the program coming up and just a few minutes and in a sense he is returning to his roots\nYou know the first time he was on coast to coast I Believe it was ten years ago to discuss his first book the ... project\nWas a typical day polite as boots on the ground investigation this time of the big butt legend and David spent two years among the ... tribe to hear their tails and legends and to apply police in forensic methods to figure out\nWhat was being seen in the forests of the Pacific northwest as it turns out of course similar sightings have been reported all over the world and wild ... better known these days for his investigations of missing people\nAnd I knew that there was Native American history with a topic that ran deep and I needed it within say six to eight hour driving location from where I Lived at the time in Los Gatos California\nAnd I coordinate down the area to ... which is about thirty miles south of bluff creek were the Paterson given one film was made sixty seven\nSo I started to do some geographical research some topic graphical some weather\nAnd I started to bring this together and then I went up there and make contact with the group of police fatter police background I approached them and I said hey maybe you can break down some doors for me I'm\nNot going to not going to stretch the truth I'm going to tell the truth and every witness that comes forward they're going to have to write an affidavit to what they saw under penalty of perjury\nAnd I wanted to raise the bar on the topic a little bit so that that would be no question about what was stated because they sign it and there'd be no question about it for the story was fabricated because it was done under perjury\nSo I I started that route and a couple of the cops there knew many of The Elders and this was so helpful and breaking down the doors these guys was introduced me and they say hey\nYou can trust this guy ah he's a friend he's credible and that's the way it got started and uh after I heard maybe ten or Fifteen of these stories from ultra credible people in and out of the tribe\nA one was a store manager that ran this big story in Hooper that\n... miles away who saw one coming into town I certainly think about my police days and I used to work with a forensic artist that was just phenomenal and uh he would sit down with a witness be able to draw the sketch from just the witness statements and the results were amazing\nBut I wanted something that a slightly different so I could a line this person with a tribal setting in Native Americans and I found a diamond\nUnbelievable look an individual name Harvey ... who was assistant director of the Oklahoma bureau of investigation and the chief forensic artist FBI trained for the state of Oklahoma and Harvey is not only a world famous artists tease it outstanding law enforcement person\nAnd a Harvey and I met in right away we just click like brothers\nAnd when Harvey would sit down with say a witness to a robbery and draw sketch a suspect and the suspect was later caught I Swear to you it is like the suspect was in the room and Harvey due the sketch the suspect that is how accurate this man is\nAnd so when I brought him in to the Native American tribes they immediately accept and\nPardon me I have done this for a long time now together and we're best friends\nWe did two books that Hooper project and then we took a follow up book called the tribal big foot where he went outside of Hooper and draw sketches of what other people saw again took statements under penalty of perjury and I'm\nKind of how it started\nA you say you don't have a dog in the fight meaning you're not committed to one position or another because there are several different camps in the big world right\nOh bingo uh when I started the most vocal the most audacious\nThe most vulgar\nAre probably the people who believe it's an eight and they will run you over the world demean you they will do anything to push that cause\nBut since they were the most outspoken I thought well this must be true and I kinda went down that path thinking well must be an aid must be some kind of a background\nBut I still kept that open mind in when we the first day that we sat down with the people in and around who drew the sketches\nHarvey myself and Harvey's wife Gina proud also an agent for in Oklahoma we were sent in stunned disbelief\nBecause the sketches were very human like yeah they were huge yeah they have hair all over the body but there was a human quality that you just couldn't miss and they didn't look like apes they didn't have that tape characteristics that you would think of in a face in their chest et cetera\nAnd it was just shocking and\nWhen the witnesses saw the sketches to a lady into a man they would consistently say Harvey you nailed it that he ... ... what you look like\nAnd when you talk of The Elders they would consistently say this is another tribal people he's on animals these are people\nThey had a sort of developed a relationship\nWith them at least and coexistence right\n[noise] yeah it in the tribal area method one of the managers presidents chairman of the tribe\nA and they said so that they looked at a map they said so this is their area we don't go in there and this is your area this is our area and if they can come into our area and they do regularly and that's why we see him\nI don't think about the hoop areas the trinity river like great salmon and steal headed area\nAh has just so much wildlife and if you drive through hoop up from willow creek you'll notice that there are more Barry bushes on the roadways and the surrounding mountains than I've ever seen anywhere in the world\nAnd there's this association with berries and big foot over the years that if you pay attention and you do the research something about\nThat and I I I Know that they're seen eating at a lot but it's just an odd coincidence\nYou or I don't want to get too deep into the woods I'm literally and figuratively but you can you summarize as a law man as former law man and the state of the evidence about whether you'd say there is that there is there's sufficient evidence that something is real here or that we just haven't quite figured out\nSo several years\nOf walking down that path I knew the DNA is the real answer to any solution of animal life for human life [noise]\nAnd there were series of people that I met on this journey that were absolutely ultra credible many of them didn't want to talk about it many of them didn't want to be visible about it but all of them said you were in on this let's let's get the DNA\nAnd George I got to think that to many years ago you brought on and at my request a a PHD name Melba catch them Dr catch him\nWas one of the few people in the world that was willing to go into the lab and DNA test hairs tissue blood et cetera that we'd bring in and on your show we said hey we need other samples from throughout North America to test to kind of get a cross section of what we're dealing with\nWe said hey we need other samples from throughout North America attest to kind of get a cross section of what we're dealing with\nAnd that led to a hundred and ten samples being submitted a many more were hair and with the hair you need the follicle ticket the mitochondrial DNA and then other people came forward where a tissue sample blood saliva\nAnd all of this noble work through incredibly well ah to figure out the solution and the chemical way to extract and read this DNA\nAnd the amazing part was is that we got nuclear DNA\nAnd what the showed was that the ... went back twelve to Fifteen thousand years on the female side to the ... Arab region to ah Jerusalem to\nA Jordan ended that part of the world and this this winter was sent to a gym bag and three hundred and fifty two billion base pairs of human DNA is in the ...\nAnd unbelievably Gen bank came back and said they can't find ever reading the male side of the equation [noise] and they wrote this up she brought in three other PHD's super smart people to help her write a white paper about this\n[noise] and during that process of getting the DNA extracting the DNA one of the places that they used was only ... than a crime lab completely automated process for extracting the DNA and getting it\nAnd there was no there was no way that the samples could have been compromised\nYet as the paper was written before I get there so they write as they're in the process of writing the paper a lot of people don't do this but you and I work together to introduce smell but to a very brilliant scientist who had written white papers before\nAnd we explained to her and he explained to her a proper way to go about this\n[noise] she listen to some of this but you didn't listen to all of it and unfortunately she put a lot of feelings and thoughts don't belong in a white paper in a white paper\nBut if you are correct all of those feelings and thoughts and you stick strictly with the science\nWhich people don't and Ninety nine percent of people have never read the paper and they read news briefs here and there and think it's the truth the reality is when you sit\nBury a a very precise DNA kind of testing the paper that was written by Dr Melba catch them maybe had some personal I'm a observations that didn't belong in the paper but the\nThe DNA evidence David Was rock solid right\n[noise] well that's the part that I don't think a lot of people understand it wasn't from ale treatment it was\nIt was the best of the best the DNA was sent to form a certified lab so to ensure that there was no mistake all of the ... the same results [noise] uh it was analyzed by a series of people it was [noise]\nIt went through so many hurdles it was unreal there's a there's a couple of outsiders right now doing research on DNA and you could see him on TV and they said oh you know the DNA is comeback of bears et cetera\nAnd one of the things that no but did that most researchers and Dan a so called experts are not doing right now\nIs that when the hair samples came in they went to her hair and fiber expert before they went to be in a way to ensure that they came back as big for her that people are saying going to say well how do you know let's pick for their well ... looks different than any other mammal hair in the world\nAnd I could teach anybody in five minutes to look at a big foot her into a physical difference under a microscope between that and other hairs parent fiber experts have a raffle all the different mammal hires in North America [noise] and when you look at a big but here it's an entirely different [noise]\nSo if it if the hair didn't jump through that hurdle it never went on to DNA\nBut if you pay attention to all of these DNA expert or not use inherent fiber expert even walk and ensure that what they're dealing with is the real deal [noise]\nSo and I don't think some of the so called DNA experts\nWhat they're dealing with is the real deal [noise]\nSo and I don't think some of these so called DNA experts have figured out the formula that Mel but did to extract this DNA and to get the results\nAnd there's a lotta there's a lotta attitude in this arena as you know George and it's unfortunate that people won't put down their defenses and all work together and it almost seems at times that there's something else behind the scenes\nThat's ensuring that they don't want to get those results\nWell it's kinda like the UFO world I mean people are very passionate but they're also very bitter conscious and you have a certain element of people who takes their take their passion to\nDifferent levels um to the point of fraudulent um material um and ah will stab people in the back and will sabotage others uh the DNA evidence at a minimum\nUm people were able to dismiss it because it has elements of humans in it right so they'd say well it's humid\nBut it's not all you\nKnow and that's that's the part but as I could say that looks like it's a hybrid human um it's unusual but it's it's way far down that humans spectrum [noise] um\nI I think the most unusual part\nThat everyone was stunned about was that the nuclear DNA couldn't come back with a human match on gender bank and when you look at that you've got to think well that means number one that Gen bank has never had a sample in the world submitted other than ours\nAnd how could that be\nUm we we used we we sat down as a group many times and try to be smart about how we got this DNA and luckily on a couple of occasions a farmer had some pipes break an irrigation pipe and it was kind of surmise that\nSay a six foot section of pipe was purposely broken on on each and six feet apart\nBecause it appeared that big foot was trying to get some kind of animal that within the pipes some kinda rodent or something and when he broke the PVC pipe and bled on it well we got the DNA off that other times it linked to a game camera we got that\nAnd there were there was a tissue sample we got that and then over a hundred hair samples that had a follicle that all match this big foot look when you view it under a microscope [noise]\nNow Ninety nine point nine percent of the time when I get approached about this that people haven't read the study they read a newspaper article or someone's opinion and they believe it\nAnd they refused to get into the minutia that data and read the report because it's available online and see that the hurdles that we went through to make sure that this was true an accurate I give all the credit to Melba she's a genius scientists figured this out [noise]\nUm it's unfortunate\nYeah because it got down to a thrown under the under the bus as she did as well um ... you said that the this this was not engine bank is it now or they toss it out\nThey wouldn't take it\n\nLet's go to your book big wild man and giants I mean a lot of times these descriptions and there's some amazing working here there's some really\nA tremendous writing in some of these old articles or from a long time ago but um and some of them are pretty hilarious and in reading it off and making fun of the witnesses as well\nBut these things are the three different categories you happen to titled they're all sort of blended together although there are some very important distinctions between the the three and they go way way back sixteen eight\nHow did you how did you find all these\nSo ... again it was just me searching for old cases on missing people that seemed to miss that fit that profile but we were looking for [noise] but\nThen when I had this giant stack of articles kind of the breakdown of of the way the articles were worded\nIs two hundred and two of the articles used wild man as the description\nTwenty four used a gorilla or monkey Ninety eight used giants and forty use something else\nNow the articles the way they broke down on geographical is a hundred and fifty eight we're in the U.S sixteen in Canada\nThree and hungry for three in the Himalayas er Nepal and three in the u._k. there were others but those were the bulk of them\nAnd then the states with the most articles about it a whirl Ohio with Twenty one Pennsylvania Thirteen California eleven Indiana eleven [noise] New York nine Georgia nine Kentucky in Texas six [noise]\nAnd then the numbers keep going down from there but again it wasn't I wasn't looking for these and\nThey weren't associated with a missing persons articles they just would have visibility on a front page along with a new article in the missing [noise]\nBut I started to pay attention and I got to give some credit to a guy named Tom Powell Oregon Tom's a brilliant guy good researcher and he started to make the connection between giants in Bigfoot\n[laughter] and one of the funniest things he did in his presentation just genius\nThere's a lot of people say oh you know if you're overly this map with the maps of the foot wild man disappearances there all the same and he puts up a map of like Bigfoot there's a appearances and UFO appearances and\nThen he does some where all the you know the amount of rain in certain areas associated and and he goes down like six maps and then he puts up a map and he doesn't say anything he goes you know what this map of because this is a map of all the Wal Mart stores in the U.S can you see how they're kind of associated in the same location of the big\nFight [laughter] and\nBut it was his statement about giants that were found in past centuries\nIn mountains and in a excavations that really kinda got me thinking or these giants the big for that were buried or were these something else and how come they're more there aren't more giants that we can go see it museums and things where are they\nYeah I'd asked that question I'm really interested in the subject in part because there are some of those stories here in Nevada you know the ... century showing the legends and stories about the big foot bones or a giant bones that were stashed in the game up in northern Nevada and Ah yes what happened to the bones and nobody can seem to find them\nWell why did these articles pointed to um some universities would get them out of the more likely candidates were all these when and it said in the articles was the Smithsonian\n... nobody can go back and find them now and the Smithsonian claims they don't have them\nLook back and some of the descriptions there's one early in your

captured a wild man and they brought him back somewhere on the ship or they've got him in jail and invariably he gets away or the evidence disappears however\n[noise] yeah and uh probably the one case in you know about it the Minnesota Wild man that half of injury to because I've seen pictures of it and I've seen descriptions of it and it is unusual and nobody quite knows what happens to it\nBut a lot of people just couldn't feel like you know was that was a fake meant for the circus but the more you dig into that one there was something strange with that\nWell I find myself rooting for the wild man or whatever it is to get away and all these cases so I'm Glad it ends up that way you know you look at where are these reports come from there from major these are major newspapers too I mean the Boston Globe and the San Francisco newspaper LA Times\nAnd the and it's some great writing some of these descriptions is just terrific writing\nIt it's somebody wasn't just phony get in a when they were working on this story and the fact that they come from places like Indiana and Iowa and Kansas or that's not where we associate big foot sightings modern sightings at all is trying to think of why would Ohio in Pennsylvania be so prominent in the numbers and it's because\nI mean that was the center of American civilization and is Seventeen hundreds or so Seventeen eighties where the bigger cities where it wasn't exactly the frontier because there are people out here as well but\nUh that's where the bulk of the population probably lived time\nPlug factly and [noise] it's a a it's an interesting phenomenon when you start to look at the sighting locations in conjunction with a giant sightings and skeletons and then if you go back in history and you think about exactly what you said where did we first establish\nCivilization and cities and as we move west where were these locations but then even though we're thing to me is Ohio has a lot of these sightings\nWall that's Bruce Maccabee with an Ohio is a friend and I went to spend four or five days within earlier this year and a strange things that he's told me that have happened in Ohio in the air and on the ground it's really strange\n[laughter]\nBruce Matt can be a is welcome here anytime he is a fascinating guy a boat in person and on the air and in his books or you know what it was kind of surprising to see the early reports from Hungary I'd never heard of Hungarian big butter sasquatch reports until reading this book of yours\nWide I'd never heard of him either and a\nAgain a surprising surprising fact that they're right about it from there and then in the ... they there's an article from there about siting ... when you look at the descriptions that they're offering poker with identical to what they're seeing here in the U.S at the same time period or thereabouts\nAnd then when you think about the present day fighting's again from on almost every continent in the world which is unusual\nUm you know some of the descriptions obviously you have to take him in a cultural contacts now I don't remember when the jungle book was written but Mobley the character Mobley um\nYou know he's described that description is used in a couple of the newspaper clippings from that era that you've collected here\nCorrect and\nUh [noise] I Know people always telling me well what about the star wars creature that looks like because I have kind of strange\nThat it was inspired by maybe yeah I don't know it's it's a similarity\nUm some of the descriptions I I I Would have to live through it here to find one but it seems like the witnesses are saying that the wild men have clothes or items of clothing or just a ... kind of a thing which suggests to me maybe they were humans may be read they really were literally wild men out there\n[noise] and usually\nAnd occasionally even nowadays you hear about big for wearing clothing and kind of goes unexplainable because why would they do that but you know maybe it's some association maybe they're trying to\nWould they do that but you know maybe\nSome association maybe they're trying to break a barrier or if they're seen maybe they think they'll be accepted more if they're seen maybe people won't be so scared\nYou know we could all through in our conjecture about why that may be happening but it happens too often for people to be fabricating and I I hear it occasionally but not very often\nUm if you were to communicate with the tribe these days a ... a modern tribe\nThat would still perhaps be in contact other than the ... are there any other tribes he would say people that have a relationship one going with the whatever these things are\nI Would say it's almost every one I mean there's there's famous stories out of Arizona New Mexico in the high plains out there where\nUh they have these and there's many times an association between and this is where they could people start their head start spending but in fact\nWe're there's this association between big in UFOs\nEven in the book I wrote that many of the tribal people that they saw a UFO and coast time and space to the point where they saw Bigfoot and they regularly saw UFOs on many of the tribal grounds\nAnd when you talk to these tribal members The Elders they believe they came from the stars and they're they're not once they have your trust they will tell you hey\nYou know there's this association between us and them and they're different kind of try and different kinds of people but they came from the same place we did\nAnd when you start to go back and you look at the history of these certain areas there's a lot of tribal people that will tell you we've had visitations for hundreds and hundreds of years going back in time and almost all of them believe that they came from the stars\nWhile there are an awful lot of associations between these creatures being cited in in proximity to UFOs and it makes everyone uncomfortable the big put people to die hard don't like it\nThe UFO die hards like it even less than they they're not comfortable with that at all but you have to follow it where it leads and you know I I don't have a conviction on it either I don't know what these things are and all the way UFOs are where they're from\nBut um there was enough cases over the centuries and a lot more of them now thanks to this new book\nHe can't ignore it I I thought the interest there was a couple of stories clippings where there are reputable witnesses who say they saw these creatures\nAre engaging with cow's milking cows\nSo this is the part that really really is unusual several years ago one of my best friends their parents on a dairy farm [noise] and I started talking to him about this and I said you know I I keep reading that\nThey may be milking cows you know what do you think about that because you know I'm going to talk to my parents\nTo stay on a huge Gary Hart [noise] anyone out there and talk to them and there's all this I think he's eight years old this guy's dad and he looked at him and he said you know\nEvery once in a while my cat will come back from nowhere completely email\nAnd goes I don't understand it [laughter]\nThen the same man\nTold and he says you know every once in a while I'm On the far corner my property and something tells me don't turn around\nGet back on the horse or get back on my TV and all the [noise] and he does and then the man said well you know every once in a while I found a bucket way out in the corner of the property I don't know how it got there\nTo talk [laughter] I think when you get the trust some of these dairy farmers way out in the middle they are going to tell you the same thing 'cause I've heard many times\nUm you know there are some funny stories I they're not in this book but I've recalled I think you and I have talked about before about big what are what they eat and they'll you know they're kind of particular this image of a big foot milking a cow a sticks in my head but I mean they've been known to eat a lot of berries and different kinds of fruits\nUm do they eat meat as far as you know\nAccording to the tribal people who are seen them take deer terror they're unarmed of war\n\n[noise]\n\n\nI'd here we go calls for my guess Dave ... is the first time caller Gwen in Pittsburgh Hi Gwen\nOh man thank you for letting me on your show first of all welcome back in about ... I have had many sleepless night listening to everything about the missing persons like eight is one of the most unsettling thing I've heard in a long time [laughter]\nSo good job on your finding um I Want him to talk about the big thing I actually think you're\nI really love how you're saying how it's related to wild man I'm I feel like Rome or off that way that we could find out more about wild men because there are Amazonian tribe network is discovered like for the first time with your own and I feel like\nYour idea of revolutionary and I feel like with them and I hadn't heard that point you have an answer if they have grown and my question who is like you're going to use drones in your research at all\n[noise] drones are an interesting topic but uh there was actually some a PHD level people that thought the drones were going to be good for finding their foot that that was a complete bomb\nSo a drones are never going to work for a big topic the missing people topic they have used drones before on missing people [noise] uh has worked real well and you can't use the drone international park it's against the law and there's a huge crime so probably won't happen [noise]\nThat George bought ... going to the next call I had a question for you and maybe you could have kind of touch on it for the people here [noise]\nYour work on skin Walker ranch the researchers there something very similar to a big ... can you tell us about that\nAre actually multiple times ah it's more of the tribe that that encounters them they've seen them there as long as they lived there and there was a very dramatic instance I've got the transcripts of the interviews with the officers\nAnd we went to the spot where it happened but the the dogs there were police officers are patrolling tribal grounds they have a gift shop that's just off the highway there on the reservation and\nUh the dogs alerted the officers to this huge thing that was a just outside the window and as soon as the dogs mated noise and the this thing looked at the officers and showing a light on it it took off running and it went all the way through the community and you could hear it\nIt ... I mean it was just taking these giant stride it knocked over garbage cans you had alarms going off and the police officers chased it\nAh I think they they found some tracks it led to a there's a reservoir there that's just on the other side of skin Walker ranch and that's where they lost that it just kind of sort of disappeared or they are seen similar creatures on the ranch and self\nUm I shouldn't call it big but it's more like humanoid and there's one particular instance that we've described on the program before where\nThese two scientists and to other people who were observers up on skin marker rigid seen what looked like a dirty snowball of light that uh that was floated just off the off the ground in the middle homestead there on the ranch in it ... through infrared you can see the the ball of light started stretching into what looked like a tunnel\nAnd through this tunnel this creature started crawling they could see it it can you guys these guys were really excited seeing this thing is coming from somewhere else in this tunnel of light ... through struggling to get through this skinny little opening it pulls itself out at the er at the entrance to this uh this tunnel\nStands up it's eight feet tall\nI'm feature lists dark humanoid shaped\nLike ahead with no neck on a on a body it's just stands up and then starts moving up towards getting Walker ridge where these guys are watching it and they can tell ya they got the hell out of there they were pretty scared about the whole thing but\nAre there have been multiple sightings of that by humans by um scientists by dogs uh uh the the tribe has the best a handle on it and um has seen it all over the you went to base and so yeah it's pretty common in that area and then of course it's in proximity to a lot of other really strange stuff so\nYou have to ask the question about what is the association between these creatures are that are described in many different ways and a lot of other very unusual phenomena and we don't know\nUm west of the Rockies Kyle in Utah Hi Kyle welcome to the program hey how you doing\nAll right so in your mind\nSo [noise] so I had um you're talking about David Was talking about Joseph stealing Smith the ones you talked to chain on his saddle um he taught Bigfoot\nIt happened in Eighteen [noise] a five star Eighteen thirty five he was on his way to another ... ... ... ... the prophet\nAnd he ... he ran in the Cain and uh he described Cain as a as a tall a figure that was taller than a shadow\nAnd a deal to kill these just talk to again in the heat and Kaine introduced this though is that I'm a man I'm Kirsten longer here and there and I might go will basically he she wanted to make men misery or the destroyed their souls\nYou brought that up I just thought in mourning culture LVS coach earlier that we have you know there's two story that are really Seamus that story than just chilling Smith shoe is Joseph Smith nephew\nKnow his brother had an encounter with Wesley Smith in Hawaii at the dedication and the then lay Hawaii temple of ... in Nineteen Twenty one\nI came came to read the doors of the temple and I'm In his hand [noise] ah\nYeah Wesley Smith said that he that was the priest and to cast came out and slowly rolls his hand and they just crashed a cash cow and king ... and so it's interesting you say that we can and art church you know like some people who are skeptical I ate there kind of hush hush let's talk about it\nBut as people continue to go on you know um there are more accepted but I just wanted for David like ... feet disappearances 'cause I've been reading this book for a little while and stuff\nI Do think it's it's a big foot you can play does he have any idea what's going on 'cause like people are asking me you know like people don't need to kind of have an interest in a little bit of this stuff\nI Will let me tell you a coyote let everyone listening here to tonight is probably the the weirdo expert in their family and then there are certain social circle\nA you and uh and everyone listening is likely they go to person in their own circles for information about these kind of topics they are to begin with the Joseph Smith story is that a is that likely a big foot type encounter or is that something else\nWhat was the scripture in the smack gave was ...\nBut then there's there's people who are researching this topic who believe that the big ... may be some night some type of the film from the Bible\nAnd there's there's people who are researching this topic who believe that the big ... maybe some night some type of the film from the Bible and when you read that there is some association there that makes some sense\nNow Scott Carpenter another researcher in the world has written a book about this it's compelling and there's there's some strong evidence that he's come across that may joined the two topics\nThen the other things like in the Smith and sent the part that's unusual is that it came in and spoke to him and he never said it mind spoke but more like it spoke to him so hard to say I don't know but one thing like this gentleman asked about my thoughts and things\nI've always stated that I'm a man of facts all of my books are filled with facts there aren't any opinions about what's going on I allow you to come to your own opinion and why do I do that because there are no facts to to establish any current pattern that points to one suspect\nWhen you look at the big foot world there's nothing that points to an exact equation of what we're dealing with other than the DNA\nBut again if you stick with the facts and allow the public to come to their own thoughts I have never met anybody who's read my eight books and they have been thousands that has come to me and said I Know exactly what's happening\nNow\nAnd I should point out that you know you did address this may be Kyle didn't hear it but there are no credible stories in your view of big but being responsible for recording people as far as you know\n[laughter] well no no killing them I I think I'm going okay there's\nThere's a story that John Green wrote about a prospect or that was taken in British Columbia where he took an affidavit from this man and he was sleeping in a sleeping bag and one of these ... grabbed his bag and started walking with him for hours and ended\nUp dumped put him in a cave and he was eventually escaped but he said he saw this family of big foot in the cave and they kind of watched him and he kind of watch them\nA it's a it's a really really good story to end the individual at the time sign an affidavit I followed greens lead and said this is a good way to document the stories I hear and that's kinda how it came came to pass\nI remember that story now yeah that is a good one is it there are some other killed in one of your books about a witness claiming to see a big boy type creature carrying a person\nThrough the forest\n... you know I don't think\nSo well there's this story out of Wyoming that I I don't put much credence in it because the people didn't come forward and they were doing something illegal but a group disappeared in Wyoming\nAfter

it\nAs it is you know I get the devour dozens of books per year I Can't think of anything I have read in the last five years\nThat affected me as profoundly as what we're about to discuss you know I saw a review of this book or months ago I knew we had to check it out and it exceeded all my expectations the subject is rebutting the writing is superb\nThe research is meticulous and this story this tragedy really touches a nerve in ways that I think we will explore over the next few hours per anyone who's not a student of naval history\nYou know the first time most of us probably heard of what little we know about the USS Indianapolis it can be traced to\nOne of the best scenes in the history of American movies is from blockbuster Spielberg movie jaws rubber jaws character went delivered a moving powerful slightly tipsy account of what motivated him to become a shark hunter\nI'm Lynn what do we start with you describe in a sort of the ... the ... version of what the world knows about the US's Indianapolis and then we'll go to Sarah to uh give us the version that that you guys have uncovered\nOkay that would be great um Indianapolis as Sarah mentioned was the fifth the Fifth Fleet plaques shift and I'm\nA small part that a lot of people don't know is that she was the flagship at the battle of now or where your father drove the landing craft and I'm\nIn the weeks leading up to the the actual invasion she was participating in the short on ... and during that time and march thirty first Nineteen forty five she was ... kamikaze\nNine men were killed twenty six injured and that was what really sent for on the faithful journey had that not happened she might have gone down in history as victorious flagship of the world war two specific theaters I'm Victoria said okay now as well as nine other major battle\nBut instead she went back to their island California for repairs and that's where she was on July sixteenth Nineteen forty five\nWhen general Leslie grows and the other leaders the Manhattan Project including President Truman\nDecided that they want us to spend the components of the atomic bomb little boy which would later ... to head to the forward areas and trim and did this a lot of uh a lot of people don't know that trim and did this before he even knew that he would use the bomb because\nAt that time uh everyone thought that there would be\nAn invasion of mainland Japan so\nIndianapolis was selected to transport the station of components of the bombs she did that a NATO record breaking run to a Pearl Harbor and then pushed on to penny an island where she dropped off the components of the atomic bomb\nAnd then two days after that on July twenty eighth Nineteen forty five she\nSet out on what was going to be a routine voyage across those things the from Guam to the Philippines and all my straight west down shot\nAnd right when she was in the middle of the specific or stays in the middle of the Philippines space on July thirty is Nineteen forty five to Fifteen minutes after midnight\nOr she intersected course with a Japanese submarine called I fifty eight commanded by lieutenant commander Moshe Sarah how she might have passionate of fire exposed torpedoes Indianapolis with two of them\nThe first one almost completely blew the fell off the shift Indianapolis the heavy cruiser\nThe second one hit or it and it shifts the vessel went down and twelve minutes and you know we've been talking longer than twelve minutes it was very very quick out three hundred men went down with the shift a\nLittle under nine hundred made it into the water alive and when they made it into the water and those who survived their wounds were very optimistic that they were going to be rescued and but uh they weren't and they spent five nights and four days in the water struggling to survive\nAnd ah as you mentioned earlier they've they fought madness they've fought the hydration they fought shark or eventually they fought each other because of the madness and that is the story that most people know about Indianapolis she was spotted completely\nAnd this and that is the story that most people know that Indianapolis she was spotted completely by accident on the next day on the fourth the fourth day after five nights and four days in the water and only three hundred and sixteen men survived\nSarah secrecy plays such an important part in this at every step of the way and it leads to tragedy threatened with tragic tragic results because of the secrecy of the what they were carrying and they continue to sort of continued over after they drop them off\nOr why don't you share with us the how secrecy a ... which obviously was necessary military necessity or lead to tragedy and how ... it probably interfered with your ability to get at the core of the story\nAbsolutely I mean there were multiple areas that help the Christian story that led to the demise of Indianapolis and ultimately the men being held off that fee for five days\nAnd you know first of which being how messages where transmitted across the Pacific during the war you know there\nWas the level of coding that had to be taken into consideration and you know one of the ships that\nIndianapolis was to report to when it arrived in the Philippines was admiral McCormack and the message he received was garbled\nAnd so you know protocol said that oh it didn't you know didn't come through clearly and no one asked for a repeat so they didn't even know Indian Indianapolis was supposed to be reporting to them you know that was one of the first thing [laughter] um so when she didn't show up they didn't know she was supposed to show up\nYou know um aside from that there was protocol that noncombatants shit arrival didn't have to be reported and so when she didn't arrive only tenet thought well I guess I don't have to report that either\nAnd so he took it upon himself not to say anything even though he knew the ship wasn't there and these were all put in place to protect our vessels during wartime but the secrecy of that and the protocols ultimately lead to her not being found you know and then beyond that\nYou know we had broken the Japanese code at this time and there were a message trafficking going across the Pacific and the Philippines the\nReporting you know various up in the area well none of that was related to captain McVeigh because they didn't want anyone to know that the coats had been broken and that we were using that\nAnd so yeah he should not have been there without an escort he should have had you know taking a step back Indianapolis was not you know made really for combat it was made to get to a scene or to a battle quickly and have guns\nAnd so she should've had something you know first of all that sold our second of all that had\nAny calmer ability armor to an arm or I\nMean she was part of the treaty cruisers so her armor was exceptionally sending compared to many of the newer shift and so that was one of the reasons why she's saying so quickly\nYou know so all of these things kind of came together to form the perfect storm\nAnd so much of that played into the secrecy on this mission and why she was out there and why this information and wasn't passed along to the captain who may have made different decisions knowing that there was a direct threat and his staff\nTold me this was it difficult to get the the the survivors to trust you I I Know there's been so many wrong stories in wrong conclusions made about what happened there then I Would think they might still be suspicious even decades later\nI think a big part of it they mentioned is that I had spent several years visiting with them and spending time with their families talking with them that you know\nWith no other interests other than learning their story\nAnd so they I think trusted me by the time that I actually wanted to start doing interviews and putting the story down on film or you know as a screenplay and eventually the book can lend as well when she came in we had this trust built in\nWith these men that they knew and genuinely wanted to tell the accurate story\nHowever heart and however long that would take we wouldn't tell the true story\nWell was it was amazing the uh how how widely you cast the net here um you know in creating real characters are you you you have to know these people a lot of the people who are characters of the book obviously didn't survives you're teaching them together I guess from people who did know them but\nUh you know may be among the most interesting is ... ... the guy who was commander the sub the sink the USS of Indianapolis a limb talk about him a little bit he's a he's a\nHe's not a are stereotypical Japanese commander\nThat try one of the things that we tried to do is really pulled back the land on the Indianapolis story because really the man or before the crash and not as it is to\nCircle back to him the man who ferry the atomic bomb aboard USS Indianapolis was an army name Robert an army major name Robert burning\nAnd he had spent the last couple of years after the war running down all of the material that they feared the Germans were using to try to develop their own atomic bombs\nAre on the continent of Europe so once that messing with completely and then burn and carrying components of little boys attending an island\nUm that is the final breathing better of the European and if the conflicts and so then right in the whole book we try to pull back that lands and bringing in a lot of other characters and world leaders and figures\nIncluding the Japanese point of view in addition to hush money over his head and for the call and tell me it was ... ...\nCommander and what we try to do storage where to\nWell it was it and then more sports that we've published after the war who first published in Nineteen fifty two and Japanese language\nAnd it was later published by Henry Holt in the fifties or here in America in English and it was really an examination of Japanese submarine warfare in World War two but written from men or ... point of view and there was a chapter on is devoted to Indianapolis\nBut because we were looking at the larger Pacific for in the end of the of World War two in general we were able to really develop his personality a lot he was the commander who cared for his men\nThere was a commander who was very very frustrated with the state of technology on Japanese submarines and really against protocol at the time because Japanese had a very autocratic top down military\nUm he went around banging on doors asking for radar and more technology for his that Marines because that makes that Marines didn't have radar right up until the end of the war and so he was very frustrated because he was saying a lot of his brother said commanders\nGo down to sell the grave for lack of technology they're carrying data why he had three sons um and eventually in addition to his\nUm [noise] book which was called fun\nUm we were also able to interview his granddaughter a and get even more information about his later life half before\nWell as we'll find out a little bit later he was kinda ticked off because the U.S Navy I mean do you took the extraordinary step of having him testify at a court martial for captain McVeigh and then\nThey didn't really want to hear his version of health things went but we'll we'll circle back around that I'm Sarah I Want to get to the moments right after these torpedoes slam into the side of the Indianapolis\nA chaos breaks out um\nYou know we we heard that clip from Robert showing the movie jaws saying that no signal was sent a note distress signal are not exactly true but sort of true why don't you pick up the story there tell us describe those next couple of chaotic moments after the torpedoes hit\nShore [noise] well it was just after midnight so you know the moon was behind clouds that had been an intermittent cloudy night and so and that was part of the reason why you know\nI don't know if we would say it's lucky for how she motive but clouds parted and the moon came out for just a moment and not for him to see the silhouette of the ship\nAnd so you know after it was struck\nThe power went out with the second torpedo and so there was no power on the ship they couldn't communicate over the first step see\nYou know the ... from the sound system and so there was no one to say abandoned ship you know over the speakers there was no one to tell people to report to battle stations\nThey had to pass that from mouth to mouth well this is a six hundred and ten foot long ship the great big ship so with the chaos happening and shipped thinking and twelve minute you have to imagine that compartments or flooding incredibly quickly you know the ship is starting to tilt\nFirst to the star bird and then it goes down by the bell\nSo men are being trapped inside the ship unable to fix tape from their compartments and you know Lynn and mentioned before they believe about three hundred men went down with the ship\nAnd even further to this because there wasn't any direct command able to be broadcast to the men people started abandoning ship very shortly after\nThe ship was torpedoed all the way until you know men went down with her\nAnd were able to escape so these men were spread out over a mile and a half is what they believe and you know those who went down on or went off on the ... the low side\nThey would have been with more of the supplies you know there were only twelve raft that they believe got off the ship 'em but you know standard protocol at that time was to go off the high side the port side well the majority of the men went off that side and there was no supplies so they weren't in raft they were\nYou know some weren't even in life jacket some were holding on to flotsam that they can find in the water as long as they could until they could get to someone who can help them you know fellow ship made or whomever\nAnd others had to just swim and tell a sailor would pass away and then everybody would help them take the life jacket off the debt sailor and put it on them\nI mean this was\nIncredibly chaotic so scary these are sixteen Seventeen and Eighteen year old that had just gotten on the ship not some of them not even three weeks or a month earlier you know they just went on board and right before the last mission\nThat really gone to any drills yet some didn't know how to swim and there and just thrown into the middle of the Pacific at midnight it's pitch black they're covered in oil because in a you know in an effort to save the ship but the last moment\nWe've kind of a written band actually released the fuel and to the water and so this is very very thick oil that can\nAnd it a written band actually released the fuel and to the water and so this is very very sick oil that can only be transferred with heat so it's like par on these men and they can't tell who anybody is they can barely breed they're swallowing it their vomiting\nThere at this point they're trying to stay alive some have injuries and they won't last much longer\nI'm you know they they say that those who have injuries and didn't really make it past the first day but the men who were able to escape without injuries were still suffering from the early stages of dehydration because of vomiting this fuel oil\nSo no one's really great shape you know by the time the sun comes up the first morning but they're very optimistic that rescue is going to come because they believe\nThere is a shift in the Philippines waiting for their arrival\nAnd there was a ... you know there were attempts to get a signal out to just didn't go I guess they they they they they weren't successful things that the\nUm I guess within a couple of days it becomes clear that the new ones coming or if they're coming there they're going to have a hard time finding it because as as you describe in the book they're spread out all over the place and in these big waves are pushing the group's further further apart right I'm\nLynn maybe you want to talk about that a little bit in this context there's incredible acts of heroism that you describe from some of these sailors who were doing their best to help everybody else and then at the same time there's some incredibly selfish acts of brutality that happen as well\nThat's right um there were incredible act of heroism and as you mentioned in as Sarah mentioned the current they move about one mile an hour in that area and they also move in these sort of giant Eddie ... or world if you will\nAnd so two men that we'd be together in the morning could be a mile apart by afternoon and and all the time these twelve ... twelve some days it's it's clear it's glass says on the day in and rescue but Sunday's there these twelve ... twelve along with these current so\nOver time over the course of the the ... five nights and four days the man become spread out over a twenty five mile area and I'm One of the rescue pilot later wrote that from altitude\nI read too plain looking down on a situation like that that had a one man would be the size of a human hair theme in cross section or diameter from across the room so basically they were invisible\nAnd you mentioned acts of heroism max cowardice one ... one real hero was I'm\nA captain parks he was the commander of the Marines detachment that was aboard the ship and\nThe largest swimmer group and the water's TV that as Sarah mentioned the men in the water we're spread out initially over a mile and a half and then they just got further and further apart with those currents the largest group that had nothing but life jackets was about four hundred men\nAnd kept in park within that group and he really spent\nTwenty four hours a day trying to keep them in together the only resource that that group of men had besides their life jackets which not even all of them had life jacket\nWith a single line that was about a hundred feet long and so they form that line into a circle and the men were to tie themselves to the line\nAnd captain park would uh\nHelp the man that didn't have life jackets and several times he would get a life jacket from a dead sailor and then give it to another man who needed a life jacket and he did this numerous times\nAnd he would round up the stragglers and encourage everybody until finally on the third day the succumb to hallucinations and and he died\nAnd when he died that group became very desperate because they thought wow if the brave man can't make it how are we all can make\nAnd then in terms of cowardice um you had precisely the opposite happening with with and then being a selfish\nSend men or even officers taking place on a raft for example when there were wounded men who needed the place I'm worse\nThere was also the ah in some of the rap group they had some supplies and they're with hoarding um applies and and of water especially\nHere's a fundraising\nNebraska governor son was mugged near the family home in Omaha Roscoe Rick good\nNews twice and our

Indianapolis namesake submarine when she was commissioned\nBill went over and tried to talk to ... and he said they didn't believe me then they won't believe me now and he wanted nothing to do was talking with him you know but he did what I was actually pretty incredible as he actually wrote a letter you know kind of flashing forward a few years to the exoneration effort ... wrote a letter\nExplaining his side of the story and saying that the captain should never have been found guilty and you know kind of did what he could do in order to help exonerate this man\nYou tell the story of a book about a Nineteen sixty reunion of the survivors and captain McVeigh shows up and he's not exactly sure how he's going to be received by by the crew because you know he was court martialed um he received\nAs you noted the book at these terrible letters from a family you didn't feel he'd been punished enough\nAnd um you know I'm really you'll tripping him for years afterward so he shows up at this like sixty event and how was he received a limb\n[noise] he was received with open arms he have very much dreaded going to this reunion in Nineteen sixty he hadn't seen these men [noise] except for just a couple of them but most of these men he had not seen since Nineteen forty five right after the court marshal\nSo they decided to have a reunion and they have their reunion in the ships named safe city Indianapolis, Indiana\nAnd kept in the day was dreading it that when he got there they actually um travelled out a dozens and dozens of survivors and their wives met him at the airport and they formed\nTo receding lines are across the tarmac because they didn't have debt ways the way we do now they would they would just stay with the plane right on to the ramp and so they formed two lines and when captain make they got to the bottom of the aircraft loading stairs\nSomeone shouted attention on deck and everybody's snap to attention and then they began to chair and the clapping and parents came to his eyes and eat and he couldn't believe that they were receiving him so warmly and that continued through the entire reunion we can\nTalk a little bit of difficulty in getting materials you talked about going through archives and records to share with me did you run into road blocks that you could not get past than and if so what were they\nActually one of the the documents that really helped us paint the biggest picture was the quarter of inquiry documents and\nYou know I had tried for years Lynn had you know come into the picture and joined me in this effort to get a copy of this document and the reason it was so important was that it was really the first recorded testimony of any of the survivors right after the sinking so you know just days after their\nRescued there in the hospital in Guam and their testimonies are taken and so\nWe tried everything to get these documents and his actually this specific report and we would come back you know oh it's last forever oh one you know we got one copy of it and it was entirely redacted and you know freedom of freedom of Information Act\nShould've allowed us to have this and then you know we contacted the the source again and our contact said well we don't have an an redacted version doesn't exist and so\nInterestingly enough you know a friend or actually a young man who became a friend was the grandson of the rescue pilot who landed in the water and same fifty three men his\nHis grandson was actually um\nI was an inspector general sorry I'm trying to remember is titled he's inspector general works with the navy and he was actually the person who got us this document and this kind of showed us really\nTestimonies of what happened not only when the ship was torpedoed and those final moments but what was happening in the water because in the court marshal they did not allow any of the testimony about what took place in the actual water because they didn't you know that would impact how\nConvey was relieved and so it was kept strictly to what took place when the ship was torpedoed\nAnd the events leading up to that so this new court of inquiry document was so important because you know Seventy years later stories can change your stories can be impacted by other stories but this was the purest form of what really took place not only when the ship sank but in the water for those five nights and four days\nWhen you talk about the lights immediately after they were rescued what it was like for the survivors where they were taken um I I Would assume more of them died after because of their injuries and exposure\nWell a few did die and and if you can imagine how awful that was not only for the men themselves for their families to know that they had actually made it all the way to rescue only to die of their exposure and their injuries um\nSo I think three hundred and twenty were actually rescued is that correct Sara yes three hundred and twenty were rescued but only three hundred and sixteen ultimately survive because they were taken to base hospitals around the Philippines see eventually converging on Guam\nWhere they had um some\nTime to recover before they had to give their testimony\nAnd then they went aboard the USS homeland homeland ... which was an escort terrier and they actually landed in our home city of San Diego where they were actually participated in a parade\nAnd then a very quickly they went home a\nCop buses and trains back to their hometowns comes in and they got out of the navy some of them had survivors leave and then got out of them stayed and made careers of the navy [noise]\nUm and you know this was the greatest generation so that that majority of them and they just kind of put this behind them they went on to have careers as engineers and fishermen and everything you can think of police officers\nThat there were those who could not hold a job and there were those who became alcoholic and um had many many struggles\nAnd almost to a man none of them talked about it and not even to their families some they held it in for years and years and years and I'm I'm for sixty years um but\nMostly they didn't talk about that today that would be a lot different I think people would be out trying to get a book deal or a movie deal or something like that but these men were different\nI think about that though Robert show a character in jaws you know if you kept that story bottled up he becomes a short cut her as a result of being one of those guys that's very moving scene and that was great\nHe becomes a short cut her as a result of being one of those guys and I'm a that's a very moving scene at it and that was great I was going to use that clip anyway I was really glad to see the coverage in the book of Sarah did you always have in mind keeping that in there\n[noise] [noise] well yeah I had to really you know when when I got across the country talking to groups about that story in the book you know one of the things that really\nComes out every time is that most people learned about this story from Josh so it's an essential part of the stories history\nIs that you know the public learned about it this way and interestingly enough some of the children of the survivors actually first heard about it and that their father was involved in it by watching jobs you know they came home\nThat really counts I came home saw the movie\nOr really impacted by it and especially the thin and\nO W two three five five one seven\n\n\nSarah share with me your thoughts when you heard the news I think it was last year that the ah Indianapolis had been found a through this a mission funded by Paul Allen\nActually it was about four in the morning when I received a phone call from bill Tony who was that gentleman I mentioned earlier the commander of Indianapolis\nAnd you know bill was contacted by the navy and he called me and it's in there they found the ship and\nI didn't know what he was talking about it for in the morning [laughter] and so you know dating my faculty and you realize what was going on very quickly and was astonished I mean this was something that several people before\nThe petrol group which has the vessel that were ... responsible for finding the shipping and there's been several attempts than they were the first one to be successful\nAnd what was interesting about it they said you have three hours before we released his information in the press so go ahead and call the survivors so villain I spent the next\nThree hours of calling the survivors up and being able to share with them the news that their ship and found that was a pretty incredible experience to hear their take on all of it\nWhat's the reaction in general\n[noise] it was really very somber was most of them I couldn't believe it actually happened and that it happened in their lifetime what [laughter]\nMostly reverent and then there was a young man by the name of a fan Lopez he was a sailor and Indianapolis in the day the ship sank hit a really good day playing dice with his buddies\nAnd so he wanted to know if they would go down and find his money stuck on winning [laughter] you know across the board it was general you know respect and reverence for this story but yeah there was a ... a couple of funny quotes here and there from the guys that you know they're always sailors that hurt [noise]\nAn inland you know we've heard a little bit about road blocks put up a to the information they uh you know where they were not entirely helpful at every step of the way to get the story told what about reaction to the book since it's come out from the navy\nBoy we've been very very gratified by the reaction care is um an admiral named Hancock who is the director of naval history and heritage can end\nAnd we make contact with admiral ... at the survivors reunion and I believe it was funny it ten or twenty six ... and we can while they're we'd really like to have your report and your help on this\nAnd I'm being helpful and directing at various resources\nBut if you can imagine spending real work at the heart that you've done to try to honor these men and honor the legacy and how the whole story of this shit and and get the entire history\nAnd draw a new analysis that very thing that happened in the story you can imagine taking that and then sending it to the director of naval history and heritage and saying hey sir hey admiral what do you think\nA point where we nervous about that but he really really has endorsed the story and a movement that his full court since he saw\nAnd they said that that that he really rarely has endorsed this story and and went to his full court since he saw what his what we came up with\nWell I Know Sarah has an award winning documentary film about it sure seems like it would make a great a movie um a full big screen movie any thoughts about that\nWe are actually working on that right now so stay tuned\nOkay we'll take a couple of calls I've got some other questions but the west of the Rockies Jerry in ... California has a personal connection to the story high during\nYa doing my father was a on the ship was the first one or the ... to rescue the savers in the water\nAnd I still have the one car being used and shoot the sharks and stuff you know and I never saw my father ... years past ... years go by never saw him cry and do you try to talk about that story\nTo maintaining key a key on the USS ... do el or that that that they know the name of the chef ...\n... and I don't remember it's on it's on Chen stone and I was just thinking about that before I'd call not a damn what was the name of the ship but he said he ship was the first one the whole man\nAnd he was talking to you it was ... you know he tried to tell the story a little bit and my father never talk to buy any of that he kept all that you know all those years you know\nHe was like a you know if you're part of the ethos of that generation that\nOh yeah yeah he was in World War two and Korea or he was going to drink donors may first class you know but he ... he was a police optional ... who's officer for Thirty years but there is an incredible story to my absolutely\nHeroic can go into harm's way like that and I'm happy with the ... the ... that one interesting story is that they can ... after the death\nBut it's considered to be a coward by some of his men and indeed when they arrived on the same he didn't really know what he was getting into and and he needed at at that had been found probably by submarine but they didn't know what exactly had happened\nAnd there was um a sailor spotted a large shark in the water and he said look at that fish\nBoiled fish is another word for it torpedo and head of the cats and ... he tried to get everybody out of there and\nHe sat down and all I had full we're going to get outta here we're going to leave the scene and his officers actually need need and lock the captain in his state room and continued with Iraqis have it'd be interesting if your dad this had been on that shit\nThanks Jerry appreciate it wild card line run and used in the morning on\nGood morning ah my father was also in the navy and he was on a destroyer escort Cecil Jay do while he was twenty six years old he was the Ensign doctor\nCan what's interesting over forty years I had opened up\nOne of his uh I guess just she just you know volunteers member washed and I found unbelievable and eye witness accounts a letter of the eye witness accounts from the doctor's point of view of the rescue of the survivors\nI've got the letter in front of me it stated August fifth Sunday at sea\nAnd it's a phenomenal letter I think the uh women would love to see this to read this it talks about the sharks it talks about the fact that the polls these guys up in the sharks off their rear ends\nShowing 'em up with the with a line given a morphine given him penicillin\nThis is an unbelievable letter from the view of the doctor and it was my dad\nAnd he has been that some of the reunions but never did talk about this but the fact that I found this letter it's about five six pages of the whole account its its history its historical\nI Love my fair share this with uh either young ladies if I can get a get an information and now\nI'll tell you what Ron why don't you hold on and Donna oh are are down there will get the information for you will pass it on to win and Sarah and a thank you for calling appreciate you sharing that I I'd like to see that myself thank you so how many how many of the survivors are still with us Sarah\nThere's fourteen still living\nClass I don't assume that they still have a gatherings do they\nActually you know um we've gone to several events all over the country with them and they they do have reunions every July and Indianapolis I'm\nAbout five or six I think six came last year and it is dwindling but you know we'll have an event on the USS Hornet on Veterans Day and to the survivors will be there for that so you know the the youngest is Ninety One but\nThey're still sailors that heart and I think think an arm wrestle man when\nYou know it's a generational thing well we're we're hearing these descriptions both from the two of you in from the callers about um how how these men reacted to it keeping bottled up inside you're right it would be different now people would be out there on Dr phil or or or getting a book deal or something but keeping it inside\nI don't know if it's entirely healthy but it certainly has changed when you agree\nYes absolutely and I I Do wonder whether maybe it was and how ... how the er I I don't know I think a bank that generation may have been a lot more stable than we are now but uh it is an interesting contrast isn't it and then I think it has to do with the\nThe um ... and in the media that we have today and they share everything instantly all the time and that wasn't the case back then", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "Yankton", "day": "22"}
