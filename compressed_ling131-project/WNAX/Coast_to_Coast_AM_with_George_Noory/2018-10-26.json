L. A. and the generic version of it ... [laughter]\nThis is a black box drug that was used as a first line of defense or something like food poisoning\nAnd from the moment that drug was injected within days Ralph both physical and mental condition began to deteriorate and there are many many many cases of this that can be found on the Internet\nAnd when you see it begin to deteriorate physically and mentally did you notice that change with him\nAbsolutely within a day or two he and one of his medical school room mates had done research\nAnd the changes I noticed or his anxiety began to increase it began to complain of strange pains that he had never had before and this began they slow deterioration that I Would call something like this doing this whole lot of the human body\nAnd at this point\nRoss took his life\n[noise] over the course of a early in twenty Seventeen he was I brought him back home to St Louis and he made three attempts on his life\nTo take themselves out of this horrific condition that was bringing him intense pain and from what I understand the form of anxiety times a hundred [noise]\nUm and on his last attempt tea was successful and um [noise] I did hold his hand and was there and he passed away\nHow old was he just he was twenty [noise] and how did he took his life\nHe tried with two other attempts that were unsuccessful\nBut on the last attempt a he used a gun and at that time I wasn't there he sent me a text that really began the marking over here but the tax came to me that exactly eleven eleven\nAnd that's where we're going to talk about tonight the ... cities that have occurred for you especially after this tragedy occurred I mean I remember being in St Louis when I heard about this\nAnd it was it was a shocking situation for anybody to have to go through a it is my biggest nightmare of course as a parent\nTo lose your child before before you go and I could only what you were going through at that time with this kind of pain but the synchronous cities then started so tell us a little bit about the name in ... and then twenty two which is the name of your book\n[noise] well I I looked at that tax George again and again and again and in some way I've found solid and connecting with that last tax\nAnd as I began to stare at it again and again it occurred to me I Love and eleven well Ralph was born on two twenty two and so the number twenty two began to resonate with me from that was the beginning point I Would say that the nation\nI Want to tell our audience does a little ... of the year when I was talking with Jonathan several weeks ago about this situation in his book and of course the tragedy that occurred now he had mentioned that you don't use his son roles\nUm was ah you know just a delightful young guy and he's he's used to name Gabriel of course you took that name as well did you not\nI did Ralph's middle name was Gabriel and so I changed my middle name to Gabriel I felt they Eunice and no one is in doing that it was symbolic was spiritual and I'm Rob me significant meaning\nAnd on and I was talking to Jonathan and I said to my dad's name was ... and uh he was born on February twenty seconds which is the same date to Ralph's was born in these weird ... started coming up all over again and Jonathan's eyes just opened up and everything else\nDo you believe that your son is Cindy ... messages Jonathan through these strange occurrences\n[noise] I I Do believe that I I've always been a rational analytical regimented person and in my personal life in my profession and Avi aiding [noise] and\nWith the pain of what happened\nIt began to open up my thought process and I said wait a minute there's just got to be more and I took down the wall of what was my personal rationality\nAnd began to read I began to study a I've been studying the ancient ... text in Hebrew I've looked through other religions and mystical world\nAnd I do believe that in finance is communicating with me\nWhat message do you think ...

behind the car and you look at a license plate didn't you see twenty two there to do these numbers pop up all over the place\nYou know they do pop up to me and at times I think they're popping up and at times I think they're not coincidences [laughter] so I really created a word for myself out of coincidences I'm calling them coincide and says [laughter]\nBecause on a recent trip to Los Angeles

linked up at coast to coast am dot com we're talking about his latest work called in for twenty two about the life of his son roped in synchronous cities that have occurred since rough tragically passed on\nJonathan I Know how tough this was for you when this tragedy occurred how're you doing now\nGeorgia I'm definitely doing better [noise] one of the things that's really helped me to come to terms with how I think of the finite and the Internet\nOne of the things that's really help to me is to come to terms with how I think of the finite and the infinite and in my own simple explanation I don't think I'm anything unique I think each of us as human beings has disability [noise]\nBut I think of the brain as the infinite zone and I think of the body as the finite zone and for the anatomical side of this the brainstem connects the brain to the rest of the body\nAnd so I think that anything that we think about is infinite and once it goes down through the brainstem it becomes finite and so in meditative thought in thinking to higher levels of spirituality we all have that ability and the infant its own were each of us is a combination of the infinite and the finite\nWhat did you think of the afterlife prior to this happening\n[laughter] I have to say that I I question that I didn't think about it much\nAnd ever since Ralph passed away I set out on a journey to try and understand more of it which is what led me to read books and to be more open minded and to be more observant of the things that were occurring in front of me\nThe goals really didn't get to the second book three strange occurrences that occurred I Want to go through each one and have you explain to us what happened tell us about the drivers situation what happened there\nAbout eight months ago I had a gun in a new verb from downtown St Louis I was getting dropped off and I told the driver a funny story and he thought it was funny enough that he wanted to repeat it and I said you know I don't have a problem with it tell anybody you want\nAnd he looked at me in a very strange stare and said\nI'll just tell them Ralph set it off and I looked\nAnd I looked at him he said what's wrong I said where did you come up with that name [laughter] he said I don't know and I said well you know anybody named morale he said\nNo she how did you come up with it he said it popped in my head\n[laughter] I Love that about one with the balloons what happened there\nWell the day Ralph passed away he left me a two mylar balloons a smiling balloon Anna thank you balloon in the morning and after he passed away I decided I wasn't going to touch the balloons I just couldn't do it\nAnd the mylar balloons state inflated for many months two three four five months and one friday I went to sleep I got up Saturday morning and the balloons were both down [laughter] I didn't think much about it\nUntil the following Monday and the cemetery called me and said we just want to let you know that the gravestone on friday was set for your son\n\nGets timing in secrecy and then you had an occurrence with some strange bedroom lights\n[noise] well I moved out of our home rather rapidly after he passed away and I went back up into the room and I turned off the lights and I was leaving in the house was empty\nAnd the lights went back on and I and I had a friend with me the criminalize back\nBut the light switch back down and put it back up put it back down and they went off the lights went back on this happened two or three times until the lights finally stayed off and at that time I left the house and just let it be\nI I chose not to think more about it other than that had never happened before\nIt was a point where you got angry about all this\n[noise] you know I've been asked them many times and I don't seem to be able to get angry about it I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing [noise] um [noise] I don't I don't fault Tam I\nHave struggled to try to understand how the generic drug industry in the United states has effectively shielded themselves from any and all liability from every American citizens\nWhile they're they're protected by a federal law aren't they\nIs there is there is a federal law in place and I'm not an attorney but the the outcome of the law is that generic drugs effectively have a liability shield around them\nJonathan was was we're all subject to depression prior to the food poisoning\n[noise] you know Ralph was a very happy go lucky kid he was very popular in his class he was a straight a student ah frequently making jokes he was just if you ask because friends they would portray just the most on us\nUm you know likeable young man you could you could think of\nNow to go to the hospital for food poisoning that's pretty serious because most people who have food poisoning stand like take some stuff uh you know they're going to the bathroom and often they have to they don't go to the hospital ... what were the symptoms for him to go to the auto I\nI think I think he was vomiting proof usually there was a lot of blood and he was out with his friends who are all medical school students as well and they unanimously decided he needed to go to the emergency room and that's how he got there\nHow did you get that cool\n[noise] well I got the call after the medication had been given to him about the next morning and he said to me immediately I feel different something has happened\nOkay let's go to some culture for you and let's go to Patty in Seattle, Washington question story Hi Patty\nI ah I've I've got a little story

Marion in all of that because it does come up a lot\nWhat exactly are rogue planet how can plan at me wandering in the universe between sellers systems in galaxy\nThere certainly are fees wandering planets rope planets and they come about from the same sort of reason that we think that planet nine is out there they certainly formed around a star just like our planet stood and then probably a couple of planets got too close to each other\nAnd one of them got tossed out usually the smaller one gets tossed out by the bigger one\nAnd in our case we think that that happened a planet nine but planet nine didn't get tossed quite far enough so now it's just hanging around on the outer edge but if if it had gotten a little bit closer to say Jupiter it could've been completely injected from our solar system\nIn which case it would just be wandering through space and so it is absolute certainty that these sorts of things exist there's no question about it\nWhen people ask me about ... that's always a funny one because of course that's a conspiracy theory that there's a giant planet that's going to destroy the earth that NASA knows about and won't tell anybody and\nThings like that and I try very hard to explain to people that this is just crazy YouTube Internet conspiracies stuff that actually makes no sense\nExplains for a general world audience why something massive like a planet cannot sneak up on earth and the inner planets with out every astronomer on knowing\nSomething like ... I don't know what the latest crazy conspiracies are saying how big it is but occasionally over to headline that it's going to destroy the earth on some particular date because it's screaming into the inner solar system [laughter]\nUsually if you do just a very quick calculation you realize if it were really coming it would be so bright\nThat you could see it with binoculars every person who owns binoculars on the planet could go look and see it coming we wouldn't be able to have a massive conspiracy keeping it secret\nAnd they would have been visible to every backyard astronomer with the whole scope for the past decade and it would have been visible to every professional astronomer for the past fifty years if all of these people are in on the conspiracy I don't know anywhere else were that many people are all keeping a secret from the rest of the world\nIs something ten times the mass of our earth where even out how to play out in the ... rebel what would be the obvious observation all changes perturbation in our solar\nIn the inner part of our soldiers would be an apartment in the planets that we know of planning\nChanges perturbation in our solar system\nIn the inner part of our soldiers are being apart meaning the planets that we know of but it has no effect whatsoever on the inner planets and you can figure out why it's ten we actually think more like seven o seven times amounts of the earth and it is five hundred times further away from the sun and the earth is\nJupiter on the other hand is three hundred times the mass of the earth and it's only five times further from the sun than the earth is to Jupiter has a tremendous effect on the planets in the solar system and nobody sits around and he's worried the Jupiter is certainly going to come destroy us\nPlanet nine is really far away and quite a bit smaller than Jupiter's it's affecting it's really minimal one effect that it does have is that over four billion years is capable of slowly tilting the orbits of the planets but even that is just a very very minor effect\nIf you're going to Hawaii in November and maybe you'll be successful this time would it be possible to talk with you in December about what you might find or you have to wait to do papers for\nThe way the process works is we'll go there in November will collect the data it'll take us several weeks two a month to process the data from November then we're back there first of December and will do the same thing and so\nIf we have found what we're looking for we will know it within a month or two of collecting those data and then at that point we'll announce the existence as soon as we can confirm it we will have found it will go back to telescope and double checked that it's really there\nAnd then will announce its existence right of ways we won't make the world wait\n[laughter] January twenty nine teen it is possible that three years after twenty sixteen January when we did our first interview about it that you might be able to confirm it\nIt's possible I'm always very optimistic Constantine fatigue and my partner and all this is always much more pessimistic and so you know you should take my optimism with a grain of salt and then take his pessimist than with a grain of salt he thinks it'll take us another ten years I think it will take us one year so maybe that means still another three years but I'm Still very optimistic\n[laughter] there you have it during an right from the man is discovered this high in terms of those ...\nOf those half a dozen bodies that are all kind of gathered together at where the guy prevailed in a cloud in that area and I think one of the most important part of doing the research\nProject with the scientists that I have no confusion\nAbout the fact that if there was something massive\nThat we're trying to move into our solar system what it's called the inner solar system\nFrom a mercury Assad and mercury out to wear a now Neptune and Iran is our biggest put a been dumbed down to a door planet out in the hype about\nThat there is nothing they could be out coming this way and that wouldn't be picked up by everyone everywhere because gravity that that's the thing about gravity in math and I it it would have impact on every single thing and\nThat's the way I would've loved those Zacharias itching to have been alive to talk with the professor I Wonder if he would have been able to convince him about that new bureau\n... well I don't know how much time we have left but I can start my own work that I had a discussion a face to face eye to eye with is that right yeah and maybe what I'll do have that for conversations that lend it because it's really quite a story\nOkay we can do that too but it's a great story and it's really exciting that even if\nShe doesn't agree and some of the theories that are out there the fact that there's this extra planted out there does echo what some of these people have said long before anybody even knew about this stuff\nWell the idea that that could be a massive plan it but when you read what say about the ... through scholar I did that translation that\nWe're a car and Don and you

with climate change Linda\nYeah you know with Thirty years ago and Nineteen eighty eight when the world with really kind of waking up seriously for the first time to global climate change\nAnd real potential dire consequences in the future if we didn't get on top of the expanding methane and carbon dioxide blankets around the earth\nAnd at the United nation many countries especially those worried about being islands and which sea level rise could flood and displaced populations they came together to form the inter governmental panel on climate change also known as the P. C. C.\nAnd the objective was to provide data about earth changes on an ongoing basis\nTo help project some of these impacts on world politics and the economy\nBy twenty Fifteen only three years ago and the Paris Agreement on climate change\nMany small island nation were so worried about disappearing under ... rising sea levels that the PCC committed to doing a twenty Eighteen report written by Ninety One scientist from forty countries\nThe question was humans to restrict global warming to two degrees Celsius or one point five degrees Celsius below pre industrial levels the October twenty Eighteen IPC the answer is\nStricter at one point five degrees Celsius\nTo to point seven degrees Fahrenheit ... the the new target to achieve and hold in place by twenty thirty that's only a decade from now\nBecause if we don't if I planet continues to warm up above that limit of one point five degrees Celsius\nScientists warn that will be a catastrophe\nGot math die off they will accelerate the coral reefs and if they die that kills off other marine species dependent upon the coral weather will become more violent and wins flooding rains and devastating wildfires\nWeather extremes will cause famine and fighting over land food and fresh water\nAnd pain level rise will force more and more island income populations to move but to where the twenty Eighteen IPC reports that the next ten years\nBetween now and twenty thirty are crucial and in order to keep the one point five degrees Celsius limit nations must cut greenhouse gas emissions by almost half of what they were in twenty ten solar wind and other renewable energy sources must replace\nAs much as sixty seven percent of today's electricity\nCoal it as an industry around the world it must be phased out\nThey're coordinating lead author or the IPC the report says quote\nThere's kind of a head in the sand mentality that has taken ... now in Washington\nWhich seems to pretend that this climate change threat does not exist but this was widely knowledge in the defense community meaning the Pentagon as recently as three years ago and twenty Fifteen consequences\nHe is professor drew Janelle PHD professor of earth sciences in the earth and sciences division at Duke University and he joins us now from Durham North Carolina\nCould you please give me the top side places in the United states where water is coming in and flooding is already making people move\nI Would say those are Florida Alaska and around the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland and Virginia and Louisiana\nSo those would probably be the top of the United states\nAnd where it would be the five top nation in the world that are now Ireland and other places that are most impacted by the level right\nAround the world unfortunately all too many very low lying countries and that's a large part of why we have to report those countries want to the United nations to investigate a lower warming target thinking that\nTwo degrees was probably not sufficient to protect them those are most of the islands in the Pacific also ... and the Indian Ocean many Caribbean countries\nAnd then there are very low lying countries like Bangladesh where the bulk of the population changed very close to the level of Nigeria has huge populations have red hair she level but you know sodas most of the world trying to the United states also has an enormous populations are right at the coast\nAnd where in Alaska\nIn Alaska you have an interesting problem where it's it's a combination of the sea levels and melting ice and the ice protected the shorelines from the waves from the ocean\nAnd without the ice the wage can reach the shore and more easily and the waves are higher because of rising sea levels so he's so a lot of coastal communities along the west coast and the very straight\nArea many of them are already having to be evacuated and move fire cramped so it's not so much the north slope but that's how the west coast\nAnd who is paying for that\nI Believe it's a combination of federal and state governments\nAlready moving people in Alaska from flooding to higher ground and use that happening in Louisiana Florida North Carolina as well\nThere has not been so much\nHe is that happening in Louisiana Florida North Carolina as well\nThere is not been so much for your evacuation of the coast there's been more what used to be rare flooding events that are now becoming quite common I think that there are likely to have to be evacuation in the next couple of decades of at least some places\nThere's an island does not to speak for example between Maryland and Virginia\nMore than half of it was already gone suddenly change the water come up\nThrough the drains skin to Charleston South Carolina and Virginia where new some flooding that went very rare as it comes so commonplace that governments have had to put up marker so that motorists country how deep the flooding is it's so routine then Florida it's been some of the worst\nFlooding of streets in the southeast part of the state\nHas become fairly routine as he level rise has continued and we've seen an acceleration because both the Greenland\nAnd Antarctica ice sheets are melting more rapidly than most expected just a decade to cope and dump more water into the ocean unfortunately what we've been seeing over the past several decades since we started to generate these projections from computer models\nAnd then watch the models has often been too conservative and things are happening faster than the models project\nCan you give an example of what has been dramatic compared to the computer model\nOne thing was the boss of sea ice in the Arctic went like two or three times faster than the models protect us\nIs the Arctic had melted two to three times faster than the computer's projected already by twenty Eighteen he's that a harbinger of the fact that he likely they would warming and melting ice will keep increasing faster like what happened in the Arctic\nWe've been observing from satellite that the melting of the Greenland ice sheet has been accelerating\nShow that is definitely a worry\nThat is extremely challenging problem to figure out exactly how this massive she might become de stabilized based on say melting from the top with water slipping down through cracks in the ice sheet and lubricating the bit below\nYou know we worry because the warming has been so fast in the Arctic that the acceleration will continue\nAnd we're speaking in October of twenty eight teams what would you project we will be seeing more dramatic weather event between twenty Eighteen and twenty thirty\nLess rainfall in the west increasing water scarcity greater probability of drought crater five foot of high fire conditions and we have flooding in the east as you get more extreme heavy rainfall events and the more heat waves everywhere around the country\nChurch's school Donald firehouses release stations anywhere people together

difficult to explain it felt like to me it wasn't for now\nAt that moment it was for something that was being given to me but I wouldn't remember any of it afterwards but it was for some time in the future that I was supposed to recall this information because it was like it was being given to me but I couldn't decipher it\nDid you have do any sub text in your mind or your soul about who would be doing this and why for the future\nNo the only thing I couldn't think of was that it may because in my past experience with ever since I was a child I've had psychic dreams\nDreams of having relationships with an entity that was giving the instructions I can describe the entity to you as a very thin\nVery white pale density I couldn't see his face all I Know it was very skinny it hadn't very long fingers\nHow many I don't know how many fingers that had it could have had five it could have had three I just remember one finger because I had the feeling that it was touching me with one finger and it just freaks me out and that doesn't mean I remember the environment being very\nLuminous very white almost to where he was going to end your eyes that I remember that being the strangest thing about it I was standing before it it was sitting in a very\nLarge thrown like chair but it was so then it seemed like a rope would've just dangling from mid air with Robie arms and it was just really creepy\n... you have this as a repeating dream yes and\nThe ... that you were describing need stream center is it possible that this very white being is in fact a reptile snake\nI got more that it was more like in in fact than a snake because it had a texture to it ... it was like\nYou know what I interject wings look like they're kind of transparent but you can see those veins or whatever and I threw it when I Lived in Florida when I was a kid we lived there for a short time in Jacksonville\nAnd I was always outside and I love collect the animals and things like that but there are a huge praying mantis as they would hang out on the bushes and the same boat arms and the shape of its neck and its body\nAre you standing in front of the praying mantis light and are you standing in front of it and it is in some sort of a crowd or sitting position\nI Want to say at the city condition because by the this big huge thrown like chair that its feet and it tasted very very very large\nAnd so this is perhaps an eight foot tall praying mantis\nPossibly could be\nAnything specifically coming into your head from it as you stand there\nI think I can smell it I think it smells like rotting wood or something to that nature like consented to the nose\nDo you have a sense that there's any kind of clothing or garment\nNo I don't think there was any clothing\nAnd the caller that is the ... just in front of you\nKnow very pale almost\nLike albino Gary pale\nAnd there are praying mantis that can be white\nTunnel think I've ever thing what\nDo you see anything in the I\nI don't

terrified to look at them but I had a feeling that this entity was in ... something to me because I wasn't afraid he was almost like it was giving the instructions very strange I don't remember boy it was almost as if it was ... ethic\nAnd on the being the praying mantis essence seem to be glowing like a sure why\nIt wasn't glowing had modeled skin was Barry White you can tell that it it had a lot of texture\nYou know if it was why it had like ... old I Would say you know how they would be like model skin like someone who had struggles are almost like an albino salamander skin\nIt sounds like you're describing it ripped Chileans skin not a praying mantis skin\nTexture was like that yeah\nBut the swarm was like a praying mantis students at\nThat time I Would describe it because of the arms they were in ... and they were long that you could tell that they were joining could very strangely ad I reached puberty I remember I started having a lot of glowing pain\nAt one point I did find a spot on my boy it was like a puncture area that blistered I just got ... that maybe they were doing something with me to recover storm or something\nBased on everything that you have experience with the praying mantis well would you speculate could be coming further\nI think everything is speeding up now\nSomething about to happen that the feeling I get I get this feeling of urgency I get this feeling of it's too late to do anything about the current situation and something it's coming to either fix it or maybe help China that I don't know\nBut whatever it was you would put into the

me from the ocean I wasn't surprised when I saw that film or the Indonesian tsunami that killed so many people\nWho watch since all of the nominees and flooding\nI have a feeling something to do with the rotation of the earth it there's gonna be like a shift or a jolt kind of like you take a glass of water and you accidentally knock your elbow and the water splashes out right from the ram under glass that's the feeling I get from that I Am the foreboding feeling\nThat everything is going to get more violent and whether\nHe is now um\nLast night ... well it is and things keep being more when they started with the issue\nOf uh I was asking\nPeople if they had had any kind of childhood out of body in the ages four to six a which is that meaning to me how many people have been provoked by that\nThat seemed to overlay the appearance of whatever the white we'll call it foggy smokers smoky fog that his period in my office twice\nThat led to my asking for a whether people had had these kinds of foggy white stuff\nAnd that led to Charles hazard and other even mailers who are saying that they're not the only person last night on my YouTube channel I had a dialogue with my audience\nAbout has anybody whether they're in a duck the an experience or meditate or out they had any insight about water a lot of water affecting the planet between now and twenty twenty six\nAnd that was a year that had been presented to me by a real whistle blower science we said that ah he worked on a project to having to do with this exact time period between twenty Eighteen and twenty twenty six\nIn which there could be some either a natural cycle or something that is going to now it's like what Charles hazard when he was saying I feel like it has to do with the rotation of the earth that there's going to be like a shift or a joke\nWhen it would cause soon armies and tremendous amounts of flooding\nAnd I have had now several emails I'm going to be doing stories on them\nAbout exactly this kind of thing and raising the question could there be a natural strain cycle interacting with planets in our solar system that could relate to know is flood that has written about in genesis\nAnd that is how ... and and a complex all of this seems to be going that every single question is leading the answers that people are raising more issues and scientists are all for coming forward and saying that they have information about this\nAnd so tonight if there's anybody listening on coast\nWe're looking for a decade operation we were really looking for\nHiring was

that I saw as a black child I Am fifty seven now but at the time that the incident I was four or five years old in Nineteen sixty five Nineteen sixty\nFive within my bed one night and I had woke up and could not go back to fully hear now from Winston Salem North Carolina to tell any down voice what\nGod damn as a child and hot it tends to this very day is retired us air force staff sergeant Tony guy\nI Lived in Dayton, Ohio\nI was about four years of age\nI live with my mother and she had a best friend that she waited two bedroom apartment my mother had two children and my mother's free and had two children and we were all about the same age it's a two bedroom apartment and it's two levels\nYou have to go up to stay here we get to the bedrooms and bathrooms\nAnd I was in my bed sleeping along with my brother\nAnd two of the kids and I woke up in the middle of the night and trouble going back to sleep and not just there and in the dark come and go back to sleep so I decided to get up out of bed and I went to the window\nAnd I was just looking out the window and it was very quiet here in the cars that's how I knew it was very late in life because I didn't hear your cargo by so I'm looking around and I happened to look up\nTo look up in the sky you know just looking around because it was really nothing but a grassy field in between the park which\nIs how I look up and I see a light up like light in the sky a suit was on an airplane that same light that I was looking at it 'cause it was only putting it in the sky\nI notice something was coming down and by the time my notes you may have been about I'd say fifty or sixty feet off the ground the light that I was looking at came down it was or\nWhat I noticed about it was one half of it was so white collar and the other half of it was me on green color you know like the glow sticks that you see at the concert when they have the glow sticks to me on green glow sticks right\nIt look like that and I was saying to myself this looks like a perfect circle but it's all ... all those if you cut the perfect circle in half and then just pull it apart a little bit\nA little lighter in the middle then it wouldn't be innocent were perfect circle\nYeah and I noticed that word it to light met in the middle a white lie in the lime green light there was no bleed over you can clearly see\nLights met in the middle a white lie in the lime green light there was no bleed over you can clearly see where the neon green ended in the fall white began and its object it looks like the span of a balloon\nWhen you say it was like a balloon you mean that in the surface was translucent and you can see through it\nI could clearly see through it it was no metal nothing like that it was more like a balloon so pretty and it's like you're looking at a seafood belong and what are you seeing\nWhat I'm seeing is a person standing in five the fall white part worn down and he's looking up just standing there looking up like he's looking up into the bars I don't know what he's looking at but I could clearly see this and I'm saying to myself look at that\nThat's a person can keep in mind I'm no more than twenty five to thirty feet from is that the only reason I been climb out the window that night because I was like if you knock out this grieving go down there you\nGo on a beach [laughter] you know what I was like man I Want to go but I'm going to be you do this you know I Know she is but I just didn't understand it as a kid with significant\nFor this okay this is very close to you as you are looking at this window describe the person that you are seeing in the white side of this circular orbit\nWhy give you my boats at the time this is a conversation about what's happened to myself I was thinking man this person looks like God\nAnd then I thought I'm not going to say that uh let's see actually pills please go out and ride and then I'll go man the show it looks like the guy who pitcher at church describe everything\nThe gal and he was wearing white when you're looking at the salt white I noticed it was bright bright colors and the white light you can tell the difference between fall white and black and white\nI could clearly see that the gal was white very bright white he was looking up and lead was Caucasian and he had a brunette hair and it came down to say\nHis shoulder to shoulder lanes and he was just standing there looking up\nWhat his hair straight wavy or curly\nI'd say was straight dislike you see when you see these motion pictures or cheeses have ... ... but it was like that\nWere you close enough to see the shape or color of his eyes\nYou know I wasn't close enough to see that\nAnd won't was the shape of the down\nFrom board I could see it looked like it cold over his head but all look like one followed piece and they went all the way down to his fate\nCould you see his seat in this terrible crash\n[laughter] no I couldn't so how do you know it went down to his seat\nBecause I could see that where the or where he was ... it was at the very bottom of it I could clearly see the whole here is kinda strange because I could see you know made it but I could look in the green part it feels apartment buildings on the up and shot\nSince I'm twenty five to thirty feet as a four year old looking out your apartment second storey window you are able to look through
