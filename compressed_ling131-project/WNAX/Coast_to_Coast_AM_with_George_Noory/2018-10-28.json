I I just want to make it clear that real life murder is not a parlor game\nWhenever we speak of murder it's important to remember that the lives lost whether it's one desk\nWhether it's Jack the ripper the Boston Straggler the wages of Salem or the most elusive serial killer in American history about which will be talking tonight the lives lost represent children who will never see adulthood adults that will never see their children grow\nYoung men and women who had their human potential to offer the world taken away truly innocent people who died at the hands of evil\nIn the words of Clint Eastwood in one of my favorite movies are unforgiving it's a hell of a thing killing them and take away all that he's got an old that he's ever going to have\nWell gay and and I will tell you though it it did present a small problem regarding our interview tonight\nBecause I had started to read the book and then I was told but if the red Sox make the series he can't be on with us\nSo I had read about the first three chapters and then when I heard the Bo Sox made it into the series I I packed the book in my boxes that are heading to Kansas 'cause I'm moving to K state understand you live in Lawrence, Kansas a lot of the two\nOf them on so I'm moving to Manhattan meant to be ... will be like almost neighbors and yet I wind up in Manhattan I Know very well and they were\nGoing to be totally cool so so I packed the book and then I got the call like four days later on always good to go like\nUh the book isn't so bad the overnight me a book that I had it in my hand but unfortunately awesome and I lost a few days reading time so I haven't finished yet and I love nothing more than doing an interview on a book I finished reading\nEspecially because I can tell already you're building up\nTo a climax that I Do not want to miss with the true story of the the ah the America's most elusive serial killer demand from the train so you're in Lawrence, Kansas and your ear coauthor is your wife Rachel McCarthy change\nAbout quarter to my daughter ... daughter my daughter she's a she worked with me on a book [noise]\nOkay it doesn't specify that so I did make an assumption I'm Sorry I should have a ticket that out and ... and pay that worked\nOut well I'd probably did somewhere but I didn't see it but in any event I just wanted to say a great book obviously desserts all the accolades that ... that you are getting for it and the fact that you very likely crack this case\nIs very much to your credit so I I Want to start if I can with the uh by the way to congratulations on the bus or the red Sox win tonight and what a game last night good thing you weren't booked for last night huh\n[noise] I Would add to cancel a little bit of torture to keep a lot of we have to be going well over here [noise] but\nYou and we mentioned the Boston Straggler last the last hour you have some experience researching that to do I get that right\n[noise] well I wouldn't say so I wrote about the ... along with hundreds of other crimes that are going to book I wrote\nMaybe six or seven years ago called popular crime or a ... I did um [noise] uh I was living in Boston at the time that I was writing that book so I took him send box and stronger case and publish some theory about it which might be right or wrong who knows [laughter]\nWell I Love that I think I may revisited that 'cause I've always been very interested in that as well but the man from the train is a story it does it speaks to something I mentioned earlier I was interviewing once and ruled the the queen of true crime and I asked her once I said is is there\nAny story too old to be told\nOr when it comes to you know re telling a story about a murder and she said absolutely not\nShe said it doesn't matter how old the story is she said what which best is is actually you is the author can bring something new to the story if you can solve it that's the best thing especially one that it either been incorrectly adjudicated\nWhich we know is certainly a case in in the book so far as I read it\nBut also it's true all the time that that will be of somebody who's falsely accused sometimes even convicted sometimes even executed just isn't the case here in the demand from the train a series of murders are happening around the country nobody has connecting them\nYet but in in one at least in one case a ... a a a local guy is accused of robbing a family and killing them and he ends up\nBeing killed for being executed for it and there was nothing he could do even though we know now these totally innocent\n[noise] they write their their tip while they're there for people who were actually executed\nFor crimes that may have been committed by the man to train them I Would go so far to say I'm fairly certain the crime was committed by the man and the train but a local person was executed not an ally of\nThe other two it could have happened but you can't pay for sure but there were also nine people nine black people who were murdered by a Lynch mob too when I was ... for crimes that were almost certainly committed by Matt from the track\nWhat year did the murders start\nFirst with an Eighteen Ninety eight but last night we are pretty sure that was ... although there was a string crime ten years later that has earmarked but we kept him\n[noise] so I looked in the you know I was trying to find an index for the book because I grew up in a town called ... Illinois ... the town where um\nThe ... I was trying to find an index for the book because I grew up in a town called ... Illinois ... the town where I'm\nHome alone takes place I grew up not too far away from the the whole Malone house um and ... the mayor\nIn around the turn of the century in were neck and one of the first mayors of the town of was murdered alone with his wife in their home\nIn a crime that was never solved and they happen to live right by the railroad tracks\nIs that right yeah and it was a story I'd always been told by my mother because she was kind of into the sort of thing where I get it and and the the the belief was always that it was just some drifter who came off the train broke into the house robbed them and then was able to catch a train to get up and they never found them\nUm but when I was reading this not thinking wait a second that could be somebody else in the in the chart of demand from the train\n[noise] they ... it is possible we have we assumed that we did not find every crime that he committed we just we found those er which there were enough signature\nAh ... signature characteristics of the crime that you could say with some degree of confidence that they're\nThere for him but they they may well committed and probably did commit other crimes that are we just did not have enough information about it but that that's a new and actually I I I've never heard that story before at all and if you hear my PIN scratching 'cause I'm writing down\nAt a murder that about a hundred years ago\nI tried to actually find out something this afternoon on it I couldn't um and I wondered whether somebody maybe from the Historical Society had more details but it was Saturday and I couldn't get a hold of anybody\nBut it made me think about it and so if I got something wrong you know forgive me but it's worth a ... a poke anyway so how many people do we think\nWere murdered along America's railroad tracks by single perpetrator demand from the train or who's anonymous for a reason to it you know during this period\n[laughter] well what Rachel I did was we\nPut the murders and bucket right there's a hundred percent bucket that his crimes were certainly I'm\nSeventy percent bucket of forty percent bucket canvas bucket right and I'm white total up the numbers of murders and each bucket and multiplied them by their likelihood that\nI'm a ... that are\nHere it was our our criminal and murdered all the time I came up with as a hundred and one\nThat actually include the two people who were murdered or were executed by the state a lot for crimes they committed and the the or somewhere between four nine people who were who were murdered by Lynch mob for crimes that he didn't commit or it may have committed\nSome terms of the actual murders and his own hands as opposed to murders for which he would be responsible including the executions\nAs murders because they were innocent I'm newly said somewhere around Ninety like a solid Ninety victims guy okay that's right All right so you get you get gets through a typical\nCrime as you as you see the pattern developing in the late\n... uh nineteenth century early twentieth century what was this guy's em oh\nWell this is along this could be a long answer I'm not a long way the person who is gonna be a long trip because there are a lot of things that kind of them together the crimes happen near midnight almost all of the crimes happen within an hour midnight\nA family is murder most often of family including how young girl is murdered without any warning and with no known enemies they live usually in a small town too small to have a police department\nMay live near the intersection of to railroad tracks they I'm a very often bodies are moved them killed with an axe\nThey act is found in the in the yard of the victims are in the yard of a neighbor and they act as a van and at the same as the crime\nThe handlers washed her fingerprints the house is locked up tight all the windows are the window shades of cold windows if necessary are covered with black it so that you can't see it all the doors are all law or something\nThis killer or the one from this morning but just because there's a lot of doubles in running around these days including son devils getting a big win today\nIt's a fun job so the we were just hated the interrupt you because you were doing such a great job with the\nExplanation about the the similarities between the cases and I I think you were coming up to the end but I I had to cut you off because we had the heartbreaking ... really it was\nGoing to do it or up to that because I was going to run out of the things to say but I was able to find\nHeart among several times I can I get a little bit\nMore than ... points that I sort of like thirty four of them aren't there or something or\nSomething like that they um they uh the crime you normally occurred on Sunday night so you heard on the weekends up until Nineteen pan the crimes almost all occurred and areas in which the primary industry was ball getting her part of the primary industry has was logging\nPay 'em Moore's uh doors and windows ... jam shot I think I mentioned that the um [noise] there's all their clarity graphic patterns and the murders if one occurs this south of\nPortland them extra curves just north of port lung or so that that would be a link between them they uh\nUh one thing that is odd is that he would he would take a lap from inside the house turn the ... way way down low so that you just gave up a little bit of light take the chairman a off the lap and set it on the floor usually under a table\nA and then carry the lamp around with him as he committed the murders and the other thing is that he would put total blankets over the head of a ... percent or a half a second before you went ahead with an axe played it a lot and they probably did that to\nKeep the blood from flying back and heading heading him as he was\n... someone [noise] the ah the coup quite a detailed pattern of behavior\nTo be a very interesting and so this is starting in the in the late Nineteen century and going to the early twentieth century following along logging lines that actually would be consistent with where this murder happened it's not that\nThe town that I grew up in the logging town but it was in between logging towns and if you just go north up into Wisconsin where that line started\nA new one that was plenty of logging was going on in in Wisconsin and it was it was in St for that matter Michigan just around the other side of Chicago so very likely could have could have followed them all into another\nThing I forgot to mention I all the all in warm weather with one one possible exception there's one crime that he may have ... his first crime which was you know there's an outburst of anger and not a\nNot a plan to vent probably that occurred in cold weather but he had to play through cold weather and after that he never murdered anybody cold weather it's always warm weather\n[noise] um we're talking about America's most elusive serial killer\nAnd Ninety would he be America's most prolific serial killer or is there anybody else who's contending for that to be around\nIt hit a probably might be but I had this discussion with my with my publisher which I Would have which was that they were going to want to say was the worst serial murder in American history or the ... or something [noise] murder is by its nature done in secret\nOr the ... that in fact that is that is one of the earliest definitions of the word murder is killing done in secret\nThere because it has done and in secret facts about it are never fully known and are not ah not normally are fully exposed and um he's getting a lot of different people who claimed to be\nThe worst serial murder in American history I don't think anyone has a better claim to that disgusting titled and this\nThis person but uh I'd I'd I wouldn't want to make it because the reality is we just can't document all the crimes to be attributed to a really anybody\nAny it's fair to say that if they were the most successful serial killer of all time very likely\nNobody would ever know about it then they could they could have done these things\nUsing drifters or people without homes much in the way that you know some serial killers have already performed but in the area of like ten to Fifteen victims fries or John ... using runaways and other things that that helped him to elude capture for so long\nBut the demands on the train is is he is he's called\nIn we have to call them that although we'll get to what you think you'd be discovered about this it in terms of solving the crime a little bit later on almost don't want to because I don't want to ruin them so close to you know finishing I was reading all afternoon furiously but\nThen there's a couple of good football game I got distracted at dinner so\nThe ... but this guy he nobody in the ... D printing does him for us to just assume that there was some national awareness southern killer who was lurking along Americans railways be careful if you have a home near train tracks\nBecause there's a guy going in between all of these towns what kind of word was going out which is about killers along trains during this killing spree\nOf Eighteen Ninety eight Nineteen eleven nothing at all the and and that this has to do with the organization of the wire services at that time in Eighteen Ninety eight the wire services were in a very primitive stage\nAnd because that's true information had very little uh ... of this type have little ability the spread from town to town\nBy Nineteen twelve the national wire services were more organized a story that was printed in a small town somewhere it would be picked up by the Associated Press or your PI or or the other a wire services of that era and published all over the nation\nSo after he had been killing people for about twelve years in October of Nineteen eleven all of a sudden there was a a sudden awareness but this was happening\nSo when he went to his most famous crime ... in June of Nineteen twelve everybody knew immediately that this is Pam and this is the latest crime in this\nTerrible series that's been going on but for the first\nMore than ten years that he was killing people nobody was connecting the dots at all even aware and logically they should have that even though you you look at the crimes and there's a case in Virginia in West Virginia where two crimes are committed six weeks apart\nThe uh uh and and towns that it's a little less than eighty miles from one to the other as the crow flies\nAnd you and the crimes are extremely similar and there's no other crime like that anywhere in the United states and all the rest of the year\nThe you would think that people would connect the dots but they didn't they at the first crime was was hung on the shoulders of a man\nYou would think that people would connect the dots but they didn't they are the first crime was was hung on the shoulders of a man how little who was later executed for and the second crime was it was investigated as a totally separate event\nAnd that was interesting because they were so close to each other\nBut that doesn't just speak to the lack of say the development in the Associated Press wire or it doesn't it's not just that it's also\nIt speaks to the engine seat of\nThe jurisdiction of sharing a police departments and sheriff's departments and there was no national or investigative a body like the FBI yet so there was nobody would report these two anyway that was going to keep track of what was happening around the country at the same time\nThat the exactly true and that introduces us also into one of the major themes of the book which is the and you know I've been writing about crime for a long time ... I'm ...\nI thought I was fairly knowledgeable about it I was astonished to to realize how backward and ineffective ... system was just a hundred years ago it's beyond belief how\n... the investigative\nProcess war at the time of these crimes and what the man from the train did was to\nExploit the peculiar weaknesses of the of the of the criminal justice system to evade capture they ah they knew that if he committed a crime and got out of town before the crime was discovered there was no no way really to\nTo connect it to him and he knew that if he committed a crime and the big city the police were going to be all over it mug if he committed a crime in a small town that had no police force\nFirst of all I took them two weeks to get their boots on but but even when they ... they had no resources to come after him\n[noise] and and syringe in medicine hadn't even really started yet I mean the the ... and ... this was a demon I'll even throw in another piece even in prosecuting that some of the things we we learn 'em ... is that even up until the Nineteen forties\nI'm juries were completely suspicious of crimes science [noise]\nUm yeah and I I wrote about this a little bit in in a in a true crime book I had written about this murder that happened in my family in that the Trump the jury's the the the defense attorneys appealed to the religious nature of the jury's\nBy telling them this is Lou do it's it's not science look at all these crazy things they're talking about we know none of these things are true now of course you look at juries very differently right and

I didn't get into this in the book but I think it's true I don't believe that the voters can murders would ... would ever have happened when they did add the light spin on and the reason that was true\nIs that he had committed another atrocity just six days earlier about a hundred miles away\nAnd he normally would not have a had another outraged that quickly but because the\nLights the city was punched into darkness it was a perfect opportunity for him and he couldn't pass it out anyway ... um [noise] uh the two little girls named Ida Lena still under went home with a more family the family of Henry More they walked home after the church service\nAnd and uh the little girls spent the night with a friend the little girl is a member of the family\nOn the morning of June can no one is starting around in the house the um and the uh his brother to find that comes to break send to the house finds a couple of bodies and runs out of the house scraping they bring the town marshal and he\nIs the same as has um hang court and Mr Horton courageously it goes through the house\nYou have to understand he has no reason to believe anything other than that uh a craze murderer is hiding somewhere in this house here as I said dark house\nIs holding matches in front of him or with no gun then to know former protection holding matches in front of a in front of his um self going from room to room finding bodies\nTheir eight dead bodies in the house and like in my log house in a small quiet mid western town\nBut he um [noise] uh and all of them hit my head with an axe the access found as it usually is next to the body of a little girl\nDemand from the train was a\nHis found as it usually is next to the body of a little girl\nFrom the train was a it was a pervert time he was interested in little little girl for the little girl was usually found in a\nIn an attitude suggesting that she had been\nA she had been outraged after that they um [noise] uh\nIn any case the crime was not there was a great uproar as you can imagine what the crime was not solved a two years later a con man named Jan Walker some came to Alaska\nAnd realized that he could stain of phony investigation of the crime by keeping people angry\nHe can keep donations coming in by keeping people angry a ... and he did that by accusing a very prominent local set of them Frank Jones of finance the crimes\nThere isn't any chance in the world the Frank Jones was guilty or that he had in any any connection to it but this campaign to prosecute crank Jones divided pulled us or\nIn a horrible and unprecedented way the city fought over whether or not Jones a dead end or didn't do it for several years\nUh and became became better badly divided community we have families on one side of the line wouldn't play with families on the other side of the line they wouldn't go that they wouldn't shop at their stores they wouldn't have to have anything to do with them\nBut this battle lasted in Alaska for even though\nA Walker San jose eventually run out of town in Nineteen Seventeen the uh um the battle went on for a long time and the hard feelings that mandating from it persisted in the city I Would I Would say for two effects staff that they are says to the present day\n[noise] you know you mentioned the piece about the the person in whipping up sentiment in making a false accusation to profit from it\nAnd even that creates a pattern for all too often how um crime stories unsolved claim stories are treated [noise]\nYet at the same time it it speaks to the fact that there weren't cold case police officers working that the crime still the kinds of ... at that time might have been solved by after that period of time by somebody writing a letter confessing or simply knowing somebody that [noise] but it\nWasn't meant to almost literally like fall in their lap which again comes back to the the power of storytelling and how he just by keeping my telling a story to beginning middle and end\nOf these events it doesn't matter how old the story is is that it will get people to listen again into reconsider again and most likely to connect again to that sense of outrage\nAbout what had happened and so you know a static police report won't necessarily you know anger people but when you start telling the story again people certainly yeah yeah that's right\nAnd and and they do that but also keeps kind of the idea of the murder alive it it makes it it gives you a sensation again is it that is you know the core of sensationalism\nBut it does it make it make you feel it again the fact that this crime in happened had they had they built it you know any kind of memorial to the family had there been\nAny had there been what had the town done to try to come to grips with the fact that this murder had happened prior to even this comment coming to town or afterwards\nThe I'm a ... well there was I don't know that there was that ... percent about I don't know that anyone built a memorial to them [noise] um for many years the Alaska\nAuthority that I Would say that it's still true today that the\nThe chamber of commerce tribes pipes and ... was known for something else right right we are ... there there is a house for the crime occurred is still standing of his operated as a kind of of more tourism\nOr it's the it's a shows up on paranormal ... TV shows and people pay to take tours of the house\nThe I'm a ... if you drive around ... there's no sign anywhere that says where the houses are now that we at science thing where the doctors houses but that but ah where the ... what ... is known for is not mentioned anywhere [noise]\nThe um uh that's not an appropriate but again it goes without saying that that's not an appropriate memorial ...\nThe um uh I don't know that you raise an interesting question I don't know that in any of these cases there was a a proper memorial to the victims victims were mostly poor people post when people without\nA without one and the more family was very well why they are\nAnd the community\nUh thought well all of them and the rigorous efforts to solve the crime wore a kind of memorial to them uh but I don't think there was any physical memorial to\n[noise] you know sometimes it's just a place where somebody always brings flowers\nOr there's an effort to try to use a dozen enough to be like a statue but it's interesting how communities will will sometimes do that because that that is their way of honoring so but I think you mentioned the economics piece that explains everything you know that\nThat's one of the reasons why it's usually prominent citizens that enjoy that kind of down is not a you know\nThe um the one of his rather than maps and trains crimes are the double murder and Colorado Springs it murder two families in what night an adjoining how the uh [noise] uh but if you if you go to that\nCommunity where that happened now the people that area's still remember it still they they could show yeah oh that's a house right there um but it still has not forgotten\nOr many places\n\n\nBill James the co author of the men from the train to the research with his daughter Rachel McCarthy genes and by the way when I read more carefully on the back cover it does say that she lives with her husband not you show [laughter] sorry I got the wrong\nBut you should be very proud of the work that you all did together not every father daughter team can do that kind of thing\nOr you looked at these are you looked at these murders and you put them in these different pockets you know the percentage that you believed were clearly done by the mentioned the train and then there's others that might be likely that he did but you couldn't prove it\nOr ones that are very unlikely but they they shared some characteristics which should also really inform us as to how many unsolved murders\nWere going on back then we think that some sort of modern phenomenon but it certainly isn't right\nRight well the murder of a an entire family and a lot of that is a is a rare of that was then and it is now but uh uh there were many many unsolved murders in that era\nYou know what I mean there's even as you mentioned they just weren't any investigative bodies and if they had one wouldn't the investigation wouldn't last for long because there wasn't a lot of funding\nBut so let's let's let's go down this path of of the process that you used to try to actually\nYou know narrowed down to a name to a person I've I've seen this done a couple of times right there's been some very interesting attempts to to to name names with regard to Jack the ripper burned Sampras and including going through ships registries and finding whether or not there was a particular sailor\nThat coincided with the murders and white chapel and or other parts of the world\nThat shared similar characteristics as the the crimes in in England but happened in Central America or happened in in ...\nAnd so they were able to try to find you know well the sailor went from this poor to that port and in each one of these ports there was a murder\nSo it just it it's a ... but you have to have to START I mean it isn't quite a needle in a haystack but it's it's at least maybe um you know to to look at it broadly your ear you don't even know yet\nWhat you don't know when you start doing a search like this so you you don't you know is it even possible that a name could even be found given the scarcity of information about you know people are public registries ... during that period [noise]\nWho the rich and the Jack the ripper case I Am I read I read\nProbably twenty bucks saying jak river was this guy or doctor ever was that guy or Jack and I and my other book popular crime I made fun of the people who wrote those books um the uh uh because I don't\nI don't have much confidence that you can actually do that and to me Frank almost all of the arguments that Jack the ripper is this guy or that guy almost all of them are selling\nThe um [noise] I never really expected that we would find it convincing argument about who this who was doing this so I mean we were looking gas\nAnd Rachel says that she did expect to find them but I didn't see 'em a lot when we walk the crimes backward\nA there is a crime in Massachusetts in Nineteen Ninety eight that Rachel says the moment she saw it you know with him the um uh and that was because I had told her that this guy would make mistakes and in his first crime he did make\nHim or his mistakes that let everybody know who he was the uh uh but the number of details that match up in the first crime to let's say Alaska\nIs is just it's beyond anything that you would\nYou would a\nSuspect was a could be coincidence and I'll I'll mentioned just a few things\nYeah please do you want me to give you the name or not it doesn't\nMatter you know we will go through the coincidence or go through the the similarities first\nWell ... the first crimes that were\nSort of publicly lake where crimes in the Portland area and two crimes and the Portland area where we're committed rather obviously by the same man and the attack the same detectives happen to be investigating him I thought this is the same guy that crime market go down\nSouth for the uh\nThe criminal had size six feet the um there's another crime in Maine in Nineteen oh two in which the criminals there were there were ... boot crab that were central to the trial\nA drug in size six feet there's a the the\nA boot cramps that were central to the trial\nOr and again size six feet this is a ... the show we we know that this is a small man well it is recorded about man that we found that he did in fact have size six feet not speculation he did\nWe know that we ... it was believed that he was small because I'm going to be a a ... and in other places\nWhen he swung the acts the ceiling wasn't very low the sailing is only about seven feet high in the room where the murders were committed but when he swung the axe over his head he just barely grazed the ceiling\nIf a person of normal sized person of a if a person's a large man could not swing an axe over his head in that room without sticking it in the ceiling\nBecause of that it was believed that he had to be small it was five foot for the uh\nUh [noise] it was suspected if you look at the blood pattern the way the blood flies off the ax you couldn't see clearly whether it's the guy is basically left handed over to basically right hand that's a pretty easy thing to see it was believed that the murder and let's go was left handed\nThe man who committed the crime and Eighteen Ninety eight was left handed when we had said that he had to be a well the the first stories about him say that he was an experience trap plan he would travel around the nation on trains for a while and then he would settled down into an area [noise]\nWe had said that he must work as a longer because all of the crimes for about ten years occur and logging areas the first story about him first stories about him specifically say but he was an experience blogger\nThe ah ah the nature of the crime itself the special attention to the a ... girl a that was there and the first crime in the first cry he always kill them out of the house first and be a\nAnd ended with the murder of a young girl that's what he did and first crime they he always used the one side of the X. I never even I wouldn't say it I Can't say he never killed anyone with a sharp type back but it was always his intention to use the blunt side of the acts\nIn this first crime blood side of the acts\nAnd as he would do in Alaska and many other places he left the acts on the floor beside the young girls that the um [noise] so the crime just matches up on too many points\nFor you to think that this isn't him [noise]\nSilly you started to look for a five foot four left handed pedophile Nicolas ... longer axe murderer [noise] um ... ... ... ... how did you begin to narrowly name out of that\nThe when he committed first crime he was obviously ... who ... for his crime is obvious who had committed this because he was living with the family which that's a common thing at a serial murderers for crime he often kills people\nTo whom he with his directly connected and can be tied to kill the first family and Eighteen Ninety eight everybody knew who who had done it because he fled the scene and I would say they were looking for is just that all of these other facts\nAbout the first about the criminal happened the line up with what we were looking for\n[noise] and the name that you believe is a demand on the train\nThe ... the name that he was using their was Paul Miller the weather that we can actually he wasn't even a German immigrant Libya whether that was the actual name or not um there's speculation he could have been using a false name even that however there's no real reason to believe he was\nWhen he found no I shouldn't say we found a friend of mine doing research on his own after the book was published found a the the ships record in which you had entered the country about an Eighteen Ninety the I'm a probably a man named Paul Miller had entered the country I'm\nOn a he was he walked with a sailor is getting paid you know\nIt was all like it and there and walk side to side with the uh uh and the ah\nThere are many different hunting seasons don't

is we have a name and we have a description\nCurious to see whether that my jogging anybody else's memories with a local story in their community like you did with me earlier in the show we'll find out next on coast to coast am this is Ian but\nMy mom you know did he worked as a matter but there are some of the I think he did at the accidents\nThat he used the word they lumbering ...\n... ah mostly a like an axe that was found in the woods pile almost all of the house ... murders were a just a more houses burn wood times\nCoal a buddy either ... or coal use an ax\nTo split the wood or break up the coal right\nAnyway they would use the coal actually the boy that would actually whatever you've found outside the building\nWell see now that answers actually to my previous question about dropping the acts that wasn't so much thinking in terms of\nThinking print evidence I was thinking that could lead somebody to find out where he and purchased the acts but you're saying in every home he picked up the acts from the nearby would pile and use that so whenever a type of actually had in the house that when he left behind\nWhich is another point about Nineteen ten and I think it

parallels between owns a vision you wrote about and that says\nThat the murderer always as a guilty conscience and really tries to get caught and some of the more famous stories like the black cat well ironically berries and acts and his wife\nRight that's what he describes and and when we come he he's not going to be caught so\nYou know he well he had all the cat in into the wall and uh you know we tried to get into the basement and said look how how the ... but he always try to give them so what\nThe ... by the way while doing research on the crime book\nI happened to find a a story in a Paris newspaper in Eighteen forty six which is apparently the original story for much of the casket ... among the autos is base the uh the poll also of course was it was an avid reader crime choices as I'm sure you know\nThe uh anyway the answer is no ... absolutely was not\nTrying to get caught in fact ... many many many cereal murders are sort of playing games with the police and sometimes they want you to know who did it uh but they just don't want to because I don't want to be convicted of it but that's one thing that's quite unusual about this man is that he had a very unusual\nA aversion to being ... he\n... he was in the wasn't the absolutely was not trying to get caught and he was taking very intelligent\nAnd very well thought out your base of action not ever to be caught one reason he never took anything from a crime scene even you know if there was a hundred dollar sitting on the shelf there\nThey wouldn't take it because he knew very well but if he was caught fleeing a crime scene playing a scene with or something that could be tied to that scene he\nKnows a lot of people were executed for that the so no he was he was very nice is quite unusual extent had a an aversion to being caught\nSome serious restraint for a guy who didn't have any money ... ... to show some discipline um beg you mentioned the scooter marine who's in Athens, Georgia until she goes for Bill James Marie\nHi Ian can feel\nUm well I was calling because I was kind of curious first of all are you guys just now talking about the acts and\nUm my my brother and I we were in fact the game and murder happened after the civil war in our family um and he was my great however I mean that grandfather was he was killed when an act\nAnd then I think that his wife and maybe a son did that and ended up being a brother in law that was convicted of it and um he lives right now and I feel I can hope that field workers would be blamed for bank anyway and we went back and that and then\nMy brother was murdered a year ago\nAnd that is in jail for talented guy about two years ago by now so if there's now a lot of it around but I'm\nWondering you may even if you feel about\nA person you know I didn't make a lot of mistakes and the person that we believe that killed my brother he um he maybe he was so far he's gotten away with it and how do you find out about a person and he um\nHe know where they're from but I'm Wondering if maybe he had done this before you know what I mean here because every little detail he's saying to me now to go in\nAnd they were just seems to perfect for the first time this is what you're saying\nI I certainly feel for you I'm very sorry about global of bothers me too\nAnd and uh I Wish there was something that can help to would be helpful to you but I I there really isn't\nI mean I I think as I said in our case we were just very fortunate\nTo uh to find this treasure trove of information about the about the first crime the uh but I I it's not something you can imagine if we can to Rachel and I were to sit out the salt in other series of crimes like this\nWe wouldn't it wouldn't happen for us to do because it wasn't something that happened because we were smarter because we knew what we're doing it was just the way the crime set up the way the story's set up that broke for us you know\nI'm so sorry but the Murray let's go to my ... in New York for a Bill James on coast to coast am\nYes scheduling gentlemen and when the light to uh I see on your back in the saddle\nMassive lack good luck with\nThat Web looking forward to it but I have a two part question when some comment and outlets and um the over the well it's not to add New York it's it's all over the\nInternet started out we had expected we'd already cages at hand people at\nThe FBI or can it profile a tell I like it now and if you put in a more modern contacts how I said I Am the I ... followed might might slash sky out\nMuch for that I'm also I like to hear more about and whether we can block and time into some money in it and that got caught up and can we didn't have black people who um [noise] wound up by not even got when they try to get name Lynch\nAnd the last part and I mentioned about the state end up probably at this time at that time that they sang to aid [noise] that's a lot of um [noise] I Am I recently read a book by you\nKnow ... it's called how I became white it hits on Jacksonian Arab pre civil war\nAnd he actually got to police besides the fact that you know they had like two hours looking for\nBlack folks but pay off a dish that Dan as basically competing gang basically street gangs went volunteer fire department [laughter]\nBad can eating spite thin and ... and I can count on that Web you know you're with gangs that came up as as sad that fall and then finally and I live in a way over the Internet thank you sound like a um ...\nThank you for your most intelligent questions\nI'm somewhat familiar with the firehouse gangs are from New York and pretty civil war\nMost intelligent questions\nI'm somewhat familiar with the firehouse gang or from New York and pretty civil war because\nI wrote about him in the most popular crime or they were in there was a woman this gets back to pose there there was a woman named Mary Rogers who was murdered in New York and I want to say in Eighteen forty five or thereabouts\nA poll fictionalized or that the murder Murray rowjee but the actual woman's name was very Rogers a there was speculation that firehouse gangs were responsible for her cry for that\nCrime but that that it really is an odd thing that there were these fire houses that were really just just a a house with his family ... pretty unruly people uh and they they were kind of ... in the city I so yeah I I did a that's an odd story isn't it\n\n\nWe've got callers coast to coast we need to talk with Bill James give us a minute here's we wrap up the last question\nUm we talked about how there were in fact gangs of fire departments and\nAnd I I think if anybody wants to know more about that too it's handy to go to watch the movie streets of New York right to Scorsese movie ... there's a lot of that that's a little stranded in there that's kinda cool but she left it because the question about what it at the end of modern police or FBI profile or take a look at this case\nI haven't asked them to do that because that would be in my nature I mean\nYou know what my book is written to say this is what I think and everything so I think they were that's up to you but I wouldn't ask the\nAh John Douglas in modern above a profile or has spoken and written about Alaska\nOr one of his observations was\nThat ah the um well he had several observations about all of the crime that lined up with what we believe for other reasons one was that the murder had to be older\nBecause he is extremely organized I mean it off the chart of how organized is this burger this guy is\nUnbelievably organized a the a and and also he he um he said that Robert ... Kelly who was accused of murder as opposed to really couldn't have done it because his mind is very disorganized but also because\nIt was not physically strong enough um\nWe know that the Paul Miller was physically extremely strong and extremely agile\nThey um [noise] uh so yeah there's something there's something there but not a lot I mean I haven't I haven't had a profile afraid of the painting or frankly wouldn't care what they have to say because you know they got their opinion I got mine so the book is about\nInnocence accused of a crime that I'll tell you briefly just one of those stories and murder in Maine and night you know to a man named Henry Lambert who was quite obviously and it said was accused of the crime\n[noise] it was just a a he was a a I'm not around me was I got a an an educated illiterate French Canadian who uh who ah you know borderline homeless drank quite a bit\nHe was accused of the crime and it was in prison for Twenty years uh before he became a cause for lab and Maine and a very good lawyer eventually what we're trying to free him and the free um but governor rained eventually\nA graphic guide to this fall apart and put him on it are based on a ... on actual innocence a buddy that happened after he spent Twenty years in jail there are a lot of stories like\nThat in this in the book it's quite unfair to a terrible side effects of what happened in New York\nAre are not relevant to this story because they were by lightning than the New York city police were relatively organized and relatively sophisticated relative to now but but relative to the places where these crimes occurred these crimes occurred in ...\nWe're relatively organized and relatively sophisticated now relative to know how but but relative to the places where

really that connected to my book [noise]\n[noise] no fair enough but it just to illustrate ... in that movie of of how those gangs tied to operate within government as they were everybody was vying for jobs even if that meant getting in fights to keep them\nOn and in the end by the way I think profiling would endorse what you've done I think you'd find I think you'd be a very proud of the way in

Ninety or eighty nine game with a smarter than Boston around you are and and then I was curious I started thinking about what was he born in Mars smarter and if there's any connection to them to\nSee it\nIt's a fair question the question I get a lot is but it could be connected to New Orleans packs murderers and and the answer that with is easy no they're absolutely the not connected to New Orleans tax partner the but the Lizzie Borden case is not as easy to uh to reject because of a time and place\nHowever it's quite a bit different than our murderers Alberta committed with a heavy AK ... it in the middle of the night of the board and murders committed with really a hand the hatchet hand held a hatch it in the middle of the day\nAnd and they do not have really any of the [noise] but I don't have very many of the signature elements of our crime so I don't think they're connected all by camp\nOr I couldn't say that but you know and all connection between the two crimes is that uh that you probably know that in the ... the board in case there was a man staying with the ah\nAh the board and family are on the night before they were murdered there and he was a a farmer who had a farm maybe ten miles from Alaska so that's an odd connection\nAnd a ... I think that Lizzie Borden pieces interesting I think it was the first thing that came to mind for a lot of people and maybe speaks to the idea of going into it does connect in the sense that it was a family\nIt was a house it was ... and then it was a it may be a crime of opportunity um in in grabbing an axe was near a hat you know that was that the property that do inside\nAnd the idea that it was in and out really quickly and then nothing was stolen\nWhich is another piece because you know that was ... you know what why would somebody going to the house and killed were it not for that that was the part of the motives piece that was presented you know against Lizzie Borden was that she stood do inherent property which makes sense but it didn't it didn't like give me a moment to where I was\nThinking about let's go to a dentist is in New York on coast to coast am for Bill James author of demand from the train bill Dennis [noise]\nMore than ... it's been a wonderful program ... thank you for taking my call I really appreciate it\nLed down the list\nUm and I'm Glad you're back I I look for them to use them for years and I [noise] I Know you went through to the problems there are little ...

more about that coming up and just a second and we'll we'll go around the horn 'em\nTo a couple of places that are celebrating Halloween on the way this Wednesday of course George Will have a terrific Wednesday night Halloween show but uh we'll also talk with the GW Oscar who's the author of a season with the witch\nAnd it's a whole book about the magic and mayhem of Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts you might remember a show we did a couple of months ago\nAbout uh the Salem witch trials and how historians had been changing their views on who were the victims or rather whether they were like really that much of a victim I mean it it was fascinating go back if you remember of\nCoast insider and listen for it but coming up next our this is another sort of historical trip I think you're just going to love along the rails of America the men from the train\nDiscovering America's most elusive serial killer\nSo this ... this is this is a great story you'll love hearing about it with Bill James who was a a writer and not just of um of general interest books like that but also he's a a sports writer or in Boston and he was of course following very closely what happen\nTonight in Los Angeles we are not competing again he extended the Dodgers ended up playing last night uh it was like a double header rolled up into one single game but but but tonight a little different uh Bo Sox lead the series now three to one the\nDodgers will get another shot at it coming up tomorrow night to send the series back to Boston three to two but\nBetween you know the creator and the creation a and in fact in that very ...\nBetween you know the creator and the creation and in fact in the very first version of a robot before the ... version of robots um the robot that is created\nIn the very first version of I robot which was in the late Nineteen thirties the sit down and read Frankenstein\nAnd then has a better understanding of life afterwards anyway the experiments that inspired Frankenstein are up and goes to goes day I'm Doug come to a great story to read and and also just wanted to from the sun\nAbout a cover up\nThat may have been exposed Google Earth blind spots over the experimental military base maybe where US government hides crushed to UFOs that according to a defense insider you'll see more about that about the the ... test range in Nevada\nUm and what they had recently uncovered but but if they did well then you know they would it would become the new Raj well\nI'm going to be with the old role as well and I'm very grateful that we have a chance to talk to who was needed Jennings who joins us on the phone on coast to coast am good evening Juanita\nCan evening so well Anita is the director of public affairs for Roswell\nI'm and she promotes Roswell as a travel and and you know as a professional opportunity and people move to rouse while all the time but this time of year where you get a lot of tourists to come in for the Halloween festivities so I just wanted to ask you what your plans were for Halloween what do you do if if\nIf Ross will kind of Halloween all year long in a way for some people with the discussion of\nAliens and invading armies and all of that it's if it's if it's a Halloween all year long what do you do special for Halloween\n[noise] most people go out to grade farm which is a local farm and ranch community just about seven miles out of town where they participate in the corn main\nUh the grade family ah the coordinates together like the hieroglyphics that were supposedly on the UFO spaceship that landed in Nineteen forty seven\nOr they can get every single year and it just a great opportunity for people that go out and really try to experience aren't you know that ... that feeling of getting lost in feel like you're a\nCrash in Nineteen forty seven other people go out to bottom or break state park ah which again has a mystery at the bottom where and and it is out ten miles from Roswell beautiful a great place to RV camp and things like that but\nAgain I'm more more of the stars and the telescopes and people getting dressed up and they feel that they become one or they may come down and uh you know it's just that that the area there is something here that land it and they're trying to connect with them especially around\nHalloween and during the year after the vote in July\nSo I'll be traveling through rose well I'm I'm moving coming up I'm In a couple of weeks and I'll be driving up through Roswell on my way to\nA new position will be teaching to Kansas State and my my ... my younger son and I was always wanted to cope good Roswell right so we we we mapped it out from Phoenix even though we have to go a little bit out of our way to dip down onto the Roswell before we come back up again\nAnd it seemed totally worth it to us just to be able to see it but how much can people tour when they're out there if anybody were interested in in being able to go to the crash site or ... or to go to any of the other locations that are linked to the famous story of the crushing Roswell where what can they do\nThey can go to the rival on international year from me and Research Center which is a great opportunity to really dive into their historical and the research a part of the crash I'm definitely what check out the library for those who are really the speakers and do you believe\nIn addition to that we have a new eco tour that is done by a local researcher he's been doing research on the crash and you're a first for over twenty ... years and we will take\nYou to the exact locations of timing of the incident and on top of that during the festival not next week but during the festival\nFor the first time last year that book or a family where the crash occurred allegedly they will take it out to the crash site where a knack for themselves rent a house 'cause they'll kind of in in place and you can see\nWhere the crater landed in in the land and so those are just a couple of of things\nThat I Would definitely recommend that people check out and um you know search for the truth and so\nIt's OK so plenty to use the word allegedly in there which makes me suspect you're not a true believer of what happened you know something we don't know\nI I Do believe that there are some people still are kind of on the fence and so we invite people to come and find out for themselves [noise]\nUh we you know there's a lot of research there's a lot of a local people here that um people can talk to when you go into the museum uh the locals know who the tourists are because\nAt the sticker and you will come and walk down our main street and go into areas that wind which is a great story I bring your camera take pictures stop in the ... visitor center we have few amazing alien that we'd decorate for each time especially now for Halloween puts\nOn a big festival with our police officers and things like that for the community that um these they're about six foot alien and people like to take pictures with them and they'll hear the story of you know are employers them on his name is Bob and ... and ah you know people really come here searching for the truth\nAnd we as local we we don't want to say one way or the other we want them to figure it out for themselves and and do their research\nWell that'd be great thank you I appreciate that let me let me ask you how many people show up every year in Roswell for the Roswell festival for the for the crash festival that happens in the summer the UFO days\nAnd so our population has doubled in size where where town about forty thousand and especially on the big anniversary of the festival um you know we've hit close to doubling our size on average per year for tourism we hear a little over two hundred and thirty thousand visitors\nThat on the UFO museum and Research Center\nParty good pretty good in pretty close to what they get in Salem, Massachusetts and so I'll I'll bring in our next guest next but thank you ... and if I'm if I'm driving through town and get a chance they'll say hello okay yes please bear thank you honey to Jennings is the ah the\nThe the director of ...\nAnd if I'm if I'm driving through time we get a chance they'll say hello okay yeah cream hair and care\nHoney to Jennings is the uh the the the director of tourism public affairs in uh Roswell New Mexico a season with the which Jay W Oscar\nThe subtitle is the magic and mayhem of Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts a Gemini let me just tell you who very funny book you read his great sense of humor really enjoy all the sort of a comic aside\nOn a serious subject because and we'll get to the second this is this is a very unusual place in America but it has an even more extraordinary place in the timeline\nOf American history but I thought it was interesting you mentioned that in Salem, Massachusetts they do about a quarter of a million people that come to visit during the month of October is that about right\nAbout right there are about forty thousand usually I'm On Halloween just how it is so it's about a hundred thousand people um and of course the month than a quarter million though the massive amount of people for the city to have the orders\n[noise] well I Love this idea so this is one of my favorite kind of books it's a deep drill down on like a well I mean it's on a narrow subject but you picked\nHalloween even say about the subject so it sort of you use that as a as a sort of a lens on all of what happened in and the implications\nOf the er the Salem witch trials um but it's it's really informative but we just get a guest a couple of weeks ago about a on the popular opinion on how historians have been shifting their views\nOn Salem and I you know I learned a lot then too but we'll learn a little bit more tonight for example I didn't realize that a ... ... ... there are other places around the world outside of Salem\nThat had massive hanging and burnings of of which is before Salem, Massachusetts didn't\nAlways trying to tell me about the first hour which wasn't the last one that was tried in the trial was the biggest one of the strangest for the first for trout America the victim was in Connecticut\nAnd Europe they're reaching like thousands of victims injuries certainly nobody\nReally hear about that which is really I mean I Know that there there are some festivals in Europe that they keep that alive but still that's an extraordinary number of which killed\n... honestly it's really a problem today even in in um north of the country there's two we're being people being executed for being with us but the the strange thing about that to me of course of the planet had this problem which is pretty much every day on the planet there's only one which city and that's still a Massachusetts [noise]\nThe government protect the costs of Medicare plants will decrease this year so you have to ask yourself are you getting the best right to help markets offers a free service with access to thousands of Medicare plans nationwide to help folks maximize their benefits and say honey\nWhat is it people need to keep in mind\nEnrollment in the right plan it's not automatic with so many Medicare options that can be confusing my advice don't go it won't get unbiased help to\nFind a plan that may cost last and cover more with our co payments more choices like dental and vision and the freedom to choose your doctors with the enrollment deadline only weeks away it's important to act now our health markets Medicare assistance as freight\nThanks Mike this is Michael met that for health markets\nFor your free Medicare assistance coal eight hundred six nine for forty five forty two that's eight hundred six nine for forty five forty to eight hundred six nine for forty five forty two\n\n\nSo ah Jay W ... author of a season with the which I just had to look up some of those steps that we had mentioned more vaguely two thousand eleven bar do Norway erected a memorial to the Ninety One victims of seventeenth century witch hunt licorice or England\nOr long ago turned its ... which is incident which ten people were hanged and sixteen twelve and toured tourist draw\nIn Sweden there's a witch memorial for the more than Seventy victims who were beheaded and burned in sixteen Seventy five\nIn Germany a staggering four hundred and fifty victims in the late Fifteen hundred generally sixteen hundreds in Spain a whole museum dedicated to the witch trials in which some seven thousand people were accused and that's just\nIt was in Spain a whole museum dedicated to the witch trials in which is some seven thousand people were accused and that's just some of them and not even all that happened\nIn America but at Salem that sticks out and so why why do you do you conclude Salem, Massachusetts has become so synonymous with the craft\n[noise] it's it's really a mystery of the even that's one of the big question that go with the book and I think it's a combination of probably\nDoesn't different factors obviously they get Salem has what city one of which of course is that where you know it's in the United states of America and the U.S kind of invented marketing or yeah that's a big part of it but I mean\nNot a big part of it that's a small part of it but there's about a dozen other reasons why kind of Salem grabbed onto that moniker and kind of held on to it you know over the course of about two centuries\nBut it's kind of a you know it's I'm On a curb Shane ... right I mean it's not that not usually what a town holds onto you know that even you know it's we just talked to somebody from Roswell in and that that was an incident that was that happened\nThere but ... and they they take advantage of that for you know tourism purposes and for whatever other reason they want but it's like usually for you you don't hear about Chicago celebrating the fact that it was the home\nOf that crazy serial killer famous worlds exposition right you don't know any of these do go on their way to put up signs and go it happened here so\n[laughter] right through and I think to to fight for that one is that [noise] you know the tragedy in Salem itself\nWas basically just to the court happened in Salem right it was a civic part of the trials actual family members and you know the people who really bear that shame over the course of generation around Salem the actual the actual stereo started next door in what's now Denver's was at the time and sailing village for sale itself does have a kind of\nKind of a generational connection to it it was justified of the proceedings [noise] um and then on top of that today which city means way more than just the victim of a witch trials I mean the actual which is that live there today\nIt means the cartoon which that's kind of represents Halloween since since I was kind of become Halloween town as well\nSo it's a determined which has a lot of different definitions for Salem today and twenty Eighteen\nYeah I guess this is important in a ... this is great distinction can't help but feel do and sometimes I Can't get away from just remembering that this this really is about innocent victims of murder [laughter] that they were executed\nAnd they protested their innocence until the end and there's a whole industry tend to build up around them now\n[noise] yeah and that is a big ... dealing with that responsibly as something that Salem is kind of ruffled with for you know probably two centuries and a lot in the past few decades especially figuring out how to balance you know the actual tragedy that's kind of underneath the underneath or Fort Ord so to speak then part of it that's left connected to the tragedy it's more just around\nYou know city identity and all these other kind of thing just become and and twenty team\nWell go back to my central question than from last half hour which is then how do they celebrate Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts\nWow with with absolute and ammonium [laughter] it really is so they\nThey don't celebrate Halloween day I mean they celebrate a season basically they thought it was called haunted happenings which technically starts October first and October thirty first [noise] um but really has bled over into longer than that\nSo if you want to experience Salem don't go in October don't go in late October go in September early October or any other time of the year [noise] do you want to visit sound but Halloween is going to get pandemonium crowd with a lot of fun but it's definitely a different type of experience from the city of failing itself\nIt's Mardi Gras basically\nIt is it really is um I talk again hundred thousand people packed to the small downtime with the city for failing to the city but doesn't have high rises it's not like you know massive it's a small city and it's everything happens within you know five or six blocks\nAnd you have a hundred thousand people there to party to wear costumes a freaky each other out to you know go to go to bars watch the fireworks all kinds of stuff [noise] so you're you're definitely there for you know again Mardi Gras is a good analogy because you're not really experiencing New Orleans Mardi Gras you're experiencing Mardi Gras during Mardi Gras\n[noise] um but it did and I imagine for a lot of times in October ... which is to in ... in in there so you're probably not going to get to seem festivity did you get in Mardi Gras anyway but there's probably some amount of alcohol than consumed during this celebration\nOut definitely actually right now or in the middle of a nor'easter so that you know cuts [laughter] how many of them right now for Halloween weekend last weekend before Halloween [noise] booze is part of it but this is within the party\n[noise] okay so you you mentioned haunted happenings but I mean is Salem known for being hunted either Salem witch Denver's former Salem Village ... are there were a lot of haunted houses or were there are there still visitations from the victims of the original Salem trial [noise]\nOh yeah there's all kinds of mythology around that is it's really hard not to have that mythology like if you didn't want it it'd be hard to fight it off because you have again everything you need for what the classic haunting idea of innocent victims\nYou have monsters 'cause of the film which trial didn't just involved which is in the story involve demons and him since ... and ghost everything we're in the trials for the big monster mass see all those kind of elements and then you have a city that has feel four hundred years of history we're up three hundred and Thirty years of history\nSo that is just you know a lot of people over the centuries [noise] so yeah there's there's all that kind of stuff happening in Salem um ghost tours there's spooky places there's the other five the executions you everything you need to build the kind of spooky mythology around the city\nNow you've been there most of these I should say you've been there right you go there to oh yeah all the time they're two weeks ago [noise]\nSo what have you ever gone and seen anything that was paranormal related that seem to be still situated didn't and in some dimension around Salem\n[laughter] you know I haven't but that's my fault so I I built a career kind of a visiting strange places spending the night of the band that asylum and murders things are all kinds of things\nAnd I've never had an experience so my interest that that is more in the stories themselves you know until the day I have an experience my interest as more just in the stories of it in Salem is chock full of like this really great spooky [noise] you know goes the stories are on that but no I haven't had anything cool happened to me\nYeah what's the what's the best what's the best ... story that post Salem witch trials that you've captured while you've been there\nUm well what are the one that really creepy ones is one of the Boston stream of victims happened in Salem so it has that kind of connection to like a real you know real actual store co vent that then I can reverberate and have kind of thought around that Houdini off of the Salem and like escape prone to jail they're\nSo all these kind of spiritual is kind of and you know macabre kind of events happened in Salem ... nothing to do with the witch trial it's all that kinda stuff kind of feed into that kind of cauldron of uh\nA kind of events happened in Salem that nothing to do with the witch trial it's all that kind of some kind of feed into that kind of cauldron of a of a mythology around Salem\nYeah but Houdini was a bunker right he was somebody there to celebrate and he was there's somebody to to to mock these people that we're creating these images so I'm curious do wizard attempt to for him to do like ... or something while he was there\n[noise] no no he was a the building actually still stands it's a it's a condominium our apartment complex now but it used to be the original jail there there was a police station\nAnd he was just there doing one of those things that used to do when he was in towns are performing who go to a local police station or somewhere and perform a quick active you know Cape as a PR move for his next big event so I wasn't down there do in order to say on busing but doing as a

I I just want to make it clear that real life murder is not a parlor game\nWhenever we speak of murder it's important to remember that the lives lost whether it's one desk whether it's Jack the ripper the Boston Straggler\nThe witches of Salem or the most elusive serial killer in American history about which will be talking to night the lives lost represents children who will never see adulthood adults that will never see their children grow\nYoung men and women who had their human potential to offer the world taken away truly innocent people who died at the hands of evil\nIn the words of Clint Eastwood in one of my favorite movies are unforgiving it's a hell of a thing kill a demand take away all that he's got an old that he's ever going to have\nWell gay and and I will tell you though it it did present a small problem regarding\nOur interview tonight because I had started to read the book and then I was told but if the red Sox make the series he can't be on with us\nSo I had read about the first three chapters and then when I heard the Bo Sox made it into the series I I packed the book in my boxes that are heading to Kansas 'cause I'm moving decay state understand you live in Lawrence, Kansas\nA lot of the two of them on so I'm moving to Manhattan meant to be ... will be like almost neighbors and yet I wind up in Manhattan I Know very well and I\nGo oh totally cool so so I packed the book and then I got the call like four days later on always good to go like\nUh the book isn't so bad to overnight me a book and I had it in my hand but unfortunately awesome and I lost a few days reading time so I haven't finished yet and I love nothing more than doing an interview on a book I finished reading especially because I can tell already you're building up\nTo a climax than I Do not want to miss with the true story of the the ah the America's most elusive serial killer demand from the train so you're in Lawrence, Kansas and your ear coauthor is your wife Rachel McCarthy James\nCarter my daughter ... daughter my daughter she uh she worked with me on a book [noise]\nOkay it doesn't specify that so I did make an assumption I'm Sorry I should have a ticket that out I didn't really pay that worked\nOut well I'd probably did similar but I didn't see it but in any event I just wanted to say I'm a great book obviously desserts all the accolades that ... that you're getting for it and the fact that you very likely crack this case\nIs very much to your credit so I I Want to start if I can with the uh by the way to congratulations on the ... of the red Sox win tonight and what a game last night good thing you weren't booked for last night huh\n[noise] I Would add to cancel a little bit of torture [laughter] to keep a lot of we have to be going well over here [noise] [noise]\nBut you and we mentioned the Boston Straggler last uh last hour you have some experience researching that to do I get that right\n[laughter] I wouldn't say so I wrote about the ... along with hundreds of other crimes that are going to book I wrote\nSix or seven years ago called popular crime or a ... I did um ah I was living in Boston at the time that I was writing that book so I took him to send box and trying to case and publish some theories about which\nMight be right or wrong who knows [laughter]\nWell I Love that I ... I may revisited that because I've always been very interested in that as well but the men's on the train is a story it does it speaks to something I mentioned earlier I was interviewing once and ruled the the queen of true crime and I asked her once I said\nIs is there any story too old to be told\nOr when it comes to you know re telling a story about a murder and she said absolutely not\nShe said it doesn't matter how old the story is she said what which best is is actually you is the author can bring something new to the story if you can solve if that's the best thing especially one that it either been incorrectly adjudicated\nWhich we know is certainly a case in in the book so far as I read it but also it's true for all the time that that will be of somebody who's falsely accused\nSometimes even convicted sometimes even executed just isn't the case here in the demand from the train a series of murders are happening around the country nobody has connecting them\nYet but in ... in one at least in one case a ... a a a local guy is accused of robbing a family and killing them and he ends up\nBeing killed for being executed for it and there was nothing you can do even though we know now these totally innocent\n[noise] they write their their tip while they're there for people who were actually executed\nFor crimes that may have been committed by the man trying to them I Would go so far to say I'm fairly certain the crime was committed by the man and the train but a local person was executed not an ally of\nThe uh the other two it could have happened but you can't pay for sure they ah\nAh but they're also nine people nine black people who were murdered by a Lynch mob too when I was ... for crimes that were almost certainly committed by Matt from the track\nWhat year did the murders start\nFirst with an Eighteen Ninety eight but last that we are pretty sure that with him was Nineteen quell although there was a string crime ten years later that has earmarked but we kept him\n[noise] so I looked in the ... I was trying to find an index for the book because I grew up in a town called ... when ... Illinois ...\nSo I looked in the you know I was trying to find an index for the book because I grew up in a town called ... Illinois I saw the town where a\nHome alone takes place I grew up not too far away from the the whole Malone house\nAnd the mayor in around the turn of the century in were neck and one of the first mayors of the town of was murdered along with his wife in their home\nIn a crime that was never solved and they happen to live right by the railroad tracks is that right yeah\nAnd it was a story I'd always been told by my mother because she was kind of into the sort of thing where I get it and and the the the belief was always that it was just some drifter who came off the train broke into the house robbed them and then was able to catch a train and get up and they never found them [noise]\nUm but when I was reading this not thinking wait a second that could be somebody else in the in the church of demand from the train\n[noise] they ... it is possible we have we assumed that we did not find every crime that he committed we just we found those which there were enough signature\nA care sick signature characteristics of the crime that you could say with some degree of confidence that they're\nThere for him but they they may well committed and probably did commit other crimes that are we just did not have enough information about it but that that's a new and actually I I've never heard that story before at all and if you hear my parents' scratching 'cause I'm writing down\nAt the murder of a hundred years ago\nI tried to actually find out something this afternoon on it I couldn't um and I wondered whether somebody maybe from the Historical Society had more details but it was Saturday and I couldn't get a hold of anybody that it made me think about it and so if I got something wrong you know forgive me but it's worth a poke anyway\nSo how many people do we think\nWere murdered along America's railroad tracks by a single perpetrator demand from the train or who's anonymous for a reason to it you know during this period\n[laughter] well what Rachel I did was we put the murders and Buckeye right there's a hundred percent bucket that his crimes were certain ...\nAh Seventy percent bucket of forty percent bucket and that kind of ... percent bucket right and I'm ... ... total up the numbers of murders and each bucket and multiplied them by their likelihood\nThat I'm a ... that are\nHere was a criminal and the murder of the tunnel came up with as a hundred and one that actually include the two people who were murdered or were executed by the state\nLaw for crimes they committed and the the uh somewhere between four nine people who were who were murdered by a Lynch mob for crimes that he did commit or may have committed\nTo germs are the actual murders and his own hands as opposed to murders for which he would be responsible including the executions\nAs murders because they were innocent I'm usually say somewhere around Ninety like a solid Ninety victims guy who cooks right All right so ... gets through a typical\nAs you as you see the pattern developing in the late\n... uh nineteenth century early twentieth century what was this guy's him oh\nWell this is a long this could be a wrong answer I'm not a long winded person those could be a long answer because there are a lot of things that ... them together\nThe crimes happen near midnight almost all of the crimes happen within an hour midnight a family is murder most often a family including a young girl\nPhase murdered without any warning and with no known enemies they live usually in a small ... at a town too small to have a police department [noise]\nThey live near the intersection of two railroad tracks [noise]\nBe I'm a very often bodies are moved their killed with an axe they actually is found in the in the yard of the victims are on the art of a neighbor and they actually the ban then at the scene of the crime or handle is washed her fingerprints [noise]\nHouses locked up tied to all the windows are the window shades of polls windows if necessary are covered with black it so that you can't see it all the doors are all law [noise] beer or\nThis killer or the one from this morning but just because there's a lot of doubles into running around these days including son devils getting a big win to say\nIt's a fun job so the we were just hated the interrupt you because you were doing such a great job with the explanation about the the similarities between the cases and I I think you were coming up to the end but I I had to cut you off because we had the heartbreaking ... really it was\nGoing to do it or up to that because I was going to run out of the things to say but I was able to\nFind the heart of terrorism but I can I get a little bit\nMore than ... what's that\nI sort of like thirty four of them aren't there or something or\nSomething like that they um they uh the crime you normally occurred on Sunday night so you heard on the weekends up until Nineteen pan the crimes almost all occurred and areas in which the primary industry was logging her one of the primary understood as was logging\nBay um Moore's uh doors and windows ... Jeff shot I think I mentioned that they um [noise] there's all clarity graphic patterns and the murders if one occurs just south of Portland the next occurs just north of port lung or so that that would be a a link between them\nThey ah ah one thing that is odd is that he would he would take a lap from inside the house turn the ... way way down low so that you just gave up a little bit of light\nTake the chairman a awful laugh and set it on the floor usually under a table a and then carry the lamp around with him as he committed the murders\nAnd the other thing is that he would put total blankets over the head of a ... percent or a half a second before you\nWent ahead with an axe played it a lot and they probably did that to keep the blood from flying back and heading heading him as he was ordering someone [noise] the ah the coup quite a detailed pattern of behavior\nOf the very interesting and so this is starting in the in the late Nineteen century and going to the early twentieth century following along\nLogging lines that actually would be consistent with where this murder happened it's not that the town that I grew up in his logging town but he was in between logging towns and if you just go north up into Wisconsin where that line started\nA new and that was plenty of logging was going on in in Wisconsin who was it was insane for that matter Michigan just around the other side of Chicago so very likely could have could have followed them all into another\nThing I forgot to mention our the all in warm weather\nWith one one possible exception of one crime that he very may have ... as far as crime which was and just an outburst of anger and not a not a planned event probably that occurred in cold weather but he had to flee to the cold weather and after that he'd never murdered anybody cold weather it's always warm weather\n[noise] um we're talking about America's most elusive serial killer\nAnd Ninety would he be America's most prolific serial killer or is there anybody else who's contending for that to be around\nIt hit a probably might be but I I had this discussion with my with my publisher which I Would have which was that they were going to want to say was the worst serial murder and American history or the first or something for murder is by its nature done in secret\nOr the ... that in fact that is that is one of the earliest definitions of the word murder is a killing gotten in secret fear because it has done and in secret the facts about it are never fully known and are not ah not normally are fully exposed\nAnd um you get a lot of different people who claimed to be\nThe worst serial murder in American history I don't think anyone has a better claimed to that disgusting titled than this this person but uh I'd I'd I wouldn't want to make it because the reality is we just can't document all the crimes to be attributed to a fairly anybody\nAny it fair to say that if they were the most successful serial killer of all time very likely nobody would ever know about it then they could they could have done these things\nUsing drifters or people without ... much in the way that you know some serial killers have already performed but in the area of like ten to Fifteen victims fries or John Wayne gay see using runaways and other things that that helped him to elude capture for so long\nBut the demands on the train is is he is he's called\n... and we have to call them that although we'll get to what you think you'd be discovered about this in terms of solving the crime a little bit later on almost don't want to because I don't want to ruin them so close to ... you know finishing I was reading all afternoon seriously but then there's a couple of good football game I got distracted dinner so the ...\nBut this guy he nobody it in ... D printing does them for us to just assume\nThat there was some national awareness of the killer who was lurking along Americans railways be careful if you have a whole new train tracks now because there's a guy going in between all of these towns what's kind of word was going out which is\nAbout killers along trains during this killing spree\nWealth of Eighteen Ninety eight Nineteen eleven nothing at all the and and that this has to do with the organization of the a wire services at that time in Eighteen Ninety eight the wire services were at a very primitive stage and because that's true information had very little\nOr they have this type have little ability to spread from town to town\nBy Nineteen twelve of the national wire services were more organized at a story that was printed in a small town somewhere it would be picked up by the Associated Press or your PI or or the other a wire services of that era\nAnd published all over the nation so after he had been killing people for about twelve years in October of Nineteen eleven all of a sudden there was a a sudden awareness that this was happening\nSo when he went to his most famous crime ... in June of Nineteen twelve everybody knew immediately that this is Pam and this is the latest crime in this\nTerrible series that's been going on but\nFor the first more than ten years that he was killing people nobody was connecting the dots at all even when logically they should have that even though you you look at the crimes and there's a case in Virginia in West Virginia where two crimes are committed six weeks apart\nThe uh uh and and towns that it's a little less than eighty miles from one to the other as the crow flies\nAnd you and the crimes are extremely similar and there's no other crime like that anywhere in the United states and all the rest of the year\nSo you would think that people would connect the dots but they didn't\nAdd the first crime was was hung on the show\nThe year so you would think that people would connect the dots but they didn't they are the first crime was was hung on the shoulders of a man power little who was later executed for and the second crime was it was investigated as a totally separate event\nAnd that was interesting because they were so close to each other\nBut that doesn't just speak to the lack of said the development in the Associated Press wire or it doesn't it's not just that it's also it speaks to the instant sea of\nThe jurisdiction of sharing a police departments and sheriff's departments and there was no national or investigative a body like the FBI yet so\nThere was nobody would report these two anyway that was going to keep track of what was happening around the country in the same time\nThat's exactly true and that introduces us also into one of the major themes of the book which is the and you know I've been writing about crime for a long time ... I'm\n... I thought I was fairly knowledgeable about it I was astonished to to realize how backward and ineffective at your digital system was\nJust a hundred years ago it's beyond belief how ... the investigative process war at the time of these crimes and what the man from the train did was to\nExploit the peculiar weaknesses of the of the of the criminal justice system to evade capture\nThey ah they knew that if he committed a crime and got out of town before the crime was discovered that was you know no way really to\nTo connect it to him and he knew that if you committed a crime and the big city the police were going to be all over it but if he committed a crime in a small town that had no police force\nFirst of all I took them two weeks to get their boots on but but even when they ... they had no resources to come after him\n[noise] and and syringe in medicine hadn't even really started yet I mean there's ... ... and ... this was a demon I'll even throw in another piece to even in prosecuting that\nSome of the things we we learn is that even up until the Nineteen forties I'm juries were completely suspicious of crime science [noise]\nUm yeah and I I wrote about this a little bit in in a in a true crime book I had written about this murder that happened in my family in that they the ... the jury's the the the defense attorneys appealed to the religious nature of the jury's\nBy telling them this is Lou do it's it's not science look at all these crazy things they're talking about we know none of these things are true now of course you look at juries very differently right and they have a very there now they have this CSI and Sacramento expecting", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "Yankton", "day": "28"}
