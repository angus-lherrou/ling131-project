A.\nWelcome to everyone listening all around the world all across\nThe United states\nAre coming to you live\nFrom the great pyramid headquarters trial which tonight is the coast to coast AM Studios right here in Los Angeles California standing in on this beautiful Sunday evening I Am your host Jimmy church and tonight my guess is my new save Saturday\n[noise] everybody let's get started [noise] listen to me [noise] everybody wants the gift that keeps on giving [noise] that special gift [noise]\nOne that you don't put in a drawer and forget about you know [noise] it and so one gift that you can visit or use every single day and tomorrow and the day after that [noise]\nAnd for that singular perfect present that's all wrapped up in a boat for this planet\nAnd every one on it it's the great pyramid of Egypt\nYou don't have to look any further it is the gift that keeps on giving the great pyramid\nIs forty two stories tall it sits on over Thirteen acres of perfectly leveled and rock pointing exactly true north south east and west\nAnd it's been looking at us for almost five thousand years allegedly and yet we know nothing about it\nA few short decades after Cleopatra's rain is pharaoh any knowledge of the great pyramid and Egypt in history was forgotten\nAnd it seemed that everything just died with her\nNobody knew how to read I have ... nobody knew how to speak the language or to be honest they didn't know anything about anything\nAnd it all happened virtually overnight travelers explorers they traveled to Cairo they look across the Nile and say you know I'm I'm using air quotes here right wow that's amazing what is that you know and the answer\nAir quotes\nYou know but it's really big [laughter] that's that's it\nYou take a moment and you you asked yourself how to get here but it basically you know I I was just like anyone else watching History Channel Discovery Channel and you know off and on about Egypt and it was interesting but it wasn't really such a you know it wasn't really a ... and focus\nAnd then ... years ago I um I think somebody gave me the vine mystery by Robert Duvall\nAnd that changed quite a bit for me that was just an amazing story um you know that the pyramids were aligned with the stars and I it's just that that just kind of open something up\nAnd and so I started reading a little bit more and uh and then a couple of years ago is when it really took off a ... and ... and then I said I have to you know I I wanted to meet some of these people I\nStarted a you know communicating and I've met a rather with our last year on a cruise and ah and I met Robert shock or a few months later and um you know just one thing led to another but yeah it's been an amazing a few a couple of years\nThe paper the latest paper I Want everybody to know all of my news published a white papers are on his website and we're going to be discussing those at length tonight on the program\nAnd you can get to my news website by clicking add a coast to coast am scroll down and you will see in the paper section everything listed in the row a new is the first\nAnd so before we get to the great pyramid which is the subject of the show tonight\nUh you and a Robert football and Roberts\nI sat down and started discussing uh the the snakes and polished that paper what was it that happened over breakfast where the light bulbs started going off that got too involved in all of this\n[laughter] yeah well you know this is a this goes back to Orion mystery so I you know while I was reading things I hadn't met the two gentlemen yet the authors\nUm I I was just a you know I thought to myself if if an architect ah builds the three pyramids ah and online and and want it to align them with the ... for a while and\nThey had to be some kind of record and you know it was it causes believe that uh the architect of the great care of it the first one of the three you know\nAnd so I looked at the statue I started looking at the statue of the moon and looked at some of the inscriptions to see if there's any clue that uh would uh you know prove that he actually conceived it that way\nAnd and so while I so I looked at the statue and there was something that I'm most interesting there was a symbol of lying that's on that are on the pedestal off that statue\nUm I noticed that and then I just kind of put it on the back burner and then you know after I met a Robert in ... he gave me the uh the book to that they just have coauthored origins of the things which is an amazing book by the way it is\nYeah um and so I was reading the book and you know in Robert section he's developing a you know something that he knows that dream Steeler which is you know in front of the parts of the ... between the positive things\nAnd it was a a so he was talking basically about the things in the sky and he developed that part of the book and and then I asked myself well what about the things on the ground why is it that there is no reference to it\nUm as far as we know before the servants were built if there was a schemes then it's it would have been such an amazing monument that they should have been no mention of it and that's how this came together so then I remember the statue I remember the line is on the pedestal\nOne thing led to another I posted something on my Facebook page Robert ... and then he wanted to discuss it and then you know or\nAt the um I think it was causing the origins in Sedona is where we met again and that's where I first met Robert shock and we were sitting\nAt breakfast at night I knew I only you know I had to get this out in less than a minute and it was so compelling that I didn't even have to try it just came out in less than a minute and\nWe uh we looked at each other and there was a moment of silence and we just knew there was something about it this uh this could be very important and that's how that paper came about\nWhy is it I Know that you listened to my opening comments tonight why is it that the will to apply to in general but you had the great pyramid the grades things are two things that dominate everything that you can see for miles\nBy is not documented the anywhere in Egypt history where you would think well you know the ... love to write everything that he loved to\nGo and tell their story and not only that but taxes and in accounting in season everything all of their daily lives all of the stories are told except for the great things in the great pyramid why is it missing in history\nYeah that that's a it's an excellent point I I'm ... ... of course I don't know Jimmy um I I mean you know the one answer you could give us that maybe we just we haven't found a record store the records were destroyed\nUm but it is there is a there is a striking paucity or or maybe total absence um and of course that was the problem with the things you know I thought to myself that if we want to prove if we want to go into each apology territory and give them the kind of proof that they want\nAn inscription that refers to the ... for example than ah than we have to really look we have to we have to take a good look at what we have\nAnd hope to find something and you know I think\nI think we found something that leads to things um [noise] the pyramids we\nUm you know when you on ... when you buy the great pyramid there is a tune from the six a dynasty maybe a hundred and fifty years two hundred years\nAfter a you know who fool key ops\nWas alive and if you walk into that tune to is actually a reference to the great pyramid and also to the uh in in\nIn the two of 'em it's called uh the whole rise of coup full and next to it it's the um the you know the the conference grade so in in in the old kingdom the great pyramid was actually ... pyramid\nSo they call that cover his grade and kudos pyramid was called their whole lives look cool\nAnd so this was a priest that was a you know supervising or other priests that were on the show and so okay there is an inscription but you're absolutely correct it is that is the glaring exception you don't really see too much\nTo the pyramid yeah you wouldn't expect and like I said an owner's manual we don't have that but there isn't even a general reference to to point is in the direction\nAnd forget about the other some about how was builder who built in the year was build you know we still don't even understand the purpose and that all\nThe way to have auditors um you know fifth century but see now this was in doing personal um two thousand years after the fact and and what it is the writing the way he describes it raises more questions than answers\nUm I mean he does get into a little bit of details you know you're saying that it took ten years to build a ramp up to the plateau and then the pyramid was done in Twenty years\nUm and there were machines that were hauling up to blocks but you would think that you don't just like what you just said you would think it should be a detailed account of how it was done but uh it's not to\nThe uh the other part of this or that is just too confusing is ... I guess we also have the same issues and if it wasn't for the dream Stella well and the inventory Stella ... we may not know anything at all\nBut\nYes that was the dream still a is a ... you know there was a dispute or at the turn of the twentieth century that may be tougher laws to force who is the author off to dream so between the cause of the things that he is the one to build it that was actually being debated\nUm but ah and there is a there is a small reference to fray but it's if it's kind of way so there's no way you can say that um that keep it definitely does not say that he built it [noise]\nUm and so that's the dream still at the end mentors the law and the other hand is very direct it specifically states um first of all it makes it very clear that when ... came when I think ... I mean\nYou may think those are two different things but it's the same it's a ... the great Dane Cook posed the Egyptian name it's the same person\nSo that even towards the large that story on a critically what cookbook came to watch all the things already existed in fact it was in your heritage and then he built his pyramid and that was the end of it of its queen and it would so\nOkay let's take a break right here will pick up when we come back where we are leaving off right now the east coast to coast damn our nearest you'd be church our guest ... my news said is that day and it's all the great pyramid all night long we'll be right back stay with us\nFind out more about the nights get loans you to go see ends on\n[noise]\nCardio ... piece of mind and your pocket for only Ninety nine dollars for your time today the guardian dot com that have a A R D I F ... dot com\n\n\nWalking back to the coast to coast am I'm you're assuming church it's the great pyramid all my ... be ball or we get to the great pyramid\nOr ... minute say Saudi and my new uh we were talking about the inventories tell and the dream Stella right before the break and I want to get back to the dream Stella briefly before we started to move forward\nAnd end the dreams della ah most of the fourth says mentions and in illustrates two things says there\nAnd desert Fox just tweeted is there a second Spanx well there's two things his there I Know that Robert shock is referring to the possibility of the seconds feelings being in the sky\nI think it's actually west of the great pyramid behind it that's that's my take is there a second ...\nIf a great question um uh so that was for that was Robert Duvall um who is interpreting the\nSecond things uh as the celestial things in other words the constellation Leo\nBut uh and you brought this up in the last interview and it's a it's a great question that's a good point um there are actually depictions of a double headed things\nAre and that double headed things is in the underworld and of course he is a is a ... you know a cemetery and I know that a cemetery is is what the Egyptians thought was the underworld and it was guarded on each end by things\nAnd these depictions are ... you know there are unmistakable\nSo so the answer to this question specific of course there hasn't been found there is there are stories uh Arab historians referred to an actual things on the other side of the Nile which was dismantled and you know the ground was used to build moss\nSo they're they're apparently was a physical things\nAre on the other side of the Nile but it's there are things buried under the fans are that the west of a conference here that it's possible\nZ.\nE. M. and tore Stella you had mentioned that a coup food shops\nSaid that he repaired this banks but built the great pyramid\nThere are others that have interpreted the inventory Stella is saying that he was just to repair guy but he was there to repair and straighten up the great pyramid why the discrepancy\nYeah let me preface it real quick because I mentioned as yet of course each call just at most ... do not accept the inventories are as a historical document\nAnd ah for various reasons and Robert shocking I recently published a paper where we counter this argument so we're actually saying is it is authentic and we think that it's mostly five Charles so I just wanted to say that but just to be fair to both sides um so what's your question\nUm the ah you have to go to the texture analysis to distinguish rebuilding from building so if you look at the left side of this still out there is a strip of text\nAnd on in that text or the it's talking about rebuilding the temple of ISIS and the specific symbol we discuss this last time is a symbol that in Egyptian means to me\nCombine that symbol with the with the with the word for building which is a bad\nAh so the ... the combination is kept him if you if you put those two together it means you're rebuilding on the other side of the style ah ah is a is a strip of ... where you know the pyramid building as mentioned and the the verb that that this is not further\nA qualified with this word and based on that is that I was saying that the pyramid was built the temples we've built\nUm is that a hundred per cent proof no of course not and people have criticized even the you know the ... of ... that was found in ... in the right the\nYou know they are saying well you okay this is the the cars talks about tour store and being ... or ... or um but it doesn't prove that the entire pyramid was built it could just be could have just been repaired and I I have to admit that's correct I I think we can only say we can only go by what it actually states\nAnd what it actually states is that ... was being shipped to either of course Chris Dodd and uh who was a ... interview you within the other day he made a good point he said that he thinks the way it was billed as that first of all the perimeter was built and then it was back failed\nAnd so that means that if you ship tour I took ... that means you were building you know some part of the perimeter\nOr as you went up to courses and then you ... later so that means there was probably a you know part of the actual construction of the pyramid but you know I just wanted to bring up some of the issues and I just want to be even handed about it and just you know a deliver the information and then people have to make up their mind\nAbout it and there was a quite a bit of relatives or a you know pyramids that coup was dealing with uh also one of the games a plateau right could there be a reference to one of those smaller pyramid\nThere are you oh you mean in the image or so yes yes\nYes there is a there is a reference to a head Knutson\n'em and hit Knutson uh this is also you know a ... a contentious subject so who's going to a new since she was supposedly is queen\nAnd uh he build a pyramid for her but the southern most of the three ah off the tree a queen permits that are on an indie east field are in on the eastern side of the great pyramid\nAnd um but\nIn the human stories though it says that she was a princess and based on that comment he took calls is that is one of the reasons why they're rejecting dispel a because they're saying there is no evidence that they knew it was a princess so again ... and I are diffusing that argument in the paper so we actually\nAh submit prove that gee I in fact was a princess or or at least that we're saying we we think is the poop shows that she was a print says\nSo that was one of the relatives mentioned um and then do you know there's mentions of ISIS and hot or\nA an old Cyrus on this Stella and that those are very much for the reasons why each opposes reject this though because they're saying\nYou know if this were an old kingdom story or at the time of coup who these ... ah you know I sort of size we're not yet a weren't being worship there were not official states sanctions or in the eighties and we also you know try to diffuse that argument as well\nUm but you know it's it's contentious I I I don't want to make it sound like we have the outs or we have all the answers perfectly locked up\nAnd then there's another glaring issue here and that is all of the surroundings smaller pyramids are crumbling they don't even look like they were built by the same engineers or by the same answer with the same pair flight and those would be more simple to build\nAnd you would you would expect to be just as elegant if even you know more complex yeah they're not and they're ... don't work is is is just awful\nYeah well that I saw the problem is of course that the ... have been um you know robbed of their stones\nAnd so what we're seeing a A R is the left over um I actually you know I was interested in that same ... you just call me that you just made I was in Egypt a couple of weeks ago and I went to a new since pyramid to see you know a little bit ... take a closer look at the craftsmanship and I was very impressed with the few casing stones that were left in place\nAnd I would say that they are in terms of uh in terms of the quality of you know they're smaller size but in terms of the quality I didn't really think that there's any difference to uh the casing stones around the great pyramid um so I Am but I think the core yes it looks pretty dilapidated\nUh and of course the parents after the old king them I'm a you know middle kingdom tournaments the most of them are falling apart so you know you're absolutely correct the the the word friendship definitely declined um after the old kingdom\nNow let's get to or what happened last year which was the big news about this new chamber above the grand gallery yes after we haven't been told over and over again\nAnd it hasn't stopped that there is nothing to find inside of the great pyramid there's nothing there well clearly that is not the case there is something above the grand gallery what it is we do not know but when that news broke what did you think\nUm I thought to myself this is this is the greatest news in archaeology of the century I think this is uh it's amazing um and and what I like about it is that it was non invasive um you didn't have to drill holds you didn't have to you know like a\nA duty early explorers they used dynamite sticks to blow themselves into these monuments which was awful and nowadays uh it's kind of liked it Germany is telling us you know you wait until you have the technology to to find out about me or without destroying me and I think now we're getting to that point\nUsed twice in our breaking news when it happens on five Seventy W.

I'm going to get to the top half of the pyramid and we're going to work on that in a second but got some calls that have been holding for quite a while to speak with you minute let's go to Barry in South Carolina Barry welcome back to coast\nHello there ... and you know what I'm getting ready to say yeah man\nYeah go ahead Barry then she or\nGo back ... can be\nLike that my news you like that the area [laughter] okay I\nHad to have our our ... hearing is that all that you may have roared do you play so great for me to have the power\nAnd thank you bury what do you have for a minute tonight\nOh I got two questions and then we got a great little short clean quick go about their armored tower just sit there and help [laughter]\nHe is credited with Jimmy ... the deciphering and learning to read hieroglyphics and then the second question is All right Howard graphics found go back we can't be in Egypt in that area of the world\nThe same our good things that are found in the pyramids of Mexico\nCentral and South America\nIs the ... so the question is how are you asking if there are a hero cliff here were lipic inscriptions in Beckley therapy is that what you're asking\nOr you know I'm asking are the ... center written on the ... and Egypt owned a pair of the civil war and go back with the all the same hieroglyphics federal found on the pyramids and Mexico and central and South America\nAh okay I understand I'm not I don't think so they are there different ... there are different and it's interesting you asking this question because you are you are basically giving a conclusion that I'm investigating as we speak you you were saying that they're here a glistening inscriptions\nIn Quebec you can't be in other words you're implying there is a there is there is writing there\nAnd um and I am currently looking into that I think you might be onto something\nNow there is I'm going to say one thing let me jump in Barry\nAlthough I'm not an archaeologist I don't have any fancy degrees after my name\nOn it but there are certain things that are in not only on the stones that go back to be but also in Egypt and tend to repeat around the world with different cultures\nAre they the same I don't know there is an H M the bells\nThat looks very similar to the age blocks in boom boom ... who are are they related I don't know\nThere are some astrological signs in Beckley taffy\nAre they are they representing the zodiac uh that were in then Darrow then throughout Egypt and throughout the rest of the world after that are the the same I don't know but I'm going back to being that old\nCertainly is indicating that they were the first than it is the oldest is at the same language\nAnd then that no I I don't think so but the zodiac symbols and some of the other symbolic ... like the I call it the army's age on the bells split it looks like they did that age that age is repeated a\nThere's a very exciting possibility um regarding that question to ask and go back to ... I'm ... and it's regarding the symbol that you mentioned Jimmy there's a very exciting possibility but I Can't prove it yet but I've ... I might be able to prove it so and then we'll let you when we'll let everybody know\nWhat we'll do it right here on coast to coast oh there was one other one other point that I wanted to make about uh uh go Beckley Tempe and it just got away from me bury it was right there but it just disappeared I mentioned it later on in the show thank you bury\nNo problem thank trial\nAnd absolutely and uh the phone lines Manu I expected this ah are completely jammed up let's get in one more call them on all of them but yeah let's let's go to\nThis is what's going to go to my dad in New York my uh Europe next\nYes good morning gentlemen and gray guinea and land and [noise] I guess the ... [noise] I like to know and he\nLooked at any of that ... highway highway have any ... and I\nAnd I'm off I I think that might\nBe the one that would be a foundation medical knowledge that they had that if if I'm correct on that they take a loved one and they can die now over there and whether they and and and lab and and shot an ad in the in\nThe African and African American ballet study the net net getting back to that we can name on the language would have thought of that that ... that killed a phrase hit south of the way they say quit and whether he look\nFat people who call themselves\nA candidate for and that in the kitchen you know before they get Greek came in and they're going to have it be can that college is kept many when we got away\nFrom like can they say and also um me what you call I think was that we have like I think we got came up with and to me\nWell why pay five with the little if not what it is and the African American dollar that I'm thinking that they call it\nA little odd that arrived here ... ton Lou oh God of fat if you follow them on ... and and I'll let you know the day I\nThink you mad great okay three great questions and my new I'm going to get to them but that she just goes to show you the extent of knowledge here with the coasts audience or they don't play around uh the first\nQuestion um I I I Am all I have heard of the ... but uh the one that I have looked at more specifically regarding medical information is the ... century\nActually in my book um because on the reverse of the evils piracy there is an interesting calendar or that's fixed Egypt colleges and I think um I found a solution to a this calendar and that's described in the book\nUm and and yes it's a this isn't that me and so the medical knowledge just incredible we're talking about piracy that's I think over sixty foot long uh it describing seven hundred at these different seven hundred different ailments and their remedies\nUm and this ... I Believe states to the middle kingdom and and we just back a most likely a probably to him or taps time so um yes there were there were very skilled positions or the ancient Egyptians um\nSecond barn yeah ten minutes and which was the name of Egypt of course kind of a group that's\nAn excellent question and I'm just going to give you a quick answer as quick as I can so um as far as we understand it the Egyptian language originally was a composite of two different cultures the one culture was a southern Egyptian culture\nAnd the script was mostly phonetic um and the evidence from that comes from two of 'em you Jay\nA king scorpion and that is I think were the African roots sly\nThe other script a that was intermingled initially comes from northern Egypt a ... probably from Bhutto and Bhutto was a sort of a trading a settlement in in the delta and they were trading with ah probably ...\nWith the live on and so they had a different kind of group that was mostly the Charles so it was picked a raft\nUm so what you saw as what it meant while in the south you here's what it meant and so I think your question is very well taken and I think yes I think the uh the southern Egyptians script was probably a originally Africa maybe you know what the hair or maybe I'm maybe even further south\nAnd she brought up another really good point before we get to the break we got about thirty seconds the Greeks adapting uh the etymology a chemistry coming from cabinet right\nYes issue I think she mentioned it's getting so my we we think the stakes was making before uh before Africa game I think it was we were I think it was a line is and their name was make heat and by the way that's also probably an African Africa or did you\nTake a break right here coast to coast am it's all Great Pyramid all Egypt all night long or gets tonight my new save Saturday his paper is right there click on his website the coast to coast am we're going to discuss the rest of it after the break stay with us\nJust find out more about tonight's gifts to log on to to ... am done\nThat you\nTo earn a quality degree from a world renowned university and he said yes to any of these questions Arizona State university is perfect school for ...\nArizona State university offered over one hundred and fifty how remain degree programs one hundred percent on line\nYou learn the same degree and through what on campus from wherever you are on your scheduled class on the one line except familiar transfer credit for information puck slouch put three five five lines sapping learned for yourself fly off the air is ranked number one for innovation by US News and World Report\nAnd learn to thrive with Arizona State university for more information about all the one line popped live two three five five wind surfing but our our ... three five five lines sapping\n\n\nWelcome back to coast to coast am I'm your host Jimmy church I guess tonight and Manu save Saturday more talking about the great pyramid and the discovery of not only is chambers inside of the great pyramid\nBut his formula in his white paper they published last week\nAnd how to locate them and I want to say really quick minute that Twitter I expected this uh is is going a bit nuts right now and you can follow me on Twitter at a ... church radio and post your questions or comments about Tonight Show\nEither of for me or or buy new right there and this question just came in before we get to a\nA page three twenty eight of of of this report a minute this is the question this is from ... Kim\nShe says is it true that the measurement of the great pyramid or possibly coordinates and that does coordinate point to somewhere um in in the past that they believe are coordinates to have in\nHeaven yes\nI have to propose\nIt's great to see this is this is what I really enjoy a about the coast audience and and I guess like yourself there is so much information out there but there's also the lack of information and we are trying to figure out the great mystery of of of the pyramid\nYeah and this is one of those questions where the math of the of the great pyramid has revealed so many different not only a a mathematical equations but numbers that are beyond coincidence and they are they're all over the great pyramid\nI have I have one piece of information that might be interesting to the listener um there isn't a good friend of mine and author Alison green who is looking Shakespeare expert and he has been able to connect uh the uh the title page of the sun it Shakespeare sonnet\nTo the coordinates or not to heaven but uh uh of course Allen said heaven right\nPyramid and specifically ah the the coordinate said Allen just discovered a U.S fall right next to the ...\nWhich is next to the great pyramid\nAllen's work is some of the most groundbreaking game changing work out there I'm going to have 'em on coast a a very soon probably next month\nAnd is you're absolutely right in the title page of the sonnets with Shakespeare\nAnd his work Allen greens work and decide ... page and what he's revealed\nIs I have never been as freaked out as I was uh when I saw his presentation with that and interviewed him about it is absolutely incredible ... next month\nSo okay so now the the top half of the pyramid yes uh you said at the beginning of the show let's go to this ... page number three twenty eight everybody in the ... the the ... report PDF\nThe top path you had said at the beginning of the show possibly six to eight additional chambers where we had been told there are known\nBy right and so um you know when we talked about um a confident ... Rudolph got to break last time a Jimmy\nUm remember we're talking about the queen of the southern shaft of the queen chamber and there is something that I forgot to mention she was so what guns and bring to the phones it's when you get to guns and brings store\nAdjust pay for the the the floor off the off the off the canal drops suddenly it's there's a depression\nAnd the way he's interpret and one of the two ways he interpreted that is that must be a space that allowed that forward to cave in slightly so that that's what he proposed in Nineteen Ninety three and if I look at the um you know the courses that we've just been discussing\nThere is a good possibility that that that he is right there is probably as face that made that came in\nAnd that might correlate with if I go back to three twenty six real quick\nThat could correlate with of course that's marked with ten twenty fifth [noise] um and and then let's go and so you know so there's some there is evidence that there are spaces and died this particular space not been detected by me on gun\nAnd now the row mud or let's let's get to this first second and the uh the audience is going to look at the numbers that you have represented here which is a starting at ... eighty four which is a shaft\nUm and uh going forward to every body of one of seven\nA and I'm looking at it here as it continues a these are rose layers of the\nConstruction that have a different sides of the different thickness on these roads right\nRight right yeah and and in this graphic or you know one of these canals as the show and going all the way to the surface and that's incorrect so I just used this illustration does as an older generation I'm so that if that particular chef did not go to the surface of the wall\nBut yes so we have all the different courses that have round fractions of twenty fits in in terms of the surface area ratio\nAnd um and by a by the rules that you know I Am basically establishing in the lower part of the pyramid I Am proposing that every single one of these courses is associated with the ceiling in other words\nThere is a space at designed space not ... you know an accidental space and designed space that correlates with each one of these particular courses\nNow you just got back from Egypt yeah we have to discuss the ongoing move on a project their wage uh did help them find this ... this new chamber above the grand gallery\nYou describe what you saw in the grand gallery well when you were there\nRight so I saw new detectors being placed I'm at this time in a different location than last time so last time the detectors were placed inside the queen chamber and this time it's very obvious you walk up to a grand gallery to the king chamber and there are I think twenty seven twenty eight boxes\nAnd I kind of knew their detectors but I asked to confirm and there was confirmed that there are a scouting\nNow for the audience tell them what to move on detectors actually do where do they used for\nBy so these are particles that are created in the stratosphere so and cosmic radiation hit the atmosphere of particle called them you on has created enemy on is a negative charge like an electron um uh but it is a is a bit heavier\nAh then electron but it can pass through solid matter if it's a travel is that the speed of light it's lifetime is just over two seconds I'm and but it can penetrate through solid objects\nAnd so because of those properties you can't use it just like an X ray and you know you take an extra person you can see the bones you can see somebody organs and in this case you can basically quote unquote X ray the pyramid you put the detectors below where you think there is something and then a show and then you have a chance\nTo see his face a because the yarns will travel more rapidly through open air then you know through solid stone so if you have a space in the ... way of what you're what you're looking for than those nuance will arrive more rapidly and they ... and more often will arrive and you will be able to see that on the detector\nWould these detectors placed in the grand gallery could they be used to find the\n[noise]\nThe chambers that you are proposing in the upper half of the pyramid\n... um I think the reason why they're doing that is because they got criticized by an Egypt colleges are that the data maybe artifacts role and I think they using this angle to confirm that the big void is real\nBut it is possible to your point that in that in that particular field of scan of that yes that there could be some some at the lower ones maybe ah you know on the graphic if we go back\nUsed twice in our breaking news when it happens on five Seventy W.

all about it over at coast to coast am dot com ... church now our guests tonight is my new as safe as our day\nWe're talking about his new paper that was published last week\nThat seems to show up formula for finding new chambers in the great pyramid more beer phone calls and more with by new when we come back after this short break that says coast to coast am [noise]\nAnd I'm I'm I think offered a ... was telling me about this I think uh you can there's you can't stand in there if maybe six foot deep\nI'm but I'm not sure it goes anywhere I from my understanding is it's basically a blind LBJ but um but you know maybe there's something maybe there is a a hatch hiding somewhere but I don't know\nThat's the you know the most ... um they have a ... of course they have an extensive labyrinth charted under this thing's a and this was published in the thirties by a a chronic a person that was chronicling there was a crucial\nAnd she has a chart that shows all of that but you know to my knowledge there is no physical proof of it\nUm there is a a there's another blind pouch in the back of the things I'm One of them was caused by um you know by early researchers that were basically trying to force themselves\nAre into this things are looking for chambers and then you know the one that should be just mention of course we know from seismic analysis that they are here to our space is under this things\nAnd one of those basis specifically which is what Robert truck or a was studying uh years ago um is has a regular uh has corners and has seems to have a manmade sort of features and we think that um that\nMight be something in it that self interest\nYou know he did the seismic research there and the both of you are looking to go back a woods another research expedition to hopefully groom right\nYeah yeah first well what we\nAre what we would like to do first as to map this again with a you know a little bit more advanced uh five small graffiti and maybe electric conductivity studies and to really get a very detailed look especially the depth Jimmy that was the problem or you know if you if you remember there was a Japanese Group that came in eighty seven\nAnd ... and did exactly the same experiment and they saw space about two meters\nA deep and uh and and then Roberts ah you know did his studies ... a couple of years later\nAnd Robert is estimating that this phase is five meters deep so we have a little bit of a ... problem and then of course you know that's I of Boston marketing or drill in that area\nBut we think that they missed it uh and I mean they are they the the drill angle was too shallow and they were too far west from where we think the chamber is so they didn't really uh you know they didn't really use a good map\nTo guide them and of course they had other reasons why they were ... so what we want to do is you know just like a you know just like a radiologist you know when you first one to do a non invasive study and really find map the space\nAnd when we have a good idea where it is then with permission of course then we're try a small probe into that space and see what's at and\nHow amazing would it be to finally located dead hall of records that you know Edgar Casey has talked about there's this this this rumor has been going around yea for quite a while it would just be great to finally uh but the bed wouldn't\nOh absolutely we think that if we think there's a possibility that this chamber is filled with water and in fact when I was in Egypt a couple of weeks ago I was standing in front of the valley temple and sinks temple and there was a little depression and it's wet\nUm you can just you can just see neither the water coming up and if the if that is groundwater than it is in that chamber\nAnd so you know if if let's say if we find a chamber\nOr the very first thing we have to do is to a very slowly and meticulously drained a water out and rescue whatever might be inside a you know sufficient enough itself becomes a very difficult project but it's doable Robert thinks it's a it's doable you just have to do it really slowly\nJust speaking of the things that came in on Twitter this is from Baldwin is uh on Twitter and I have heard that it does things may have been a woman's face and that it was changed and that is why it's head is too small for words body\nYes [noise] well if we think we think\nIt was a female lie and so that part is partially we agree with that yes I don't think it was a person's head so um but we think that was a lie in us there before and the head of the line as was carved into a what we see today\nNow um I Know that you tend to be a little reticent to talk about alien jury tee when it comes to ... I leave all doors open myself but this comes in from Lucy in winter\nAnd and and this is I'm just gonna have to read this directly as ... images it seems like all of the pyramids in Mexico have an alien in this space craft depicted somewhere\n... any comments\n[noise] yeah I I Know I I remember reading this long time ago and I've found myself agreeing with that uh that's one way you could read it I you know I think that was Eric ... data can invite that originally that she's talking about the ...\nYeah right the lid off the uh South Africa's of ... right\nI have I have that's our topic is in my studio in the ... and I have a reproduction of it on the wall but and I stopped and I look at that Manu and I don't have any other way to look at that step for\nThe controls hand controls an oxygen mask same coming out of a a rocket motor on the bottom\nI I you know I don't have any problem with that I I think this is a this is one way you can explain it and everything is in this day and age everything's on tables you just said it we're going to Mars\nAre the odds that there is in ... I I Know somebody recently published an article saying that there may not be intelligent life out there but I think I think there is it's a very likely and especially the physics of of a of the universe you know the holographic universe I don't know if people are following this\nBut it you know there is one way that you can explain everything has a projection and if that's the case\nUh then just like Robert Duvall proposed in Cosby gloom there's a one way you can explain or some of these contacts is there may be a message that gets broadcasts across the universe through you know through um ah through a quantum fields\nAnd that message ends up on our end somehow it causes someone to do something that they otherwise wouldn't have like you know design a pyramid\nUm I think it's possible I I think it's on the table I'm not going to close my mind to it is but we have to have some proof I I I mean I'm I'm not going to embrace a theory like that until I see from solid proof of it but I think it's on the table\nLet's go to the international line right Robin Vancouver Rob really quick before we get a break what do you have for a minute\nAbsolute owners Richard ... is really quickly a notion struck me when you talk to her structured space for a look to make it quick quick jump some laundry\nLooking at the idea of a Greek skin or protect from all the trauma ... remembering John during the term papers a farming old knowledge building big ... structures\nWho's to say I mean I mean do you know regular people assume that the the ... the ah periods are solid\nDid they not maybe just struck traces the oh I Know you've heard of raw and everything [noise] arches side because nobody's Hempel\nYeah Rob go look at a news research paper on his website and and read through it that's a fact lead the conclusions are that by new is presenting in this paper my new we mentioned already six to eight and voids could there be more\nYeah so I I have to you know I've been I Need to have to mention shop here will do so of course proposed an internal ramp years ago um I think it was Eighteen years ago with Bob Brier they published a book\nAnd he proposed the these aren't logistics basis basically to get the stones up the pyramid and the scan from last year didn't show it but I think the theory is all that I think it's possible that the scanner was not sensitive enough to detect those spaces\nAnd then of course I'm proposing that this that there are spaces that are not necessarily logistic I'm saying that could be the logical and shop you dealt with probably disagree with me\nOr you know your review paper but she still thinks it's possible that there are logistical spaces in it but you know beat out of it may so we've got green there are probably space is up there and I just want to ask you a quick uh because\nThe chairman of course it's it's it's hot spaces inside research is in the sixties went to Africa pyramid because they thought it can how can it be that we have all these spaces inside you know corporate pyramid buddy ... all we have is built on each chamber\nWell let me jump in I've got to take a break right there but this is something we need to talk about when we come back our gas my new stateside eight this is all the great pyramid on coast to coast I'll be right back stay with us ...\nOn your mobile phone and say the key word free bottle\nEarly research

I I Want to recommend an author to you a merry I'm a David roles so he's a he's really done some excellent work on a ... a basically tracing biblical stories back to Egypt\nAnd so you may find some answers\nIt's producing a television series and he's with books about it um those are great documentary a couple of years ago by I think Timothy Mahoney if I remember this correctly [noise]\nUm but yeah I think it's an interesting subject I think uh I think the ah the early ... um when they were in Egypt um I think\nA ... for specially Joseph I'm that's what David role is describing Joseph real figure and uh I live in a in a in a place called a virus which is in the delta\nAnd had a palace and it was a it was basically a A N tuned in a pyramid and he was such an important official at the court\nAnd I'm a and then all of a sudden I'm you know this virus community disappears and does this archaeological evidence and well pieced together um and David role is basically saying that\nAh where are you are at war historians got it wrong is that they they were looking for the biblical story in a in the new king dome and it's it's David role is finding that it was probably a couple of centuries earlier\nThis I just came in on Twitter this is from Jay and Jay's says I heard that surgeon tools for found indeed to pyramids that doctors use now true or false\nUm I ... well what was found is that a is a a tool that looks like a ... a like a small it's like a fish tell\n'em what on I I'm not sure that was a ... tool but of course we don't know um it was found in the I think it was in the northern ... a shaft of the queen chamber by a Wayne ... Dickson\nUm and he uh and it's now in the British Museum a with a with a with a ground ball um but whether or not that was a surgery with ... and ... other than that I don't know of any surgical tools found inside of the games are pyramids\nLet's go to bill up in Oregon bill you're up next on Kos added Manu\nEmanu Hi Jimmy yeah this is a really academic discussion tonight and I've got nothing nothing against that I can graduate you on your discovery\nBut my question is um okay so I just want you to speculate a little bit if you just chambers or for construction in engineering could they be like for instance for architects to put gold on the ...\nOr could um if their theological could be you know some sort of burial chambers for for those are the king wanted to proceed him into the\nUm afterlife yeah great question down a great question bill I'm\nGlad I'm Glad you asked that because I Will speculate now I I'm I'm looking forward to speculating I think because there is obviously I'm proposing up to ten chambers house thinking well what if it's the logical what could that be and I think the answer is the end they add\nSo inherently up all is a day or the ... was known for the center of the warship often nine major God this kind of like the pantheon of off the ancient Egyptians\nAnd I think ah these chambers are dedicated to each one of these deities and and the one that's dedicated to sauce is the one that is the crucial chamber\nOr wherever we may find the kind of things that you just mentioned um but I'm suspecting there could be piracy ... and they are or what the inscriptions\nI'm so that would be very exciting if that if we're if that were ever to be found\nUm but I think it's along the lines of that and if it's a logistical then I'm all I think I'm with Trump here will die think this it's still on the table that there may have been space is there that\nFelt the workers to pull up the stones or to the top it's possible um and we'll just have to wait until next scan I think the next county will give us some new information\nNow I have heard some rumors minute that they have already gotten inside of the new chamber above the grand gallery and have removed items from there and they will be on display when the new grand museum opens next month\nYeah I I I'm not I happened to those rumors but um I Am a I wouldn't be all I wouldn't be completely surprised let's put it that way\nIt would certainly help the tourism I mean ... left right\nWhich has dropped off I Am heard you know you just got back from Egypt but I Am heard from so many friends that have been going to Egypt for decades\nAnd that you can as a tourist because in years past it was crowded all the buses were there you had to wait in line and there was a you know thousands of people on the ... the plateau but today you can burn truly be the only person there\nYeah that I had there was a couple of days when I felt like that Jimmy I um you know it was not\nThere were there are parts of think he's a toll where I was the only person walking around besides the guards and the camel riders\nSo yeah tourism has been down and they um you know they want to build a new museum and uh and of course they have to if they discover something they are they are going to show it to the world so that people come and look at it I that's why I'm hopeful that if they have something that they haven't shown us yet that we'll we'll find out about\nThis uh this is from Twitter this is from David I Love this question actually did the Nazis research Egypt areas as depicted in the raiders of the Lost Ark\n[laughter] oh that's a good question it is a great question it's a great question um\n[noise] you know I I I don't know I don't know for sure I Know that Germans did this once before before Nazi Germany um there there was off course German activity on the keys up there was actually a great American German a collaboration on the ... uh George ... from Harvard and uh\nAnd ... from a from the German a fun life sick\nAnd they were excavating them stop us in Iraq but this was more Nineteen you know ten Nineteen twelve and ... into the twenties and then when a Nazi Germany came about uh some of this was halted and there was a big break\n'em but specifically Nazi Germans what they did in Egypt I I don't think I can comment 'cause I don't know\nLet's go to a show out east in the Bronx Joe you're on next on goes\nHow you doing Jimmy I'm doing good Joe say Hi to my new\n[laughter] Hyman knew how I could take two\nGood uh yeah I wanted to ask you are in the case of the great pyramid is there any evidence that there are any any tunnels underground passage ways that would connect the great pyramid to other pyramids and the vicinity\nUsed twice in our breaking news when it happens on five Seventy W.

Casey energy tell your current current denial is rerouted around uh adjacent Mitt are under the pyramid and the purpose of it to generate electricity\nLarry let me ask you a question instead of you asking my new a question are you reading if I can answer absolutely if the uh you know and Christopher done and others have talked about uh the the pyramid being a machine and possibly a generator of power\nOr in energy all of that is the case Larry what would they have used it for\nOver ... to ... to provide a labor free\nEnergy\nYeah you know what and Larry thank you for the phone call my new that's exactly what a Christopher done as said to me last week while he's talked about it for years of Korea\nUm it wasn't a big revelation with me but that it was energy for the for the people of Cairo in Egypt\nYeah you know you know what I really love about Christopher done this that he he looks at the observations and he puts it into a model that is a completely uncovered by prejudices and biases\nHe just fits all the observations into a model and that as he ... you know if I if I were doing the investigation he'd be the first call\nTo have him on board um you know so I yeah I he's amazing ah absolutely I I Love the interview and I've read has worked before and very impressive person\nLet's go to wild card was go to Carol in Charleston D.C Carol you're up next on coast\nHi Carol hello Carol\n... ... ... several years ago\n... national me twice and both found some artifact I thought oh man found the plants hatchery him on that when I'm Around I hate to hear anything about you\nKnow I as far as I Know I I\nI haven't looked into this in detail as far as I Know for two of us not discover it but you know maybe it has been discovered and it's not published as possible\nAnd what was your second question Carol\nAh without being in archaeology is how do you go about getting involved with one in the ...\nYeah that's a great question ... so yeah I have to I Want to make sure I explained to her every one so I'm not an archaeologist I'm also not a a credential Egypt calls is this is for me it started as a hobby and all of course it's a serious endeavor\nUh but you have to be associated with an Institute a research place or university which I Am now I Am a you know association affiliated with Boston University\nUm and so then you can apply for permits and you have to you know you have to do the application you have to as\nA they have to review the application and they may say no and you don't have a recourse um you know so we'll have to see if they allow us but if it's not me it's okay or somebody else you know my my I think you know I wanted to get the information out there are other people can see it other researchers\nAnd they might be able to get a permit to investigate further and that's okay with me\nTo do the same thing Carol are you researching on your own now\nOn ... and it kind of like they found an addict carrying ... fan of that in the national news twice\nIn and Carol ... one of the things that that I like to do and I encourage others is blog right research and and and publish and self publish yourself and and continue because once you start to do that because I Do it myself and and certainly sodas Manu\nThat others out there\nAre attracted to you and they will find your information and then they start sharing their information with you and you suddenly have a network right in front of you so I I encourage that and I encourage blogging\nAnd creating your own website just like my new did and and look what happens in the end let's let's go east of the Rockies is going to Manuel in San Antonio Texas you're up next on ... Manuel\nThank you how you doing and I know a thing over because of baiting a what I what I wanted to know like the gentleman that called before a that there was that a bird or something\nOn the higher ... on on the the two of the game\nBut there was also one in a game out Peru and there was a little one the medical if those ... made the same thing if the bird move the same thing oh that's a good question because\nAnd you're putting my other question I wanted to know how ... August ... before when you say right off that money may cause a lot of money to do stuff in there\nYeah you're I'm Sorry I'm not hearing hearing the question\nI mean he was saying that you had brought up a ... why you answer this question that why hasn't this been brought up before and it always comes down to money that's where that was his point but the first\nThe birds that are represented throughout different cultures around the world on a different temples and and pyramids and right and we're seeing it over and over\nRight so the big the the the most important question in my mind okay which is probably the same question that ah you know or ... or early research has worked confronted with when they looked at the Egyptian lives", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "year": "2018", "city": "Yankton", "day": "15"}
