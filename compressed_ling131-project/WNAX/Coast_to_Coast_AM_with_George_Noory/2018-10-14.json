I'm a belief system mhm\nThat of course is nothing but fear\nHere is a control mechanism it's been used for centuries to control the population and it still used today right actively unfortunate way to control um ... you know societies\nOr we'll notice there's always an enemy and there's always some kind of thing that needs to be a feared and ... is that\nIs one of the great things that I think we have an opportunity to realize when we have an out of body experience you realize number one you were a mortal and it sounds a little grandiose putting in\nYou know that you know my God I'm more than my body I Am an immortal I'm I'm not some um week pathetic being that needs to be manipulated or told what to think uh you know I'm I'm a powerful non physical spiritual be\nAnd that's amazing shift in consciousness for the individual\nI Am more than my body it really does help you and your level of consciousness and\nForget about tiny problem in life that you feel are still large because our brains me in that way but they are insignificant when you compare and he'll\nTell our universe really is I'm Talking about I think beyond Bonnie yeah yeah\nAnd it was what's so important is for us to have our own transformation or experiences I think that's critical to our evolution individual and collectively otherwise when you have your own profound experience\nYou you you can no longer be manipulated by these external forces around you because you know better you just look at it like it it's just the drama it's the game that's being played all around us and you look at it like that\nAnd you know it and that's makes a difference you don't get sucked in for instance a political drama the day you don't get sucked into that stuff 'cause you realize it's a temporary drama\nAnd and you understand there was a bigger game it's foot here you know the big game is to know your true self to have your own profound experience\nSo that you know the answers for yourself and you're no longer on anyone else any belief system government religion you are free of all of that indoctrination and that's that is incredibly powerful\nYes and I think more of us need to understand that and get out of the the ... that we tend to get in with his Eric all news that we\n... if you're addicted to it and you realize that you know there's so much of a court and stuff that we need to know about ourselves the\nGreatest problem with humanity is a lack of knowledge of shelf ...\nThat's the core issue involved in all the ills that face humanity it's lack of knowledge himself if every one seven billion now but suddenly awoke one day I knew what we were\nAnd where we come from and where we're going there'd be no conflict there'd be no wars are being asked to learn that would occur\nBecause we would know better\nPay for it really truly knew we were all connected but there are just some beans on this planet we don't want to be connected with that theory doesn't work can we really truly I'll be connected to only the ones that want to be connected to [laughter]\nOr we go beyond the ego\nYeah we we were going to take another quick break and when we come back we're going to take your calls to give us a call and I only think I Need to take a stand you'll run\n\n\nWelcome back to ... to ... am Ryan Lee cigar and my guess William Beaumont is joining me his website again is astral in so dot org now uh we have great college ... college sure and has to go to\nJamie in Washington state first time caller here and coast to coast Jeannie when does your question\nA lot of the gun great what is your question my friend\nI'm curious if there's any a relative in between the out of body experiences and a memory loss\nGood question the question I mean not remembering the experience or memory loss in general\nCoalition a little bit of both are either long term memory and of the uh out of body experience itself\nBut not\nInterfering with your like everyday memory of needing to recall of certain things that you use all the time so to speak like war and stuff like that and drive in things like that [noise]\nOh I Would say definitely not a I can speak for myself for I think my memory um is excellent and I've been having out of body experiences for over forty years\nOr so I I well like I don't I don't see any ah um correlation\nLike a TV I Would be associated with memory loss and ... and I'm a she's when you have a brain trauma but not so much the out of body techniques it doesn't serve their brain memory patterns that All right\nNo I've not seen any correlation for that or [noise] um I absolutely not matter of fact a lot of people that have out of body experiences of an incredibly productive and lives in their late years like Robert my road did and others that are written many books\nI'm In their later years let's say [noise]\nSo if anything I think they're the opposite I think you're you open up potentially um certain pathways that enhance your ability to remember and to function\nSometimes the have you ever experience as Jamie an out of body sending\nAll of them than I\nCan relate to the phones ... showing a figure myself out so to speak you know yeah Mm make myself poll or whatnot with my phone she's so\nGreat now that's great thank you so much for your phone call I appreciate it yeah that's the\nOne of the techniques that William talks about is discovering yourself through out of body travel and I do like the fact that it doesn't and isn't associated with the TV I any type of trauma or brain injury we want to avoid those they\nThey're not fun no no and uh\nCertainly a lot of people do associate the two ... and it's and and it's not the case at all now granted there are people do a for instance a lot of people correlate near death with obese because obese are an element of near death\nBut the two were actually even obese are part of the near death experience there also independent of them so it's important a distinction to make\nIt interesting and I gave in New Jersey I well I like four days Elena night\nHey Lisa the call is coming from inside the studio\nAnd gas tank [laughter] right so\nThis is where it might get a little weird when I was he a lawyer I was growing up in a place called west town Pennsylvania we moved here when I was about to when I started getting visitation that with these patients they gave me\nI first saw of ... and they account for the school\nOr in fell down on the scale mode by hands both find days where there is so those two rows and an absolute scale it happened to ... to in the water ice on the night before had died but off they gave me a chance for a body\nI was younger I didn't know what it was used by our own\nFascinating is very cool so can be deeply competent is ...\nIs a cat and um there are multiple um experiences and reports of people that have ah let's just say knowledge of events\nAre not only in the past but in the future or what we would perceive as a future you know it's interesting that you bring this up when you leave your body there is no time as we know we look at time into linear but yet those of us who have out of body experience is quickly realize\nThat for instance you can live a life in five minutes\nIt's ... it's there is no time as we perceive it in non physical reality it's a whole ... all that that's why it's important to learn about the\nThe dynamics of error true home are true reality which is non physical ... everything functions and a little different than it does here [noise]\nUh and that's why it's important to begin to read or at least learn about how non physical reality functions\nThat fascinating can you ask him along and thinks he called my ... and ... can you ask in going into and out of body Syrians and media destiny question or\nHow does he get something out that really going into the future more than figuring out your ...\nYou can you can ask anything a matter of fact that's one of the things I Try to\nUm teach people is to be open to asking if you have a question asked to get the universe is willing to provide the answers your higher self or your higher mind however you perceive it\nIs launched to assist you if you're open to that assistance\nAnd there is no limit to what can be it let's just say obtained um there's literally no limit\n... but you have to ask yeah it's great to\nSee if he did he are a wildcard line berry in St Louis Hi Danny how are you\nHighly ... thanks for taking my call\nI had a question you your guest um years ago while we were a towel and by ... by we're really close to the past suddenly while we were out of town and um I wouldn't call back and I just didn't let my laps view him to be in a casket so I didn't go\nOff and I was upset about that and I had this dream and that was the police but at the time\nAnd that was chasing the suspect for about ... mall very familiar with but what I made the term I mean it was my dad he was standing there who right there and it wasn't fuzzy or not but it was my dad and I said to him I just said dad and he he held those hand up\nAnd he said you need to settle town it's okay and uh I I Want to talk to him but he was actually fainting out and I was I said to him I said dad don't leave please don't leave and he was gone I walked up\nBut after I woke up I stress and everything was all gone and I guess my question is\nWhy this dream because I was stressed out about it and it was in my imagination or or does she think that maybe that was my dad actually contacted me from the young ... you know life after death now settled down because it actually works\nYeah I think it was I mean that's reported by my God countless people report that kind of contact and often it's perceived as a dream like experience\nUh the universe it's a continuum of consciousness and dreams are part of that continuum and yes the people especially in within thirty days of an individual passing\nThe the the chance of contact is incredibly high\nAnd often will perceive it and the dream like environment because we're more open when our ego mind is when we fall asleep or Hugo mind set aside and we can begin to experience is but yeah I think that was a valid\nAbsolutely valid a contact ah I Know I've had that with my mother on many occasions and almost everybody I Know it's had some form of contact\nAnd that kind of regard

till the ghost\nOf Shirley actually sue was not happy with me I'm not long after that my nephew was living with me and he was only six years old at the time and he actually had his own bedroom with the on a ledge estate and he started talking about a ghost named sue\nOh I\nThought it was just so precious that he had this imaginary friend I had an imaginary friend when I was a child too and I didn't think much about it [noise] Wilson started telling him what to do\nLike oh in the beginning it was really sweet like oh sue made me eat those cookies that you told me not to eat\nAnd I'd be ... to you know innocent\nBut then\nUh I I I have to catch my breath because it really bothers me to even recall this story it is so hunting and chilling that my nephew begged me not to tell this story so when I wrote about it in my first book haunted managing springs I changed the name\nOf the people and how old was your nephew advertising at this time next okay in\nOne night in the middle of the night he came into our bedroom crying\nAnd he was covered in scratch marks and he was leading okay he was\nBleeding and it looked like he had been bitten all over his body and I pulled off his shirt and he was bruised and he was crying and he was so scared and I said what is happening to you and he had since his in his hands and I ran down to his room and he had got the ear off of our cat\nAnd he said the stew made him do it oh dear you said stew [laughter] I'm\nSorry he kept calling it's due this goes stew it wasn't sue I'm Sorry it was too well it was after about two or three months my nephew had his speech and pet him and and really what he was saying was soon he was saying sue and that was the former owners name\nThe one that died now the one that did not like me anymore right for and before oh\nIt was awful he said to me stupid doesn't want you any here anymore\nAnd then how would you do did you\nOh my gosh I was so frightened you just even to recall it and like I said my nephew doesn't even like me to tell the story um it it was\n... we had to I we had no choice right had no choice oh where did you do that oh we had no choice and then\nIf it's if it's to make matters even worse is like I told you I was having these um haunted wine and cheese parties and like I said in the beginning I just thought it was fun it was like oh that's silly stew\nHe stole something again you know and I might find oh my eyeglasses in the freezer or [laughter] or they might be missing completely for a week and then I might find them outside in the driveway it was just kind of ... in the beginning and and and fairly innocent\nBut what I really think happened was not only did we have the ghost of the former owner there but um because see remember it was hunted before we bought it supposedly\nSeveral owners or several people wins or men you know I'm just going to say\nThat what what we ended up finding out was that it was the sign up for it all it is it's the stream only strongly haunted still I'm ... and you are still living there\nNo milk no after five years we did get out we got out and the day that we left\nThe day that we decided we had to leave every single doorbell and the house was going off with was a four story home and we had doorbell is on every level and we took the doorbell about the batteries out of the doorbell\nOn the first level and then the second level went off we took those batteries out the third level went off it it felt like they were driving as crazy\nLike driving you out would happen celebrating what came of that place what would happen to it\nWill actually after we sold it then the Maddox family bought it and this was in two thousand five and they just sold it about two years ago but wildly owned it and two thousand fourteen\nOn a ledge was voted number six on the nation's top ten most haunted places just behind the lazy boarding house\nBy USA Today and the Huffington Post\nWho would buy something like that\nIt actually you know what about talk about true beauty what happened with this house is that it was actually bought by someone who turned it into a Buddhist\nA Buddhist retreat and it's wonderful because last I heard is that they cleared all the spirits away and that the house is happy again so I Am really\nGlad that would take a lot of work but they have done so much work than men with ...\nExperts and they uh they change the gardening they change the direction of certain\nYou know that really worth\nIt apparently it worked because it it's it's free [laughter]\nFascinating sure about a hundred\nYears yeah it was tremendously haunted and then later after you know me being a historian and everything I wanted to know why the house was so haunted [laughter]\nAnd I won't get into that right\nNow I did find\nOut that there was a reason there always is anytime something tragic all horrible happens it leaves a psychic in in print or bruises if you will that can be felt by some people and I'm One of those people unfortunately\nWell at least you know that about yourself some people may feel it and not know how to interpret those feelings or interpret things that are happening in their lives and all\nThis is so interesting that you should bring this up because I'm actually my children's stepmother um their mother died of cancer when they were one and three years old\nAnd so um they're both very smart people on both of them there have their doctorate degree my son interesting enough um is a doctor at Stanford right now and he was the only one in our family who never saw a ghost when we were living it on a ledge or experience something paranormal\nAnd I really believe it was because he just didn't want to\nKnow he had an analytical mind do you want to become a doctor for exactly he\nTotally turned it out so all these years I think he you know he always thought that I was a little bit crazy until\nI knew when to know what he does is friends do ya my mom's go turn [laughter] and ah\nIt it's it's it's a it's it's kind of sweet being validated finally [laughter]\nOh it has ... did you\nOh yeah he believes me now he knows I'm good storyteller anyway\nWell that's that's what it's all about everything's about storytelling now you\nStrings right tell us a little of the history of that area\nWell I only had one and this is the most taunted I call it a hunted heart of the Rockies and I'm not alone I came here to Nicholas halfway right yes oh\nWell this was his home base he is to hang out here all the time we have a lot of lightning hair you know where we live another ... he's ... and I'm so he actually built a lab on the top I think he may have fascinated with manages springs especially because we had some very curious magnetic\nAnomalies in our town I can actually walk that might come this around the perimeter demanded his springs on these ethical hiking trails that we had\nAnd my whole shaking my head and never find true north I hit you're not the the Indian American Native American knew about these\nSacred places and any place in the trees actually ... Adam sideways and it's just curious about the hair on my back on my arms and my neck will go up to ... um you can feel it um and the other thing that's curious about it is that\nBecause these magnetic anomaly I'm Nicole that's what actually noticed I Believe he was standing outside of the clip has hotel and he was watching as the bird um we're just\nGoing over managed his friend was like they didn't have any sense of direction\nLike their innate sense they're ready to find their way to North or south was gone and you know they had birds have a little piece of hepatitis crystal and their brain and it would be he was he must speculating that maybe\nBecause of the magnetic anomalies bred for hunting confused\nBecause they were actually having a very strange\nManner by like\nDiving into buildings and and like I don't know how the pilot [laughter] interesting\nIt really is a very special place that is fascinating we will find out more about manatees Springs Colorado when we come back but my guess that's any water I Am sick argument sending to coast to coast am\nStephanie waters and she is only a professional storage or as we can tell but she's also the owner of the blue moon hunted history tours in Colorado\nSo Stephanie tell us a little bit more about the ... we were just talking about men or two springs and how it has this incredible magnetic anomaly there wherever else in Colorado and why specifically Colorado did it just called you\nUm I think another reason why I'm that people were drawn to manage to spring or spiritual reasons is because\nOriginally this was a sanctuary to five warring Native American tribes and when they came here they had a pact between them that they would not\nFight when they were here this was their holy sanctuary so they would wipe out their war paint and put down their weapons and there was peace here forever until the Victorians came along and the legend is that we started building you know the hotels and\nWhat have you right over their natural minerals springs that was sacred to them and that the native is actually the town after that and that's why it's so hot that make sense to me [laughter]\nYeah it does yeah does now you live there\nI Do ... and you like it [laughter] I hate you\nBut you know what you have to be careful if you live here and I am not kidding you I'm I'll tell you what happened to OK a year ago with September eleventh I was taking a beautiful morning walk up the trail and I ran into a dead body hanging from the bridge\nNow this for you Deb body it was awful he said he was suicide\nUm tend to find out it was a homeless person and it was awful but you know it rocked my world and I started talking to people here in this town about what is wrong with people here there is a\nHigh incidence of drug abuse and alcoholism and I believe it's because the people here have not learned how to um processes that they\nThey don't know how to channel the energy has managed to that is the legend that that's why they're so are there are so many artists dancer singer musicians that live in this town because they can feel the energy but if you don't properly channel this energy for the powers of good [laughter]\nIf you actually get into a negative mind spot or you don't create because if you're an artist and you live here you have to create and if you don't eat it will turn against you it will become a negative force and I know that because it happened to me when I first moved\nHere [laughter] ah and I see it happening to other people were not one of them my a godsend moved in with me\nHelp him out he was going through a hard time and I have this beautiful addict apartment two bedrooms and a kitchen and bathroom and I said he could live there for free just needed to get a job he was only here for a week and he you know the ... the spirit of mandatory Wilber\nTook him and he goes I can see what I can feel it I've never felt so good in my life you know [laughter] I said well you got to be careful well he burned out and about ... months then [laughter] and it was really sad\nHow do you suggest people process and energy wherever they live if it's a haunted house or if it's a a relative how do you channel that energy\nWell I definitely don't want to be around in a negative energy anymore like I said I I Try to keep you know a healthy attitude about it if if I can just call it bad [laughter]\nBecause you have to think about this why is it goes here why aren't they lingering that can't be good [laughter]\nBecause there is on his own business right\nWell yeah but I mean that's that's that's a lot of anger too if you think about it and [noise] um what do you say that I\nCan you would have to have a lot of anger to beast it to be tethered here um if you are a full life and full of love and full of Christ consciousness whatever you want to call it [laughter] I don't think you'd be tethered here after life I think that you would want to move on and toward the light I'm\nNot a good point there do these beings want to see each other here to to disrupt people because they have a grudge\nWell some of them I Believe our conscious and some of them I don't think that they know that they are here still but they're they're all troubled I you know I Love these stories when people go to bed and breakfast is haunted but only by a friendly spirit I'm like give me a great\nThere are no such thing as a friendly those Casper or otherwise\nWill because it why would they why would they state that's a good point\nIt's ... it's going in and when you said was this okay it can it can lead you\nDown a dark road okay I've seen it happen to my friends I mean I don't watch TV and I haven't for Twenty years and it's funny that I'm In this business because now all these goes hunting shows that are on television\nAnd I guess in the last year or two you hear all these stories about these people that are on these goes hunting ship that shows and they kill each other and [laughter] you heard about this stuff I think they get involved into a dark force you know it's nothing to play around with\nOur own goes troubled and our own lives that\nI Believe so I think that everyone has a different opinion now I Want to tell you something this last book that I just wrote was actually written because of a ghost\nI was called on the telephone to write a story to help this poor person who has been demonized for the last hundred years I helped her cross over by writing this last book and I have that that is a matter of fact\nIs that been forgotten jails and Colorado is\nBoth legends allure of the Rockies by shit for and it just came out and the very first story is true I Swear to God\nKnows about it [laughter] pardon Jones about it\nOkay about its they'd actually begins in Nineteen eighty five I was a college student and I decided to go to this little mining town to um interview the owners of this old theater and I'm not going to mention the theater 'cause I Want people to buy my book [laughter]\nAnyway they go to I go to the theater and I have an amazing paranormal experience where I actually saw the former owner of the theater and she was crying and she was upset\nBecause her name had been tainted\nWell I didn't know what to do when I got back to school I'm not going to write this story they are going to think I'm not ... I did not tell this story to anyone you know I've been single since I was a little kid so some time to just put it out in my mind and don't tell anyone\nOkay so now flash forward to two thousand sixteen I have written for books on those legends lord of the Rocky Mountains and was quite happy to rest on my little Rory laurels and I ... out of the blue dot a telephone call\nFrom the Colorado alarm company about an intrusion signal\nOn Harrison Avenue and those historians out there might know where that is my only a historian with no where that was and that being said this was a message left on my home number now\nI was getting ready to take a walk I heard the phone rang and I was like I'm not going to get it but something told me to get it so five minutes later I went and checked the phone and I'm like oh my gosh this is an intrusion signal at the at the this place you know\nIn the mountains and I'm like let me see I'm three hours a day\nAnd and furthermore I mean only I Would know where this place is 'cause I'm a historian I mean this was really weird not even the same area code or anything so I called the Colorado alarm can be right back and I said why are you calling me is your check number I don't even have the same area code as as this place\nAnd it was a man that answered the phone and it was a woman's voice on my answering machine and the man said I don't know what you're talking about lady and I gave my phone number and he goes we didn't call your house\nAnd I said I got it on my answering machine he goes I don't know what you're talking about you're going to have to take this up with a theater [laughter] I call the police department and I said you know your alarms going off at the theater and they go yeah I got were on our way [laughter]\nReally next morning I called the mayor of this town on what's happening I called the mayor I called the theater I told everybody I couldn't nobody can give me an answer\nSo did you do have that voice on yet\nSo I might everybody listen to the first person I called was one of my dear friends dory spent my business partner she is a psych and she's been on good morning America she's pretty well known and when I said don't let the devil is going on with this and she listens to the tapes you know on my tape recorder on my answering machine I let her listen to it\nAnd she went into a trance and she did a reading and she we found out that I had the same birthday as the former owner of this I'm\nOld theater and a lot more in common that was just mind blowing and my friend said to me you were destined to write a story about this crying goes\nBecause she is very sad that she has been deemed when all these all these years and no one has hurt her side of the story and she wants you to correct it for her and I said you're kidding me and I said she goes no no I'm not saying you so I called I called the um\nThe manager of this theater and I told her all of this I go I Know you're going to be ... thinks I'm Crazy relation\nTo this message and she calls me back and she goes I Want you to come up here by himself all alone watch the theaters closed in the winter okay and I said well it's the November

baptized by water every seven years and so it seems to be true\nNow I looked into this and I'm like going All right well when's the last time that we've actually had somebody tried to remove the curse\nAnd it was back in two thousand\nAnd what happened was in Nineteen Ninety nine we had a huge flood again and it wiped out our spot building and it was almost going to be demolished the Murphy company came in and they spent uh quite a lot of money to have this\nBuilding completely Reagan got it because it had to get rid of all this suspect this and that was like three million dollars right there [laughter] but anyway just to make sure that their investment was not going to be flooded\nThey actually asked five members of the Native American Indian canceled come here and do a healing right over the town and over the spot building\nAnd I actually read the article in the Colorado Springs does that and it said after they did the healing ritual in front of the ... building that five crows flew up into the air\nAnd not even being able to find true not north flew\nInto the building and crashed I'm not kidding you you've got if you want to look it up as easy to do\nLooking at an omen I\nDon't know but you know what in two thousand Thirteen it flooded again it didn't work\nNow right yeah if it was like in elementary maybe they shouldn't field there again yeah me not to put a concept I mean there are\nCertain things to be said for the history tours and things that are being done and you could land ... or ... being built and so forth where the fine line there to honor and respect the lure of that particular land\nI I say thanks every day you know to the good lord to the spirits that be to the land that be and I give that there is a legend about managed to springs that you're not allowed to leave and unless you ask for permission or less you're ready to leave you\nCome here because you are supposed to learn a lesson you don't come here because it's a choice you Martin summoned to this town\nAnd I know that sounds crazy but I have talked to so many people over the years and I always ask them I said so what brought you to manage to springs hallways the same story it was the weirdest thing you know I never planned on moving here and my car ran out of gas and\nStuff like that and when you hear so many of them you know this isn't a coincidence\nInteresting so let's go back to the idea of what to do if you are sensitive to those types of energy or maybe you have a ghost in your house or\nSomething that might be visiting you what what do you suggest to people that maybe don't want you want to be to transition want to move on already yeah\nSee I think that when someone dies\nThat I I Want to ... make sure that I don't offend anybody is religious or spiritual beliefs this is these are just my feelings\nI think when someone dies for the first three days or so that maybe this ... that they stay here some people believe that some you know maybe you just hang around to see her funeral and then you leave if you're not both [laughter] um\nOther stay right up but if there is a lingering energy in your home get rid of it or move [laughter]\nIt's usually owned that particular person I didn't\nSee I earlier in the conversation I did say the my house has haunted that I live in now and that\nI Want to say but the ... that it is it used to be the pikes peak Bible college that has a very interesting history and anyhow the other day band that it is that the veil is so thin this time of year I actually heard choir and music in my house I've lived here for Fifteen\nYears have never heard that before when I ran into the dining room and then it it ceased [laughter]\nI Know it was inside of my house I heard it my dogs hurt it they were howling like is going on\nI think that's a residual it's like a bird in time in a quantum physicist can explain it better than I can but I just think of it is like Brent toast you can still smell the burnt [laughter] it's gone yeah I\nLived in time makes more sense where it could be a coming back into this dimension temporarily in a split second\nYes and see that doesn't have a consciousness the choir music that I heard did not have a consciousness\nWho you mean by no means it was just like I heard it in the room like some it was a burping time does that make\nSense to have a conscious it's yeah it's\nJust music that I heard like they came through sometimes believe it or not I can hear the trains that used to run behind my house\nAnd Senate ran in over a hundred years yeah so yeah when I hear\nIt so I don't know other people do [laughter]\nDo you have anybody around but you could ask a much\nMore in tune with the higher laws of nature as I say it delicately they can they can pick up on it to have children especially that's why I Love it when when little children come on my tour is because um I turn it down a little bit so I don't scare them so much but ah the kids have a great time because they haven't been taught not to the\nRight to read so back to where people feel that they're afraid of goes through saying that they're not usually wanting to say they want to move on or they should move on and move\nOn I think it would be like you know when you're hungry you just know to eat\nAnd how do you help but being do that how would you suggest or how would you teach someone to us and this goes to move on\nWell you can always try talking to it at the I Swear it works and what would you ask\nI tell it are you that you need to move on you know you're not supposed to be here anymore and I know this is your house and you love it but you are not supposed to be here anymore your loved ones that are waiting for you on the other side you need to go\nAnd just talk to them like the common person would talk to anyone who was scared and confused the beans are just like they were on earth and some of them get caught here it's it's really sad if you think about these those centers that go out and our teasing them like they're\nLike they're like in the zoo or something you know he's not very nice\nLooking Ghostbusters where they could vacuum them up and put them into two yeah when you asked this where you say to this this entity that might be hanging around and causing Mr move on ... ... why do people get scared\nI think that you know what those timing is addicting first of all it is so fascinating we've all been fascinating with what's on the other side and then once you have validation I tell you what it does not stop it that it's like gambling or something you've opens\nUp a whole new world upon the moon and I can't\nBelieve this happened and then you do feel special because so many people want a validation that there is life after death let's be honest and when you do have it happen it blows your mind and you will never forget it and you will never let anyone talk you out of what you saw the that's what happened to me when I was a child\nMy parents told me that it was because they brought me on the head when I was a baby\nTo imagine that you know\nSo I mean they all my life I was told that I was crazy and I'm not [laughter] people have had a\nHabit enthusiastic I Would say [laughter] but now which do you started this wonderful conventions paranormal mentioned travels to various areas tell us a little bit about\n[noise] well um we call it a mood move all these like I said and so when we go into different areas the very very very first thing that we do is we contacted the local historians\nAnd the local goes hunting groups and we say we want to be your advocate we are here to help you and your community it do you need to get rid of any does we're here we're not going to be like those guys though were really like I Would call us paranormal psychologist [laughter]\n... yes\nAnd that's what we do and we're very kind and we're and we try to talk them over or do whatever we can write a book [laughter]\nSo when you do the tours you have a group to comes with you and it's more of an active type of tour right\nMy two words are it's because the town itself is very active and this is how I Do my tour is um if you look at my website managed to lead since that time you will see that there's very little information on there after Seventeen years there's a reason for that\nI don't have a meeting sites because before my tours I actually do a prayer and a meditation on ask for the spirits which one wants to come out and talk tonight so the tours do change night by night and you never know which there is going to come out and play quite interesting\nDo they do say it was Pacific date and time and all that you think are not as validating\nNo I didn't say that at all I'm just saying that's how I run my tours okay\nAre always different they always change because that's how the paranormal is it's always changing it's always different ... there are some spirits that are pretty consistent but I called ghost hunting as much like fishing I mean as much as I Love to go fishing sometimes I don't catch a darn thing\nHow does hunting as you just never know what's gonna happen and then sometimes he'll it'll be hot you catch it on check\nOut like that and that's all right we're going to take a quick break and they weren't going to come back we're listening ear phone calls and he goes to experience is a question of the ... definitely wanted to call and the guy you're listening to ... am [noise]\nI think that you have been asking for a resolution and asking for some kind of the sign to come to you and and that is

among roe Institute which by the way I'm calling from\nHow great it is only\nTwenty four people can attend it's a world renowned as being the center for the exploration of consciousness but in my workshop\nI'm generally what I mean each person is in a check unit or Bob Monroe had a real thing for a but he's ... and\nUm what is that controlled holistic\nEnvironmental chamber in other words each person's in and personal isolation both\nAnd I speak to them when we're doing a technique through headphones so everybody's in their own isolation chamber and then I present\nEmmys sink which is a ... a ... brain synchronization kinds of technology plus guided meditation and we do five of these day typically\nAnd more with the idea here is to guide each person to go into a nice deep meditative state\nAnd every person listening in their own isolation chamber through the headphone\nNow hit like a cubicle or a ... and a client or how you know it's\nA it's a it's a cubicle each person has their own\nThe size of like a single bad okay and you can it's you can close it off completely you can block out um\nIt's the whole idea is to create an isolation chamber why is that because you can go deeper with no or external stimulus factions like I'm In many ways the same concept behind um\nFlu chambers exempt in this case you're not floating you're you're in this this controlled unit and all the sound is piped into the room of we use special technologies like him he sank\nHands headphones on\nYes everybody wears headphones and I talk to them in their control unit and guide them through these series of exercises\nSo they don't feel a loner isolated right\nNo that's the idea you are isolated\nI mean they don't feel alone because you have headphones on you know they\nThey're listening through headphones and exercise minor typically about a Fifteen minutes long each one\nAnd and people go on these incredible journey your friend who's been there several times on wet when he had he

will be technology it's been around for a long time that helps us to go deeper faster that's a concept\nOkay All right and then where do you go on this journey where would you and I know that ... that you take people to kind of a song and I'm right\nWell there is a yes or relaxation I use sometimes what would be considered to be light hypnosis\nUm there's different progression setter used but it's basically a meditative type of program that guided often guided where you would just go along with the program\nAnd um and have your own experience everybody has different experiences\nDuring even my program I'm teaching people how to self initiate their own out of body experience but in my class for instance people have passed fly for aggressions mhm they have contact\nWith all kinds of such as say a non physical being different kinds everybody has their own type of experience when we open up to her inner self people experience different kinds of\nAh let's just say ... opening a mind opening expansive experiences mhm so it's not limited to just out of body experiences\nA for instance past life or ... or regression type flashes are quite common\nAnd there's the whole idea is to open up to this inner party yourself for the answers are where you can begin\nTo explore your true self into open up to that awakened to that multi dimensional self within you\nKnow it's like to question could you ask\nYourself and then you write them down when you come out and there's like write it down right away\nYes what I always suggest is that right after the exercise you everybody receipt gets a journal or they bring a journal and you immediately after the exercise you begin to journal\nWhatever in whatever kind of information may have come to you or imagery 'cause information can be\nTransmitted many different ways\nIt's not necessarily all the boy can be imagery or through a just a um memory download or all kinds of ways so it's it's important to be open to the way that you receive information\nBut uh people have all kinds of profound experiences\nAnd they awakened to\nTheir their true self and they're the answers within them\nMhm yeah so the implication that personal growth in the spiritual awakening that are happening in the can really be transformational and I like it because you find your house to them I mean and when you're\nStanding you William have died in the direction that\nI Would have my own personal experience now my friend mine that scene is going to get on the civil war she said that she has in the past encountered those that need help and I think that's fascinating councils\nCure a we actually have an entire class devoted to that where people meet and guide those people that just me need assistance\nOr that's but that will happen in um in all the classes that can happen I that comes up in my class as well or where people have contact and um provide guidance let's say to\nThat and there are people that have died but they are law store for instance someone that may have died um quickly and they're just disoriented and they may need some assistance\nI I think that that type of thing does happen quite a bit and I'm at a ... that\nThe Monroe Institute we offer sixteen different classes and one of those classes focuses on that type of guidance it's called guidelines\nI'm which I'm you're trained to literally assist the

I was practicing out of body experiences uh during nine eleven era\nAt myself and I received a lot of contact ah during that period of time um that was a that was one of those events where there was a lot of people that were just totally disoriented let's put it that way to manage and you're having coffee one morning and your office\nAnd suddenly your entire body is gone\nI mean can you imagine I mean it's hard for us to even wrap our minds around that so there was a lot of people that we're assisting those um people that died and this is a this is an ongoing process it's done but\nMany around the world and it it functions in different names and different cultures\nBut nothing Darwin's deterred we we presented in I\nThink I'm more or let's just say I'm very grounded in a scientific waves at least the scientific as we can do\nAbout that goes for all the training here there are it's done in a way that's presented in a very logical way that um understandable with no cultural or religious overtones another word\nWhich is yeah which is great because really allow the person to have their own experience that then all of that\nI Want to find out a little bit more about what are the culture or does it and what it's called another culture or going to take a quick break William thank you so much and when we come back we'll talk about what are the culture just exist and and also a little bit more on how you can do that on your own\nMessages deer ... burning your degree from one of the top business schools in the country might sound impossible to fit into your workload\nBut what if there were a business degree that further your career and give you access to world renowned faculty leaders and mentors\nAll on your schedule one that open doors to some of the most influential CEOs tech companies law firms entrepreneur and thought leaders and what if you could earn that degree in his little less sixteen months one hundred percent on line\nTo find out more text path to seven nine six four or five that's P.

exploration\nNot to the trauma that to an actual workshop or it sounds fun regulated type of out of body exploration is just a thing and it's also\nWell done it's very well done it and something that William Bowman has led for almost Twenty years that have been railing typically but this is something you can do on your own William where what other cultures has this existed in history\n[noise] a leash or from the very beginning of time I'm Out of body experiences are probably the quintessential I'm\nA way that throughout history people had profound experiences I mean look at the biblical by revelations begins with I was in the spirit and if you look back to all the biblical text all the transformational type of experiences people\nTheir their consciousness was projected or extended let's say beyond their physical limits\nAnd that is in itself a form of out of body exploration it shifted to was in two thousand years ago wasn't called but on the train it goes all the way back to ancient Hindu the Buddhist text [noise]\nUm [noise] to every culture and religion known to man if you start to read it objectively you'll see their comments about this uh I was in the spirit or our ways beyond my physical body let's put it that way and there they had this profound experience\n[noise] how can an out of body experience validate life after life\n[noise] well it gives you that infinite number one or two shocker for many people just to be aware of the fact that oh my God I continue to verification bat you continue beyond your body\nAnd that's a that's a ... in itself a big life change or for people it's weakening cause then they realize oh my God there's I continue there's other things that are that are going on beyond a single ...\nAnd it really opens people's minds to the potential what they are [noise] think about it there's a seven and a half billion people on the planet and people don't have a clue where they're going to death they don't know where they come from before they were born and they don't know really what\nAnd then being because they were they found themselves in the human body ... but in actuality consciousness\nUh can take on any for I I Know from having out of body experiences encountering all kinds of life forms including by the way animals\nMany people contact a love love pets six cetera during their out of body experiences and the pets are having out of body experience to\nSee any new ones that have crossed over all day\nOr even the ones that are alive I write about this my first book where my my dog McGregor would would follow me out of body and I also had a cat that would do that I mean this this is er just real events that are happening the fascinating\nPeople all over the world I mean we're a multi dimensional beans that's what we are and are biological body you know we have to realize we're not we're not biological beings we're only here for a very brief period of time\nAnd then we exit and we move on to another state of consciousness and another energy body and that's what we've discovered without a body exploration\nIs that it's multi dimensional and that death is in a ... really I'm no no that's been said but once you encounter and experience and communicate with loved ones who are passed and you're doing this face to face\nThis is life changing you no longer need a psychic the actors the intermediary you you you're empowered to discover the answers for yourself\nAnd really to find out what kind of journey or we all on 'cause this is an amazing journey of consciousness we all share\nYeah it is but you know what I did see that I just interviewed Raymond Moody unlike guy in show and you know the ... the grandfather and clean the term life after death and\nUm he had expressed to me after Fifteen Years doing that that he doesn't know for sure\nThat that yeah flights have to get things just because scientists agree it's never really been proven even though he's heard thousands and thousands of poor people who live\nHere in his life ... life ... ... he killed doesn't as a scientist as a location right now I Know for sure is\nExactly why self initiated out of body exploration is so important because you get that verification absolute personal verification that you need books\nStudy research will never give you that kind of verification you can read a thousand books\nYou could spend your entire lifetime studying this topic and it's not going to give you the inside and the verification you'll get from one out of body experience\nBecause suddenly you know you go from being a researcher or a believer to an hour and that's the big huge step that all of humanity I think is moving towards\nI mean we need to we need to wake up to what we truly are\n... and to get away from this big green

I'm a belief system mhm\nThat of course is nothing but fear here is a controlling mechanism it's been used for centuries to control the population out and it's still used today actively unfortunately to control um ... you know society\nOr we'll notice there's always an enemy and there's always some kind of thing that needs to be feared\nAnd ... that is one of the great things that I think we have an opportunity to realize when when you have an out of body experience you realize number one you were a mortal and it sounds a little grandiose putting in you know that you know my God\nI'm more than my body I Am a mortal I'm I'm not some um week pathetic being that needs to be manipulated or told what to think uh you know I'm I'm a powerful non physical spiritual be\nAnd that's amazing shift in consciousness for the individual\nI Am more than my body it really does help you and your level of consciousness and\nForget about tiny problem in life that you feel are still large because our brain that way but really they are insignificant when you compare and he'll\nTell down our universe really is talking about being beyond funny yeah yeah\nAnd it was what's so important is for us to have her own transformation or experiences I think that's critical to our evolution individual and collectively otherwise when you have your own profound experience\nYou you you can no longer be manipulated by these external forces around you because you know better you just look at it like it it's just the drama it's the game that's being played all around us and you look at it like that\nAnd you know it and that's makes a difference you don't get sucked in for instance a political drama that that you don't get sucked into that stuff 'cause you realize it's a temporary drama\nAnd and you understand there was a bigger game it's foot here you know the big game is to know your true self to have your own profound experience so that you\nAnd you're no longer on of anyone else any belief system government religion you are free of all that indoctrination and that ... that is incredibly powerful\nYes and I think more of us need to understand that and get out of the the ... that we tend to get in with his Eric all news that we now have\nYou ever did kill it and you realize it's you know there's so much important stuff that we need to know about ourselves the greatest album which humanity is a lack of knowledge of self ...\nThat's the core issue involved in all the ills that face humanity it's lack of knowledge himself if every one seven billion of it's suddenly your work one day and knew what we were\nAnd where we come from and where we're going there'd be no conflict there'd be no wars or be no I Know a lot of that would occur\nBecause we would know better\nIf we really truly knew we were all connect and there are just some beans on this planet we don't want to be connected with that theory doesn't work can we really truly I'll be connected to only the ones that want to be connected to [laughter]\nWe go beyond the ego\nYeah we we were going to take another quick break and when we come back we're going to take your\nCalls to feel free to give us a call and I only think I can listen ... damn run\n\n\nWelcome back to coast to coast am Ryan Lee cigar and my guess William Bowman is joining me his website again his ass troll info dot org now uh we have great color come in William you may cause sure and has to go to\nJamie in Washington state first time caller here and coast to coast and Jamie when is your question\nA lot of the gun great what is your question my friend\nI'm curious if there's any a relative in between the out of body experiences and a memory loss\nGood question the question I mean not remembering the experience or memory loss in general\nCoalition a little bit of both are either long term\nMemory and of the uh out of body experience itself but not interfering with your like everyday memory of\nNeeding to recall of certain things that you use all the time so to speak like war and stuff like that and drive and things like that [noise] oh I Would\nSay definitely not a I can speak for myself I think my memory is excellent and I've been having out of body experiences for over forty years\nOr so I I well like I don't see any ah um correlation\nLike a TV I Would be associated with memory loss and ... and I'm issues when you have a brain trauma but not so much the out of body techniques that doesn't just served their brain memory patterns that All right\nNo I've not seen any correlation for that or [noise] um I absolutely not matter of fact a lot of people that have out of body experiences of an incredibly productive and lives in their late years like Robert my road did and others that are written a book [noise]\nUm in their later years let's say [noise]\nSo if anything I think they're the opposite I think you open up potentially um certain pathways that enhanced your ability to remember and to function\nSometimes the have you ever experienced is Jamie an out of body said\n\nMm showed them than I\nCan relate to thinking that I'm just trying to figure myself out so to speak you know yeah ... ... that's a whole ... now with my phone she's so\nNow that's great thank you so much for your phone call I appreciate it yeah that's the\nOne of the techniques that William talks about is discovering yourself through out of body travel and I do like the fact that it doesn't and isn't associated with the TV I any type of trauma or brain injury we want to avoid those they they're not fun\nA lot of people do associate the two ... and it's and and it's not the case at all and now granted there are people do a for instance a lot of people correlate near death with obese because obese or an element of near death\nBut the two were actually even though ... ... ... are part of the near death experience there also independent of them so it's important distinction to make\nIt interesting and I gave in New Jersey I ... for Danes hell I ate and ate\nHey Lisa the call is coming from inside the studio\nFantastic [laughter] All right so\nThis is where it might get a little where what I was he a lawyer I was growing up in a place called west town Pennsylvania we moved here when I was about to when I started getting visitation\nThat with these patients they gave me um I first saw ... de account for the school\nWhere I fell down a scapegoat by hands both find days where there are so those two rows and an absolute scale it happened ... two in the water I saw the night before and the Dow but off they gave me a chance for our body\nI was younger I didn't know what it was how you liar own\nFascinating very cool so you can be deeply ... it is\nYes they can um there are multiple um experiences and reports of people that have a\nLet's just say knowledge of events are not only in the past but in the future or what we would perceive that the future\nYou know it's interesting that you bring this up when you leave your body there is no time as we know we look at time is linear but yet those of us who have out of body experiences quickly realize\nThat for instance you can live a life in five minutes\nIt's ... it's there is no time as we perceive it in non physical reality it's a whole ... all that that's why it's important to learn about the\nThe dynamics of our true home are true reality which is non physical 'cause everything functions in a little different than it does here [noise]\nUh and that's why it's important to begin to read or at least learn about how non physical reality functions\nThat fascinating can you answer skin along and thinks he called my pre shake and William can you asked in going into and out of body Syrians and Canadian destiny question or\nHow does she get something out that really going into the future more than the hearing out your ...\nYou can you can ask anything matter of fact that's one of the things I Try to\nUm teach people is to be open to asking if you have a question asked to get the universe is willing to provide the answers your higher self or your higher mind however you perceive it\nIs launched to assist you if you're open to that assistance and there is no limit to what can be\nIt let's just say obtained um there's literally no limit ... but you have to ask\nYeah it's great I see that you are a wildcard lined you berry in St Louis Hi Danny how you\nHighly ... take my call\nI had a question you your guest um\nYears ago while we were a child and my dad and I have a really close to the past suddenly while we were out of town and um I wouldn't call back and I just didn't let on my lap view him to be in a casket so I didn't go off and I was upset about that and I had this dream and that was the least about the time\nAnd I was chasing the suspect throughout most of them all very familiar with but when I made the term I mean it was my dad he was standing there who writes there wasn't fuzzy or not but it was my dad and I said to him I just said dad and he he held his hand up\nAnd he said you need to settle down and it's okay\nAnd uh I I Want to talk to him but he was actually fainting out and I was I even said to him I said dad don't lead pleased to leave and he was gone and I woke up for I woke up I I stress and everything was all gone and I guess my question is\nWhy this dream on that because I was stressed out about it and there was in my imagination or or does she think that maybe that with my dad actually contacted me\nFrom the on to you know life after death settled down because it actually worked\nYeah I think it was I mean that's reported by my God countless people report that kind of contact and often it's perceived as a dream like experience\nOr the other universes a continuum of consciousness and dreams are part of that continuum and yes the people especially in within thirty days of an individual passing\nThe the the chance of contact is incredibly high\nAnd often will perceive it in a dream like environment because we're more open when our ego mind is when we fall asleep or Hugo mind set aside and we can begin to experience is but yeah I think that was a valid\nAbsolutely valid or contact ah I Know I've had that with my mother on many occasions and almost everybody I Know it's had some form of contact\nAnd that we're kind of regard with a loved one\nIt sounds very healing\nAnd they say well it is very healing I I think that's a wonderful experience\nAnd I think your intention was right to the father in the way you remember him rather than any ... and I think it's a really wonderful intention and he basically did this technique like out there and he", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city":
