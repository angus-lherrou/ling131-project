in for George Norris tonight who's getting a good weekend off I Hope and doing something fun and it in in this period just before Halloween ... is our focus for both tonight and tomorrow night when I'll be hosting coast to coast again coming up tomorrow night\nLooking forward to a season with the which it's in our first hour we'll talk about uh about Salem, Massachusetts again because we've had a great show but\nAbout witchcraft in Salem a couple of months ago but in this case uh we'll be talking about in regard to Halloween and some of the festivities it will be taking place and uh and then also the men from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer\nAbout the scariest story you could ever imagine to here on a Saturday Night before Halloween because it's all true\nAnd also happens to be a written by a guy named Bill James\nSo it'd be better no as a sportswriter he writes ah he follows the Boston Red Sox and he writes about the ... he was not in he's not in LA tonight\n... originally we had him scheduled a Bill James for tomorrow night on with the contingency that if the Boston Red Sox made the world series you may not be able to make it but as it turns out he wasn't traveling to LA so he's going to citizen after all which is great because in the tradition of like\nYou know Freddie and Jason and Michael and all of the Halloween stuff a creepy story and

to do with genetic engineering so between genetic engineering and artificial intelligence robot man I'm telling you Larry King is going to be around for a long long\nTime and I was reading some of those sanctions and I thought that was interesting because there really as you said when he was very I think you mentioned like ... one of the book and there's not a big emphasis on it but there is still this hope that people have about\nPreserving their essence and and then that becomes a course a full debate about what we're is the seat of the essence of a you know we used to think the soul was the heart and the head contained all of the you know the the computer works but\nBut you do you how realistic is it ever in any near future that we would be able to upload\nThoughts in dreams like you might expect from Minority Report being able to capture them and then put them into something else\n[noise] I think it's very real or in I mean you know and and and you indicated about my book being about the future but but the truth of it is it's really about what's going on right here and right now even as we speak in labs all over the world\nUh I tell for example the story of Iran mosque or being very very involved well you know he's involved in driverless cars he's involved in outer space and going to Mars and so forth and so on but he's also\nGot a finger in this whole neural net a business which has a a really the new one of the new hot topics out there\nI imagine a ... and ... and ... imagine this because we're already doing it with my ... and in in the very near future um you know ... it's pretty certain that we are going to be doing it with humans but imagine this un jak really what amounts to a very fine fisherman's net\nThink of it I think of it as a fisherman it's not so you injected into\nThe brain cavity of a mouse and when you do that it's almost like tossing out a fishing net it wrapped itself around the brain\nAnd then kind of ... integrates itself into the brain tissue and so it becomes one with a brain tissue and this mirror on that has a lead a electrical lead a coming out of it and the idea is that now we have a mechanism we have a real honest to goodness mechanism by which\nWe can tap into the human mind and plug it into let's say the Internet so one of the things that have on mosque is thinking about doing and by the way you don't even have to have a lead you could have a wireless connection that's that's even better\nBut one of the one of the things that you know on mosques foreseen\nIs a day when when you were to use the one of these narrow math we can actually surf the Internet with our thoughts we don't need a keyboard or anything like that so\nI think that is the beginning of the ... of the mechanism we can use to upload our thoughts are memories are in code them digitally um it's not at all farfetched anymore\nOnce you had that neural net you have a mechanism by which you can transfer digitize if you will our thoughts onto a super computer and you know\nQuantum computers are on the horizon and so you talk about supercomputers quantum computers are going to be like whoa [laughter]\nWay way out there right and so easily easily a whole you know it's not just the ordinary flash drive I mean you can hold on a person's entire a lifetime history of memories and then as I say robots are becoming very realistic\nWe can run about that tonight no I I think\nThat's the way to go not cryogenic that will ... is a kind of an old school I'm not saying that it's not going to be around it it will be but I think these other technologies that much more sexy and much more practical\nYou know and so and I'm not going to try and pursue what you said to me it's been a a I think it's fair to say and this is where I I think I draw maybe a different line than you do in this narrative moving forward\nIs when we use terms like thinking about doing or you know beginning of the mechanism that's what I'm Talking about when I see the future because what we can do now is the frontier but that's not where these are going in so you know as we would say cilia logically\nThat's not the end game for where these things are and I think partly that's the scary peace because you know if we if we take our science fiction movies seriously\nThen we're often reminded that what starts off as a really good idea [laughter]\nI can go terribly wrong when it actually becomes applied science right\n... thank you thank care absolutely oh no absolutely\nAnd and you're right there this book deals with\nWe're right at the cost in and I I think that's what makes it exciting but it also makes city and for some degree unsettling and and even downright dangerous that\nWe we are really at the threshold of these technologies Rhett are are kind of one foot in the present and one foot in the immediate future and so you're right it is it enables us\nIf you will to make very accurate forecast in other words we're not talking about pie in the sky want you know the sweet bind by one day\nNo these are things that are now becoming realized and so we can have this kind of discussion about hey what what kind of world are we creating what what is ... is a mortality in any sense of the word now possible\nAnd the short answer is yes it is very much so now that we have\nA ... they we are creating these incredible robots artificial intelligence and we have the ability to manipulate DNA now at will so so yes you're absolutely right that what we're discussing is the near future but it is it's ... right now it's it's crazy\nWell and so I'm reminded of the of the ... song\nUm which I I inevitably come back to an subjects like this history shows again and again how nature points up the folly of men Godzilla and and the the the I think this is where I'm sort of curious about your approaching this because this book is published by\nA publishing company which is known for being the based\nAnd and I think this is in in in the in the certainly in the publicity for the book but even as you get into there's a larger discussion of\nNot just doing things because we can but because we should do and the author so really important in there too so you know just because we're on the threshold of doing something off we do that and ... who how are we going to make a decision\nOn the implications of when we decide yep this is where we're going with this\n[noise] yeah you're you're right about regular you know when they approached me to write this book and I have to give them credit it was their idea um and you know they said basically hey you know you you really love writing about science history and I do I love science history\nBecause of the lessons it teaches us about what we can do and what we can't do what we should do and what we shouldn't do\nI it's history because of the lessons it teaches us about what we can do and what we can't do what we should do and what we shouldn't do [noise]\nUm they said why don't why don't you write about you know what's going on right now you're you're uniquely qualified you've been reporting science all your life and I thought about it and it was a kind of a no brainer I said yeah I'll do it and then they gave me the the freedom to kind of you know opine about this\nI Am a because I'm a theoretical physicist and you know I I I'm very strict about things so I decided I was going to write a book and the four sections that that I describe\nOur perfect based in their ... it's just like you know the old dragnet series you know the facts ma'am right Andrew ... that's what I did with those four sections there more than a thousand foot notes that you can imagine\nOh no I've read through to you you're very young you sound very thorough yeah\nVery thorough but then I allowed myself that last final chapter and I thought you know I Can't just serve this stuff up to the reader without giving them my thoughts on it and so\nHere here my thoughts in a nutshell apropos what you've asked me [noise] um [noise] I see these innovations as the fruits of human intelligence they really spectacular many of them are brilliant a lot of positive consequences I think will come out of this\nBut then there are some things as I said that are a little unsettling and downright dangerous [noise]\nWhat I think we need now because we are at this threshold of\nCreating for ourselves a world that can either be grim or great\nAnd so I think one of the things that can help steer us one way or the other\nIs to call upon the fruits of human spirituality out for many many years I was pretty much an eight is in the sense that all I cared about was science I\nGrew up in east LA with the dream of becoming that scientists since the second grade really and that dream took me to UCLA then on the Cornell where I got my PHD in physics and astronomy and then as I said on the Harvard where I taught physics for about eight or nine years and so\nIt was during my grad school years at Cornell when I started at myself how did this universe that I've been studying come to be an\nExport into wisdom and Buddhism and Islam and transcendental meditation and Judaism and finally um I met this girl this girl came into my life and she challenged me to read the Bible and I was interested I was like a pie or not I I just thought it was just too familiar to prosaic\nBut anyway it's it changed the game changer for me I don't want to get into all of it so I became a man of faith a fate\n\n\nMichael Guillen former science reporter for ABC News on various shows and former instructor of physics at Harvard as well as the author and the new book is uh is is is great it's the end of life as we know it and just before we went into the break we were talking about\nThat that base in discussions of what we should and ought to do which might be better informed by discussions of morality as much as ethics\nAnd and you know I think even Michael when you were talking about [noise]\nAbout the idea of preserving physical lights are on this planet\nIs like the weather that was through uploading a brain and putting it into something you know into a robot or something [noise]\nThe the you know even that it makes me\nQuestion whether or not that's something we ought to be doing I mean what is what is the endgame for that what is the ultimate what's the end used for that um other than our own human vanity that we become immortal\n[noise] I agree with you and and I think another concern in addition to that is that a lot of the technology that we're we're kind of ... we're talking about right now it's no longer speculative it's actually happening is very expensive\nUm you know never mind\nNow it's no longer speculative it's actually happening is very expensive\nUm you know ... and never mind trying to achieve immortality through some of this technology let let's talk about some of the\nTechnology that is being used to let's say\nA I'm a help treat macular degeneration I'm going and just pick that as an example there is such a good way in California right there's a company in California that is a marketing a retinal implants for people who are have macular degeneration and their eyesight a going away\nAll that stuff costs upwards of a hundred thousand dollars or more and it's not covered by most insurance policy so a lot of this technology that that ... aims at improving our how Hansing our health enhancing our life for achieving immortality is going to be available to the super rich\nAnd so you have to stop and wonder what is this going to do what what is this going to do to the dynamics of the society when you have a wealthy super wealthy people elite\nPeople will I'm able to to benefit from the ... and the others are you know like being put out of business by robots and\nSo I talk seriously about a ... in my book I talk seriously about the possibility of there being a human revolution you know we often talk about and science fiction often to pick\nYou know robots kind of rising up and revolting against humans and taking over the earth well you know that we can talk about that possibility but I think an even more real possibility the way this technology is shaping up right now\nIs for people who have been kind of disenfranchised um our marginalized by this technology will just be get fed up at some point and say you know this is enough is enough I mean we're we're shaking and we're taking it ended up\nBehind and and and and and we're not going to we're not going to take it anymore and so and and I it's interesting and I talk about in the book\nDoes ring or I Know you talk like that to the people in Salem no I mean really I gotta I gotta you're really on a limb there you know\nI figured it's a late night shows\nSo you're not going to you're done and now I Know it's\nLate but you know never mind regularly I got to worry about my wife you know that the white used that was a bus or [laughter] but um but I I talk about how a lot\nOf these guys from Silicon Valley are actually are buying these but what they're calling book out houses\nRent they're buying houses in these remote places in the country and in the world\nOn the chance that you know when this stuff hits the fan there I go again but one of the stuff hits the fan they they want to be able to escape and this is a serious thing I Hope some I quote former Google engineers and a Google executives are and and others\nWho say yeah you know a human revolution is a real possibility many of them are trying to avoid that possibility now by talking about the universal basic income\nOkay but he doesn't he lives in ... was ... because the idea of having a bug house right yeah that's like I mean every ... every you know church of latter day saints person I Know has had that philosophy\nRight is it to her tuna and ... yeah I Know lots of other people who practice that belief that doesn't that's not the same to me although I understand your point\nI I'm thinking about I\nI'm more reminded of of ah you know of what Jeff Goldblum said in Jurassic Park when he said you know the dinosaurs had their chance right they're done they ... they ... that was there a moment\nAnd the fact that bringing them back is is to reintroduce say living dinosaurs just because we can\nIs and the and the notion to that for example when you talk about the ... the wealthy elites as opposed to the intellectual elite sort of the physical elites or any other types of ways in which we the moral elites any we could\nYou know a quantify society hit the wealthy elites aren't necessarily the best in anything except inheriting stuff you know some of them might have gotten it on their own but not all of them and then it becomes the ... the class that perpetuated\nI Would say again they had their chance to ... ... it has to there has to be a Darwinian element to that where somebody else is going to have to come along behind them or we turn into Illinois and more locks from age she will time machine right\nMhm yeah yeah yeah yeah no it it it's interesting I by the way I interviewed Jeff Goldblum one this is just a funny aside when\nIn fact when Jurassic Park came out I was at ABC News and I had been in touch with the producers and they invited me to come to the big Hollywood premiere and the ... at the after party and Jet Blue and was there and a bunch of other\nGuys and I went up to ... I said Jeff you know you're always like playing a scientist you know not just in Jurassic Park but elsewhere and I said show\nI I'm just curious I said you know I did you have an interest in science growing up for what he just not just a job and you know he has the housing disappointed in his answer I thought he was going to say oh yeah you know I majored in physics at college\nAnd now you know but no job\nFor him but yeah they tend to ... I I I Love you bringing that up being the dinosaurs had their chance [noise] it's really an indication of how the\nEarth how the world works how the universe works\nAre designed wouldn't work is designed to work exactly yeah and you know\nA lot you know you're with somebody's religious beliefs aside for a moment let's just talk like strictly science\nUm ... what what were you learn is that these species have a window of time in which they rise up and they flourish then they die out for whatever reason whether it's a meteor or whether it's a\nA temperature change or or it's a rampant disease that and then I mean you know like the woolly mammoth saber tooth cats and so forth and so on\nAnd the dinosaurs yeah and and one wonders as as as you contemplate these innovations that we're creating the ones that I describe in this book you can't help but wonder why are we doing here and then I think of what Arthur ... Clark one set and it stuck with me\nHe said it remains to be proven that intelligence has any survival value\nI go oh whoa\nYou know and you wonder are we like outsmarting ourselves you know are we are we just being too clever by half\nWith a staff thinking that you know we're going to improve wife the we're going to improve the human condition and in fact just the opposite happens we do ourselves then I mean that's a real possibility\nAnd and and and you think of Jeff Goldblum said they had their chance maybe some some creature in the future we'll look back at us and say yeah oh yeah human beings they had their their chance\nWe blew it up\nNow here's an age now let me bring up a little differently\nFeeling beans they had their their chance now he blew it\nUp and now here's an age now let me bring up a little differently\nYeah there was a human's killed off species they didn't die out naturally they were killed off\nAs opposed to say\nEvolution they weren't they they weren't allowed to follow their evolutionary cycle that was truncated right by you know the fact that they you know some giant bird in New Zealand lead these really big exit you know human could eat off for three days and so um you know they've done\nSo I mean I I realize you can make a Darwinian argument for that but I think there are some species like some\nLike some bare earth some tiger whenever that if we cloned that Darren brought him back in ... introduced it to the wild not enough time has passed that he couldn't read absorbed that back into the the natural flow of our evolutionary

[noise]\nE kind of ... there were like All right no this is this is one of those nightmare dream things depending on where you are with it I can understand that somebody had um a body that was decaying but their brain was brilliant and you wanted to put it on a new body but then where does that end and how far along are they in the pursuit\n[noise] [noise] yeah well you know what I've been reporting on that story for some years now and um it began with a a small number of scientists I'm totally experimented on monkeys and it gets a little grizzly but this being Halloween okay\nAh where they yeah they separate the monkeys head and then they re attached it or just to prove that they could so there's a lot of plumbing involved right I mean you have so up the\nThe the the veins in the arteries and the nerves and and so forth and so on and they've they've scientists have achieved to\nA level of success with monkeys and so now embolden uh by that they are turning their attention to doing it to humans and there's at least one guy in Russia who's been quoted a frequently\nWho is a quadriplegic a you know otherwise mentally very alert and he says yeah come and do it to me man I'm I'm ready I'm I Want to be that guinea pig\nAnd there are scientists who are over her were quoted as saying yeah they're going to do it so we're once again you know remember I'm I'm old enough to remember the first artificial heart transplant\nSure you remember that oh the ... ah he um the what was his name Jobbik writer yeah something like that and um\nEverybody cringed at oh my God way way putting them which mechanical\nHeart in a human being and the you know was in South Africa right and yet a duck and and and and ... and you know\nNow artificial hearts are pretty routine thing although now you know with stem cell research and other things going on a day where even getting past mechanical hearts hey by the way in a you talk about things that\nGive me some pause here's one there are three groups of scientists in California and Minnesota\nHey I read that it's like Minnesota that's like so random but okay there you are\nNo you know the ... University of Minnesota's a monster recently been huge research you it's a it's an hour or one it's a big school\nNo no you're right you're right I just I just I don't know why it just gives me an article but anyway you have three groups of scientists\nWho are creating a creatures that have never walked the face of the earth before they're called ... shape human and pink human ... so these are\nCreatures whose DNA has been knit together using human DNA and she'd be in a or human DNA pig DNA and they're creating these creatures because they will have human Oregon they will have human kidneys human livers human hearts for the purpose of you know\nTransplanting them to patients and neat\nAnd you know I get that I had a friend who who died recently because his kidneys just went south and he couldn't get a transplant and boom\nBut now what that's done is to raise the very real possibility and I discuss the book that\nIf you put too much human DNA into the recipe you know so it's always a question\nToo much human DNA too little human DNA then you don't get the human Oregon's\nRight if you put in too much DNA then you can have an animal a creature that thinks like him and that has basically human brain trapped inside of a body of a sheep or pick I mean these these are the things that are very real now because of our ability to tamper with DNA\nUm so that's one of the things that gives me it gives me a little bit later that we really wanted to and what's interesting is that these guys are doing it\nAnd by the way I quote one of the researchers that says yeah that's that's a real possibility that this is not like you know made a pie in the sky I mean they even the researchers admits yeah we got to be careful this possibility\nBut they're doing this research against the wishes of the anti age the national institutes of health which is the government's never won funding body for biological genetic engineering so even the anti age this kind of very um [noise] yeah you know forward thinking funding organization is saying you know maybe we should just pushed the pause button\nAnd decide do we want to do this and if so what are the guidelines\nFor the guard rails are all I'm sure I'm sure these guys are not just doing it in violation of the you know you're probably doing it against the advice of their moms like what are you yeah yeah they don't mind\nThe oh my God it reminds me when I was growing up in east LA and then montebello oh because the town over\nAnd I was a real geek I mean I was speaking out when I was a kid and I found a way to make hydrogen gas using stuff that I found my mom's kitchen and I look back and I'm Out there in the garage at the ... of our [laughter] making hydrogen gas and you know that stuff is explosive\nAnd I don't ... I Would filled balloons up with it and then send little insects all off just to see what happens is that the ... I was a little mad scientist in the area and create\nYour own space program against their will right by the way\nGuys with a ... year right the mothers I say why don't you know I get stopped doing that already go play tennis\nAgainst their will right by the way guys come area you're right the mothers and say why don't you don't get it soon that already go quite tiddlywinks\nOr something safer\nUm it's on ... ... as you mentioned LA I Want to mention that the the game is still tied in the fifteenth between Boston and LA you kidding me know so I thought I didn't mean pinning\nFifteens any game three of the world series Richard tweeted out on Twitter he said he's listening to this show and watching\nThe uh the world series game he said it's like singing a pink Floyd in the wizard of Oz he said the kind of work and so I don't know I guess it I guess that means I'm committed a lot of errors because that's how that's how it's happening right now still there's two men on top of the fifteenth and we're we'll\nKeep an eye on it so it's All right so let the the island of Dr Morrow things pretty scary it really is but I I still you know not only think of what the technology that people you see all the commercials for\nWhich I'm well you know for his theory you know what how cold is it outside I don't want to look out a window Siri is it snowing\nYou know or you know Google ... by ... you know by me some more uh ten meet whatever and these commercials and everybody's focused on that type of business and I kind of get it\nBut they were just beginning to learn the downside\nOf having a microphone connected um and on monitored inside of one's house aren't we\nAnd that's another interesting you bring that up because that was on my short list of things to worry about\nAnd that's your thing we're bringing about our cell okay you're a ... if you're absolutely\nRight I tell the story of a little girl in Dallas texas\nWho use the Amazon Echo or you know and said hey Alexa buy me a bunch of cookies hey Alexa by me well you know it's a doll house the fancy fancy dollhouse and\nParents are totally clueless stuff starts arriving at the house parents freak out but here's the punch line and he would think that the parents will have learned a lesson and like ditch the echo you know get rid of it\nAh but instead I have the mother quoted as saying you know we need to whisper around ... election now are you\nKidding me I mean that could take away having leaders in a row yeah I Know\nIt's so big brother in a way to because it's not just I mean that story\nAnd and again I remind people will get to the phones you're coming authority ringing and will line of people to to talk with Michael deal in the end of life as we know it in a few but\nBut that story out of turkey about the supposedly the audio recording that was made by this guy ... um you know apple watch\nThat they were able to monitor his apple watch and record his torture and death now I don't know that I Believe that I don't know that it really really wasn't just microphone implants or for that matter\nMaybe it there in the Saudi ... they have a they have Google and they had the Little Syria or whatever and they monitor that way but however it happened\nThat kind of the debt that passive listening\nThat is going on that we had not yet fully come to terms with what that could mean for our jobs for our relationships are for our communities\nAnd for the security of our ... a country I just had an op ed that is going to be published very shortly\nI'm a U.S a Congress issued a report on Thursday so a saying that um\nThe Chinese are hell bent on um a exploiting the vulnerabilities of something called the Internet of things and that's what we're talking about\nHer that kind of a ... year refrigerator your dishwasher everything that's going to do\nAll these smart devices that we're talking about the Alex's the smart watches the smart\nAs you say refrigerators the smart thermostat on and on and on ... there are now I'm more than eight billion Internet of things devices so we call it I O T I talk about it in the book\nAnd the Chinese or the this as an opportunity to ... to spy on us and we are the willing accomplices because we're buying these gadgets bringing them into our own home\nDial pound to fifty on your mobile phone and say the key word free\n\n\nMichael before we started getting all these calls waiting for you let's ruled that story back about twenty seconds before because I was ... I had to cut you off but we're going to the bottom of the hour and it's a heartbreak so I could pass on that [noise]\nOh yeah no I was just telling you the story of a murder that happened to Connecticut and or the husband claimed the one story and the police looked into it or his wife was murdered and he claimed one story in\nWhat they police found was that the woman was wearing a the ... the woman wearing a fit but it's one of these little smart watches that you know keeps track of your heart rate how are you walk and so forth and so they downloaded the data from the fit fit\nAnd they found out that they they could actually get this calculate how many feet she walked and it didn't square with the story from the husband\nAnd then and then other things started happening with Facebook in other words what I'm saying is sure that that technology out at this husband he ended up being charged with murder\nBecause of this this kind of a Internet of things that are spying on every aspects of our life they can tell you when you were asleep when you're awake how many feet you are what your heart rate uh you know if you watch Netflix said the the they they download what you're watching when how for how long I mean\nThere are ... this is a kind of an invasion of privacy but we've invited it on ourselves than\nWe are these gadgets\nYeah and I like to a lot of them I mean I I were an apple launched by the way they use that as a plot device that thing about the ... been in a ... a law and order episode last week the same\nThing they took it from the real life oh they do maybe they are they always do no\nRipped from today's headlines so but that's where I mean I I think that like to catch a killer is one thing they do listen to all good they kind of killer because of the fitbit\nThe hard part will be is when evidence is presented in court that's collected from some of these ancillary passive data collection system which\nAccidentally convict somebody who didn't commit the crime I mean that that that that hasn't happened yet and I know of but that's going to be the real test of this technology\nYeah no absolutely and I talk about the FBI now having this humongous database of face prince\nOr that they don't you cover in the uh yeah\nAnd and and and they have like a eighty they they allow themselves in eighty percent accuracy rate so the question becomes like okay well that means you have a twenty percent inaccuracy\nRing with which raises the possibility that\nYou and I got to have the FBI knocking on our doors because they think we committed a crime based on their database\nBut the facial recognition technology that they're using to id and could finger culprits\nIs wrong twenty percent of the time and and by the way researchers who are looking into it from Australia and elsewhere are saying it's it's more than twenty percent and so this this is what you just described is a very real possibility now where innocent people\nAre going to be fingered by a by a screen up\nA Michael deal in the end of life as we know it let's get to keep who's in Virginia on coast to coast am key\nHello can you hear me in a perfectly\nGood a night\nOn my own turned back up\nTo go and get a question from Michael\nMichael and I argue or speaking about the ah Jarvis cart have a couple of friends one of which I wouldn't be a great guess because it was fair and experience\nAnd service even there's a whistle blower this call them coast to coast and before but uh but it's been great to have them on to tell a story about a lot of things [noise] um one of the um [laughter] predecessors that artificial heart was a a\nA heart open heart surgery that was a heart lung machine\nAnd Dr wrestling Nelson\nWorked on that at the University of Minnesota understand that the sharper car was at the University of Utah\nAnd I'm Thirty years earlier and he and his career as a heart surgery at some paranormal experiences one of which was a\nWhere he did a surgery that a technique that had never been done before and he describes it as after praying to know what to do that basically it for ... or whatever it was\nClear right in his mind that the surgery a from those instructions said he was I was in his mind and later\nI got to get you a question because there's so many people who have questions for Michael so if you want to hang on for an open line called the sounds more like that but did you have a question from Michael\nThat could be yeah I'm One of them now and by the way is\nI'm going to put you on hold I'm going to put you on hold right now and we just let me get back to the cause I Know we have our time is pressures and I open lines is where that kind of belong so let me go to\nA Tracy who is trucking in Alabama with a question for Michael Steele and\nYeah Michael I got one question for you here where does it end whereas you to stop when do we stop playing God\nOr are we ... we as a good question but are we playing God yet and when do we play God is maybe another question but Michael [noise]\nWell I think that is the ultimate question the traits he's asking and ah you know I I quote a very well known biologist in the book\nUm who was actually a a major participant in in mapping the human genome remembered the human genome project sure it wrapped up in two thousand and three and there was a big ceremony and the White House Bill Clinton was president needs that now we have\nDiscovered the language of God now that we've mapped the human genome while this biologist Craig Venter I quote him in the book\nAnd ... and it's a very telling quote and I have to be careful but he says you know when it comes to biology we don't know blank I'm not going to use the word he uses but when it comes to biology we don't know blank now this is a guy who's in the thick of it\nAnd this this is directly an answer to Tracy is excellent question that in effect what Craig Venter is in South is saying is look we're we're toying with some\nDirectly an answer to Tracy is excellent question that in effect what Craig Venter is in South is saying is what we're we're toying with something we don't know squat about\nAnd and and that is a recipe for dangerous picture a child playing with matches or worse than that plane with a nuclear bomb or playing with a dynamite you know you pick your your your pick your imagery and that is really the picture that emerges when you read my book\nOr whatever you think about the technology and there's a lot of positive but let's keep in mind that you're going to have Ninety nine positive consequences wonderful sunshine positive consequences like the neural prosthetics but all it takes is one sticker and that\nCan within price but everything else\nBut I think that's the crux two of the playing God premise are we playing God or aren't we would we cure a disease\nDiseases natural it was as God made its natural on the earth is hurricanes are we not playing God when we cure a disease\nI I I I get what you're saying and that's why I tend to avoid this phrase although I Know it's a popular place phrase\nThat's what I'm saying it's too weak to use for the context as it doesn't really in compass all the ways in which\nYou know when we make better break pad or do I mean there were always attempting to try to save lives and sometimes those will come with unintended consequences but it was really a matter of playing God I I think it's more true with the ... thing I think that gets into a very weird area though [laughter]\nYeah no no I agree and and I I think you know what it's like when we restore sight the blind with these retinal transplant I I mean that can be said we're playing ... to ... what I like to do is look I when I was at ABC News I covered the Persian Gulf War story you remember when they lift the oil fields on fire oh totally\nI what I was the first TV correspondent to actually find my way to those oil fill\nA oh a oil fields that were on fire and the way I have to get there was through a minefield we got a guy from Iran code the a Saudi Arabian oil company ... new way through the mind feels and so that's how I I think of trace this question is\nI see it there I see as navigating a mine field [noise]\nAnd it's you know so far we've been able to avoid a stepping on that one mind that it's gonna do it in but as we progress with some of the stuff that is unsettling and outright dangerous never mind that great stuff okay that's gonna sunshine but as I say all it takes\nFor us to do with the step on that one mind that won the

I mean it really is it's an amazing video in it for people that don't believe in in goes I think you'll enjoy it um but the scissors in the ... the ... and this little cup holder who'd just certain moving around\nAnd it's just it's not I mean you could almost making an argument like maybe the jar was on the slanted surface or something and we couldn't see it from the camera angle and they're just having a good laugh but I don't get the thing with the the pencils and the then the scissors so yeah benevolent pulled the guy so I'll go with that until\nIt got any other theory to a a back it up Michelle is in Wyoming on coast to coast Michele\nHow high the and I'm Sorry I'm driving around ... you know\nFirst things first the first things career as I can put you on hold and come back in a minute but that'd be easier\nI Know I can talk right now for a second I'm a first time caller longtime listener and nice to have you when\nI was wondering why it's like I was raised Catholic and then like I chose to kind of walk away from that and explore other options and other things out there because you know I just I don't know that that's the way I have inside an\nMethane gas Michael I'm Carson when he first got on he was talking about that you know that scientific side at hand and\nThen when I sat\nDown and read the Bible and now he changed his mind on it and it's a Christian so what I was wondering and I don't have a very strong religious staff exactly but I'm a little bit\nLike I ... I Wonder how often when I'm driving down the road and how we can trust the authenticity of the Bible because [noise] you know I Am often heard that a lot of the major story from it like the story of the ... and the story of um [noise] you know like\nI said you're a hero type figure the line of American and stuff those can be found in like pre biblical feeling like ancient\n... from like ... and ... you know whatever's predates the Bible how\nYou're talking about the you know you're talking about guilt ... if you're talking about the story of NOAA for example um and there are some very interesting parallels\nIn the in the guild diminish narrative should the news story [noise]\nUm and you are correct in saying that there had been other traditions that had a sort of man God a ... that was birthed by a human mother but from a a divine father and that that is just another version of that\nSo the question to me\nAlways is not this to me and this is where I think a lot of a ... in my personal opinion I Believe this is where some people get really hung up\nBecause I'm not going I'm not trusting the Bible because it has so many facts in it I trust the Bible because of how many true ... it has in it\n[noise] okay there's a there's a difference to me and there are true that we know to be a\nWorse steering by right there there you you can count you can count on these troops that for example when you're good to others they will be good to you or even if they are good to you you still have to be good to them because it only makes the situation worse\nYou know and so there are ... and and a lot of these stories tell the truth is the actual facts of these stories it's always been less interesting to me too\nSo I'll be honest we buy\nThey'll let you know story that can be found in other places we can still try you're saying like the other information on the ...\nWell no here I Would say though is that even some of those other stories there are some of those things which you have heard that probably aren't true so there are some people who win Christianity was catching on over two thousand years ago\nOr the other people started in ... like I'm emphasizing something from their tradition saying see were just like Christianity and so it was because of the rise of Christianity that they started to really promote\nThe things that they said had pre existed that story whether they did or not there's really there really isn't always a lot of proof but that there isn't in the Egyptians\nThere's there's a little bit of a tradition of that but but ... in the end does it matter I mean it it do you can you do live your life better it doesn't improve your life\nThat's the question and I think getting hung up on\nIt it do you can you do live your life better it doesn't improve your life\nThat's the question and I think getting hung up on worrying about whether or not the Bible is a book of science there's a lot of people treat it like it's supposed to be his book and it's not I don't think [noise] um and I think the stories are very instructive and we need to you know re learn from them every day\nThinking that that's my best answer for you I Hope it gives you something to chew over while you're while you're on the open road with a full tank of gas and\nThere's a long time out here that they found [laughter]\nAnd it will be be uh you know you're a bad man the gym and you get where you're going well and thank you so much for joining in and I'm Glad your was your first time I got to be there with you um I go to a adjusted who's in Texas coast to coast Justin\nHey buddy hey\nHey and it's nice to be on a list them wherever they were actually called in\nA kennel or to take it to the length everybody's on the the religious aspect but uh do whatever you want to get some more scientific stuff yeah sure I'm not sure if a lot of people carpet you on mosque interview or he had with Joe Rogan and when he smoked ...\nYeah they they I think there are a little out there but I think somebody is a technical logically advanced in the mind and has the means to do a lot it's pretty impactful Wayne says things about like a a guy in a magnetic augmentation and stuff and uh\nI really thought it was a neat metaphor they use than how human beings are pretty much augmented already carrying their cell phones around you know we have the ability to do the massive computations and\nAccess to any kind of data that we had that we want and all that and he said that you know in the very near future that could possibly be a thing that we can do hands free\nYou know and uh\nYou know what would that do maybe to the educational system would we go to school for the district philosophy classes to learn how to think properly you know\nYeah well we need more of those but I think we need more of those I think I think I think a lot to be would be we treat ... yeah I think we treat philosophy of some sort of exotic thing and it was really the first thing around which all education was built in ...\nAnd we do it's just a fine arts credit that people just take just after\nRight because it 'cause it's not that dance you know or something so excited and dance at least in philosophy you don't have to go [laughter]\nBut you know to your point on on ... I'm a big believer in in his technological ... solutions on big big in sustainability [laughter] um\nUh the Joe Rogan interview is troublesome because I think actually if you want to look at it in a different way all the time he spent talking about being depressed or you know his mental state for him over working and not sleeping enough and et cetera\nI I think that review much more of the humanness which we don't and we tend to think almost of Ilan must be some big giant slot machine to\nSome big in the whenever he's just he's a human being\nRight and he may be a slightly unstable human being these days I I ... on Venus is are you know are at everybody that that's a\nVery intellectual always have some kind of inner struggle\nRight and so I'm a I I'm an investor actually in a very small way I mean a couple of thousand dollars for the stock which took a hit after that Joe Rogan interview and uh and has recovered mostly women\nA day or something like that won't affect stock\nWell I don't know that though because I see my argument would be ... ... ... we I invested in the lung mosque\nRight I didn't I invested in him I decided at some point probably after the sixty minutes interview not it's not his insurance but as a person\nYeah I thought that guys smart he gets it\nUm and I think he's going to come up with cool stuff and it's going to make life better and make a lot of money and so I bought on that basis so when I'm watching him in the interview\nI'm watching the wheels come off right when she was the wheels are going and just like watching a Tesla with the wheels are coming up it would be very worrisome so I I I think anytime the head of a company like that become so synonymous with the product\nI think they have to be much more careful about how they live their lives in public that's my feeling on that but [laughter] but I don't want to take away from him 'cause I Know I agree to use its own genius\nNo doors plenty there are lots of state park activities in advanced\nThere are many different hunting seasons don't forget about the upland slam and there are tons of stock parents ... rainbow trout to be caught by you and your kids your grand kids go to outdoor Tabasco dot org for more details see out there I ride Wagner\nHang up I don't think the one eight hundred missing give you a local auto owners independent insurance agent called today six o five six six five thirty six eleven empty an RC Smith insurance tool for west ... street in Yankee since Nineteen sixteen no problem people let auto owner's insurance provided Braun\nFlexible auto insurance coverage they'll make sure your coverage is right for you\nAnd to you in our ...

I don't look at it we are studying for the fact they study it for the truth and I was like\nYeah like the way he put that\n... exactly right during any any simpler than that I think that's true for everything like it's even true for you know for journalism I honestly is I think that journalists get things wrong every day but if we\nGet hung up on like oh got something wrong oh he said that person oh we do that we missed truth of what's happening and I think that's much more important to focus on the truth is of of what's happening around us all the time then get distracted by whether or not something for the moment is a fact\nThat I totally agree with that oh I forget I at higher than they were going\nBut it was on the Adams fan like not the monsters\nOh did he say monsters and I

investigating this possibility by the way\nHow ... how do you investigate that\n[noise] okay um okay you don't want an experience or oh yeah\nOkay uh an contact yeah okay well\nThat's how I investigate as far as validating or vetting what I come up to ... what kind of ... of more kind of information I get half a check out everything at least a from two different sources\nAnd her mother and her friends as well maybe a knowledgeable in this area\nBecause it's a very compelling idea that that uh maybe if we're if we're worried on this planet that artificial intelligence could overrun us and deprive us of our humanity and eventually\nMake us into something other than what we are just some servants to some degree that they're going to happen here that we're worried about why don't we think it could happen somewhere else and another and I think it's actually a really great idea for a movie but I think that's really good it's really interesting\n[noise] can you you might want to consider what if it did happen somewhere else and it came here and now it's running it can game on us and we're building the very thing that it is\nI'm game I'm In great ah\nInteresting I don't think it was that I Would think about it before I go to bed tonight or I won't sleep at night thinking about over ... let me go to a Tom who's in the Bronx and coast to coast Tom\nHow are ya I I like to

coast to coast am on a wildcard line before the bottom of the hour wall\nBlow PHD and it's nice to talk\nTo you think you know\nWhy I told I wanted to say something about the border but you started talking about the Bible and uh I was brought up as a Roman Catholic but I supplement subsequently become a ... gun not so I don't know what to say that you're really\nAh [laughter] well I wasn't trying to hijack this show that really that it was just it you know a couple of callers mentioned something and next thing you know I'm I'm John away but it's a space I live in I live in the space during the week so that kinda bleeds through the air I'm afraid this\nShirt or when you said that job\nYou know people come out of church and then they act like an atheist and the reason I'm an atheist this because\nI Can't possibly believing in God that show hip but credit or whether you're talking about the outrage over or the other guards up\nYou know in the Bible or you know I can I possibly believe in Jehovah when he kills children by the thousands while you're talking about Schober ... some of that first point to chip change or the great flood\nI was there was one you're talking about some of the first one they are the great\nSaddam they got more loudly innocent children job so I mean yeah I can I possibly believing that God like that\nSo you know I guess part of that again comes down to how much are we going to invest in a particular narrative\nAs being the defining story so except what you're saying and I think don't get my point wrong about atheists I I I I I Know you're gently chiding me on the on the offending part\nBut let me just say when I say atheist I really mean that in the strictest sense I think a lot of people live their life like there is no God\nAnd then when they go to the to go to church somehow to hedge their bets and they look like they do that and but they never actually it doesn't actually make a change in what they do is all I mean and so you know everybody puts their faith in something\nFormula you'd be crazy not to try try prefer you draft free dial pound to fifty on your mobile phone and say the key word free bottle

before Halloween ... is our focus for both tonight and tomorrow night when I'll be hosting coast to coast again coming up tomorrow night\nLooking forward to a season with the which it's a in our first hour we'll talk about uh about Salem, Massachusetts again because we had a great show but\nAbout witchcraft in Salem a couple of months ago but in this case uh we'll be talking about it in regard to Halloween and some of the festivities it will be taking place and uh and then also the men from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer\nAbout the scariest story you could ever imagine to here on a Saturday Night before Halloween because it's all true\nAnd also happens to be a written by a guy named Bill James who saw the butter no as a sportswriter he writes he follows the Boston Red Sox and he writes about the ... he was not in not in LA tonight\n... originally we had him scheduled I'm Bill James for tomorrow night on with the contingency that if the Boston Red Sox made the world series you may not be able to make it but as it turns out he wasn't traveling to LA so he's going to finish in after all which is great because in the tradition of like\nYou know Freddie and Jason than Michael and all of the Halloween stuff up it's a creepy story and you're going to want to hear it coming up tomorrow night\nThat third it has to do with privacy and surveillance technology and the Ford has to deal with genetic engineering so between genetic tests\nThe third it has to do with privacy and surveillance technology and the fourth has to deal with genetic engineering so between genetic engineering and artificial intelligence robot man I'm telling you Larry King is going to be around for a long long\nAgo and I was reading some of those sanctions and I thought that was interesting because there really as you said when he was very I think you mentioned like ... once in the book and there's not a big emphasis on it\nBut there is still this hope that people have about\nPreserving their essence and and then that becomes of course a full debate about what we're is the seat of the essence of us you know we used to think the soul was the heart and the head contained all of the you know the the computer works but\nBut how realistic is it ever in any near future that we would be able to load\nThoughts in dreams like you might expect from Minority Report being able to capture them and then put them into something else\n[noise] I think it's very real or in I mean you know and and you indicated up out of my book being about the future but but the truth of it is it it's really about what's going on right here and right now even as we speak in ... in labs all over the world\nUh I tell for example the story of a mosque or being very very involved well you know he's involved in driverless cars who's involved in outer space and going to Mars and so forth and so on but he's also\nGot his finger in this whole neural net a business but just the really the new one of the new hot topics out there\nI imagine a ... and ... and ... imagine that because we're already doing it with my ... and and then the very near future um you know it it's pretty certain that we are going to be doing it with humans but imagine this un jak\nReally what amounts to a very fine fisherman's net think of it I think of it as a fisherman it's not so you inject it into\nThe brain cavity of a mouse and when you do that it's almost like tossing out a fishing net it wrapped itself around the brain\nAnd then kind of integrate itself into the brain tissue and so it becomes one with a brain tissue and this neuron that has a lead a electrical lead a coming out of it and the idea is that now we have a mechanism we have a real honest to goodness mechanism by which\nWe can tap into the human mind and plug it into let's say the Internet so one of the things that have on mosque is thinking about doing and by the way you don't even have to have a lead you could have a wireless connection that's that's even better but\nOne of the one of the things that Iran must get for seeing is a day when when you with the use the one of these and our own that we can actually surf the Internet with our thoughts we don't need a\nKeyboard or anything like that so I think that is\nThe beginning of the of of the mechanism we can use to upload our thoughts are memories are in code them digitally or it's not at all farfetched anymore\nOnce he had that neural net you have a mechanism by which you can transfer digitize if you will our thoughts onto a super computer and you know\nQuantum computers are on the horizon and so you talk about supercomputers quantum computers are going to be like whoa [laughter]\nWay way out there right and so it could easily easily a whole you know it's not just a ordinary flash drive I mean you can hold on a person's entire a lifetime history of memories and then as I say robots are becoming very realistic\nWe can do about that tonight ... I I think that's\nThe way to go not cryogenic cryogenic is the kind of an old school I'm not saying that it's not going to be around it it will be but I think the other technologies are much more sexy and much more practical\n[noise] you know ... and so and I'm not going to try and partially what you said to me it's been a a I think it's fair to say and this is where I I think I draw maybe a different line than you do in this narrative moving forward\nIs when we use terms like thinking about doing or you know beginning of the mechanism that's what I'm Talking about when I see the future because what we can do now is the frontier but that's not where these are going into you know as we would say cilia logically\nThat's not the end game for where these things are and I think partly that's the scary peace because you know if we if we take our science fiction movies seriously\nThen we're often reminded that starts off as a really good idea [laughter]\nI couldn't go terribly wrong when it actually becomes applied science right\n... thank you thank you [laughter] absolutely oh\nNo absolutely and and you're right there this book deals with\nWe're right at the cost the and then I I think that's what makes it exciting but it also makes it in for some degree unsettling and and even downright dangerous that\nWe we are really at the threshold of these technologies Rhett are are kind of one foot in the present and one foot in the immediate future and so you're right it you know it it enables us\nIf you will to make very accurate forecast in other words we're not talking about pie in the sky\nWant you know the sweet bind by one day no these are things that are now becoming realize and so we can have this kind of discussion about pay what what kind of world are we creating what what is ... is a mortality in any sense of the word now possible\nAnd the short answer is yes it is very much so now that we have\nA ... they we are creating these incredible robots artificial intelligence so we have the ability to manipulate DNA now at will so so yes you're absolutely right that what we're discussing is the near future but it is it's ... right now it's it's crazy\nQuilt and so I'm reminded of the of the ... song\nUm which I I inevitably come back to an subjects like this history shows again and again how nature points up the folly of men Godzilla and end of the ... I think this is where I'm sort of curious about your approaching this because this book is published by\nA publishing company which is known for being the based\nAnd and I think this is in in in the in the certainly in the publicity for the book but even as you get into there's a larger discussion of\nNot just doing things because we can but because we should do and the officer really important in there too so you know just because we're on the threshold of doing something on we do that and ... who how are we going to make a decision\nOn the implications of when we decide this is where we're going with this\n[noise] yeah you're you're right about regular you know when they approached me to write this book and I I have to give them credit it was their idea um and you know they said basically hey you know you you really love writing about science history and I do I love science history\nBecause of the lessons it teaches us about what we can do and what we can't too\nAbout science history and I do I love science history because of the lessons it teaches us about what we can do and what we can't do what we should do and what we shouldn't do [noise]\nUm they said why don't why don't you write about you know what's going on right now you're you're uniquely qualified you've been reporting finance all your life and I thought about it and it was a kind of a no brainer I said yeah I'll do it and then they gave me the the freedom to kind of you know opine about this\nI Am because I'm a theoretical physicist and you know I I I'm very strict about things so I decided I was going to write a book and the four sections that that I describe\nOur perfect base the ... it's just like you know the old dragnet series you know the facts ma'am right Andrew I that's what I did with those four sections there more than a thousand but now that you can imagine\nOh no I've read through to you you're very young you sound very thorough yeah\nVery thorough but then I allowed myself that last final chapter and I thought you know I Can't just serve this stuff up to the reader without giving them my thoughts on it and so\nHere here my thoughts in a nutshell apropos what you've asked me [noise] um if I see these innovations as the fruits of human intelligence that really spectacular many of them are brilliant a lot of positive consequences I think will come out of this\nBut then there are some things as I said that are a little unsettling and downright dangerous why I think we need now because we are at this threshold of\nCreating for ourselves a world that can either be grim or great\nAnd so I think one of the things that can help steer us one way or the other is to call upon the fruits of human spirituality out for many many years I was pretty much in eight years in the sense that all I cared about was science I\nGrew up in east LA with the dream of becoming that scientists since the second grade really and that dream took me to UCLA then on the Cornell where I got my PHD in physics and astronomy and then as I said on the Harvard where I taught physics for about eight or nine years and so\nIt was during my grad school years at Cornell when I started at myself how did this universe that I've been studying come to be an\nExport India wisdom and Buddhism and ... a Islam and transcendental meditation and Judaism and finally um I met this girl this girl came into my life and she challenged me to read the Bible and I was interested I was like five or not I I just thought it was just too familiar to prosaic\nBut anyway it it changed but it was a game changer for me I don't want to get into all of it so I became a man of faith faith\nOf what you owe reduce a large portion of your debt now\nCalled national debt relief at eight hundred six eight three forty five forty six eight hundred six eight three forty five forty six eight hundred six eight three forty five forty six\n[noise]\n\n\nMichael Guillen former science reporter for ABC News on various shows and former instructor of physics at Harvard as well as the author and the new book is uh is is just great it's the end of life as we know it and just before we went into the break we were talking about that\nThat base in discussions of what we should and ought to do which might be better informed by discussions of morality as much as ethics\nAnd and you know I think even Michael when you were talking about [noise]\nAbout the idea of preserving physical lights are on this planet\nIs like the weather that was due uploading a brain putting it into something you know into a robot or something the you know even that it makes me\nQuestion whether or not that's something we ought to be doing I mean what is what is the endgame for that what is the ultimate what's the end used for that um other than our own human vanity that we become immortal\n[noise] I agree with you and and I think another concern in addition to that is that a lot of the technology that we're we're kind of ... we're talking about right now it's no longer speculative it's actually happening is very expensive\nUm you know\nTechnology that we're we're kind of ... we're talking about right now it's no longer speculative it's actually happening is very expensive\nUm you know never mind trying to achieve immortality through some of this technology let's let's talk about some of the technology that is being used to let's say a I'm a help treat macular degeneration I Want to just pick that as an example there's hardly in\nCalifornia right there's a company in California that is a marketing a retinal implants for people who are have macular degeneration and their eyesight a going away\nAll that stuff costs you know upwards of a hundred thousand dollars or more and it's not covered by most insurance policy so a lot of the technology that that is aimed at improving our health than Hansing our health enhancing our life for achieving immortality is going to be available to the super rich\nAnd so you have to stop and wonder what is this going to do what what is this going to do the dynamics of the society when you have a wealthy super wealthy people elite\nPeople will I'm able to to benefit from this and and the others\nAre you know like being put out of business by robots and so I talk seriously about a ... in my book I talk seriously about the possibility\nOf there being a human revolution you know we often talk about in science fiction often to pick\nYou know robots kind of rising up and revolting against humans and taking over the earth well you know that we can talk about that possibility but I think an even more real possibility the way this technology is shaping up right now\nIs for people who have been kind of disenfranchised hum are marginalized by this technology will just be get fed up at some point and say you know this is enough is enough I mean we're we're shaking and we're taking it as a\nBehind and and and and and and we're not going to we're not gonna take it anymore and so and and I it's interesting and I talk about in the book\nDoes ring or I Know you talk like that to the people in Salem no I mean really\nI gotta I gotta you're really on a limb there you know and\nI figured it's a late night show\nSo you're not going to lay down and now I Know it's\nLate but you know never mind regularly I got to worry about my wife you know that the white used to watch a bus or [laughter] but um\nBut I talk about how a lot of these guys from Silicon Valley are actually are buying these but what they're calling bug out houses\nThey're buying houses in these remote places in the country and in the world on the chance that you know when this stuff hits the fan there I go again but one of the stuff hits the fan they they want to be able to escape and this is a serious thing I Hope some I quote former Google engineers in a Google executives are and and others\nWho say yeah you know a human revolution is a real possibility many of them are trying to avoid that possibility now by talking about the universal basic income\nOkay ... ... ... lives a little ... because the idea of having a bug out house right\nYeah that's like I mean every ... every you know church of latter day saints person I Know has had that philosophy\nRight is it ... to ... and I know lots of other people who practice that belief that doesn't that's not the same to me although I understand your point I\nI'm more thinking about I I'm more reminded of of ah you know what Jeff Goldblum said in Jurassic Park when he said you know the dinosaurs had their chance right they're done they ... they ... that was there a moment\nAnd the fact that bringing them back is is to reintroduce say living dinosaurs just because we can\nIs and the and the notion that for example when you talk about the the the wealthy elites as opposed to the intellectual elite sort of the physical elites or any other types of ways in which we the moral it leads any way we could\nYou know a ... quantify society it the wealthy elites aren't necessarily the best in anything except inheriting stuff you know some of them might have gotten it on their own but not all of them and then that becomes the ... the class that's perpetuated\nI Would say again they had their chance to do it has to there has to be a Darwinian element to that where somebody else who's going to have to come along behind them or we turn into Illinois and more locks from age she well time machine right\nMhm yeah yeah yeah yeah no it it it's interesting uh by the way I interviewed Jeff Goldblum one this is just a funny aside\nWhen in fact\nWhen Jurassic Park came out I was at ABC News and I had been in touch with the producers and they invited me to come to the big Hollywood premiere in the ... at the after party and Jet Blue in was there and a bunch of other guys and I went up to I said Jeff you know you're always\nLike playing a scientist or not just in Jurassic Park but elsewhere and I
