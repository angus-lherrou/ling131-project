informing all of us about the realities of climate science and energy economics his book outside the green box is in my hand right now Steve welcome to the program good to have you with us\nA very good night to George and great to join you\nI was just mentioning climate week with just wrapped up in New York well what do they do anyway\nWell they they had a lot of people there are a lot of dignitaries their goals from the website where that they were run into a race ambition reduced climate change and accelerate climate action [noise] uh some big notable Tony Blair former prime minister\nAnd spoke ... moved from the United nations um actor Hugh Jackman\nWho the wool over in spoken a so quite a quite a big group also a big public relations steel claim a five hundred thirty five million people were reached in three hundred news articles written\nSo a a kind of an interesting thing but uh I Would and and a lot of folks there I think believe that if they change a light bulbs they can save polar bears\nIf we all drive electric cars we can stop the oceans from rising and if we build a wind turbine towers we can make the storms less frequent and less severe and George we live in a in a modern age of superstition uh there's really no empirical evidence to support those sorts of beliefs\nSo there are definitely man made global warming proponents\nAren't they they are never been a fan of that because you know I think one Steven I think you agree were polluting the planet there's no question about that we need to fix that\nThere's a real pollution went into ...\nI don't think the pollution is causing what they say man made climate change I think we're in solar cycles a I think this this planet or has been warmer during the dinosaur days and we didn't have cars and all the carbon in the atmosphere and anything like that\nOr at least for periods over the last ten thousand years when it was warmer matter of fact it was about two to three degrees Celsius warmer according to a geologist eight thousand years ago when we've been gently cooling since then although temperatures go up and they go down [noise]\nAnd ah you know the other thing about pollution as you say we were so many people are completing what are called real air pollution that can harm people or harm the environment\nAnd things like carbon monoxide nitrogen oxide so for the mercury particulates with carbon dioxide which is a voter lists harmless invisible gas\nAnd when I speak to groups I like to say to them what to cannabis growers know that the climate scientists apparently don't know\nWhy do you believe that there are so many proponents man made climate change\n[laughter] it's a bit of a long story back in Nineteen eighty eight Dr James Hansen of NASA came and testified before Congress and it was on a very hot summer day and he said he was Ninety nine percent sure that the earth was warming in humans were causing as he was a computer model or\nAnd or within a year and a half the United nations form the Intergovernmental Panel on climate change and just three years later we had forty one nations on the European\nCommunity signed a treaty saying they would reduce greenhouse gases so in my opinion of the first thing is that the world kind of jumped to a conclusion quickly on this\nBut uh you know for the last Thirty years or so the computer models have been predicting very fast warming and we haven't seen it temperatures have warmed just a little storms are stronger the polar bears doing fine\nAnd then the second factor though is I think a much of this is being driven forward by momentum by money uh we have a\nWind and solar and biofuel industries we have deans of sustainability at the university's vice president sustainability corporations\nAnd there are over there is over two hundred fifty billion dollars a year spent every year on renewables to try and stop the planet from warming so the first is the world jumped to a conclusion second is there's there's just a huge amount of money momentum behind all of this\nAmazing what's been going on lately the last couple of days they've been talking about here's a one or two degrees affecting everything what's going on with that\nWell you know that is really remarkable to I uh Jay Inslee governor of Washington state just to post an article and CNN quote how the show Trump to care about climate change and he's made statements saying that the forests are a lot warmer\nAnd that's why we're we're seeing these forest fires well we've had one degree of warming in the last hundred and Thirty years one degree\nYet and I think it came from the sun while I Do too\nBut that come straight from the climate research unit at East Anglia in England they the number one authority on this one degree so so in the last decade maybe we've had a tenth of the ... in Washington for a son to say that all these forest fires are caused by a tenth of a degree change I mean that just doesn't make any sense\nSo people need to get a little perspective there's probably other bigger factors at work [noise] um the way we take care of our forests ah for example\nAre you concerned Steve that we're headed down the wrong direction here with climate change\nOh absolutely this is a tremendous miss allocation of resources as you say there are\nThere are major pollution issues to be solved today eighty percent of the world's waste water is discharged untreated into lakes rivers and streams the ocean if you remember a few years ago and Brazil the swimmers didn't want to swimming in the water\n'em and they're just building the first water treatment plants down and Brazil so that's a real problem we need to solve we have two billion people trying to live on to US dollars a day one point two billion don't have\n... electricity we have two point five billion without proper sanitation millions die from disease yet we're spending all this money to try and keep the planet from warming and\nThe bottom line is the planet is dominated by natural factors as you say oceans whether driven by the sun it's unlikely that we're going to be able to make a measurable difference with all the things you're doing in California and everywhere else on global temperatures\nThere's no question that you know the the the groups that are pro or con what's happening with climate change keep butting heads but I'm beginning to see at least more scientists beginning to feel the way you do\nThat we're dealing with a different kind of climate change\n[laughter] well if you again if you look at it at any of the well any of the uh the predictions about climate change and you see a lot of articles he saw articles written about uh [noise] um what was Hurricane Florence\nLast year we had a couple of major hurricanes ah we had Harvey hit Texas [noise] ah we had another one hit I think it was Irma hit Florida [noise]\nBut if you look back at history this has happened before we've had a twelve years since Nineteen hundred when two or more major hurricanes have made landfall in the United states and these are this is really nothing new\nA hundred and Seventy hurricanes made landfall during the twentieth century [noise]\nAh there and and if you look at the actual evidence you don't see that's storms are either getting more frequent are stronger\nOr the U.S government also has data on a droughts and floods if you look for the lower forty eight states over the last hundred years\nOh indication we're seeing more floods are more droughts we had more drop some of the Nineteen thirties and we have three times a week or so we had a a a Nineteen sixty\nSo the dire consequences are just not occurring as people are predicting and people still write these articles but they never show data comparing the past to the president\nWhen we come back let's talk specifically about your new book outside the green box Steve Steve ... linked up the coast to coast am dot com spell it for you first name Steve G. O. R. E. H. A. M. dot ... dot com\nGhost insiders the new version of the coast to coast am map is now available for I'm bone in now Android ... on demand anywhere anytime good at ... dot com and downloaded today [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nAnd welcome back to coast to coast will take your calls next hour regardless of your thoughts on whether those global warming climate change we don't muscle you because people have different views Steve New book outside the green box told me about the title personable\n[noise] sure well that's a that's a book that tells you what's your green consultant doesn't tell you a written for general audiences and businesses and a one popular business a phrase use over and over and think outside the box so the\nTitle was think outside the green bucks because businesses today are are really trapped in the green boxer sustainable development there they're forced to do many things ah that don't really do anything for the environment\nAnd so I go through a what I call first before horsemen of environmental apocalypse [noise] uh which are overpopulation of the idea that humans are growing too fast and and populating the planet too fast or the second one is global pollution the idea that we're increasingly polluting the environment\nOf the third is climate destruction\nUh and the fourth is a resource depletion of those for fears are really at the basis of all of our state and federal laws about energy\nI'm a and they're taught universities and taught in a high schools but if you look at the actual trends you find out that none of those really is a significant problem they've all been exaggerated to a very very big extent so\nI discuss the horsemen and then I talk about what happens in is happening in different industries or energy materials agriculture or et cetera but it's a fun read it say a color paperback and a\nLot of color side bars and a lot of great quotes and also but uh uh eight hundred notes on the back so people can go deeper by the way for its size it's a heavy book\n[laughter] well I don't know about that but in lots of grievance really do put it that way also hired a cartoonist got a nice cartoon at the front of every chapter which got to summarize the some of the stuff in the chapter so it's a good read\nMore with climate change with what's happening I'm a I'm told that the United states today is the world's largest oil producer again have you know\nYeah that happened last uh last month or so we passed up Russia we had passed Saudi Arabia about four or five months ago amazed that\nCould be temporary because Saudi Arabia is talking about turning out a lot of ... additional oil production but uh we're growing very fast food the miracle of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling has turned the U.S into the world's energy powerhouse [noise] and ah yeah we're the biggest producer of crude no\nNo I Believe in Thomas schools theory of abiotic oil that the planet is God in abundance of oil which was natural when the planet was formed it's not just made up of dinosaurs and plants\n[noise] I tend to think that way to a matter of fact the Russians have said that for a long time what we know natural gas can be created by all sorts of things including a you know camels and horses and cows and everything else and and many people think deep within the earth\nOf the earth also produces a materials like gas and other things I so I think there's probably a combination of of some that his fossilized fuel but others others that do come up from the ... of the earth I Do believe that so I I Try not to use the phrase the phrase fossil fuels I like to use the combustible hydrocarbons instead\nOf who you know one of my simple theories on why the abiotic theory is the probable Siri is because most of the oil that has pumped on this planet is way way down there oh yeah I live in Lansing dead animals get down there\nThey're finding now below twenty thousand\nThe ... yeah some of these very deep wells they find oil and you got to kind of wonder the other thing is that a lot of it has been you know found in the polar regions too and in those regions tend not to have as much a plant life but I Know we have shipped shifting to the polls and other things that can occur but yeah I I Do think it's a\nIt probably is a combination of factors and maybe it is being produced stone down in the ... of the earth\nWhat is the argument about overpopulation and then it's a major problem for all of us so\nNineteen fifty um we had this huge population growth rate or across the world and up and until\nIt got up to be about a three percent per year by Nineteen Seventy ... the big reason for that was we had declining um infant mortality we had a declining death rates as we solved all these disease problems [laughter]\nAnd so a bunch of people like Paul Ehrlich of population bomb fame said that hundreds of millions of people are going to starve to death from the Nineteen seventies the Nineteen eighties [laughter] but they didn't uh\nFirst we had a global agricultural revolution and even though population grew to seven billion at it more than doubled or by two thousand and five we had triple the agricultural output but the other thing nobody else saw is that the fertility rates have been dropping [noise] the fertility rate is the number\nOf of ah children a woman will have in her lifetime and back in Nineteen fifty for the world each woman on average was having five children during her lifetime will today that has dropped down to two and a half [laughter]\nThat's a dropped in half and the reason is we have a society moving from an agricultural into a industrial and then a technological a sort of a state where more women entering the workforce there waiting to have children they're having smaller families\nSo all none of this was foreseen at all occurred and the great news is that uh we're probably going to get the global zero population growth within about fifty or seven years and so we're getting to a soft landing on on the population issue\nAnd benefit yesterday Steve in downtown Los Angeles for the red cross and affiliate KFI and as we were driving to get to the venue\nI saw things that I haven't seen in years because I spend a lot of time in St Louis I saw so many homeless people living in tents on the side of the room with more garbage in John Stewart strewn all over the place\nWhere his dad was a scene you know four new seats in Los Angeles yeah you're looking at how homeless\nPeople in in in the county of Los Angeles there are so that\nIt really is a tough situation\nWould you would you call wasted dumped him or you wear a solution [noise]\nUh it certainly is it it certainly is a litter problem as a minimum but yeah probably pollution you know the other thing though that if I might if I might comment the government to California keeps making housing more expensive you know you now have to every new residents has to have solar cells and I understand there they're going to want everything to have a electric car plug in\nSo he just had about twenty thousand dollars to the price of every home every residents of California does isn't really going to help the problem\nNo you're absolutely right what would you recommend that people start doing personally to combat the situation\n[noise] ... ... people and businesses ah you know actually a waste is actually a pretty good news problem as far as what's going in the land fills\nA that piqued about Nineteen Ninety in the United States Senate is now starting to trend down we're doing more recycling [laughter] um but uh businesses need to reduce real pollutants that we've touched on before\nA nitrogen oxide sulfur dioxide particulates et cetera are not carbon dioxide\nUm so uh the the efforts to reduce that really I mean again carbon dioxide is what they're pumping into greenhouses in California to make their cannabis crop grow\nA bigger and faster it sits plant food\nThat's right or the idea that ah that CEO to as harmful is crazy and and people always show you these\nPictures that where you have this dirty looking air over China if you can see the error that's not causing global warming all of the major global warming gases a greenhouse gases number one is water vapor but it's the biggest greenhouse gas to his carbon dioxide three has a methane those are all invisible [laughter]\nSo if you can if you can see the year you gotta clean that up but the greenhouse gases are are really not causing air pollution or so we need we need to get our our uh aimed at the real pollutants air and water and and quit trying to stop the planet from warming\nYou talked about in people coming in energy and climate regulations what what kind of ... is this\nYeah well we've had a basically a rate payer revolts now in Australia just this last summer in Australia um we had a a Scott Morris and take over as the uh the new ah ... minister\nOf Australia Malcolm Turnbull was turned out and leading the opposition was former prime minister Tony Abbott who is called for withdraw from the Paris

that was in the early Nineteen hundreds now every decade it's less than a million people died so we are making a lot of progress but I didn't want to suggest that we just ship them money [laughter] you're right on that\nLet's go to another caller barbers in Los Angeles hey barb will come to the program good to have you with us\nI think Ken tasked with tear gas final contest first of all I'm a lot of work being done less alternative than a team and you have a fake that frequent guest on your head David ...\nWith alcohol and gas and these outfits\nI'm\nPride cakes with that and then I Can't ... Oklahoma has more earthquake sit and wait dealing California palm oil drilling fracking primarily\nHandlers actually that\nIs true they are having more earthquakes but it isn't really fracking it is the it's the injection of wastewater from fracking that is causing those are like\nWell that's what I mean by the ... yeah well you're right indirectly it is\n[laughter] but uh they're working other other places where we can inject water all all day it's that's a really a problem to be solved by geologist uh they need to tell us where we can safely inject water where we can't and then uh and then will reduce the possibility of quakes\nSure possibility Steve the entire planet should just have some horrendous catastrophe that something could happen just shattered the planet to play absolutely\nIt could you know I I Hope that never happens and\nAnd you know all we can do though with with the things is adapt that's what we that's what we do with the storms that's we do with the sea level rise we've been doing that for a thousands of years\nUh there's really no evidence that we can control the climate we can do something locally with temperatures and locally but what with weather but not on a global scale I'm very unlikely that we can control the climate at this point\nTo British Columbia Canada we go to the first time caller Terri Hi Terry thanks for calling\nFellow man it's a good night to be having this discussion I most appreciate it\nUh for George ... first than if the current age as the information age user are the cutting edge and you'd have my total respect I think you would ... them I say I am the Lone Ranger\n[laughter] I have lost\nMost of my credibility\nKiller researcher but people think I'm Crazy or heated and bringing up these these arguments that you do means nothing and there's [laughter]\n... boom warming is a very sexy position\nBecause people feel smart and that if I just you know say my balls or do whatever I'll save the planet and [laughter]\nI'm sure you've heard it before but no big thing that I Love to bring up in this totally discredited like Mr Gura to address this or the Ninety thousand to cargo ships at sea they're pumping [noise]\nSulphur into the air\nThat must have a profound effect on 'em\nWell there is there there is an issue right now I'm cargo ships use fairly high so for fuel fairly furry dirty fuel um and I think the uh I Can't remember which organization is but the but the international organization on shipping\nHas actually agreed to go move to some different a lower so for fuel types\nAnd a lot of folks in the industry think that it's going to be a problem that's probably a good step so so I'm generally in favor of moving to lower so for fuel overtime [noise] um there's a lot of people also talking about cutting greenhouse gases from ships so it primarily carbon dioxide I think that probably is not such a good idea [laughter]\nBut that is one of those real real pollution problems we need to clean up we also need to do a little or improve uh the problem with the litter of plastic and the oceans that's another\nIssue that we need to work in organization was the international maritime organization thank you that's [laughter] that's it and they're they're predicting that the the increase is going to be huge\nUh in the next several years by twenty fifty if no action is taken the increased by up to two hundred and fifty percent that's a big jump\nThe sulfur yeah [noise]\nOr possibly so yeah I I couldn't really comment on that but I think so I think that's probably a good step\nLet's go to roots in Portland, Oregon Hi roots go ahead\n[noise] [noise] Hi how you and your you and thank you for filling in my blank spaces I have no\nControl over who's going okay no I'm Serious I'm\nGetting is I think that ... he ordered um right now and if they can get rid of them have a plan they can make our world more free and\nLike my aunt paying it forward now putting our technology and in in a place where we can bring our energy to where it all in the freezer for everybody that would be great and I think they can do it and that might be here that rescue here donate to making our our uh\nDams in a eager to better and I've done that\nWe're looking at it even even the little people out here like me and a man is bigger than I can pay it forward right now I think that we all can live free\nI mean without anything\nThat would be great but Steven they're going to want to make money on this some aren't they\nI mean one of the great points that I talk about in the uh the second chapter of outside the green boxes the rise of democracy for the United states basically was the first modern democracy now we have\nUh just about I think it's almost Ninety ... set of ... that have a form of democratic government so it's going from zero to Ninety nations\nAnd with that you know we get the benefits of legal equality and freedom of speech religion and rule of law limitation of slavery women's suffrage personal property rights a lot of other things so the world is getting freer oh that's a very positive thing and it's all part of this idea that everybody is better off\nThere's a lot of people going around saying the world's gonna collapse suddenly got overpopulation we got pollution we read always terrible things but people are healthier lives and and one aspect of that is the rise of democracy\nSee what do we do with people's cars this to me is one of the most heartbreaking situations people who cannot afford electricity or their gas or let's say it's the dead of winter and it's going to get shut off because they can't afford it\nWhat do we do with those kinds of folks I mean it's it's sad\nYeah that's a tough situation actually United States is in better shape than many European places because uh we have very low cost electricity um [noise]\nA price us here in the United states I often put up a graph comparing Europe almost all year the nations in Europe hire a electricity prices and we have here in the United states we have the lowest cost natural gas in the world are right now we're the biggest petroleum producer\nBut we should we say though that nobody nobody gets shut off during implement weather or can we say that\nI Am not going to get into that I Do think many of the the uh the utilities have that sort of policy that they're\nEither not allowed to do that by law they will see where they're not going to do that during equipment whether [noise] and they tend to postpone things some of the summer I think\nHold on

of vents what seems to be the question that most people want answered\nWell um there are many um [noise] you know I speak to businesses and one of the things I I run across as they they tell me you're preaching to the choir\n[laughter] but the funny thing\nIs though they don't realize that the majority of us business thinks that the climate laws on the energy laws are foolish in many ways\nThe headlines or grab by a lot of the big companies like apple and Google and uh the political leaders but but the kind of the rank and file of of American business um thinks a little bit different but they don't realize that they're in a majority [noise]\nUh so it's a little bit of a strange situation [noise] um\n[noise] let's see what are some of the other major questions why why are all the climate models wrong\nIs is uh something that people come up with that has to do with some of the assumptions [laughter] um\nAre they concerned about anything\n[noise] well they you know back in Nineteen Ninety the United nations and the Intergovernmental Panel on climate change predicted but it uh temperatures would rise three tenths of a degree Celsius per decade\nA with a mix of five ten so low of too tense and if you put those on a chart those rights pretty fast but over the last Thirty years we were fed much less than that so we're\nWe're below the estimates for the United nations that they made in Nineteen Ninety we're not seeing me that rice that was forecasted which basically says the assumptions are the climate models are wrong and natural factors dominate global temperatures\nLet's go to Joe in Long Island New York to east of the Rockies Hey Joe go ahead\nSteve interesting show actually I Want climate change I wanted to be warmer but color skin or add a comment about a quick uh my first question what they uh\nWe just had a factor in Indonesia unfortunately and they said that they weren't really warned that that was supposed to be a week and that was working with the people kind of\nWay this\nThing [laughter] so I I relate this to a whole ocean temperatures how well monitored all shouldn't temperatures and to satellites come into play with anything to do with that the second question would be\nA political climate you know ... boy talk about the last couple of weeks twenty four seven as see a you know Brett Kavanaugh are in his shoes and a and a\n... you know it does make me think that the senators\nDon't have time to study science never or the tourists and really don't have a good grasp of science maybe they took one course thirty forty fifty years ago and science and never really updated themselves on their own\nUh and uh you know I don't want to pick on trial is already gotten blamed for the recent hurricane or the Washington Post\nAnd ah that my comment would be uh you said the nuclear ... industry uh was traditional\nAnd I think it's a like a lot of people are a potential disaster waiting to happen [laughter] I Know it doesn't contribute to climate a big ... CEO to really look at Chernobyl\nThat still only buried at still active it's never been contained nobody can go within fifty miles of the place ... years later\nSo uh you take New York for example you got to the point right man them or their stake metro area or something that happened with that then what happens in New York City\nSo you got a whole bunch of things that are I think there were three of 'em one was what are we doing with ocean temperature measurements the uh the national oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has I think they are the ones who put out these diving\nUm\nA measuring devices I forget the name of them again but they have thousands of 'em out there now but\nNow they've only been deployed for about a twelve to Fifteen Years so we really only have data on ocean temperatures are from measurements uh over the last twelve to Fifteen Years before that it was just you know people take 'em and chips and kind of measurements are going around and those were very accurate\nThat the the um\nThe thing you said about ... uh what's um let's see ... the third one was a nuclear plants I think one of the big issues with nuclear plants that they need need to solve is I Need to be able to shut down automatically\nWe still have plants so most of the ones that are on the world that are relying on cooling systems in the cooling systems fail fail\nLike happened with the Saddam in Japan and then we have a chance for a big melt down so that problem needs to be solved um the other big problem with nuclear is is just frankly natural gas is so darn cheap right now nobody will build a nuclear plant\nAnd I think the third one was\nUm satellites but you said something about governments and once you're going\nTo have I I think eight or ... or undefeated about five times in the U.S Congress\nI think the majority of a arguably more than half of the United states so members of Congress right now do not think global warming is a dangerous problem I most of those around the Republican side of course [noise]\nPanned as when I mentioned we have we have we now have a climate revolt so if you will in Australia and Ontario so I think I think political leaders are starting to get it\nUh this has been a disaster crisis for more than Twenty years now and we're really not seeing the disaster so I'm hopefully I've covered most of your issues\nI think the biggest problem we've got as an ex clear from the sun that could wipe out our power grid in render a useless forever that\nThat's possible probably a big explosion there again if the if all those ... go off in Antarctica melt of big bunch of ... the south of the of the peninsula down there that could be there's just many many things that could occur\nUm again we need to adapt as well we can and the biggest one is a nice age boy I like this warm weather folks I Do not want to see the start of the studies that\nWe've got we've got against Robert Felix who believes were in the early stage of a nice age ... okay\nWho knows Walter in Pennsylvania and taken away well go ahead\nBy George needless to say I did talk to you once again George\nThank you Walter charging up with all due respect Mitch to Guam sounds a lot like a doctor Kimball George\nWith all due respect to most of them I don't think that Dr Paul Ehrlich there has been discredited though I think George I think it's just common sense\nAbout the human population on this planet cannot increase in line with them\nNow you know George we share this planet with other species are not modern agriculture may have a lot of the uh the ancient a bane of law and modern agriculture consumes much natural habitat\nAnd now the human population eat driving Diyala he shouldn't\nSays in this country are\nYou know we have largely eradicated the great a herd of buffalo bites and\nOh so you know naturally you you could not twenty million\nA\nQuake by sitting hers that used to be twenty million in a hurry you couldn't now ... they would be compatible with our agriculture where the by horribly wrong we have law\nExpansion fields of corn and soybeans and wheat so uh you know I think it's common sense out the human population a lot of clean shot in a lot of them\nWill there comes a point Steve is they're not that you know you can't have a population of twenty billion people on the planet\nNo you can't and and you make good points well but the the the predictions are now that we're going to level of about ten and a half billion there is no doubt that the Weaver radically transform the surface of the earth\nYou ... and our

um\nI think it's the missing link\nWell I mean you know it's it's a missing link of some kind in that when I used to seeing this type of thing [noise]\nYou know we're familiar with ... lions and tigers and bears and human beings yeah [noise]\nAnd um you know when people encounter this thing they're not quite sure what to make out of it [noise] uh I've had a number of people telling me that you know it's not humid it's not a human hybrid either it's simply a big foot\n[noise] and I think the uh the relationship between something walking on two legs having two arms pans with fingers attach you know and I ... mouth ears\nJust makes us think more human [laughter] because the way it's walking around and the way or the way we ... [noise] but um yeah I don't I don't really think it's a hybrid I think it is simply its own entity\nIt's very odd totally unique and because of the lack of sightings or the few that had been said and then you also have to consider George how many of these things are actually being\nMean scene and how many are being told to us the stigma surrounding\nThese creatures where people don't want to talk about it they don't want to give the name they prefer if he didn't tell them the exact location where this this happened to them [noise]\nUh you know they're at work they don't want to mention it I mean you know these are real problems when it comes to a ascertain ing a evidence pertaining to the creatures you know people don't want to speak [noise]\nI put inside the cover my book if you've seen something say something [noise]\nAnd uh another thing that's worthy talking about a ... I think some people misunderstand it [noise] I did a little disclaimer inside the cover and it was kind of a play on words\nBut uh basically what I said was in his marches big foot has not been deemed real these works oh worker fiction\nAnd the point I was trying to make was in the eyes of the world\nEvery thing about big foot is fiction for the most part would you go before\nThe the ... film or could date after the Patty film [noise] uh most of the world looks at these things with a wink and a nod [noise] I mean when I have conversations with people about a big foot when I have conversations with people about [noise] uh UFOs\nHe a typical conversation is that if somebody looking at you with a big grin on their face [noise]\nListening to what you have to say and then sing to you come on you don't really believe that\nThere was a guy who called the program years ago when our bill was still alive cold ... any claim that\nHe shot too big for it and had them and of course\nI don't know what happened the guy you\nKnow definitely don't know what happened to the recorded ... what are those kinds of stories in your opinion on Senate or made a\nWell you know [noise] what what are we talking about George we're talking about one person it's like a he said she said\nGreat I Believe me the proof [noise] yeah\nI Believe that these people have no ax to grind I heard that story a when a or did it and I'm thinking about it the man who is not being paid he could have easily just shut up and walked away [noise]\nHe didn't he wasn't trying to sell anything you know [noise] uh he was reporting on what happened\nAnd the fact was he like a lot of other people had a certain amount of guilt about it [noise] uh having seen it they really didn't know what to do with it they knew there was going to possibly be some repercussions [noise]\nAnd so they buried them [laughter] uh I've had a couple of encounters a where animals have been killed was said to have been killed one of them was in self defense\nAnd a dismantle this thing was going to kill him [noise] ah and what are you to say about that\nAt my just say you know he'll wrong for doing that you should have you shouldn't have done that you shouldn't have pulled the trigger I mean I can only I Can't imagine\nThere and that's a different than just going out into the wild look for one to shoot it\nWell that's that's correct you know if he's like I could um well I don't know let me let you continue I have so many things you or it could show we\nWill do that and we've got a break coming up in a couple of minutes or ... or\n... or like I said I have some people uh who have seen buddies [noise] a couple of guys say they shot them and\nAs far as ... concerned\nI thought he knew his firearms I thought he knew his uh bullets\nUh it didn't seem it seemed very real to me and there's a lot of people uh down south uh ended his neck of the woods\nThat do go out on these night on a I have a couple of uh accounts with guys were out hog hunting feral hogs\nAre which is becoming a big problem down\nYou know huge insurance\nAnd are there are people actually being hired out now by a lot of farmers and landowners uh because it's different for your children are getting attacked by these borders and whatnot\nThat a hiring people to go on their property they go out at night they have lights they're riding around some of them have electric basically golf carts so they could ride around rather a stole fully\nAnd they're you know trying to gain an upper hand on some of these I personally I think there shoveling against the tide [noise] but um [noise] people feel like they have a need to try to take some of these animals down\nA thankfully as they're doing it to me there's going to you know food kitchens and whatnot but it's a it's a real problem\nI had a ... year ago\nFrom an individual who was fishing and he caught two trials and he said as soon as he kind of realize what was going on he saw a big flood looking at him about eight feet away\nAnd he said he's holding the two Trump the guy is in the big one looks at him\nTo do so in a panic she handed the to travel to the big foot and the big foot took them looked at them and gave one back now does that sound real to you or do you think the guy called and made it up\nI'll be honest with you a that is one of the most unreal\nStories or if I heard that it would have discounted a entirely however having said that I had a gentleman was new in Vermont and\nHe had taken over lake in to a creek\nLet's hold on to that story while you were going to take a break we'll come back and talk about that I've always had suspects about that a fishing store but ah let's get yours when we come back\nGoes to insiders the new version of the coast to coast am map is now available for bone in now Android for ... listen live we're on demand anywhere any time to coast to coast am dot com and downloaded today [noise]\nThe one line exceptional transfer credits for information tax base to three seven nine when three learned for yourself ... seat was ranked number one for innovation by US News and World Report on learned to drive with Arizona State university for more information about and the one line\nSpace three seven nine one three back to the ACTs three seven nine one three\n\nAnd\nWon't come back to coast to coast here was William ... author of the big foot terror in the woods William you were telling us about somebody in a canoe when a break on us\nYes yes so what this gentleman was a canoeing in a creek up in Vermont and really was Puerto during and stomping when he came across some nice holes that he felt he could get some good trout and [noise]\nAnd ah he was lining up some trout on Iraq near him as he was catching them maybe was camping on the side of the creek and there's plenty of course being the cook 'em up for dinner so he had caught a few brook trout late I'm On a rock and\nWhen he turned over Detroit we're gone now\nIs first and think that a raccoon took more raccoons stroke them and I've actually had happened to me fishing that connect quite river or wherever I heard a little world filling the bushes and I turned my head and a rainbow ahead laying up\nOn the side of the river [noise] ah I see a raccoon stick it on the left and right\nGrabbed it and went back into the grass so I Know this happened and that's what he thought [noise] so a little later on he was putting more fish up there when he saw a long arm and out at all most ground level\nAnd the huge hand grasp the pile of fish not just one fish in one school grabbed numerous fish and retract it back into the weeds\nAnd that when he saw that\nIt was game over because he knew this was something in the woods said he hadn't bargain for and the problem was that where it had reached out at ground level\nIs can shut up about fifty feet away from them [laughter] so shortly thereafter that he got the guts to go over there and repack up his mind and started to make its way out with the canoe [noise] but he had said that\nHe thought it was a big point obviously what else has a long hair rearming began burning standing out of the bushes\nAnd then he also realize that this thing had to have been crawling on its belly\nAnd the lord shall be sneaking along kind of like a soldier trying to sneak up\nAnd ...\nAnd was able to know that he was pushing short him fishing show you what you're doing by placing these fish on the rock and then had positioned itself\nOr in such a way where we could get up there and\nGet the fish and recreate back into the woods without being seen but according to him when he saw the first group of British\nMissing he was actually sitting on a rock smoking is pipe any hat is peripheral vision looking out towards Iraq now now being mindful he wanted to catch the raccoons and the act [laughter]\nOh well it's not a raccoon at all and uh he was pretty it was pretty frightened off by that\nAnd and tell us with these reports on a people describe the creature in terms of tight neural big but how big\nA little bit it really varies I Would say a minimum you're talking a seven feet tall [noise] uh and I had a point he had\nA a lot of people say the comical shape to there's varieties of a a hair for coloration ranging from like salt and pepper\nTo a lot of people use the term or burned or read a and then of course brown and black so that seems to be a variety and then we have two different basically physique\nUh it seems that you either have these kind of almost ... very early a beer like for lack of a better term and then there's the other one that appears again and again and it's described as being like a weightlifter\nOr a ... you know Arnold Schwarzenegger or to the nth degree type of body extremely muscular or the chest you know bowl jing thighs you know just like a a real monster\nSo these are the things that people are seeing and it it just varies a I had one I'm\nA one story cold decree stand a incident I named it with this fellow claimed that his trees stand who is twenty five feet in the tree which put his feet at something like twenty feet [noise]\nAnd this sasquatch and a group above the sasquatch is [noise] it seemed that the group was distracting him making our own noises in the woods while he was bow hunting\nAnd he couldn't see because of the density of the trees and the fog that was laying in this valley in the early morning [noise]\nBut he had said he recognizes the hunter that these our little noises one not real in other words they were being mimicked\nAnd he was kind of paying attention to this and sorting out the pieces [noise] a sasquatch snuck up on him from the rear and jet Li grab the heel of his boo [laughter]\nThink about how big this thing had to be [noise] even if he was wrong in this measurement nobody ... trees stand ten feet off the ground I mean he said twenty five feet so what if he was at twenty feet and his people read I don't know Seventeen\nSomething\nAt that have tremendous height and reach [noise] but the amazing thing about that story was\nThe way he said that the creature ... grabbed his boot\n[noise] and he jumped to the point where he almost fell out of the stand and when he looked down this thing was looking up at him and he commented how he almost won that it just wanted him to know that it can do that that they could sneak up on him and ...\nAnd then it left the scene and everything went quiet again\nGeez now maybe you're born big foot terror in the woods tell us about the terror Porsche what what's going on out there\nI mean first of all when we talk about terra or when we used the word bizarre uh in regards to big foot I ... I take the stand as to what is more terrifying\n[noise] is it ... is it not enough terrifying to see a ten foot tall monster walking across the shoulder road or is it more terrifying to have one linking you in the woods or when you're hiking with your girlfriend [noise]\nThese things are out there they're frightening people a lot of the encounters a somewhat casual wear this scene from afar and then the people exit hastily\nBut then this other encounters where it's my opinion\nThese things don't want the people to be where they are [noise]\nAnd they seem to exhibit behavior that in my

Robert's with us to get things started hey Robert go ahead sir\nGeorge yeah we can thank you\nOnly have two questions have you ever seen them all to make sure captured and killed him around a little show and they might go to this thing looks like the real McCoy\nWas in Pennsylvania now and I should go to Sharon in this one big caught up and the other big Megan\nAnd the second question I as you mentioned some men that\nShot a big what happened after that but it could go down like I should have what kind of weapons well\nHere's an answer your first question no I'm unfamiliar with the uh too because it's in Pennsylvania [noise]\nUh but I have a number of historical accounts one of them was quite interesting [noise] uh that came from a photograph taken from a a a grandparents' house after the\nFinal grandparents had died in which was depicted a work camp in Virginia at the time [noise] uh that was set up\nA after Roosevelt pet established a [noise] uh the protection of the park [noise]\nUh they they needed to start making ... an access to these parks and structures so people could go in there and stay in a bathroom facilities and rangers stations so they had assembled this civilian core of workers\nAnd these guys were in basically roughing it in the wilderness in these newly protected uh a wooded areas that were to become a national parks and they will regularly having encounters with what they called the hairy men\nAre in fact in the one in ... account in a one of my books called the hairy men one of these things came into the camp and tried dragging on demand off of this caught any older men attacked it throwing a handout taxes\nAnd grabbing guns shooting at the thing as it ran a out of their uh encampment\nNow but the odd thing is about these things [noise] it seems that shock gunfire has almost no effect on them are in fact one account called the ... and the hunters\nThis guy hit this thing at twenty twenty five yards so we're both bottles of a seven and a half lead shot and he said the thing didn't even flinch and kept running through a briar patch [noise] uh in answer to your second question about a big puts being shot\nOr in my account called the bullet [noise]\nThis guy was hunting in um I think was Idaho\nAt any rate he came to an area or in the woods where he was confronted with a mountains in a ridge line on three sides in front of him and he ran across what he described as a corn to call it made out of stick [laughter]\nHe said this thing did not randomly form there in fact there was nothing about this pine forests have lent itself\nTo having this quantity of sticks and branch bows oh bows and branches formed in this type of thing any inside had about a two foot deep a layer of branches as well as well for me what he thought was like betting his initial thought was that\nHunters had built this thing as like a shelter when they were out there but that was shown to change on this line that he had initially seen coming into the place he was now seeing a dark figure standing at the ridge which started to charge in his direction down the hill\nNow he estimated that this rich line was about a Fifteen hundred feet\nAbove the valley that he was standing in and he said that the ... that this thing was running down the hill was impossible for a man to do this thing will come to the base of the ridge\nHe estimated now than it was about six to nine hundred yards away from his position and at the time he was a hunting with a vintage Korean War vintage am one car being [noise]\nAs it got closer he level the site on it and pumped around over its head thinking it was scary it kept running he described this thing as looking like the cop in the Terminator movie\nOne that that the cyborg or whatever the heck they called the Terminator robot was posing as the police officer\nAnd how he was running relentlessly with the arms pumping and like nothing could stop them\nEven load is gone fired a second round added he sure he hated it had no effect on them and they kept broadening he fired a third\nAnd fourth round and if things kept coming at him now was closing in squeeze the trigger on the fifth bullet which is why I named the story the bullet and it's finally drop\n[noise] and when he walked up on it he got closer we shot it with another round he got even closer to he realized the thing was was not moving in that it was gone and he left it where it was\nNow here's the thing George\nFirst of all this guy shooting this thing in self defense he's in imminent danger or\nThis things coming at him like a bat outta hell he's shooting at this thing and the bullet seem to be having having no effect on them and yet when he saw it lying on the ground he conceded that had been more to do was multiple blood\nPatches were these bullets had actually hit it [noise] but why these things can ... you know we all know if you go hunting [noise]\nIf you don't hit a move or an Al Gore deer if you don't get a good long shot or heart shot some type of solid organs shut these things can run\nAnd hunters to lose their uh Corey not being able to find it because they can go for miles or you know they could just disappear on you if you don't get a\nGood shot [noise]\nBut these creatures\nIt seems like to me if you gonna take one of these things down it's kind of be a head shot it's got to be in the neck or the ... or something ... much sadly they have to take them now what I mean what are you going to do Georgia rhino\nR. by the way I looked at the picture that Eighteen seventies series a big\nUh they didn't have photo shop the news is very very intriguing picture\nThey got a couple of these ah old hunters with the big for a they're holding him up or he's obviously dead bloody shoot she's huge you just Google\nEighteen Seventy big shot in Pennsylvania in the picture\nAmazing take a look at you and I\nI have a diary of town a cold but the hunters diary it's it's no longer than a handwritten letter that you would write the to your wife\nAnd in there they're not talking about big foot or anything this isn't a brief account of a guy in a uh his two friends that went up to Canada
