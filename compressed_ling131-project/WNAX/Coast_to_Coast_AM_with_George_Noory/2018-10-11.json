would you just thank him he's saved my life so you've helped a lot of people\nGet literally millions of we're in fifty countries now Georgian or so so very proud of that we have five thousand products to deal with over nine hundred different diseases and uh it's just so we run into this all over the world and it's just so very gratifying to be able to help so many people\nDr story that I had a couple of weeks ago that I see you know when you were going to view on was that you talked about this but eating foods like bacon and sausages they say may raise the risk of breast cancer what's going on here\nBut it's an absolute fact or you know I'm ... my thesis for my postdoctoral fellowship and the sixties and seventies I did twenty thousand autopsies I'm Seventeen thousand some change over four hundred and fifty four species of animals and three thousand humans are looking for\nA a common thread were animals were getting the same um diseases in death from the same pollutants 'cause everybody knew the earth is going to end until he's from pollution\nAs humid and when he found was of course that there were no deaths\nFrom a pollution um but ... but I did find\nThat when people ate one serving a day whether the male or female if anyone serving a day of any processed meat things like Delhi slice of the sandwich meat sauce sea ham bacon baloney salami pastrami pepperoni jerk economies bam Cerrito those kind of things [noise]\nUm then increase their risk many different types of cancers at the same rate as smoking two packs of cigarettes a day I I wrote that up and published in Nineteen Seventy one everybody laughed at me well in two thousand Fifteen\nThe world Health Organization and set it and then just a couple of weeks ago there's big study in England where they said they looked at like five hundred thousand people who are getting these processed meats and sure enough you know men get breast cancer\nYou know as well as women and\nOf course it also have um a cause and effect or in a lung cancer colorectal cancer and stomach cancer and so on\nAbsolute fact and so\nI haven't the eating process means for fifty years\nTalking to a friend of mine who has been\nJust starting the regimen a little late and let me tell you why\nShe went to the doctor a couple of months ago and the diagnosed her with the uterine cancer don't gain or are you there I guess they're going to give her full hysterectomy she's all upset but ... ... ... what do you do at this age\nOld ... has metastasized other words has left theaters and gone to lymph nodes and the liver and that\nKind of thing I don't think so okay well\nI'm your immune system is your best friend when you have cancer chemotherapy kills cancer cells no doubt about it but also kills normal cells many people who die probably eighty percent of the people who died when they're getting chemotherapy treatment for cancer\nOf the doctors oh gosh you know we just we got 'em too late and it is so sorry that we weren't able to to stop the cancer but invariably it was the fact that the chemotherapy agents killed all the normal cells that kill the patient is not the cancer [laughter]\nAnd so that's a a problematic thing with a trading with chemotherapy but as everybody's choice are they going to get that are now the antioxidants and immune support is your best friend\nWhen you have any type of cancer or any type of cancer and so was uterine cancer testicular cancer prostate cancer colorectal cancer stomach cancer lung cancer\nBrain cancer I mean we could we could save John McCain of ... to come to us okay ah he had a brain cancer other that actually caused by a deficiency of a single mineral\nAnd I'm\nA ... and so by the gate and chemotherapy instead of giving them the nutrients\nIn it is it okay to do both\nWell many people do and do they do very well we we have one\nI Would I Would I Would I Would you know because unlike conventional medicine in some cases um but I Love natural things in all cases but I probably would do ... I had my debts and do a combination\nNothing wrong with that well we have one product I mean we have probably probably two dozen antioxidant product that would take 'em all [laughter]\nBut um there's two of them are wanted which was a dumb it big study I'm In I'm a I'm Charlotte North Carolina I'm In the medical school and it was a ten year study a hundred and twenty million dollar study was the government's study\nAnd um it's it's on our ... grape seed extract has a liquid or from our um nature's Pearl division and it's probably shouldn't street journals\nAnd it just came out like last year at the end of the study and it was one of the most effective\nUm cancer which I say survival uh products and so liquid and you take two servings a day per hundred pounds of body weight\nAnd um there was nothing like it out there and that so they they were just so excited I'm by the hundred and twenty million dollar government study medical school\nIn Charlotte North Carolina Republican Trey medical journals it's liquid extract of of from the mosquito and grape seed and it's just so beautiful product and then of course we have we call her Rosie radical uh eight hundred and fifty university studies in Japan\nOn CSI radical it or has the um ... which is an extract from red green algae that they credit is the reason why they have so few cancer deaths there and they have a a lower rate of cancer than any other nation because they eat so much of this\nWritten marine algae as part of their sushi stuff as part of their standard died [noise] and so we have a product called Z radical and few causes either capsules and the radical the liquid\nAnd so I take that and of course I take the mosquito and grape seed capsules and they take the most getting grape seed liquid cause for prevention my immune system a top and I don't eat the processed meats\nAnd um and and so you get your body than Ninety cents and your chance to sixteen minerals sixteen vitamins film is just very petty officer your body functions probably including your immune system\nAnd you're going to do very well um your quality of life goes up you live longer you are able to fend off in a void in so many diseases\nBecause most of the ones that used to be said to be a genetic it really just simple nutritional deficiency disease is [noise] and that's why my thesis charges in the Smithsonian Institute is a national treasure and sells for twenty five thousand dollars\nEach somebody in young jeopardy the company behind critical Health News dot com is entering the cannabis markets a big way right now we use CBD Oil I I think it's going to be a wonderful people listen\nWell I'm Glad you brought that up because you know there's thousands of little companies have out there is CBD Oil they sell CBD Oil as in tobacco shops and whiskey stores and liquor stores and so forth [noise]\nSo what we did we added things to our CBD Oil or so so bland and you get the benefit of the ... plus the enhancement of these other products we have three products right now\nDid you hear the first one was it's an ... if you put drops energized coal relax and this plan has came a meal and lavender but Larry in which many people are familiar with and melatonin oh\nJust sort of relax you and just to show good very smart\nAnd so now instead of our CPR which everybody else has dealing with a five or six standard uh problems including sleep apnea and so forth now are blend with all these uh again Kevin ... and melatonin\nWith our video now it deals with the issues and of course we have a topical cream it's a battle for pain and not only does it have the pain relief of CBS which was just fabulous and its own right\nWe have a big mixture of herbs in there which I'm\nMinerals and of course we have good at that I own another Antioch\nMonitoring hole into the tribe has come to watch my head I lodged top condition you they'll say look killer decided to stop pecking kinda Bora maybe it's just incredible to set up enough she'll be ... ... when I have the extra category two and a half months later\nSomething amazing which already ... how to actually have contracted staggering about baseball which has been conducted\nOn soft spot can kind of made it all started coming for like a kinda barbaric ... excuse the pun [noise] well I think that works beautifully\nOwner Richard astro here we're talking about the power of waking up your immune system which has heal this gentleman's haunt perhaps the immune system can be called one of the bodies fears this powers to he'll visit C.\nA.
