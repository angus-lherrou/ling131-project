this is it\nI'm dead end nowhere back something beyond me\nBack up popped right back up and then my uncle didn't even know I went under just kept walking but it was the weirdest feeling but I thought that was it for me it was a strange feeling\nCorrect I wanted to tell you I don't know if you ever went to my website but Iowa lots of times Oh thank you I was at the world Trade Center\nWhen nine eleven occurred because my husband and I had an apartment very club through like a thousand feet from some of the world Trade Center and we moved there about a month before buildings came down\nYeah we were just there a month and on the day we moved and Jack and I looked up and the world Trade Center was towering over our little building on liberty court and I I said you know we had to each other boy the St ... were finished well exactly a month later they'd come down as you know\nAnd we were\nWe had to leave the building and because it was unsafe to be there so many people in that area had to leave [noise]\nBut we came back a few days later when it was safe and I had the most phenomenal experience and that's where my website where um what happened I I actually had gone to sleep and I was awake and and tell him to go on to the living room\nAnd to help people to cross over because they were coming through they had created the portal in my building and in my apartment and the people who

rewarding oath on to share dreams I mean we don't have good ways of talking about dreams most of us when we remember some here in Paris how do we talk about this how do we tell us\nSo one of the things lacking in our society is a way that makes it fun and as I say socially rewarding to bring a dream to the table I invented the very simple full step process the sharing a dream of a story that makes it sound you can get it done in minutes to get some help ... feedback and you're guided tours action but there are other reasons\nWhy we're losing our genes I mean bad habits a pot tonight is part of the let out so they rushed out to sleep by the alarm clock but the need to get the job of deal with the family when we think that we should lie in the in bed and don't pay and it took eight dollars or whatever and they pay any attention\nTo those in between twilight states of consciousness too between sleep in the wake that's a good time to catch it means there's good times and Bachmann loose and dreaming but many people don't realize that it just seemed because they're awake in the middle of the night yet ... says losing that\nSometimes we close our boundary because they're scared of what they might be telling us we don't want to know that we might get sick we don't want to know that our actions may not be okay we don't want to know the relationship is in trouble so he'd slam the door and say no more dreams sometimes this is very interesting\nSometimes they kiss goodbye to our dream because we think that our dreams and giving us a luring pictures\nOf possibility that we cannot manifest because but not young enough but not rich enough we'll never find the right below the right guy and then sometimes strangely we kiss goodbye to dream because we don't think we can bring from a beautiful romantic breathing space\nWhat we would like to see an hour waking life these are some of the reasons that people lose their dreams\nAnd I noticed that you know if you follow the the simple suggestion that I also you can get chilled dreams that you can start dreaming again in the sense of remembering and recalling and one of the most simple ideas is\nYou might have something to them and I think you've got nothing but some say you've got nothing and tell us pay attention she might have a with he might have a fragment and if you can call that up and begin to play with that you might have a way of getting back in touch with your dreams and another thing I'd say to people George's\nFor them to you can dream wide awake world around you will speak the language of signs and symbols and some good is if you pay attention and sometimes you get more look to the pop up so the pop ups and waking life that can give you ship is because you feel my gosh there's a hidden handed work\nThat that helps to turn on the dream flown the night as well\nAs some incredible wage the dream pre cognitive lucid dreams what about these recurring dreams and you've had had some stories are directly related to that\n[laughter] well it's a recurring dream is coming again and again there's a hilarious story a mysterious realities about a woman doctor from England who's complaining of the breakfast table\nHow Robert why do I keep having the same thing dream when I got to do my medical exams Thirty years on and I did them I keep having the same dream I said what I Would say in general or you know if if you if it really is the same ... very close to the same dream it's probably because\nYou have dreamed producers who are making a dream movie for you that's something that goes on to\nAnd they're trying to get a message through you're trying to get you understand the situation I'm trying to educate you all assuming you might have some clue about what's going on they've tried to mobilize you to take some action on the situation so I I did one of the stories I I picture I sort of dream production movie company\nThat is making dreams for us and repeating the ...\nThe stories I I picture I sort of dream production movie company that is making dreams for us and repeating the performance if necessary in order to get a message across and I actually picked how I'll dream produces might be getting very bulletin fed up with us if they have to keep on making the same office is\nNot getting the message of not taking action from it that's one of the ways that ... come about I mean dreams that not all to be put in one box we do have dreamed productions where you feel and you might be quite right when you feel this that there was a production crew behind the scenes\nThat is making a certain kind of dream you because you need to get a message and another the stories and mysterious reality as I describe but very strange women who sat down next to me in a plane and old reality and mentioned me at a certain point the dead have been to the ... he was a ... musician he'd been shot in the face and a diner in Seattle on the knees creepy story\nAnd he says to her in her dream I'm I've got a great job now I'm helping to make movies both people are that they're seeing their dreams that I'm doing the music and the special effects on the fact that goes on I think that's another fascinating aspect about happening and dreams\nWho's in charge of this though who's who's the director of these productions\nBoy that's a very good question indeed it might be you the dream a if you become more conscious of what is going on and decide to step into that role until you become conscious it might be either some shadow or hidden aspect of yourself maybe if you're a high a self maybe a site they wise or inside the highest self\nIs the director I don't think any of this is alien to us I think we are connected to all of this I think the dream production company that might be staging movies for you is not alien to is not hostile to you and it's probably being run by someone with a site it why is the perspective\nMaybe more of a sense of humor than you currently have about your current situation because one of the ways that dream shock is awake into doing some costs correction is they dramatized and they spoof parity or what what we're doing in our lives in a way that makes it very difficult to avoid noticing that some action might be required\nDreams are powerful Robert in a eyeball we used it for my own personal life to get things done accomplish things once you learn how to master your dreams there's no end to what you can do\nThat's right I mean I think that here's here's where our our current understanding of dreaming and current physics or meet up with I mean ... is our current under staffed by kinda understanding I mean the really ready to revive riding and understanding about dreams that dream is traveling for example\nA physics tells the science tells us that we have access to any moment so the mentality of non local mind we're the field of information quantum field of information that

point\nYou're ready to lose the dream on that subject as well because he's got some breast and you're ready to take off\nAnd it's amazing how many creative solutions come through in this way and they've come through across history one of my book the secret history of dreaming is full of ... narratives from the documentation that suggested dreaming is actually a secret engine in the history of

for time travel but time doesn't move into a new one direction and in fact to understand what our relationship with the time is through dreaming we have to know that in dreaming we step out of Libya time altogether we stepped into a different place and in between place\nFrom which we can access time passed a future or parallel so you may discover that in your dreams your getting really interesting experiences\nOf what's going on in other times altogether in those parallel times we leading a power live this becomes very interesting when you begin to look at give some lessons you

to coast Robert Moss with us his latest work is called mysterious realities how many books have you written rubber\nBusiness of trying to fit publish the old way George but I must tell you I'm getting nervous because I Dreamed sometime ago I have a life contract that says I have to probably sixty eight books\nOn a short of that that's still pretty prolific though good for you good for you and they're ... they're all fascinating works [noise] these dreams\nAre so important I mean I I think people can you make themselves healthy in a dream that you can get a better job in a dream they can make other people think about them by concentrating on them and dreams it's amazing what you can do with dreams isn't it\nAbsolutely does lifting some really interesting areas for example in terms of a help\nI mean one of the things going on in dreams of that body chalk as well as so to get out of the woods and dreams we see what's going on inside the body you know fashion doctors\nUnderstand this and in traditional Chinese medicine for example that says front and center the idea is that a dream my gives an X ray even an MRI of what's going on inside the body might show symptoms that are developing might enable us to avoid those symptoms but that's one of the functions of framing and the and in terms of our emotional and spiritual health I'll\nDreams which shows the things that help us to get wild him to stay well ended with acting up on those dreams of trying to bring their energy through you mentioned connecting with other people will you know till after the which literally means fellow feeling at a distance or or being in touch with someone else\nIt's a common phenomenon and dreams in fact it's surprising that more people who are related to each other either by Lovell by family well by common colds or whatever\nI'm not aware more often that they might be dreaming with ... and all of each other I mean there's the phenomena shed dreaming or interactive treatment which we find ourselves sharing adventures with friends and other people I mean this was another fascinating phenomena and dream\nAs a matter of fact you discovered if you wake up your dreams remember more look at what's going on\nBut you have what used to be cold and it's being cold again super normal capacity abnormal supernatural but beyond the normal and we're talking about things like pre cognition\nAnd to let the ... and and so on and and and and you are able to see things before they happen to be able to see things in the distance but I go to connect with other people and these are natural powers and abilities that along to you and if you become a more active treatment you'll find the fewer\nGrowing in developing these gifts that very helpful in life\nIn terms of creative solution for things green tool to live with them if you can find a solution to problem the oatmeal I\nPut that question to your dreams and the what come and I would add to that that you can do this in everyday life as well because dreaming for me it's not just about what happens when you close your eyes it's what happens when you open your eyes wider so proud of this part of part of the fence of all this is\nBut the world around you once again we'll speak to like a dream if you pay attention so I encourage people many of my story is done on this\nTo notice what goes on in the amazing moments of meaningful coincidence when you've got a thought or preoccupation on your mind and suddenly the will deliver the incidents are striking\nThat gives you not only a reflection on what's on your mind but sometimes a way of dealing with what is on your mind if you have an issue in your life one of the games I encourage people to play is\nPut your question to the world go down the street or go into the pocket go your morning commute\nBut that question in your mind and received the first unusual unexpected thing to enter your field of deception as the message from the use of the surrounds you it is amazing how specifically but we'll we'll speak to you delivering a dream my message when you play that game\nIn Nineteen Seventy one Robert I did my first radio audition tape and ... and I had it on tape and I dropped it off at a few stations in Detroit hoping that somebody would listen to this young kid and hire them\nDish and tape it and I had it on tape and I dropped it off at a few stations in Detroit hoping that somebody would listen to this young kid and hire them to be some radio person on the street reporter\nAnd what I Would do when I dropped him off at a certain radio station I wanted to work at I concentrated on that person every night when I went to bed or he already had my tape I hadn't heard from him a mature enough after two days I'm going to sleep concentrating on the individual\nVisualizing what he looks like I had met him one time and uh sure enough two days later the guy calls me and says hey I liked his tapes and I've got something for you to come on down it work study\nYes while you're send to Europe be mad and your manifested George I'm not surprised one bit you know Mark Twain staged experiments of this guy and he called them mental to leg graffiti back in his day when people said telegrams he'd make a habit of writing a letter or an old fashioned telegram to someone he wanted to be in contact with\nAnd not mailing it he just right on tension on\nThat goes unnoticed walk followed then he said that actually almost didn't celebrate that was the response so you're practicing your game that is an age all day and it works I mean we know the thoughts are already thing they're already thoughts and feelings already action\nAnd if you're thinking about another person you're probably going to reach them unless they are shielded again being reached that mean you are reaching out um but nine way to do something good we wouldn't want to be able to be reached by just anybody with with any intention but that's a lovely creative and benign example\nOf sending a mental sending medical ... is what Mark Twain\nAnd I you know I subsequently used it a lot by doing the same techniques and it's almost as if they have this in blocks that you get on the same path with and you drop your little messages in there and then you for some reason they pick it up\nYeah we'll we'll\nDo a little experiments of my groups by which one of those degrees the bell sending him it just might be a painting it might be a sculptor it's a non announced image to the group of people have the gas in the morning after the night of sending you walk the walk the image that was being sent\nMy to beat and it's interesting how that works and some people a very good at picking up and some people a better send to for now the businesses just focused example of something that we do automatic they were connected with each other where to wear in into weaving field of interaction and it goes on in ... all the time\n[noise] Robert you've talked about synchronous explain how that ties into our dreams\nWell I think it's like this make a dreaming once we understand the treat me might be traveling we get out there we go beyond the cook loyal to the old really understanding a consensual hallucinations and we get into a deeper space we have encounters with people who live in a deeper space including the auditing our ancestors\nTruth synchronous today we often feel the false as an intelligence to live on the other side of those cook in the walls of Audrey understanding\nCome pushing al ... or ... to bring us a weight to give us a message of some kind of this is the thing about synchronous demeaning folk ... gave us who would sit in front of the cause is set up without trouble in Tokyo about co incidents they gave us a different would\nInstead of state we often feel they're the hidden hand we feel like getting a wait and cannot handshake or pushback\nFrom something beyond our kitten something we cannot see so although the phenomena of this code isn't a causal phenomenon them and said then so there's no obvious\nPatton of cause and effect we often feel there is cause they should play you might even feel that very large forces are in play poses a full of the cold the archetype so that people might have called the ... the guard until the ancestors are in play\nSo I Am a great proponent and then actually conditions and shaped every day of my life\nBut paying attention to the unusual unexpected things that are going on in the world around you and seeing what the ... looks like\nNot just one

radio this holiday season and one of the greatest ways to do it is to treat yourself to a new radio or somebody you care about from sea crane what I Need a radio with the best reception an audio that's who I turned to seek crane because they're always there for you they know radio they continue to make good products\nBecause the crane loves radio to the CBC Radio too we is the best team in FM radio and with the two week you can hear our show for example with amazing clarity the CBC Radio too we is designed to receive long range even FM reception and make those weak signals stronger\nThe high quality audio from the CBC Radio too we can be adjusted as well\nYou get great voice clarity even even for music it's really something so important to choose radio that has the ability to bring in those stations crystal clear and you get that put the CBC Radio to eat from sea crane ordered the CBC Radio to eat for yourself or a loved one\nI look up and I see this thing come over that looks like a cell phone upside down with one bag light in the middle for\nOn each corner and I realize that I'm In trouble all of a sudden and as soon as I turned to run away um I Know that I'm gonna get hit\nWith either a mess or something like ... or\nSomething like that and but I mean but I was a kid so none of this made any sense to me at all but now we have drones right so a ton of us drones are going to be telling a reality where they don't even after him placed soldiers or whatever\nI'm saying well let's get let's get Robert ... take on some of those rubber what do you think that many damn\nWell it's possible that you were dreaming of future developments in technology and in other ways that might manifest ... tons of this you haven't run into these situations in ordinary on the tea yet and hopefully you weren't\nBumped to it's perfectly possible that you had long range pre cognition in dreams of situation might develop in life it's also possible\nBut the dreams have a symbolic made not simply a literal meaning but the symbolic me if I'm dreaming of of of the situation that seems very serious and talk and threatening going across the ... and seeing this may be this EMT\nOkay maybe that symbolic of something that lies ahead to me in life which is going to have the emotional falls\nTo the emotional pools or something like that maybe my dreams are actually coaching me the pairing me for an emotional situation which are not all that full situation which I Need to be ready I don't know but that comes to my mind\nThe upside down cell phone you know I just want to holding that image I realized that might be something larger more scary than a cell phone but I thought I wanted to reach into that dream and grabbed a cell phone let it be a cell phone and speak on it and see who's on the other end\nThat image I realized that might be something larger more scary than a cell phone but I Want to reach into that dream and grab that sell to let it be a cell phone and speak on it and see who's on the other end I mean this is the way that I Am about three times will probably way\nRather liked the idea of the upside down cell phone yeah it's scary but if it's my dream my actually however many years that he has since the dream I didn't want to reach into the dream ... cell phone or hold it to my ear and say who is there talk to me while you and see what I get it might be that it's the kind of phony what you can talk to someone on the other side of death\nYou know dreams where often people are often talking to the dead\nOn phones are receiving phone calls from them and sort of want to go in that direction with that tree\nOr wiring dream sometimes convoluted in mired in a confusion in a terrible and things like that why isn't it just so obvious\nWell I think that actually took the dream ... the dream sources of many sources of premiums and try to communicate as clearly as possible but but not necessarily is not enough to follow all of this\nUh and also we need to remember the dreams are experiences that whatever report we we quote to each other from a dream is only a report it's not the full experience so it might seem convoluted all confusing well not ... but that might be because we've only brought back a few things from the dream and don't know how to put them together which is why\nI signed the best way to understand the dream is to try to get your head back inside to try to get back inside the dream take a look at what is really going on when you do that you pretty quickly determine whether it's literally symbolic you can fill in some of the get when you learn the technique of cream reentry of going back inside a dream\nI I and once we understand that I think one of the songs you were playing the something about living a whole life\nAnd play implicitly in your dreams I mean once they understand that we're having tremendous experiences\nAnd couldn't live days or weeks in a in a dream and a few minutes to talk time they can get into grounds that whatever we bring back to the dreams only partial and may be confused we might need to go beyond doubt says memories of the tree and bring back more in order to understand what's going on\nOne is more prevalent to loosen dream free cognitive dreams just normal regular dreams what pops up the most\nWell a lot of people are dying seem yet to understand how to come loose and dream is the idea of lists of dream has become very popular since ... movie inception and and the ideas talented you couldn't make love to anyone in your dreams and you can be Superman that set for said there's been a sort of adolescent quality to some of the\nThe the sad loose and dreaming but listen dreaming is actually easier than most people make it to themselves when they try and memorize ways of wake you up to ... inside of dream look at your hand and see if you can stick a thing go through your town that kind of stuff as I said earlier the easiest way to the ... dream is to start up loose that stay that way\nSo I didn't know how common listed dreaming is amongst the population of the moment\nAt the moment I Do know that probably everybody is having ... previous but I knew a few people are aware of that yet only a few people look it up to it I think it's it's routine I think that we do in the night whether we know it or not scout ahead of us felt some aspect of consciousness\nChecks up what lies ahead I think that's going on all the time but I think many people have yet to wake up to the fact that they can do it and can use it\nSo regular dreams what regular dreams of people I mean the Greenspan a whole spectrum there are big dreams are little dreams a little dreams to the rather routine processing of what went on the day before coming tree on how you said yourself and how fast you ate the night before and then there are the big dreams which of the dreams of which you feel that you have received a message\nFrom those you might feel yourself in the presence of the highest dose of wisdom oh you've gone travelling you know you've gone too distant galaxy or different time period or a place where the dead or alive so\nThe point is that all of these avenues of knowledge an adventure open to everyone all the time the only thing that prevents you from getting in on this\nIs is perhaps your reluctance until now to make time in your life to amend the more of what's going on in the night to write that down keep a journal that's basic practice keep a journal writes a done deal with the times on notice you'll feelings around the experience to run a reality check ask\nWhether this could happen in the future once you're willing to do some simple things like that you're on the way to becoming a more active ... you had to find it's getting to power and ... sorts of ways\nTo go to Thomas in law who California Hi Thomas\nHigh George thank you for taking my call Robert ... work that you are doing [laughter] you know I Want it and how many Robert um [noise] you know you talk about you know we get tired at night we close our eyes when we go to sleep\nWhen we have dreams and in the ... not totally travel man maybe even\nMentally time travel\nBut then\nTonight us over we open our eyes when is it possible you imply that is\nThat we are stepping from one dream state to another that we are stepping in from night to white king during during the day a dream and watch\nReality as maybe plastic malleable um ... where we can not chess mentally travel mentally time travel but actually like the shopping men and women around the world\nThat cycling travel and physically time travel because they are aware that reality is a white can dream as opposed to a night during I was wondering if you have a comment on that you seem to that\n... I Love your raping statement Thomas yes I think we do step when we come out of the cream of the night into the dream of the day I think we need to step from one stage and condition of creamy into another one I think the\nWaking life is also a dream in the reality might be more plastic and malleable and we make allowance for we talked earlier about how your your your intentions the energies you carry the attitudes you carry good a shape you'll reality\nThe physical possibility of time travel all shapes shifting et cetera is of course is is his feet on the debates among scholars and scientists and their traditions of it in different so many lineages\nAs you imply whether time travel is a physical possibility either for certain kinds of primal Sherman or with the technology of the future I don't know but I Do know I mean I don't know from my experience I don't think I physically stepped from um time into another though I felt very very much on the edge of it sometimes\nI don't know where the shape shifting and the way the charm and connect with the animal spirits central is physically possible for those people today but I Do believe that probably was physically possible and the earliest stage of human evolution and the human animal divide was not as absolute as is today\nBut anyway leaving aside those are areas which found them to think about and the stuff of good stories\nI'm absolutely certain that you are right when you say that to come back from a dream of the night in the day is to move from one stage of dreaming to another actually I often feel Thomas live I step from ... from one room into another from one landscape all from one willed into another\nActually I often feel Thomas divide step from what I took it from one room into another from one landscape from one willed into another I have a sort of just so feeling okay I was there doing that that reality now I'm back in the body and the bed\nI get it out of bed I go out in the street and I
