BP's electro traumatic boys phenomena where the whole chapter in the book about\nParents that perfect because it seems to me that since we've gone to the digital age from the analog age they're getting more and more these recordings\n[laughter] yes indeed and I think that what you have is you have the ability now to\nUse digital radio is to scan the frequencies more quickly\nA fellow by the name of Frank some action in the nineties figured out that if you have a digital FM radio you can literally break it in such a way so that is that scans the frequency is it doesn't stop at a station\nWhen the signal comes and clear it just continually sweeps and again that\nThat's that continuous sweeping has ... ... if you do that voices and other sounds sort of a rise out of that noise and again people will write these words down that they will capture and these very quick\nSparse moment says it scans the frequencies and see if they can have some\nOr attempt to have some kind of communication with with a magic has the spirit world\nHe came up with what is called springs box which is ... ... exactly that isn't it\nThat's right Frank's box and you can see some of the photographs online if he's a really wonderful very creative um devices that he made and he they became more and more complex eventually he started to think that maybe in fact it wasn't spirits at all but that was he was communicating with extraterrestrials\nPeter as you were putting together strange frequencies did you come across anything strangers sells\nWell I did some experiments and there were a few times where there were a few things that I thought were particularly\nOdd but I think was important was that I was able to sort of get into that had space where I felt that I was\nDoing something that had been being done for centuries I mean I'm I'm would like to make the argument that even somebody like John de who was using his scene stones to try to communicate with the angels and\nAnd as a result created what magicians called the ... language that that use of a scene stone is the same as using our radio to communicate with the spirit world that that this is something that human beings have been attempting to do with some media mystic device some material device\nWhere we take some pain and we read purpose it we use it in a way that it wasn't originally intended and in fact the magician or the medium becomes a kind of spiritual hacker\nWhere we're really trying to interact with our technologies and our material world in a way that some would say really is that what we're supposed to be doing with it and yet as we know what's really the hackers that have more early on the most inventive and if it wasn't for the hackers we probably wouldn't have desktop computers today in our\nHome [laughter] that's true Peter ... with us his latest book is called strange frequencies you start the book with Jewish mythology and legend surrounding the goal and tell us about that\n[noise] yeah I mean I like to think that the goal of them is really the first piece of technology right where we try to build something and and view it with a spiritual\nPower and use it to some and what's interesting about the Golan legend is the legend of the goal them as it's called particularly the coal to Prague is a story of a rabbi who builds a goal and to help the Jewish people who feel\nUm who are being attacked or there's a poll rum and they're trying to defend themselves\nAnd eventually the goal of becomes\nIt goes you know it it it it it there's chaos ensues the rabbi can no longer control it and either has to destroy it already has to put it to sleep [laughter]\nGetting one of the stories that goal and grows so large that the rabbi has to climb up on a ladder and a race the secret word from its forehead and it crumbled and ... sometimes crushing the rabbi and some of the stories\nBut if you look at the actual Jewish ... missed this as a mystical\nWritings about the call them the goal of them is in some ways\nAnd means by which the the rabbi demonstrates their spiritual\nAccurate man it's it's almost like a task to show that they are prepared for greater mystical magical knowledge\nBut the column itself has was understood by the rabbis to be just kind of a dumb machine there's a wonderful ... story where a rabbi ... go to the head rabbi and\nThey show him that goal among the he says to them well what can I Do kind of speak and they say well no it can't speak and he says well then what good is it it's just a it's just the toy\nWhich is what really makes the human being different from all the other creatures right so we can't do that we're not playing God we might think we are but if we can't do that then we're just pretend there's to the throne as it were\nHere what about the Sherman says well you know Native American tradition and other types of was a cultures the showman also seemed to be the person connected to the other side\n[laughter] that's right and the Sherman would also use utilize\nSound and light off and and other kinds of mechanisms to try to win ... states have consciousness in their\nPeople and I think that what the ... does and what the stage magician does in many ways this is very connected and it also can access and connects the technology to the history of spiritualism and the staging of spiritualism which spirit cabinet tend to different ways in which\nPeople were using technologies sometimes it was just a little lever inside the cabinet but they were using technologies to be able to create the state\nOf consciousness in the audience and so I don't think that it's necessarily well we we don't go to see a magic trick and get mad that were being tricked right we want to be we want to be in chanted we want to exist in that state of mind\nAnd so all the ways in which people have used technology whether it's very primitive are very advanced I think\nIn that state of mind and so all the ways in which people have used technology whether it's very primitive are very advance I think it's something that we have long\nBeen excited about it I mean even watching a film about spirits in the movie theater is almost like a ... sure experiencing it\nThomas Edison the great adventure was obsessed with trying to communicate with the other side he tried to build his own machine I don't think he was ever able to do it was it you\nKnow and and in fact you know he really wanted it to be true and it's even goes back to the ways in which we have\nVery interesting thing here where we have people who are considered scientists to rationalize and it's not that they were the funky ... because they want it to just be cynical skeptical because they really want that there to be the truth is this true Houdini\nHoudini really want it to him he really wanted to find that medium could communicate with the other side so that he might speak with his eerily departed mother but he couldn't find one all he found was Charlotte but his but she believed that it would be possible\nAnd I think that that's an important thing that sometimes we we lose a sense that mystery in our lives where\nLet's just for a moment pretend even if it's just a pretend moment imagine that things could be possible but I think that that's a valuable place sometimes just sit still for a while with ourselves\nAnd ... those are new Houdini by the way you write was obsessed with trying to find out about the other side we're talking about him in a couple of hours after we're done talking on the right yes that's right ... ... going to be exciting he's he was one heck of a guy but to you as you say he wasn't able to find the medium to do the job\nThat's right if he had today's equipment do you think he might be able to do something\nMaybe but I think that he would also find which unfortunately I sometimes founded that people were using these things but if you have\nTo move the curtain aside you saw the wizard of Oz there with all his contraption think is most quickly try to hide the fact that maybe he really was it is magical as you thought\nWere going to be back in a moment to talk more with Peter a beeper golf his book strange frequencies we've got a link to his publisher Random House to make it easy for you to get the book if you're into this is a magnificent story the subtitle is the extraordinary story of the technological quest\nFor the super natural so stick with us we're going to take calls with Peter next hour we'll leave and take your stories you're paranormal stories and just your general questions more to talk with him about though about strange frequencies high technology and its ability to maybe\nPeter of all these incredible inventors and engineers in secret shore temping attempting to get some kind of evidence about the existence of the other side what are you seeing drove them why would they so obsessed with trying to get these answers\nI think what Dr fat quest is what drives a very Schumann quest to control of our own\nBeret charcoal material destiny I mean I think it's actually a very American Spirit right I mean that some scholars a sociologist one particular max vapor used to talk about\nYou know Protestantism in the spirit of capitalism that how about the Protestant American Spirit is something whereby we want to\nProve bar right next we want to prove that we are loved by God by by being successful in the world by being innovators inventors entrepreneur is right and I think that that it tends even to our sense of our own spirituality\nAnd that this idea that we are in charge of our own salvation where we want to be right in\nFront of our experience with the divine is is again something it's a very human I think particularly American and and so you have these people who are just doing what we've always wanted to do which is to say\nYou know what I'm gonna do it I'm going to figure out how to interact with with spirit or with God or divine or whatever\nAnd and how do we do that well we often do that by inventing something by making something by taking something pre existing eye opening\nAnd and how do we do that well we often do that by inventing something by making something by taking something that pre existed and opening up and re purpose in it\nAnd so I think that that drive is is a is a very human drive it's why people have practiced magic for millennium right\nJust another example of magic of\nA of a cult practice where we are trying to insert ourselves between right right in the middle to get right in there and to say I want to have this experience directly I don't want it to be mediated but if it is going to be mediated I'm going to be the one who\nWho uses that tool like we put you Peter in that category [laughter] myself [noise] yeah\nWell I definitely am somebody who who believes in a spiritual reality and who wants to interact with that\nUm I tend to ah believe though that we have to be careful about how much we try to rest that you know from that we have to post put it this way we have to meet God halfway right we can't make it all the way [laughter]\nYou know and if we get so far and we don't get an answer then maybe there wasn't an answer at that moment for us to get\nWhy does it seem that some people get the answer or at least they think they do and then others can't even get close\n[laughter] yeah I mean that's the greatest that's the greatest mystery though isn't it I mean there is\nYou you know why some people seem to be more sensitive to this or why some people are\nBut this goes you know back to the whole idea that we once used to think that a bit a profit was somebody who had special information for us and now we often believe that those people might actually be crazy right so\nYou know ... it up for a long time we've been wrestling with a visionary experience and\nUm and that's why you know even people who produce our we called visionary art or spiritual aren't are often considered outsider artist ... why is that why are the people who are working with these themes considered to be outside artist as opposed to just people who are part of a regular\nAre mainstream artistic community and I think it's\nWe live in a world where we still feel that these questions have to be a little bit on the outside of our normal experience and what's interesting about technology is that it and this is really key here to\nSee if I can explain this somebody takes her radio and they say I'm gonna I'm gonna open up this radio and I want to re solder a few connections to see if I can communicate with the spirit world\nBut the science that made that radio possible and the science that makes it possible to the Saudi Arabia and have another effect take place\nThe science behind that that even made this radio or something that you could find a store which said that communication with the spirit world is not possible spirits don't against\nAnd yet we can take the thing this technology and somehow divorced it from the science that is underneath the scientific method in scientific understanding of the world it's\nWhat's underneath fit and divorced and turn it into a tool that we can use to try to have these experiences and so I think there's a fascinating disconnect there about how we can think about technologies in ways that that a science connected to that might actually be in opposition to\nWell if you didn't own a radio or have a computer where you could listen on line and somebody came up to you and said Peter I hear voices of this guy at night\nTalking about ghosts and spirit ... strange things he's alter he's out there and you of course who never had a radio you never went on line like that to listen you're probably saying what's this guy talking about he's insane or but my voices out there and it's being heard by millions\nOr if they have the receiver to pick it up in in I think all we need in order to pick up the spirit world which is all energy to do the right time to receiver\n[noise] well it's fascinating that you say that because when spiritual is a was becoming very popular I'm In the Eighteen hundreds in the mid to late Eighteen hundreds it was also when we had started developed ... telegraph technology\nAnd people called medium spiritual mediums spiritual\nTelegraph [laughter] they really believe\nThat there was this link between this this new version and technology and how you're right it was a special a new kind of receiver and transmit her and that the human being could also be this thing and so we use that same language to talk about them\nYou see that being from the television Iraq his really augmented in shape things were spirituality in technology and tell me why\n[laughter] well I mean the TV itself is kind of a ... very strange and scary yeah\nIf the some of the the there is a very wonderful advertisement from a television set in Nineteen thirty four called the clue television company and they actually they this is how they advertise their television this is what they said the dreams of witches have come true oh my God\nSo they they saw this thing this new device that the way to capture the public's imagination about buying this thing was not to try to make it less weird [noise]\nBut to increase its sense of being connected to some supernatural dream that we once had that we could communicate in this way over the ether right [noise]\nUm and so the the the fact that you know we ... that we used to call those the after effects on a TV you know in the when we were used to watch ... VHS stations with an antenna\nWe used to all those dose right so even the way in which we think about the television metaphorically is his failed to the brim right with these supernatural and I called metaphors and I think that that's really important I think it even when we talk about technology for not believers and even if we're just\nUsing it we still use these this language to try to make sense of it\nAnd I remember those two ... says anything to do with our discussion tonight but a ... radios televisions were built into very heavy furniture remember those\nOh my gosh yeah absolutely yep\nMy dad had an old silk all radio and this thing must have been about four feet tall and you know where it was and it was a case in this beautiful piece of wood furniture\nAnd silica will written across it uh it it was it was a piece of art in the same way or the TVs in the in the stereos others started coming out with\nChinese are meant to be central pieces of our home right and so you can imagine this thing the centerpiece of our home and then a movie like\nThey started coming out with\nThe Chinese are meant to be central pieces of our home right and so you can imagine this thing the centerpiece of our home and then a movie like pulp guys comes out it only makes sense that this is how the spirits would come into our lives is through the TV\nFor you a hundred percent convinced Peter that the other side exists\nI'm not a hundred per cent convinced about anything so I\nYou know I live in a very limited all place what I what I like more than anything and what I like about is about technology is that I really believe that these ambiguous states are and chanting states that when somebody tries to convince me something as a hundred percent true I tend to be a lot more skeptical\nThan somebody who just wants to share an interesting experience with me\nGet into your time machine and told me what you think things will be like fifty years from now with regards to

I I Know several friends very spiritual religious friends\nWho knows or guardian angels name a gentleman and like one one friend he was charismatic prayer conference one time\nAnd like some lady didn't even know\nKept them on the shoulder and said you know you're a guardian angels name as an end and she said you know she said that it was a fear of your guardian angels name as severe and meditate it or that he said you know she's she's right\nHe never he never saw this lady again\nThat's Ron I'm going to ask you a question but I got to know how old are you because the question doesn't mean anything if but if you're not old enough\nBottled on your I'm sixty two okay do you remember the Catholic bishops sultan gene\nOh absolutely a white a life worth living he's he has to have is

be raised or they'd write something down and it was a highly rated show with one or two cameras that was\nNot it not Milton Barrow awful number one status a trend that\nHe's been ongoing milk was was

I was born so I only see you know is it shows are on replay Melanie WPN so I mean I kind of makes sense that would be on Sunday but you know I I don't know but yeah people together and he had these penetrating\nEyes that yes we're conduit to he could he was like Patrick Tio [laughter]\nOur guys to look for in a TV screen to look at near Seoul [laughter] talk to you\nAnd and you really believe the angels were there and run things for that seat or you're probably too young to remember that\nNow but I Love that it all happen um that these miracles happened over the television\nYeah that's true [laughter] that's absolutely true technology at its best\nTrained somebody's going to come up with something somewhere I think don't you\nI mean some you know we can only become more advanced and it's going to be interesting to see if one day these different parts of our lives can really merge in some way and maybe it's technology that's going to make that possible\nLet's go to Carolyn are hemmed in Connecticut now Hi Carol thanks for calling\nOr maybe you haven't had anyone tell you about a strange and sent them than when they CD player\nIn Connecticut now Hi Carol thanks for calling\nOr maybe you haven't had anyone tell you about a strange and sent them than when I the D player or I go ahead what happened was I was driving a one block past where my son used to work\nAnd anti in between the songs on the CD it's about five seven second\nAnd uh all of a sudden I hear a young boy hey don't drive that way no one no one had any access to my CDs my anything and I'm looking around on a thing where it's coming from is coming from the thing it never happens again I played it over and over again never done any other city\nDon't drive that\nAll of the advice of the\nSlaves or I bet it said you didn't have Carol\n[noise] well I don't know if that if you just don't don't cut through past where I'm I'm always aware I worked\nFor you to train me a car with Mike\nThat or yeah or or maybe there is an accent by just do the exact same way in continuing\nBut you were what were you aware of it were you thinking a little bit more\nThinking about it [laughter] you know\nIn between absolutely quiet you know you know a pretty new CD and I played it over and over again and I just thought you you'd want to know about a CD incident where you say there's radio you know and let them or whatever we think this is you see\nAll right it's pretty pretty soon it'll be popping up on podcasts Peter\n[laughter] that's right exactly what those\nTo the whole range of electronic Bush phenomenon I mean the earliest researchers weren't using radios they were using white noise\nThey were using just a quiet room with a microphone it was it was so much about that that the vice itself it was the fact that it was electronic media was making this possible some record about media whether it was a tape\n'em or I next case a CD\nWell in one one of the things I think that is very intriguing about all of this is that some people do not react to that little angels sitting on their shoulder whispering in their ear telling them don't do this or no here go straight to stop\nYou have to be able to\nDetermine when to do these things right because if you don't you could miss a great opportunity or you could get killed or something like that and put out\nSlowly and do you know maybe in some ways and and I don't mean to diminish anybody's experience but maybe you know maybe sometimes we project\nBeef things from within ourselves on to the media you know maybe it stopped the spirit world communicating to us with the with the um radio or what the tape player maybe it's our own unconscious our own spirits that are trying to communicate something to watch that we need to hear\nWhen you started writing the book strange frequencies was easy or difficult for you to get it started [laughter]\nWell at part of the problem for me was is that each one of the subjects that I took up here's been you know decades of research and books about them so\nWhat I Would have to try to figure out a way to do is take all of this material and and turn it into what I think I Hope is interesting stories about these these specific thing I mean the history of there's some wonderful books about the history of spare photography\nBut I Want it to specifically orient my story around Shannon's work and doing show take up you know some of the important background information but yes it ... it was difficult and I have to say and and you know I'm sure that you understand is that\nNo matter how you want to approach the subjects where the one approach to the skeptic or as a full on believer or the way that I like to approach them more as a journalist and a historian\nThat people are worried when you bring up or it's like supernatural are caught they don't know if you're going to try to exploit them or make fun of them or if you're coming at it\nFrom all of a way that they feel is is not rational enough you know and so just the idea of the I Want it to work with a subjects that all poses problems sometimes what I'm asking to interview somebody and they're a little bit mistrust\nMight tensions might be\nWell in a lot of people Peter when they hear the word a cult thing because it's the sickness or double ... yeah and it really is we're going to come back with final

[noise]\nSo\nAble to\nOn the chances [noise]\nBut I don't know do they know budget thing [noise]\n\n\n\nLive from the gateway to the west coast to coast am with George Nouri\nWelcome back to coast to coast as we continue with the supernatural in a moment\nDo we do the west coast to coast to coast am with George Nouri\nTalk back to the coast to coast as we continue with the supernatural in a moment are very special guest professor slim king joins us\nTo talk about Harry Houdini for a moment Harry Houdini was a Hungarian born American illusion is stumped performer noted for his sensational escape ... first attracted notice of vaudeville and the U.S\nAnd that is Harry handcuffed Houdini on a tour of Europe where he challenged police forces to keep him locked up Sunni extended his repertoire to include chains ropes slung from skyscrapers straight jackets underwater and having to escape Roman hold his breath and sort of sealed\nMilk can with the water in it Ninety dull for thousands watched as he tried to escape from special ... cups commissioned by London daily mirror keeping him and suspense for an hour and another stumps I'm buried alive only just able to ... himself to the surface are merging and the state of near breakdown\nSo I'm John Cox from while about Harry uh there's a website and she has some great information a bunch of doctors came in and um they decided that Houdini or you know die from this point a lot of\nDoctors nowadays say he just died of ... night is from a ...\nSo it's the battles rage on and on and what really killed him and it goes back and forth but I think he was had the onset of a a pen to fight us and when he was hit it actually broke\nBusted a trail the bacteria comes out and just ran through his body\nRight and they had no anti bacterial anything back then in twenty six so he uh had stuck in seven days\nTo die because he had won the substances that what happened yes yeah I was up\n... salt through they had two operations\nAnd then they gave him some mysterious serum that they'd been working on but nothing seemed to work\nDuring those seven days he had time to go over this afterlife experiment that he and Beth ... worked out and they'd had it since the early Nineteen hundreds or since before Nineteen Thirteen [noise]\nThey had this it's a two way code that they'd worked out if one of them died that they would\nUse this code contact\nEach other and so he had a week it took him a week to pass away he was so strong and so they had a week together to fine tune this code and then about two years later she gets uh the actual code from Arthur ...\nHot as our to forget what the easy enough of a medium trance what happens\nIf aren't the report was a ... medium he wasn't like I'm a Marjory I'm you know the er which\nFrom rice and she's like was he was he liked Whoopi Goldberg in a post\nHe just goes into he puts on a blindfold and goes to sleep okay like like Casey all righty goes into the trench state\nRight he just goes into a trans state they have to write down everything that happens and then he read later he doesn't really always remember what goes on attendance subconscious but he consciously doesn't really remember\nAll the time what happened so they transcribe these fans so he started having these senses and in one of 'em he contacted Houdini smother about a year before this\nAnd then he starts having these than says and he starts getting the code now the Houdini messages actually in three part it's one word than a nine words that spell another word and then she it's a two way code\nUm bass has five words in French that she says back to him\nAbout does that make sense to you everybody I talked to a Ninety nine percent of them only think of a one way coke yeah you're on the other side have\nOne word or something you're going to get an across and then they're going to know that you're there but again it was sharper than that who any said listen I'm over on the other side I Want to make sure she gets the code that she's the one who gets\nI Want to make its shirts her so she has five words in French that she gets\nWant to get it right I Want to make its shirts her so she has five or ten French that she gets back that come back to him [laughter] so this was an ingenious code really because it's taking the pan [noise] it's like Fifteen words wrong\nWhy why was Harry professor obsessed with either trying to come back spiritually forty even let everybody know what was going on\nAs well as you know Harry you had to be first\nFirst hand to escape\nRight here with us desk apologist he had to be first I don't know if you know the Harry was the first guy to fly an airplane and Australia\nYesterday was that is true I heard\nHe had to be first in a matter of fact he did a great movie called the grim game about that [noise] so uh and he did several movies he he was a really multi talented guy [noise] um I think he would have been I think he would have had a movie um\nCareer mogul yeah it had he survived he invented what they call now the dailies uh in in the movie industry he invented that it was rush cuts right\nYes so he was a you know awesome and all these different ways so he was going to be number one and if he had to come back from the grape to do it he was\nGonna do he was going to do it then you think it was successful\nI I Know what successful I Know that the code and the message that he gave was exactly the same message that they that they had agreed upon\nYou didn't know that for a fact didn't\nComfort professor Bess his wife\n[noise] bass was in tough shape she best was pretty depressed but you know her husband had died\nAnd bass was um she had developed some well I Would consider bad habits she spent money like crazy and she uh\nWhile he was alive and after he died\nWhile he was alive and after he died and so if you remember Nineteen twenty nine when message came back ah all hell broke loose the none of her magic friends really wanted to believe that in any way\nAnd then later in the year the stock market crashes and she loses not only all her friends she loses all\nHer money she was arrested in the stock market yes\nShe loses the majority of her friends the majority of her money and now she's got this bad habit of spending\nMoney like a grows on trees cheat just\nSiri left her a nice little sum\n[noise] yeah he liked her a part of the uh they pay double a\nDamn needy or whatever for his ah insurance\nInsurance the insurance was twenty five thousand dollars\nWhich in Nineteen thirty six it's probably a lot of money though\nRight product that's close to a million dollars [laughter] um so they got about that because they said it was an accident because this guy punched him and\nSo it was the insurance company that came up and said ah that can't happen you can get appendicitis from being punched and so they were proven wrong in court and so she got fifty thousand so she was little and then do\nNow and then she they put it all in the market and she lost at all\nNow you have heard of the crash that killed Houdini yes what is the curse\n[noise] know Houdini had a three part show first part of the show was magic ...\nThe second part was the ... scapegoat he would do an escape\nThat was where the water the Chinese water torture cell or the uh the milk can skate and then the last part towards the end of his career he would go after the spiritual life and he would have this um confrontation with\nThem lunch and self like confrontation right [noise] well at some point in time he would say I've had enough and he would get up\nDuring a third party he would go out to a palm reader or somebody or a [noise] a that he considered fake and you would go in there and all the reporters and everybody to be following him and he'd go in they need to find a couch or something and they pull out like an incandescent down that goes in the dark\nOr some of the I found it I got you [noise] you know and\nAnd they're probably a string or something like that\nRight so uh and of course the the medium to just what a what do you do it and that I didn't have nothing to do with that [noise] well they honestly didn't because I I'm a magician and a magician always have what you're calling out the way out\nYou work it into your magic trick if you have a magic trick you might have two or three different methods on how it works and then something else he switched to the next one and you switch to the next\nOne and and at work so you're assured of success\nAnd so in his magic that's built in in his escape so of course I'm I guarantee you got two or three keys in there [laughter] you know and if all that failed and he couldn't get the T would come out and kissing women sheet up the appropriate

apply if you're considering going back to school I guess I'll just following questions Tierney the flexibility to take classes and your schedule you have college credits to transfer\nAnd there we are talking about it uh the Ninety years later and I'm calling\nFrom Detroit when I started listening I Lived in Tennessee at the time but just the fact the correlation of Houdini Detroit and I just wanted to say that I Believe\nThat's a that's a that's a great story rich thanks for that Houdini was in the Detroit River when he was in town before he died was he not professor\n[noise] yeah I think I think that was one of his one of his us capes\nYeah it really was they dumped him in the Detroit River I think he was in a straight jacket upside down\nYeah that you love doing that and sometimes he was in a box Houdini would he would uh modify his escapes to whatever uh you know kind of businesses that wanted to support them\nSo ah you know if the police supported him he'd unscathed from one of their jail cells\nThere was one tiny escape from any like big fish they built a big fish 'cause there was a fish company that was sponsoring him in their town [laughter] so he would he would kind of ingenuity fleas he would make up some way to escape from something that tight in today's advertisers\nTony Curtis died in a twenty two and he was eighty five years old but I thought he did a great job in the ... movie you remember it\nYes yeah I think all of the movies have been actually pretty good yeah ah I don't they don't stick with the actual\nHow the how did he make that elephant disappear in the ... in London how did he do that\nKind of you want me to tell yeah\nYeah you know the I mean what did he how did they have the thing covered or or what first of all\nI can tell I'm not going to tell him come on now\nOr or what first of all\nI can tell I'm not going to tell you come on smile I might tell you on private there's a book you can buy a ... by a guy who who ...\nLet me ask you this if I'm right would you tell me\nThat if I if you write all I'll tell you do have to tell you on the air\nYou know I'm just going to ask you if you question okay that's did he have any apparatus that raises the elephant from underground you\nKnow you did not okay I'm going to assume that the elephant was always there [noise] [noise] okay\nWe'll do a little more homework is yeah there you go now who comes up\nWith the tricks I mean was it Houdini does that make him a genius for being able to come up with this or did he have somebody on staff like you who would say here's this trek\nAnd let's do this and we can make this and that how did they do this he said it was called puck Copperfield to I assume ... people on staff like you right\nExactly exactly I'm James Collins when the guy that Houdini the bill to all of them for like Houdini would say I want to do this and then he would put it in the ball in their court and then they would have to come up with how you would\nDo so I assume in the human genome they walked in Allison out everybody sees this thing lumbering noon and then uh the shrouded in or close to or something and then the trick began I it's absolutely amazing wasn't the queen there at the time\n[noise] uh well he probably the same queen that's there and [laughter] you know Europe but I don't think she was that there okay I'd I don't know for sure next on it I don't think she was there I think he performed for them in Europe ...\nLet's go to the first time caller Ralph in Indianapolis Hi Ralph go ahead\nYes I'm here already taken away readings\nA New Yorker for oil and as the last five years of his life got a letter from him just before he died out seeing bishop pike on a ledge when he was trying to go over to comb Ron in Israel and that's where they found them\nQuestion for you or what we what irritated archer forward bring back the code\nTo Mrs Houdini this was in Nineteen twenty nine okay I was a three part code or the ... was the middle section first word was Rosenthal arose and then he had a code for the nine or words that spelled out believe\nAnd then she had dry words in French which means I pulled the curtain back like this and that's what she told him so he was assured that his code I'd gotten through\nAbout did he she later denied that later on after she loses her friends she loses all her money a man called Edward Said comes into her life and says he's er manager but they live together\nHe fell in love again yeah yeah so he didn't like that and that's why you wanted to come back\nRight she means women the same kind of way that I mean there's a lot of things going on here but he's like Twenty years younger than her ... her that\nShe can make a movie and she'll make a million dollars okay go ahead\nOh what year than they cheat\nDeny that the the code was correct well the first time she'd never denies the code was correct\nUh she says that she was told that she never denies that the code was correct but she first about a year and a half after um she they're given the Houdini messages\nShe having lunch with some ladies in Miami and she she said she was hesitant about a\nHoudini coming back because why didn't he favor from the depression so she was she thought that Houdini would come out of favor from this math\nDepression that what's happening or that somehow he was going to come back and not breakfast with there every morning or something I don't know what she was thinking [laughter] but she wasn't happy about the fact that\nUh our before was on tour somewhere so she had no way to contact him and so she was you know showing this pleasure for that and then at work thing comes in later promises or a million dollars and then they go on\nAnd about eight years later they make a movie called a religious racket years\nYeah he made a a couple of movies that leads to me\nWell Houdini made four or five movies\nYeah but they also how they do they do well\n[noise] a big it fine but he was he was the star of of every movie\nWas he like an actor or were they more like documentaries\nThey he was an actor and he always had like a really really good looking coast are\nHis real name Eric Weiss yes he was he was a pretty good looking guy too\nI kind of a sudden muffin guy he was only\nAnd everything kind of a smooth smooth talker could really give a a ... compliments really well but he wasn't the greatest actor but he used it to promote his escape so we had a bunch of escapes in ... all the movies\nReal name Eric white some\nHank yes an ax Eric turned into Harry and then who game he got from who Don any at it and I called and Houdini and er so to this day they called him Harry Houdini but I don't think he ever a switch his name and he was born in Europe\nAnd he wasn't born here and he was he was born in Hungary yeah he was born in Hungary Budapest and he wasn't even actually a U.S citizen if you think\nWasn't there a magician named Blackstone did he come after hearing\nA

who\nAre David Blaine he's is humid you shouldn't do\n[noise] well he's a very good magician he is a missed the fire a Houdini began calling himself a missed the fire [laughter] he kind of drop the magician thing\nOkay and so people are starting to go that way it's part of the mystery are [laughter] you know\nWhen people go see a magician do they want the trick to fail or succeed\nWhat do you think well I think they all want it to\nSucceed I think you'd be a strange individual if you'd like to see the guy fall on his face\nSome people who want to see that\nYeah maybe maybe uh I don't uh\nI
