it will side that was twenty five years ago\nAnd and think about we're America was twenty five years ago from an energy standpoint I mean completely a hundred and eighty degree or we were dependent on a lot of countries that didn't necessarily have our interest in mind who are still a developing a the energy sources that we were\nBuying and now I'm you know Mexico and and and and Canada both very different positions then we were twenty five years ago so it makes a button that good sense that the president was that you know what\nIt's time to renegotiate this thing and we got an email now the
