struck outside of their marry him and we have been joined us from the thirty yard line by the head coach of the Jack rabbits jobs tickle Meyer a\nCoach as I talk to those two guys as well particularly I took it seems like every year you have a game or two that may not go to the script the ... and you just have to find a way to win and that's what separates the good teams from the great teams today you found a way to win win things didn't go with maybe they were playing\n[noise] yeah yeah I agree and then the case in point\nWe play such an average defense the whole game and then we get down and its first and goal from what the for something that we rise up and stop 'em and three plays and allows us to win the game and they and so I'm proud of our team proud of the when we got some work to do but these guys will do it\nTo that point in the street at two steps from inside the one yard line get nothing on the first place then lose the yard and the second plane ... penetration by Dalton Cox which forced them to appeal golden obviously led to you winning this ... yeah\nYeah big play and uh you know we talk all the time you don't know what to watch planes going to be the one that affects the game you just have to play your heart out every play and that was a great example and uh you know I get I get the Indiana State a ton of credit you know they they uh executed\nOr they put the ball and the money they caught a couple of bad defenses on some runs a good football team and I I Believe that when a bunch more down the road\nWe talked about that too if they play like they did tonight the rest of the year they're going to be a factor in this race they're gonna knock some teams opposite nothing else right\nRight and and uh [noise] you know they keep their heads up we gotta get healthy we got a bunch of guys heard again tonight for us to be able to put our best football but I Will do whatever we can\nTo that point you lose ... center you lose Tyler were right tackle jak bill ... employed a whole lot he's in at the center Aaron Johnson at right tackle who is played sparingly\nAnd those two guys again when you need to let the film I now seem to hold up very loud because if they let you down it's a totally different story that's a tough situation for them to step into\nIt is a you know but they know we believe in them that's the cool thing about our program you know that\nUh you know next step I Know that kind of a cliche but we just believe in our players and when the guy goes in there we don't go throw these plays out we just run the ... and tell them go do your job and really proud of Jack ... and that's a tough situation to be in to be making the calls and point at the right backer and all that stuff but I thought he did a great job\nKaren Christian nine thousand five hundred and Ninety seven career passing yards the surface often ... as the all time passing leader in South Dakota state football history I Know you get asked about um all the time we talk about it all the time\nWhen somebody says her record like that they deserve to have a moment to talk about just what they meant to this program\n... as a you know they we brought them into break it down with Isaac tonight and it was like a you know I [noise]\nDon't draw attention to me he's such a great young man he he's a [noise] a humble he's a great leader is a great athlete a he's a difference maker inhale guys wanna guys want to grow up to be like tearing Christian they really do Isaac\nWallace had two huge plays a metal works on the one that gets forgotten on third down an eight or he puts his shoulder down to get the first down barely got it and if he doesn't run that hardy does it get it and then obviously scores the touchdown run senior roles to the occasionally [noise]\nYeah yeah I did because it just went some really good football and a lot of our backs are you saw that again tonight uh but uh you know I think is is really hot right now and and doing some good things to keep getting him the ball\nYeah you feel like you have a lot of death was for running backs and Wallace Daniel Wilson and strong junior then they got this kid named vegetarian scored a touchdown every time he's run with the football at least two for two of his career that was a huge plate to that play call what did you see and I'm sure Jay so that was involved in it but what did you see that lead to\nFor that fake feel go or you know that we had planted a as we thought every one of their looks either one of our face would work\nAnd they were in there the most common look or feel they just don't defend against the fake or they come hard and and everybody's got a different philosophy so he walked in the end zone and the other but that's all Kojak in the sense that that's what they get paid to\nDo when you look at the defense decided I don't need to watch more film but how much of it you just give a nod to India to state and how much of it are you frustrated in your defense and its performance\nA very frustrated you know they give a good teams credit [noise] but uh you know we've got to play play well we got we got to defend the deep pass and uh\nI just think our guys got on their heels a little bit when they got things rolling at times and we didn't play aggressively and then we'd been hit\nBy the double move so many times are in the past so they run three step we just stand there watching catch it because it's got to be a double move and it just we got to get the confidence back we've got to get her tackling firmed up and uh it will be five\nTo add to that we're we talked about those two leading anybody else a lot of Nixon cuts and scrapes 'cause it was a physical game but anybody else besides those to the left\nOr not that I'm aware of we have some guys missed some place 'cause bruises or whatever but they all came back yeah\nAll right well next Saturday Youngstown State coming in for a whole day the whole coming tradition you're letting the

mention to her\nWhich was their duty they mentioned it to Ford that she had an opportunity to testify under oath privately and in California\nBut ever having a kind of washing either foreign lied under oath that she didn't know that or her lawyers failed to tell her and it's fair to tell you that there are no cameras and create light and probably the cast in California there's now Washington based\nObsessive media right to take to uncover every jot until and a new client base for then afterward so that there are many things that could be investigated long after the vote for his confirmation happens\nIs the government is you're going to happen to your your bed if he's going to get some burned Lindsey Graham says if he's not re nominated him\nThey see that so leader McConnell said he's ... he's going to have a vote and this man will be voted on ... percent oppose him but had the guts to\nSay why don't pretend to about X\nY and Z do when you add already said you're going to pose any as Donald Trump's nomination beginning anything I wanted to mention for all the talk about how energized the liberals are and they're watching in suburban women I suburban women are smart enough to know that they are benefiting from an incredibly an economic boom market\nPacket and happened by Clinton that happened to causation his name is Donald Trump even we humans how one Democrat now who is trying to apply the chump ... his name is Rocco bomb that President Obama tried to take credit for it and he didn't get the talking points of Democrats to say but the economy's not that great he thing it's so great I'm\nTaking credit for it but these suburban women also should look at this process and they should say I'm so much is going right but I also\nI also am so disgusted that people aren't hurt this one used it in line for their own political grandstanding purpose isn't the case of a few of them out there in the Senate Judiciary committee which actually raise money for their twenty twenty elections they injected politics and what should be a decidedly\nNon political process here and yes I think it will be investigated after the fact and and I think that people will be very upset about this for a long time they called the folks are watching and for all the talk about liberal excitement look at their ratings at the Fox news primetime lineup last Thursday\nAfter the attack and I read over five million per show that the ... ... pm in the daytime shows the morning shows for the networks want to you had asked every three hundred thousand lakes and they pay to the president's tweet at that Brett Kavanaugh just running for hours later\nThat's a very high number of like for a presidential three so people are energized they're watching not voted out there say don't let that let their funds slip through don't give in to to the mob mentality of out of the minority in the Senate I who doesn't have enough votes to stop this man\nI I Know I Know you've got to go one last quick when would that have been refreshing Kelly and had anybody on the on the left on that panel the Judiciary Committee been questioned by somebody in the media one simple question if he comes back squeaky clean from his FBI investigation you wanted will you vote for him when we when somebody when I\nCame here when I tell you that question hypothetically if you're a great question right on and remember when I say something else so Ford and Kavanaugh under oath\nBut none of the senators who are they just ask and say whatever the heck they want [laughter] um but you're right what would change because they never thought that they never thought that ah that they can many would give for an opportunity to testify they did in fact they accommodated bent over backwards to accommodate her\nHer laundry list of demands I she testified ten days after she was eleven days after everybody found out who she is and that would be eleven days after Brett Kavanaugh was willing to testify and I know one number two\nAnd then they say well we happen to the FBI investigation they would only take four days between now and the day that they have to find so let's just do it they never thought the president would have had an off duty authorized and saying well maybe she'll be longer stronger deeper\nI'd not enough it'll never be enough\nAren't dealing honestly before with with why they oppose this man and his nomination to the United States Supreme court here right how many they will change their mind\nMaybe done but we're looking at some of those red state Democrats who need to see did well over their voters do right by the people who put then on the job or decided they're going to be complicit in a process that has tried to destroy if you live in and and and the way\nIt's a counsel to the president until you can tell you a ... million always appreciate it thank you can't pack\nWe always appreciate having Kelly and all your thoughts on what you just heard plus we've got plenty of time for phone calls here you know it's interesting because it was really due globe and the faces of those who are opposing a Brett Kavanaugh remember how this whole thing started\nThe whole thing started with room waiting and waiting game we can be said he was leaving and the left said we're going to oppose whoever he nominates then they have these either paid or ginned up protesters after Supreme Court waiting for the announcement but didn't know who the for front runners that would\nBe so they had blanks signs\nThat were in protest\nThe signs were blank\nAnd they just filled in with a Sharpie after he made the announcement terminal\nSome of the far left it might have been Planned Parenthood might have been somebody else sent out an email that night\nWe hereby oppose and they literally had two blanks\nThey forgot to fill in the the the nominee's name\nThis was from the beginning just to resist them all that's all it was\nNothing more nothing less we're going to resist because Donald Trump doesn't get to put another another Supreme Court justice employers well guess what he did\nAnd and he's going to win this one I did look into it it's starting to be widely reported that Lisa Murkowski is going to abstain she will vote president she won't vote yes or no on Kavanaugh shovel president\nSo that I'm senator Danes of of a Montana to go to his daughter's wedding so it looks like that's probably how it's going to go down instead of forty nine other does it's going to be forty eight\nAnd um\nAnd I guess it could have been forty nine forty nine with ... gun salute took it probably will be what forty nine forty eight something like that or fifty one forty nine well you'd be a hundred because he's not going to be there will be Ninety million total votes so I'm well we'll see how it shakes out\nBut the bottom line is it looks like she's going to stay in just a president\nAnd that will that will um clear the way for Brett Kavanaugh to be confirmed today unless something happens\nAnd again keep in mind if you're just joining us to shut my show is live from uh from noon to three pm eastern time on Saturday and a nine AM to do that on a specific time on Saturday So if you're hearing it later than that and he's already been confirmed or not confirmed I think it'll be confirmed\nThat's why we're talking about it and it
