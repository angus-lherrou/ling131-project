normal boy what a what a warrior but Goldberg first of all is a great guy\nSecondly the house ways and Means Committee the committee that comes up with the the the the way to do tax cuts to way to deal with taxation Kevin Brady worked very closely with President Trump to come up with a first tax cut plan\nWhich was passed by the house passed by the state of the president signed into law everybody pays income tax\nGot a tax break 'em\nOr carpenters got too much now shut up the corporations actually got an appropriate tax break it probably should have been Fifteen Percent not Twenty one um\nBecause they're the ones that employers they're the ones that have more money to pay cash bonuses or give us raises are more research and develop minimum wage it's are filling in the ...\nHave corporations bring business back bringing manufacturing back and we're seeing an explosion in jobs in the GDP is looking great what Kevin Brady says he's working on the presence will lose you are listening to this for the past week or so or they've been working on a nother tax cut another tax cuts to point oh we're always going to happen\nSo that's what we're talking about a year the president keeps talking about a new tax cuts for middle class families well what does that look like\nHow does that how does that come together so we talked to somebody about that ah the president keeps saying he wants to get it done in the first week of November ... happened before\nThe midterm election that'd be interesting 'cause every like next week\nAnd what does this mean to you will have Kevin Brady\nYou can build Denver can that happen before\nThe midterm election that'd be interesting 'cause that'd be like next week\nAnd what does this mean to you will have Kevin Brady bottom of the hour we'll make sure we bring you back in about ... twelve minutes from now okay so deep that in mind or each one eight hundred and five zero one Seventy ... dot com to the phone lines and Craig is in Pennsylvania Craig what's going on high\n[laughter] hey I just that well as you were talking there just was reminded again about um you know like people talk about basically stopping the bad guy um before he does something [noise]\nAre you there yeah I got you know sorry some bad guy\nYeah sure do are basically though uh I Hope we don't lose or lose sight of the fact that the bad guy is a bad athlete does something bad you can't you can't um you know try to stop people from doing something they didn't do\nThat that that actually I mean is a little beep as little minority reportage but but let me throw this out of the ... the guy in South Florida in Parkland up the ad I miss the high school in February you know the story and talking about right Seventeen innocent people killed\nUm I don't call them by name I told him by his prisoner number which is Eighteen Nineteen fifty eight Eighteen Nineteen fifty eight had thirty or forty contacts by local police\nThe broken several laws that was washed away it expunged because of some of the gold the promise program the FBI had contact with them at least twice and knew that he was hoping to be a school shooter he wanted to actually being a school should remove that clear he was expelled from school because you brought some bullets took last one day and\nHe was all around a bad guy now what you just said to me doesn't make sense in light of that guy because we had every reason to believe this guy could have if he had the chance go and do what do you eventually went and did right\nSure sure and all those ... and all that you've finish their promise so I'm not saying going or arrest him for what he hasn't done yet\nI'm saying actually take action on people who are thirty or forty ... look he knocked his his mother's teeth out by punching hearing the mouth\nSo we've got a guy that we know is a bad guy that should be watching very closely by law enforcement on several levels and who should never ever ever never had been able to go and buy a gun that he allegedly bought legally that he couldn't have bought it and he had this criminal record that he should have bad I'm due to to go and do what he did\nSo can we prevent these things from happening by doing a better job preemptively I'm going to argue yes go ahead\nYeah sure I'm like ... offenders I agree there should be much stronger um consequences for for people that are continually breaking the law\nHowever I'm basically I'm trying to prevent people from breaking the law that haven't yet is it just the dangerous um it it it cuts away at the freedom of the society that who suggested that\nI never said I never said go\nGo in and stop people who've never broken the law firm breaking the law I mean I've never broken the law I'm guessing that you have an either not to that level as I got the speeding ticket but no I I'm with you I don't want us to be Minority Report I just gave you thirty or forty or fifty different times those guys should have had a criminal record and he didn't have a criminal record because of a stupid Obama program called the promise program\nOr is it for me\nThis guy has a criminal record and this is the fact he would not have been able to buy buy the gun for me you have the on campus resource officer pulled his gun gone in and tried to stop him maybe he doesn't kill Seventeen people there were several things that could have done\nBefore he ever got to that school that day that's what I'm saying I'm not seeing trying to assume was going to be a killer or journalists who was going to be a bad guy what I'm saying is if somebody has shown himself to be a bad guy we as a society should take action no\nYes yes I agree but I'm Talking more along the lines of 'em are like um where everybody has to be checked in to a synagogue\nOr whatever or or you have to basically for your your identity they come to your synagogue um you know it just seems like we're going we're ... we're how's that backwards\nOr just because of the fact that in freedom there's a certain amount of risk that has to be taken so if if you're free to walk in and out of your synagogue yes there is a risk their however there's thousands of others synagogue that haven't been shot that day\n[noise] right oh so so so no big deal that eight people died at one synagogue everybody else to say to everywhere else\nWell guess what I'm saying is um\n[noise] there's a certain amount of risk and the freedom to move freely like that and and it's it's sad and there's got to be a way to limit the shootings however\nWhat we we we don't we don't have unlimited freedom in\nThe ... we don't I mean we don't have anarchy we actually have a government\nYou know body and we have police officers that pleasing than protecting served there's a reason for that because there were laws I mean you realize that the fact that we have laws means that we don't have\nUnlimited freedom right we don't have freedom go kill somebody willing for him to go deal drug delivery to go I mean he sold in the blink bad thing that you can do we don't have freedom to do all those things because there are laws in a in a civilized society so if it takes me an extra two seconds to get into the synagogue going into the church\nTo ensure that the guy with a gun can't get in I'm okay with that I'm Still free to go to my synagogue is next Tuesday is longer so what\n... yeah I Know we we only have the freedom to do um what society decides we have the freedom that do you know through law but I I just I guess my point is that I I feel I I just moving towards\nSome that it's okay to limit everybody for the sake of catching one wow\nReally limiting everybody's ... when you get on a plane are you happy that people are going through a checkpoint or not\nWell against what yes or no I mean it's a simple question no I I Know I was not that long ago and they were still\nSaying would you like for the TSA the go away we have nobody checking anybody anybody can walk in with anything they want [noise]\nYou're going to think I'm nuts but yeah it's um it\nWas ... I I Do the job I Love your like a brother but your nose get up on the line now one eight hundred and five zero one Seventy eighty Joe packs dot com timid here [noise]\n\nSixteen year olds for alerts an office of the automatic tax message Mr dean originally applying\nYou're breaking pencils him going crazy with ah with 'em all sorts of what\nHow do we make this happen and you did somehow\nAnd all of us every American who pays taxes got a break every American to pay taxes as a bigger paychecks many Americans three four five six million either got bonuses or they got raises companies are are no manufacturing stuff here again or promising to start doing it so the other side Kevin seem all that success as\nWe got we got to raise the taxes again we have to hurt corporations again and drive them out of the country how is it a winning strategy for them\nYeah I don't know that it is and and and they but they are doubling down on it so repealing the tax cuts raising the taxes on businesses going back to the old a code where every month we saw another us company moving overseas now are manufacturing overseas or jobs overseas and and in in in a period where President Obama\nYou know that was the weakest or economic recovery um since World War two right and he never had a year never had a year he broke three percent\nUm uh for the entire year here because of an more good news again this morning in the third quarter that three and a half percent growth beat the predictions\nInflation's down very strong consumer confidence spending what that means is America's growth will end up above three percent this year just blowing past all the protections before our new tax code and tax cuts so the tax law this new tax law is working for millions of Americans\nIt really is a ... and also by the way getting rid of the individual mandate helped out a bit of an eighty percent you and I talked about his eighty percent of those who are taxed because of the individual mandate we're we're in the middle class or lower middle class area they all got a tax break when that went away as Kevin Brady House Ways and Means Committee chair of the president last week or a few days ago said I\nGot another big tax cut coming going to go to middle class families is going to be a big tax cuts it's come and he's on the way you and I've talked about two point oh what does this look like can you can you let us it a little bit\nSo it's really this one's a little ... to put in a two point oh it was really about you know tax forms about changing the trajectory of the economy and putting America back in the lead role that succeeded two point oh it was about changing the culture in Washington so that every year we make the tax code better they are more competitive so that means permanence\nFor families and small businesses that that's fair that their tax cuts are made permanent plus creates another million half new jobs\nThe second part of two when I was about to savings helping families say more in earlier for their life really important the third is about helping start a business as an innovation draw back to America that's two point oh it's passed the house already and actually even picked up forty four democratic votes in the process\nBut this president wants to go beyond that uh like Ronald Reagan just as you enter as you said earlier who really on a leash prosperity with the series of tax cuts President Trump wants us\nTo ah to advance in path at ten percent cut\nFocused on the middle class and here's his thinking the middle class you know they make too much money to get all the government help\nThey don't make enough to really um live comfortably while you're always the ones getting squeezed into his point of his can't we do more for them and my answer is yes we can and so uh in what a contrast think about this so the Democrats want to repeal the tax cuts\nAnd a new report by Heritage Foundation says that'll cost each middle class American uh twenty seven thousand dollars in an extra taxes and lost wages so contrast that ... every everyone in America right at twenty seven thousand dollar check\nTo was you know you don't have\nVersus a president who wants more tax relief for middle class families is there is there a clear contrast between that\nSwab or it could not be more clear as Kevin Brady House Ways and Means Committee chair he's a Republican producer date the racing to Texas from the ... the first thing about it is\nBoost sales job on the left is if you Brady and you'd Trump do this and if the Republicans do this is going to hurt the deficit expert who actually ... years they ignore the deficit I mean the bronco bomb a double dip episode by ruining the economy in\nIn in by the way the president bomb and Democrats they added two trillion dollars to the national debt in one year then one you were taking less than that over a decade and we invested in a brand new tax code in in tax relief for families\nAnd small businesses in a redesign so that American companies couldn't compete and win anywhere in the world it's very modest and smart investment and by the way\nBut what the liberals won't tell you is our federal revenue in the Washington hit a record high this year\nWe actually have more revenue for individuals in payroll taxes the hundred and five billion than we did before tax reform in so look we won't know for many many years whether the the new um tax code has actually fully paid for itself what we do\nSo look we won't know for many many years whether the the new um tax code has actually fully paid for itself what we do know is is that\nNew revenues are coming in into ah the federal government that our economic growth and opportunities is helping every American and I always like to point this out the difference for you if you if you're worried about the Washington have enough money\nThe difference between that really slow Obama less than two percent growth and the three percent growth we're seeing with President Trump and more is forty four trillion dollars in extra federal revenue\nWhen we are growing the economy you know so I'm I'm convinced that if we hadn't you know had tax reform our deficits would've been much greater overtime\nStates Kevin Ware the house ways and Means Committee chair but when can this go into place the president has has said he's going to be first week of November it sounds like it might happen the day or two before the election what's going to have a\n... here's what we're talking about before he went onstage about when we might introduce it to when he might bring the resolution to the floor and we're talking about could we do it in the next few weeks but in truth what he wants to do is to have this ten percent middle class cut ready for him and when Republicans\nHold the house and Senate ... introduce it in the new um\nA Congress and pass it than his point is let's make sure every American understands only one party is fighting for their pocket\nBook I talk to you for three hours or let me let me read one more quick question but let you go Kevin always appreciate the access to maintain thanks for having me we always appreciate it All right so the germs you just talk to but you just intimate of\nThe house in the Senate looks to me and again people have to stay engaged in our science to go out and vote and I sit in their hands and be happy that their paycheck is bigger do insure that is going to stay that way and go and vote but it seems to me that two maybe three some say four seats\nCould be gained in the Senate but the house is still a toss up ... the Democrats are backing off of that whole blue where you begin to actually what what did you tell me before we started the interview they're actually saying we're not watching the numbers\nHave on yes they are in fact as you see their early voting rights\nAnd and you watch how Senator Cruz has really kicked him back in the gear and Rick sort of feel the pull the curtain back on that Aurora now more taxes realized just how extremely liberal he is always\nFar left yeah guys basically as a Bernie socialist guy would open borders and in fact he actually said Kevin not too long ago that we that we recently took capital Mexico we just took it\nYeah I have to use the\nGuy who voted against repeatedly the hurricane Harvey disaster relief right it's so much of our state was desperately waiting for I and and I read his excuses about say there is no excuse\n... for for down here on the market has she wanted some something unrelated attached to it or else he wouldn't do it and you're right ... thank goodness we have the majorities because this would not pass in too much of people like Jim ...\nAnd I'll tell you wish you could be me joke 'cause 'cause ... Sen Cruz ah was was hugely helpful\nAnd important on tax reform on Hurricane Harvey relief in order to Joe mandate so I'll just tell you he is delivering protects us in a big way and I think look in the house we have our backs to the wall history says we don't\nUh keep the house lost a lot of tough races at the end the day I Believe we do because because Republicans and conservatives are now turning out and understand this is not a mid term this is really about you know keeping this house the Senate this economy this president in place\nIt's our house ways and Means Committee chairman Kevin ... Republican the great state of Texas Kevin my friend I appreciate the time was talk soup thanks so take care okay\nWe always appreciate the house ways and Means Committee chair stopping by such an important job and are age really great news to hear that it looks like there's going to be another tax cuts for middle class families and they're looking at cutting your taxes by ten percent holy mackerel\nOr were to give a close eye on that get you details as soon as we get them a come right back each one of the hundred and five zero one Seventy eighty Joe ... dot com on the weekend say or\n... burning your degree from one of the top business schools in the country might sound impossible to fit into your workload but what if there were a business degree to further your career and give you access to world renowned faculty leaders and mentors all on your schedule\nOne that opened doors to some of the most influential CEOs tech companies law firms entrepreneur in Salt leaders and what if you could earn that degree in his little less sixteen months one hundred percent on line\nTo find out more text offer to seven nine six four or five that's ...
