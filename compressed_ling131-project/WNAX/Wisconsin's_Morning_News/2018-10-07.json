past ... effort so why bother to pray power answer to that question is because me and my dad did\nWe read about it in his memoirs which we find in our Old Testament\nLet me give you some background it's for forty four BC before Christ the Persian empires now in power and king are taxis is in charge of the whole thing\nIsrael had been in exile in Babylon for their disobedience to God for many

the nation suicide in Jesus and we're the call people empowered by his spirit to serve out his purposes and bringing people to that kingdom so our take away from this near my story\nAs missionaries as servants of God working for the Lord Jesus Christ\nTo bring people into his kingdom\n[noise] amazing thing happens with this combination in this order\nPrayer hard work in God's faithfulness got that wall built in that\nCheese is operated the same way in this day to day ministry and even before the trials and across there was prayer in the garden of ... and you might too yeah but that was me and my as time and the timing cheeses can those things actually happened today let me tell you the story\nOf two thousand ten a group of eight people from two churches felt cold to the Detroit boulevard neighborhood of Sacramento, California\nIt was known as one of the most notorious crime ridden neighborhood in all the Sacramento\nEach house in that neighborhood was a place of danger\nNonetheless this group of ... decided to walk through the neighborhood praying over each home praying for the presence of Christ or rain or violence addiction and satanic oppression they began walking through the neighborhood praying over each home and rebuild the demonic strongholds of addiction and violence\nOne of the eight former Sacramento police officer in gang detective Michael Jong\nReported that each time we prayed over the houses we felt the weight of oppression becoming lighter\nA woman from one of the house was confronted them when she discovered they're praying for the community she asked for healing and God healed or\nThe group soon physically moved into the neighborhood and started what they called Detroit life church\nA couple of years later a local newspaper the Sacramento Bee reported that there were no homicides robberies or sex crimes and only one assault and Detroit boulevard between two thousand Thirteen and two thousand fourteen\nDetroit boulevard has been transformed by a small group of people who began their ministry in the neighborhood by praying around houses streets in parks\nFor the power seem to be vanquished\nKingdom prayer in body is what it means to be faced fully present to his presence in this world\nListen me and my favorite position when faced with overwhelming\nProblems in odds was the kneeling position and then he got up and worked hard made that being said of us\nAs individuals and there's the church of Jesus Christ\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWould you pray with me [noise] lord thank you for the privilege of prayer\nMay be our first

versions of today's program as well as past program at our website address is Christian crusaders dot org [noise]\nIf you enjoy today's program and would like to continue we ask you to consider making a gift to this ministry\nChristian crusaders is of vital importance to many persons who are unable to attend worship services in the church of their choice all donations are considered tax deductible\nWe are happy you chose to worship with us this day and we pray you will join us again next Sunday on this station conducting our service was our speaker rivers deep Kramer senior pastor of shepherd of the valley Lutheran Church in Aspen\nMinnesota Christian crusaders on the air and online now and it's eighty third year broadcasting biblical truth\n\nThis account serves to show how wrong we may be in our thinking\nFor this man had a God given purpose when a life is created when we are blessed with such a great gift\nWe may see it as merely inconvenient not worthy of having right now as this new life is in the way of the plans we have made for ourselves throughout the world about fifty five sixty million God given lives are taken by abortion each year\nThe arguments for abortion range from not wanting to raise children with birth defects to those concede due to rape yet those cases are the absolute rarity among those who choose abortion\nTwisted in the devils lies as we are we may\nNo longer see the value in lives created by God his children no less as worthy of protecting\nSin has caused us to become towel and sub seen life as having great value for the one who gives a\nDead as we are in our sinfulness we placed little value in lives that are no longer able to contribute to society or to us more rightly said it\nWas good could bring a disabled child into this world possibly bring\nPurpose does grandma or grandpa in their frail bodies offer wine with a disease that will keep them requiring chair for a long time stripping them of their ability to be active citizen\n[laughter] even though it was my actions that caused a life to be created my life isn't ready to share with another so I'll just make this problem go away it isn't really a life until it fully enters the world we hear today\nAnd until then we have a right to choose to do whatever we want with it [noise] we need not look hard at a mirror to see how broken we are\nOur thoughts may even shock us at times [laughter] looking at strangers seeing how their dress or thinking of what little value they contribute judging their life as worth less\nThan our own but what if we are wrong\nWhat if I were sitting written and reason cannot be trusted and we were to give God the final say in our lives\nRemember how we were once created in his image old that image has been shattered but it is helpful to see how or natural inclination\nTo hold cell value above others in this world should be seen as a sign of sickness you see all were and are created in his image I'll be at a shattered remnants of it\nAnd God loves us so much that he wants that all would be saved and if his value for all of us is so great even broken and simple as we are there must be something to each life that he grants to exist\nAnd therefore we have no business pronouncing a right to choose its existence or not and as Christians\nWe cannot be complacent about this issue we cannot claim to see God by his words to be followers and to not speak out against the hatred towards his creation that exist today pro choice is\nSo ... that only he should make euthanasia is also the same\nSure things are broken in this life and we can expect some tough stuff to enter our lives\nYou're using evil for good as God does all lives how purpose we may not see it as crowded as our eyes have become by swallowing the devils wise but there is much to be gained by knowing the one true God as\nHe is you see God is a Serbian king each action is one that is meant to draw us into a deeper understanding of who he is and how valued his creation is to be seen thinking we know better in seeking control\nWe'd be left to looking at an eternity of darkness death and torture in choosing the devil as whom we should follow\nYet wanting none of that God in knowing how we could never perfectly fulfill the laws that are best for us since his only be gotten son to save us\nAnd with him living his most perfect life Jesus then traded his life for our dead ones ones that deserves nothing but God's wrath and separation from him\nTo see how lucky you are you must see how enemies as we are God still loves us enough to provide the fix to show us that even our lives still hold precious value to him\nAll lives do\nAnd when we begin to understand how we have a father who still loves us and wants us in spite of our own the facts\nMaybe then we can see how his loved extends to everyone everywhere and that they too are valued and deserved to know of his love also those who God creates are no accident\nRegardless of how they arrive in this world\nThe blessings that we may see and loving those lives that we may expect to be burdens are precious in the eyes of God\nThose who need our compassion and service are there to teach us\nAnd they exist as lives that we may grow in love by and that is the real gift\nCard grants to learn of how we too may love and in doing so may receive loved in return\nFollowing him we can expect is sinful broken world to bring with it trials and hardships yet we are made stronger and blessed to be in closer communion with him trusting as he draws us into deeper understandings of his plan and purpose amid the chaos\nNow if you are listening\nAnd you have gone against that which God wish for you to have\nTaken a life and now find yourself surrounded by the darkness of that decision and feeling the pain\nI encourage you not to hide in the shadows where the devil once you but instead to bring that to the one who loves you the most your lord and savior who seeks to save the center for the last ... the broken the one who's forgiveness knows no limits in seats to embrace you again in his loves\nA mixed darkness storms in trials Jesus Says\nI Am with you always even to the end of the age\nAnd in that there is much to be thankful for the life giver our lord and savior ceased to give us life eternal in him he wants to share all his love\nThat you would share his love with others also [laughter] I mean we always think of God's created children however they arrive in this world and wherever we find them in the age of this life\nIs full of value and purposes God declares us to be for the whole children are\nA heritage from the lord the fruit of the room a reward\nMay we thank the lord always for valuing our lives enough to save them\nBut there is nothing greater to be thankful for today man a father who spared not even the life of his son to save ours and trusting in this most precious work of Christ we will arrive home again to share in a life\nThat never ends me that\nPiece which passes all understanding keep your hearts and minds in your lord and savior\nJesus Christ in his name we pray all men\nTo learn how you can support worldwide Oak Ridge
