got shut the man in non can open\nIf gosh you gather to himself his spirit and his breath\nAll flesh would perish together in men would return to dust\nJob twelve and thirty four\nJob's belief\nThat God is the author of all things is the thorn at the throbbing source of his anguish if we continue reading the perplexing book that bears his name we hear him go on to say God has torn me in his raff God gives me up to the ungodly\nCast me into the hands of the wicked\nWhy do the which it live and prosper wire not tons of justice kept by the almighty\nJob sixteen Twenty one twenty four\nImagined being trapped in a story like that\nAt a turning point in the story of Harold Crick\nAgain he hears his author alluding to his past interpreting is president foreshadowing his future Tyne is tied here's the voice again\nIt was remarkable how the simple modest elements of heroism life so often taken for granted would become the catalysts for an entirely new life\nBy the end of day Harold had enough again he hears that voice in his head\nHarold suddenly found himself beleaguered end exasperated outside the bakery\nCursing the heavens ends utility no I'm not I'm person you you stupid voice or shut up and leave me alone\nAnd even if you want it out you couldn't escape\nYou can't stop being a character in your author's story that doesn't stop you from trying\nYou rebel against your author now that you realize he's here that he's in with under everything messing with you you try to fight him\nResisting the movement of the story trends pressing the boundaries of you're setting but the more you struggle the more you only hurt yourself or you fight him the more you find yourself fighting everyone around you\nSo you begin to resent your author you hate him\nOne day you try something new to protect yourself you start to tell a different tail it goes like this there is no author\nThe universe is a an accident\nOf fun guided evolution\nThe idea of an omnipotent author is a infant tile illusion from an age without smartphones\nI must make my own meaning I must create my own the happy ending\nI Am the author of my story it's up to me to justify my life as a life worth living and so it goes\nWe reject God the problem of justifying life in the face of evil and suffering doesn't go away\nAnd now you and I have to bear the God awful burden of justifying ourselves justifying our actions justifying our world or else we pass the buck onto a government and that will become our author and master\nQuestion of justification is unavoidable cannot find meaning in life unless you receive it as a story and there's no story without an author and so the problem is always the same which author or do we trust\nNow Harold is standing at the bus stop and once more that voice provoke them and so on this particular Wednesday evening as heroin waited for the bus his watch suddenly stopped the Herald washed\nTrust him into the mythical path of fake little did he know that this simple seemingly innocuous act would result in his imminent death\nWhat what\nHey why why yes hello excuse me why and how it's\nHarold burst into his apartment ransacked the closet throws open doors turns out drawer searching for the voice okay\nWhere are you probably heard you come on you stupid voice say something desperate now Harold becomes his own narrator Harold frantically grabbed his lamp Harold in since ... about the room for no apparent reason smash it on the ground stopping it repeatedly\nCome on say something say something say something\n[noise] Harold distraught God Harold bistro\nThan the author speaks\nAbout you this time but to you\nAuthor addresses you personally\nNow I'm going to ask you to stop imagining and just believe part about God being your author it's true\nThere is another part of the story that I haven't been telling you and you need to hear it before it's too late\nHour author is not limited to one way author character relationships are author is not a solitary on moved mover he's not an evil genius playing with us like puppets are avatars he's a father\nBefore even started this story from eternity\nThis author has a give and take relationship with his son than in the power of his spirit he loves his son and as much as he loves his son this is how much she loves you\nThat's why he created you you know so that you could become not merely a character and his story but his adopted son his adopted daughter\nHe justified your existence not because of what you could do for him but because of what he wants to do for you\nTo bring you into an authentic to weigh relationship father son father daughter relationship of love and trust and to recreate this relationship of love for us the father sent his only son to be born into history\nTo take the named Jesus to become a character in his own story\nAnd as a character the son suffered all the unanswered questions that you and I suffer his character\nThey are in his own story and as a character the son suffered all the unanswered questions that you and I suffer as characters and the strange and sometimes confusing story\nJesus showed us what it looks like to actively strive to passively suffer as gospel loving children in his death\nHe showed us how to express doubt we job like face my God my God why have you forsaken me\nHe said father into your hands I commit my spirit Luke twenty three forty six\nIn his resurrection Jesus showed us how face waits\nOn the author of life\nGod is God with a sore without us yet God became ...\nGod for us when he became the man Jesus of Nazareth\nFace alone was the phrase that the Protestant Reformers use to describe the to a relationship between God the father and his beloved children the reformers were just following the apostle Paul and they insisted that we are justified we are put right with God to face alone\nThis means that we are rescued from our rebellion by hearing in Jesus the voice of our author and taking them at his word trusting him receiving his story is our story that's what it means\nTo be justified by grace along through faith alone\nIn Christ along to the glory of God alone\nAmen amen\nYou're listening to the Lutheran our I'm Mark I sure along with Dr Tony cook and our new speaker Dr Michael regular we thought we use this time to help our listeners get better acquainted with you Tony
