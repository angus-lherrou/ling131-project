now to discuss that is Dr Tony cook\nDirector of us ministry answer at Lutheran our ministries Tony ... let's talk about fear in our lives and uh how face interact in intersects with that\nSure ah thanks for having me again this is a topic that\nI can get in the way back machine go back to um I think if I'm remembering correctly about when I was seven ... and um I was going through some rough times uh in my life\nAnd I started to have nightmares ... when I Would have these dreams that felt like you were kind of locked into them you know you can get out um they repeated every single night it was the same dream that that happened every time\nAnd when I Would uh when I Would wake up from his dream I'd be like really startled and in in my heart would be racing and I'd be half awake and half asleep and I would see\nYou know shadows in the room is a little kid you know and that's scary stuff it was a I had a closet that didn't have a door\nSo dark um and I had a a Barney Rubble nightly now I don't yeah I had a night light and that was the only light in the room and sometimes it help and sometimes it kept odd you know shadows on the wall but\nWhat happened is I was going through this period of when he went to sleep I Would have this dream\nAnd I would wake up with this tremendous sense of fear and for boating\nAnd I I'm a little kid I thought what can I Do\nTo keep these things away [laughter] and\nUm I really only knew two prayers at that time I knew now and lay me down to sleep\nAnd I knew the Lord's Prayer\nAnd so what I did is um before I Would go to sleep I Would close my eyes\nAnd in my mind every time I said one of those two prayers they would make a brick and I would take these bricks and I would put them around me in a circle and as I pray that they would get higher and higher and higher until it's like a pillar of ... and I was inside a pillar of brick\nOf prayer and that would help me fall asleep and it gave me a sense that this this pillar of bricks was protecting me if you will from the fears that came in the night\nAnd eventually eventually they they went away after a period of time but I still have that very very vivid sense of\nNeeding to be protected from that fear\nAs well as not being able to stop those fears from you know in invading my sleep but I Do remember that little I don't see childish technique because now that I think about it actually probably wasn't that bad a bad thing to do but uh that was a time in my life that I had these kind of foreboding fears and and how I handled it", "year": "2018", "show_name":
