send me to see how many I could baptize\nTo proclaim that gospel\nI have not done this by the persuasive ness of clever words for I have no desire to Rob across his power the preaching of across is I Know nonsense to those who are involved in this dying world\nTo wash who are being safe from that debt it is nothing less than the power of God is written I Will destroy the wisdom of the wise and the ... the prudent I reject consider what have the philosopher the writer and a critic of this world to show for all of their wisdom\nHas not gone made the wisdom of this world foolish\nWas after the wisdom had failed to no God that he and his wisdom chose to save all wouldn't believe\nBy the simple mindedness of the gospel message\nFor the Jews ask for me it was proof and Greeks and intellectual panacea but all we preach his Christ crucified stumbling block to the Jews and share nonsense to the ...\nFor those who are cold weather Jews are gentile as price of God and wisdom of God amen\nYou're listening to the loo through an hour and we just heard this message from Dr Oswald Hoffman first preached in Nineteen fifty five talking about the rapid pace of technology\nI'm joined here in the studio by Dr Tony cook director of us ministries or at least for an hour ministries the rapid pace of technology is not slowed it all has it\nI I remember when I was a kid I Lived out on a farm out in the middle of a cornfield\nOr we didn't have air conditioning we didn't have cable TV we didn't have a cell phone we didn't have an answering machine\nAt one point we didn't have computers you know anything like that and to think of where we are today it was like I was living you know like life on the prairie [laughter] something like that and then then all of a sudden those technological advances started they started to you know kinda multiplies\n... speed I'm starting to get to that age that I'm thinking\nWell I'll just let them next generation deal with that I can remember when the Internet came out\nI had this thought that well I'm sure that's just kind of for kids I really don't need it now today you know how to get a permeated everything so yeah a technology I think is a an amazing amazing gift but it it does make your head spin and it also\nBrings questions of of morality and and usage and and how we're using things appropriately or or inappropriate was well\nDr Hoffman speaking back in Nineteen fifty five said things are happening so fast it's impossible to get a grip on them before they slip away replaced by something new and better and that's the same thing we could say today what does that mean for Christianity for the church\nBut it's interesting er here at the losing our we use technology a lot to um to get the gospel of Jesus Christ out into the world\nBut I'm not someone once said that the Internet is where religions go to die\nReally yeah and I kind of an odd what do they mean by that well I I think that the the point is that\nWhen you have a faith of any kind um that talked about on the Internet you're exposed to all the other ones ... and you're exposed to people from all these different belief systems that they know this is the right point no this is the right point or my way as and here's the proof for this or whatever it might be\nI think it's partially because of the fact of um exposure and as I go back to the beginning of this one I grew up in the middle of a cornfield I wasn't exposed to anybody other than the six hundred people who lived in my town you know but now every religion every thought every philosophy that exists in the world comes to you\nAnd I think for many people that is a challenge and they don't know how to necessarily think through those things so I I think it's important on the one hand that as Christians that we use technology in a way that gains a hearing for the gospel of Jesus Christ\nAnd that proclaimed that gospel in a way that um it's clear maybe even more than it has been in the past because\nWe can assume that people understand the message of the church anymore I'm with all these competing messages that are there still on the one hand technology is this great tool\nFor us to use to communicate the gospel but also it presents challenges with other ways of looking at things sometimes that can be a challenge or just for people who might not be as strong in their faith or thought about their faith that might challenge them as well I'm not that we should pull out of technology\nBut I'm understanding who we are and who's we are and being able to articulate our faith clearly as we confront these diverse messages I think is extremely important with all of this technological change\nAnd as much as technology continues to change what remains the same as God's love for us in Jesus Christ and we reached that message each week you're on the program\nAnd that's kind of beauty I think of Christianity is the goal post really never move [laughter] it's a a Jesus has already kick the ball and and the game has been one of 'em and for us\nThe message is the same the message that it's because of Jesus Christ that the love of God is here\nFor you that the kingdom is here for you that there is a place that has been prepared for you by God in God isn't your enemy he's not against you he wants you to be with him forever\nAnd his kingdom and that comes through\nThe crucifixion and the resurrection of Jesus Christ and while things are changing you can never change that that's something that his his historic is something that happened and it's something that regardless of what you're facing you can always go back to and say this is the one thing that makes the difference\nAnd in that crucifixion and resurrection we find our identity then as as people have got\nOh and this is the kind of the beauty of it and almost a ... not only beauty but it's it's like a beautiful mystery to me\nAre identity being connected to Jesus that in our baptism that death that we talked about that that that saves the world from soon we are connected to that death\nSo in our baptism we die and we rise with Jesus and our identity is directly connected to the identity of the son of\nGod and so when you worry about who am I a in these changing times uh how do people perceive me on Facebook and all these other a technological platforms the real question that we should be asking is is how does God see us and gods\nA technological platforms the real question that we should be asking is is how to God's Ears and God sees us in\nJesus our identity as him and him and we have a diet and risen with him and when he looks at us he sees through that death and resurrection of his son and he loves us any cares for us any forgive us and he wants us to know who\nHe is at the same time that message is not an easy one it's perceived as foolish both by those who take religion very seriously and by those who don't Yeah Dr Hoffman talked about that the the foolishness of the message\nThat the that is being preached and yet that is the message that contains the power of God for saving us\nYeah it's interesting 'cause we talk about the Christianity is foolishness I'm On the one hand a person could say that and you think well that's a horrible thing to say I'm sure that's not correct\nBut if you ever take time to look at it you know I guess it [laughter] um it's foolishness to our human way of thinking really be the wiser person in the world would not have come up with this as a solution\nTo the to the problem is and you know so you think that okay sin came into the world and the solution is that God is going to sacrifice his son Jesus\nAnd that belief in that Jesus in in that son of God and his sacrifice is somehow a Tony for us\nThat doesn't make sense it just doesn't make sense and and so when you try to think about it a cognitively with your mind or academically or treat it like math or science or you know something like that in dissected\nIn the end you kind of step back from an eagle while how that is not how I Would have thought about that that that's not how I Would have done that but in many ways that that again is where the beauty of it is the gods solution\nFor a problem that transcends our ability to cope with it\nAlso has to transcend our ability to cope with it had to provide a solution that was so beyond us that in many ways I just kinda really stand in awe of what the gospel is\nAnd the depths that he went through and what that meant for Jesus I can only barely begin to kind of crafts that that you know I I read the Bible and I I Try to imagine what would that be like\nAnd of course I I Can't put myself in in Jesus you know she was at that point\nYou know that he would die and then he would take on the sins of the world and and uh that he would descend into hell and you know for claimed victory things like that\nSo I just have to stand back and I just say ah you know I Believe it but I don't understand it and in many ways when people say that sounds like foolishness I just said yeah you're you're right but it's not really about understanding it from a logical perspective for me it's about faith",
