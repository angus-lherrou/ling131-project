spoon just off the interstate\nAnd your cabin in the woods welcome to coast to coast am I'm Richard Sayre and\nAnd the night this morning we're coming do you live from coast Toronto, Canada affiliate in dance radio news talk contests [noise] last night I mentioned this news talk ten ten the old C F R B had been on the radio for eighty years correction is more like Ninety Ninety years [noise]\nAlso last night or should I say earlier this morning during the open line segment a number of callers shared their near death experiences or glimpses of an afterlife [noise]\nTonight in our one I'm revisiting the topic of the afterlife this time an alleged after death communication involving the great American magician escape artist Harry Houdini\nHoudini and his wife best were fears the bunkers of psyche ability mediums and the spiritual this movement in fact Houdini wrote several books exposing fake mediums and there are fraudulent methods\nHoudini of course died of a ruptured appendix on October the thirty first Nineteen twenty six Halloween four days after receiving\nFor unexpected punches to his abdomen by McGill University student backstage at the princess theater in Montreal Canadian connection there on his deathbed Houdini allegedly told doctors that despite being a skeptic of\nAfter death communication if he were able to get a message to his beloved wide best he would do sell\nThen more than two years after his death his wife best attended the sands\nConducted by medium psychic Arthur for during which forward allegedly channeled the message from Harry using a secret coded message previously agreed to\nBy Harry and bass initially best stated publicly in assigned in witness testimony that she believed Terry Haddon fact\nCommunicated to her from the grave\nLater however she recanted and stated publicly that no Harry had not communicated to er during the say odds despite this best continue to hold highly publicized San says in New York every Halloween on the anniversary of Harry's death for the next ten years\nNothing on Henry you know I mean he didn't add any kind of reason to go there or do anything\nRight right I I just wanted to ask you about briefly about a circle is their Arthur Conan Doyle because they were area and and he were were good friends and yet\nA door oil was a prominent spiritual is so how did that how did that friendship survive the fact that area was such an avowed to bunker didn't have time for spiritual is and yet he's good friend and his wife were both very much into spiritualism movement\nYes yes the spirit was movement is not exactly a and defining in some kind of permanent structure you know you can't say there's a leader but a lot of people did looked at the oil as the leader of the spiritual as a matter of friendship starting in around Nineteen twenty for about two years\nAnd I think the friendship came about through fame just fame crossing pads and hey how are you and they enjoy the fact that they had a different perspective and they talk about it\nUm but eventually um there was a little bit of\nA discord between them that got so much that they did break off their friendship\nAfter a couple of years it was the oil's wife who gave a I think it was a [noise] what do you call it a automatic writing kind of reading for Harry where she claimed that he brought she bought through Harry's mother\nAnd Harry's mother the spirit of Harry's mother plays an important part in this whole thing [noise]\nUm and Harry was supposedly moved but he declined to acknowledge any real evidence that there was contact and that kind of upset the oil and his wife and that was the beginning of the tension so anyway\nAs you sort of outed her in public didn't need any out her ... yeah\nYes yes uh thirty taco view um some of this play out through the newspaper which is an awkward way to have a conversation\nThat no part of this debunking that that uh Harry and best engaged in ... would be to sort of demonstrate I guess the audience is how it works so they would sort of do their own\nSort of photos psychic ACT UP on stage and I don't know if they'd been explained to the audience you know how they were being deceived but they had this secret coded method\nThat Harry and best could communicate with each other in order to sort of demonstrate how psychics may may be pulling these scams off can you explain the secret Cody method um\nI think we should touch on that a little bit I don't want to go into it too much but I'm here's one way to anybody that interested in this it's all explained in the essay quite clearly there is a list of can words and attempt word is actually a phrase in each word corresponds to a number number one to Ken\nAnd number can can also be taken to be zero and so this was used to point most commonly to the date on a coin that's the trick would normally work when Harry in best first met and Eighteen Ninety four that's when they got married\nThey would do this little trick where they would have someone volunteer they'd reaching their pocket ... what is the last two digits on the coastline\nAnd they these words which Mm pray answer say now tell and so forth\nThese words would be correlated to a number and so that would work these words into an easy sent tents like quickly area I Know you can do this and that would be number eight\nAnd so it has a natural them is to it and yet there's some information in there you see what I mean\nChrist so if the coins at best held in her hand was a let's say Eighteen eighty eight\nAnd because she would say she's communicating doing verbal using these code words and she said quickly quickly is corresponds with a number eight to eight eights Oregon in the secret code emitted so he knew that one of the numbers was age\nRight and then she might use quickly again so that would be the same number right mix size right okay\nAnd I don't want to go into the details and how it can be used to construct words rather than just\nNumbers but it can you know of course we have twenty six letters and the alphabet so you got to use a pair of words at times to get to the letters that are passed number can but they have a way of doing that and that's what we're used to make this code\nSo they would've had to memorize they'd have to memorize those ten words or phrases praying or say now ... please be quickly look the quick and as you say all of this can be found in the essay let me just because people the website if they want to follow along at home as we say infinitely mystical\nDot com infinitely mystical dot com is the website where Houdini afterlife experiment did it work the essays posted there sorry Hi and\nThere's a link on the coast to coast now let's talk about this code because after the message was delivered to bath and she said that at work somebody\nSaid hey this was all in a book\nAll already published in a book this is no big deal well I thought and I read this on line a number of times someone would say within a book but they wouldn't say the name of the book either people were saying it's on page da da da da da da da da and then I\nFinally found someone who said the name of the book and I thought you know I'm going to look in Santa Barbara county library and see that book is there and I was so surprised to find out that it was in northern Santa Barbara county\nAnd for all of twenty five cents\nThey would move that book down to the downtown Santa Barbara library and I could go in there and check it out and eighty five year old book\nI couldn't believe it so I got the book\nAnd I stand the relevant pages of this book and if you're interested just follow that may not say there's a link inside there to show you scan of this book\nAnd so that book does talk about those ten words and how it used to form numbers but not how to form or\nSo that's not in the book in fact there are a number of important things that are not in the book\nAnd um it see I hear a bullet points about it that the code can be used to form words not just numbers\nHow clever coating method works to form these words that they use this code in the afterlife experiment that the secret message would start with the onion coded word rose about that the secret message would include the word to leave and the actual\nSecret can word message none of that with in the book and the person who claimed that it was in the book\nThis is important to ask who this is key also is a famous magician and he's a close personal friend of Harry Houdini so in this person says ah it's not a trick it's in the book\nEveryone just took him at his word did not look into the book and just believe that Ford was a fraud without looking into it anymore\nWe need to back up a little bit because we need to introduce a\nAnd you believe that forward with a fried without looking into it anymore\nOkay we need to back up a little bit because we need to introduce a Ford and and why it was important to point out\nThat this secret coded message was sort of explain in another book by Houdini or about Houdini a and therefore it may have been possible for someone to know about that because now we get into the say on\nAnd and uh we should back up and explain that on who Deanie deathbed in Detroit and\nOne of the last things he told doctors allegedly I don't know what this is actually true but allegedly he told them that\nYeah I'm a skeptic I I I'm a ... I don't believe in an afterlife but if there's any way I can get a message to best I Will try and then she has contacted basses several years later correct by an Arthur Ford how did he how did for get in touch with best\nWell that's an ad in just a minute but I just wanted to point out that I think that this worked they can bath and Harry loved each other so much I think that's really important to point out now science runs the experiment checking into reality as it is a heartless machine\nAnd I think it's really important for us\nTo think about how well we love one another and how they look we are for kindness and compassion and we're not involved in a big giant heartless machine so back to your question\nI'm bored with a reasonably successful psychic and he had clients that would come to him and ask him questions and in one of these sessions in Nineteen twenty eight I think it's about I think it's about Fifteen months after Harry died [noise]\nOne of its clients is getting and reading and Harry's mother the spirit ... adds that spirit Harry Harry mother intrude into this session and then I'm putting words for given all capital letters putting in a letter and sending it to death\nWhile that's gets this letter and she very fine in writing the understanding I had\nAnd she says it's too bad this came after Harry died because of this is the word that he was looking for from his mother to show him that his mother's soul or spirit was surviving gap and got\nHer attention but what's really interesting is that neither ... nor Arthur forward pursued this anymore they didn't want to pursue Arthur Ford\nWas well aware of who gave his reputation and how strongly he was pushing back against the mediums and he\nHer vitamins and enzymes replace the nutrients cooked out of most commercial dark boots\nTake up all night scratching his shutting is minimal and it's just such a pleasure my calm relaxed non shedding how neat and I have to think of I\nDon't let your dog itch scratch stink or shed like crazy come to China for help\nEight five nights for two weeks one thousand eight five nine four to eight when the NFL V. I. T. [noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nThomas resentful my guess is the author of leaving the paradox of enlightenment and the the essay we're discussing a Houdini afterlife experiment it didn't work and that is posted up at the coast to coast am dot com website and Thomas's website as well infinitely mystical\nDot com that time is tight Thomas so let's get to the other say on a at a bath house in January of Nineteen twenty nine and a Arthur Ford is there this is the the medium would reached out to her a so so what happens [noise]\nUm are there for it shows up and he Arthur Ford usually worked for the spirit named Fletcher and Fletcher is in touch with Houdini and this ability for the spirit world to communicate to our physical world\nIt a little bit tricky to navigate and so sometimes spirits need a little more help with this and apparently Houdini mother the spirit of his mother was also present to make this all happened and they were able to make it kind of a um like a show or very theatrical show where Harry would work with Beth\nAll happen and they were able to make it kind of a um like a show or very theatrical show where\nHarry would work with best the same way they worked when they were on stage and use her as an assistant and and have her um well he was very poetic with are very at times very touching and romantic\nAnd ah there were statements like throw in the curtain and all of this but what they did was they put this pen key words on the table and then they coated them\nAnd after it was decoded the message I'll tell it and just a minute but first I Want to explain that best as a nickname\nThat Harry used for her was Roosevelt and this came about through a popular song right around the time when they got married and this song had a little bit or perhaps more of this song I'm inside her wedding ring\nAnd so have you called her Roosevelt and so the message once it was decoded was Roosevelt believe\nAnd it really really touched bass and she was very very strong and clear and her language that her husband had spoken to her\nAnd did anyone noted did anyone know did or the Ford no that Roosevelt was the pen name for best or was this common knowledge\nIt might have been known throughout the close friends um [noise]\nSo I really can't say about that there's a story going around that I read the other day on the Internet 'cause that's trying to brush up on his kind of set up\nSomeone said that uh there was a big romance between Arthur Ford and bass who is Twenty years older than he and he saw her wedding ring and saw the inside of it and saw where it said Roosevelt and blah blah blah\nI just don't find this credible so I won't go into it but um yeah there are people that say that it's quite possible that they would have\nKnown that he referred to as Roosevelt but the believe is actually came through the decoding of those other\n... and and again he just he he didn't of of forward through his spirit guide Fletcher ... just didn't show the word believe they use\nThis secret coating message that we had mentioned earlier using those keywords pray answer say now tell please speak quickly look can be quick in and these all windy coded spelled out the message which began with Roosevelt and and believe [noise] yes\n[noise] yes and um\nShe declared success she declared it a success correct\nAbsolutely and I'm In fact the very next day and in fact I think this was written in another newspaper by someone who is president to say on said oh this is a lot of nonsense that wasn't true and and so that's that's why her statement says regardless of any statements made to the contrary\nI Wish to declare that the message in its entirety and in the agreed upon sequence\nGiven to me by Arthur forwarded to correct message prearrange between Mr Houdini and myself and then it's signed by not only herbal three witnesses one of them as a representative of the United press\nAnother one is one of her lifelong friends and another one it's someone from Scientific American\nAnd these this this letter was reprinted in the New York times and she gave an interview to the times again confirming that that this was a success that it happened\n[noise] I think so in effect of the\nNewspaper articles that I was reading you could clearly see here in support for a good while and then around ... fourteen months after that there is a hard switch where she suddenly start that they're now denounce that anything was valid that there was any evidence whatsoever\nThat this was a genuine contact so it's it's quite shocking um\nBefore that before she sort of recanted there was\nAnother a reporter with a a either a magazine or a newspaper called the New York graph or we rack rather than your graphic and tell me about this reporter ... is it re Jew Jew Ari I Can't pronounce the name but the one\nName but I think the first name as R. E. A. and I think it's pronounced ... writes um she had an apartment and she invited Arthur forward over to visit her and she was going to interview him\nAnd she had some friends hiding I don't know where they're hiding in a closet but they're hiding somewhere and they're going to witness this exchange\nWow the person that shows up is not really author Ford it's someone that's been paid doing person ate Arthur Ford and he shows up and he says uh I paid Mrs Houdini some money she gave me the code I'm just here to tell you the truth [laughter] I just you know it's really funny because\nBass heard about at well the reporter wrote this up\nAnd so bass responded in a ladder um to that same paper where she just completely denies that there she's been a party of fraud in any way and if Arthur Ford\nSaid that they were in cahoots he's a liar I mean she was very clear in this letter goes on and on and I'd never seen this letter until um yesterday and it's in an article\nPosted on a website and the author's name is Greg new Kirk I'm so it's\nAnd this was written to Walter windshield the great Walter ... that's\nWhat I thought I had read that there was a letter written to watch Walter wind chill and he was um yes the social\nThey go to guy you know and um but this\nKind of made it look like it was a letter written to this um the Newark evening graphic\nBut it doesn't matter there may have been two letters but she was very supportive and these these were supposed to be private letters the letter starts off saying this letter is not for publicity I Do not need publicity\nYou know I'm just telling you I was no party Danny fraud you know but anyway um there's a number of things like this where it looks like someone saying aha we've got prove there's fraud he can fast and then it's like yeah but that wasn't him his lawyer said he was somewhere else at the time\nSo Arthur Ford didn't go to this meeting with this reporter at all\nRight however at some point best Houdini further uh money's the water because although she has been insisting and insisting that had happened other than she does an abrupt about face\nYes [noise] and you know in the very first days after the message happened\nIn one of the newspaper articles I read something where she says oh by the way my family and friends they don't buy this you know they don't believe in their communication you know and so and I think that this faster and she was tired of being ridiculed by her friends\nBeing labeled and not\nUm and I think she just told that and said you know what I'm ... I'm I'm going to go back to my friends I Want them to access accept me um and she even said things like if anyone says they get in touch with me\nGoing to go back to my friends I Want them to access accept me um and she even said things like if anyone says they get in touch with me after my dad to know that it's false I Will not try to get in touch with anyone [noise] um so this also muddy the water\nAnd and when I mean how long after the sales and twenty nine was she re camping and changing their position\nI think it was about fourteen month\nFourteen months and but also she had at some point she had offered up a an award a reward a ten thousand dollar price to allow anyone to ten thousand but and then she refused to pay for it so we really interesting\nTo yeah because you know if he really was in cahoots with Arthur Ford he could have done this much more gracefully she basically said hey look I'm not paying because a couple of weeks before this happened I retracted the offer well that sounds you know pretty\nWhat I Do to do is very important because I'm exchanging\nBecause I'm exchanging a day of my life for\nWhen tomorrow comes\nThis thing will be gone forever and leaving something and its players\nMake God gave me this they\nAlso give me the wisdom to know how to live and\nAdd ... to ...\nWhich he also gave me\nThe wells them loose\nWith somebody or\nAny all of them I tell you the gum America's not selling brand seven o'clock [noise]\n\nThe confidence of this program does not represent the views or opinion so five Seventy W.

every one of us and that stress\nAnd believe it or not whether it's job stress financial stress family stress or even the little things that were told not to stress about\nAny form of stress takes a serious physical toll on your body\nBut don't worry because there is something you can do about your stress and joining me today on the phone is Dr Michael ... and Dr ... there's going to talk about stress and\nGive us some great information on things that we can do to reduce or even eliminate the negative effect the daily stress has on our bodies for those you that may not know Dr Parikh is he is a nationally recognized authority on natural an alternative health he's\nWorked with top Hollywood celebrities professional and Olympic athletes and it continues to be involved in the latest research into today's top health concerns and Dr ... thanks so much for being with us today\nThanks Chris great to be with you\nSo let's get right into this whole stress issue you know stress is such a normal part of our daily routine these days but why should we all be concerned about it and more specifically what's going on in our bodies and one of the warning signs that we should be looking for\nWell you know there's two ways to look at stress on is what we call mental stress on the other the other is stress affects your body as a doctor I'm more interested in how it affects your body sure so the waste stress affects the body is this person is under stress the body transpose as a stress into tension\nAnd your mother end up contract and everyone feels that in there and the upper back in ... right by the doctor I'm more concerned about the muscles that you don't feel\nSuch as the muscles didn't artery up and the muscles the heart is a giant myself over and the muscles in and around your digestive tract mhm because these are the things that are resulting in\nIn a heart disease digestive difficulties and I want to talk a little bit and your show today about nutrition because there are two nutrients\nThat completely handle the body in terms of stress okay now according to the research that I've been involved with his his as simple as calcium and magnesium\nCalcium and magnesium right okay\nWhen you're deficient in calcium and magnesium a lot of things can happen\nKelsey magnesium for example is needed in order to go to sleep at night and how many people you know they just don't sleep while you wake up tired your body hurt more\nPretty soon it starts to wear you down and pretty soon you get sick and you have a condition of people are suffering for pain and osteoporosis and fibromyalgia and cramps and their legs and weird illnesses so there's something wrong with this picture and it has to do with not how much calcium someone taking in their diet or how many ... supplement their\nHow many in Athens you chew it has to do with simple absorption is that calcium getting absorbed into your body\nWith calcium being something to do with stress season calcium for building bones well\nYes okay yeah it does build your teeth but he's the one percent of the calcium actually circulates in your blood\nSo in that one percent starts to drop it could affect your heart your brain your kidneys your organs and your body shutdown actually died\nWow one percent of the calcium always has to be in your system [noise] and there's two sources of calcium one isn't diet you know and to is from the bones themselves\n... absorb it back from the bones if ... that's right I see\nAnd what you just discussed right now leads to one of the major causes of a condition that's affecting twenty five million Americans right now which is called osteoporosis right which is a weakening of a ball\nAnd that's due to the body deriving the calcium from the bones instead of from the ...\nYeah okay so we have to do is we have to find a way to put calcium back in the diet do you think that would be really easy\nFor sure just drink milk just drink milk or you know eat a lot of green leafy vegetables and that sort of thing but first of all people don't do that right and second of all the the quality of the calcium that comes from our diet has been decreasing in the last fifty years really because things like pastures Asian\nIrradiated um the calcium as leach from the soil and\nPeople are taking medications that block it so\nThe actual calcium is that being absorbed in the body okay and then you see people taking toms and calcium supplements you know they buy the health food store drug writer but these things don't absorb and the body for a couple of reasons\nOne when you take a let's say an antacid that had the ... like a dumb first of all calcium does not absorb in the body unless it's an anesthetic environment\nBut see what happens when you take a Tom antacid oh oh okay so even if you're getting calcium in the in the antacid itself has that been absorbed\nBy the because it has to be in a in an environment for it to be absorbed\nExactly okay now we have a product called ... formula\nWhite comics formula is natural\nAnd the differences is that a powdered\nAnd what happens is you put it in hot water and you mix it up and you drink it don't do it in a liquid instead of a pill\nAnd it absorbed into your system\nWow so that's a problem that\nWell yeah because when Cal the magnesium earn a liquid state it absorbs ten times better than in any other state\nWell that's great matter of fact yes I'm I'm reading the can right now says the pants absorbing calcium and magnesium beverage powder\nWell it comes down to absorption one of the ways to tell if you're not observing calcium is take a look at what drugs they're taking\nAre you on high blood pressure medication do you need something for your kidneys or you want pain medications you need sleeping pills the calcium and especially the need is being absorbed ... you're not going to suffer from all these things\nMy comment formula does absorb incredibly in the body the thing is is that what do you take my comments formula but not like well well I feel better I have thousands of people right if the doctor pain 'cause I Can't believe it thirty minutes after I took the ...\nThe pain in

and the negative effects that every day stress has on your body weather's job stress financial stress family stress any form of stress takes a serious physical toll on your body and Dr ... you were talking about how your kill max formula\nCan help us in this battle against stress and I guess this is something everyone should be aware of whether you're twenty four or Ninety four\nIdeas that for many many years as as a younger person and I'm a dancer [laughter] well I use it then it definitely helps me sleep better it helps control the stress of the working world and many people will just be amazed how this actually work\nBecause our formula has a chemical reaction occurred before you actually ingest it mhm how Mac is pre dissolve it doesn't get lodged in your system and so what happens is that when people drink the ...\nIt's like an infusion into your body is like ... like ... and so people who are in pain they take the comments the calcium magnesium ... end of the month of and it starts to relax it\nDr figures you talked earlier about how stress affects your energy and I'd like you are to elaborate a little bit more on that subject if you would I mean the stress really affect our energy level good\nQuestion because energy is like the biggest thing right now like people chronic fatigue syndrome PMS and fibromyalgia wiping people out and that's the key to low energy is a lot of it's caught by paying feeling old your joints don't oh well this kind of wife's you out it drains your energy and then then you get tired and you go to sleep\nI guess what you don't sleep now I'm

heavier than the average person in Nineteen sixty studies show that most of us have persistently negative attitudes about people just like us who carry extra weight\nSome might expect that biased to have improved our time because rate there'll be the have increased and so we might expect that title tolerance to improve but in fact we're actually seen that bias has worst hit and\nMiss Dr Rebecca pool professor of human development and family studies at the University of Connecticut and deputy director of the rub Center for food policy and obesity\nAnd we've done some national study and\nReally following people over a decade and we see that report that white discrimination are increasing we also see evidence of this and other types of experimental studies that look at public attitudes towards\nPeople that have obesity and compare those same kinds of studies that were done forty fifty years ago and we see that attitude their worst\nPool says obesity bias is based on a persistent misconception held by the thin end obese alike that a person's weight is entirely their own responsibility so they can be blamed if they're overweight\nBecause these kinds of methods aren't challenged in our society people who are struggling with white sometimes internalize those types of methods and blame themselves for the stigma that they can find\nAnother reason is because if we look at our diet mentality that we had our country and that's really reinforces the idea that body weight and temporary is infinitely malleable that a person can have whatever kind of body they want if they just work hard enough to lose weight\nYou think that doctors wouldn't no that's not true that they know the science showing that weight is complicated and governed by a whole host of factors yet studies show that doctors mirror the rest of society\nIs so much weight by us in our society that health care providers are really not immune to that aside a biased and what we've seen in a number of studies and that way by ...\nBy health care providers toward their patients will be the end that the level or prevalence of white bias among physicians and really pretty much the same that's what we see in the general population in some cases we see that this bias had the worst and every time especially among individuals who are working India beef a field and so that's the real problem\nFor example the kinds of stereotypes that we often the case\nWho are working India will be the field and so that's the real problem\nDo for example the kinds of stereotypes that we often the president are expressed I'm On health care providers are views that their patients with obesity are lazy lacking and discipline\nNon compliant with treatment recommendations or just not motivated to lose weight announcing that their personally to blame for their weight and so I think those kinds of attitudes really underscores the fact that health care professionals are not immune to the broader negative societal attitudes that we see\nThe prevailing biases in our culture which have long been to associate obesity with things like laziness gluttony and frankly that's just falls I think that\nTends to be shared with physicians just because physicians are part of our culture so if we've got prevailing biased as they tend to affect everybody but if they are compounded in medical practice it's the frustration of\nI think what we can only call impotence the feeling like you're supposed to be able to help and you're not really very good at helping and nobody likes those kinds of in passes and eventually that frustration kind of takes over and we tend to behave badly\nIn fact Dr David ... sometimes apologizes to patients on behalf of the medical profession who's director of the Yale grew in prevention Research Center at Yale University and founder of the true health initiative\nIt's important to look around and recognize she this is affecting not just a lot of people but a massive majority of people in modern culture and not just in the U.S but around the world this has to be something bigger than individual willpower or personal responsibility those things matter but\nPandemic obesity in the modern world can't be a lot that we have no evidence to suggest that the modern generation of adults to say nothing of children has less native personal responsibility than every prior generation it's not even plausible that seven year olds are suddenly less personally responsible these days\nAnd yet we have massively higher rates of obesity in adults and children alike\nSo doctors will be used to be biased is likely to show up in one of two ways\nOne would be to ignore the issue altogether and the problem with that is that obesity really is a canary in the coal mine of chronic disease\nYou gain the weight before you become insulin resistant and develop type two diabetes you gain the weight before access at a post tissue causes systemic inflammation which contributes to the risk of heart disease cancer stroke dementia every bad thing\nSo it's an early warning indicator on patients dashboard and we want doctors reacting to it but if you're biased against it if you feel impotent to do anything about it to feel it's really the patients in business to take care of their way if you don't view it as a legitimate medical concern\nYou just don't talk about it at all and I've seen that happen many times over the years\n... says the alternative may be even worse when Dr ... monitoring finger and lectures the patients\nDon't you realize that being so heavy is bad for you you should do something about it as is\nIt were that easy and of course we don't do that with hypertension and we don't do that with coronary disease don't you realize that corner diseases bad if you just clean out your coronary arteries for crying out loud I mean we don't do that we accept that many chronic diseases\nHave major lifestyle factors affecting them is not directly responsible for them\nBut we don't blame patients for them but with obesity we tend to so when you ... finger and blame the victim you pretty much never help anybody lose weight but you do make them feel about an inch tall\nPools studies show that four men the difference in how they're treated doesn't come until they're about Seventy five pounds overweight but for women doctors will be used to be biased much sooner when they're only about Thirteen pounds overweight so millions of women know what's coming when they make an appointment\nThey know when they go to see the doctor that there are a larger fatter person they know that the doctor knows that the patient makes some assumptions in some ways that the doctor will have a bias against that the doctor knows it the patient knows it really kind of ends up making a skewed\nAwkward communication right for almost from the get go\nBust cater a psychotherapist in Saint Paul Minnesota who specializes in body image eating in weight issues including weight stigma\nSo many of my patients have really become really very phobic about having to go to the doctor because uh well I just tell you a little story a patient was working with just a while ago needed to get a new physician and actually the reason that she had for going was that she had a painful war on her foot\nAll came out of a patient patients making comments in focus groups and they really felt like the gallons that we use\nIt all came out of a patient patient's making comments in focus groups\nThat they really felt like the gallon sent me is Nathan embarrassed to have conversations with people because they felt like they were kind of the true and then they hated walking anywhere in the hospital and it's really important for them to get out and walk to start the healing process\nImproving the quality of hospital gallons could even help prevent post hospitals syndrome a condition that leaves patience unsettled and weekend after being discharged\nBeing able to have a gal that allows you to kind of feel like a person again so so important I think a great example I like to talk about\nIt was a color a gal so historically ... a pretty hideous prints one piece of feedback where some patients was right now we don't feel like we're part of the recovery process they treatment process where you don't feel like the team\nSo what will new hospital gown to look like Mullen says she asked her graduate students for IDS sort of a contest with patients that judges\nThat down that one was a gallon that wrapped around so it kind of worked like a rap dress and if those people who don't know what a rap dress does is it covers the fine\nWraps around the back and then come back around the front again and tires on the side\nAnd these students came up with this idea that a darker colors something that was a little bit less trans parent as well as a little bit thicker fabric and the wraparound design would be the best\nFor helping patients feel respected and model\nMall in science that new gown designs don't benefit just patience but the hospital staff to\nOne of the things that was really interesting about that research really was the fact that the nurses felt so much more like they were getting warm and caring and comfort [laughter] that was really surprising finding\nSo if the old school grounds are so bad why are they stuck around so long maybe just inertia change is on its way\nOne common misconception I guess that\nHospitals don't want to change and the hospital like that gal that they currently have and one thing that we've been really causing way I don't want to say surprised to\nGet a new hospitals to want to change your father products they created but the one thing that I've really been been really impressed by is how many hospitals really passionate and exciting about her down about moving forward\nAnd make a change and I think that kind of goes to show just how right industry stranded based Shannon how\nReady prepared conditions are also to make a difference\nIt's a process but like I said hospital gallons have unlimited life cycle [noise]\nI don't have that number in front of me that if memory serves about fifty five sixty five washing [laughter]\nIf you think about it hospitals over time could get rid of their older gallons and replace them with the newer gallons and they don't have to just all

part to that is that\nEveryone was there looking at some just amazing new technology and the logging industry one of the cool things about that show if you ever get a chance to attend a logging show is most of them they have a demo area so\nDuring the two days of the show they actually had to areas where they were cutting timber and they had some ... some some booms and some trucks and they were loading tampering cutting timber and portable saw mills and mobile sawmills and so everybody's there\nLooking at what type of equipment they can afford to run more efficiently and pull more temper and get more loads to saw mill and there's an irony in it because these guys are walking through the vendor area and they're walking right past our booth going out and looking at ... that's a hundred two hundred\nThree hundred four hundred thousand dollars because they want to be able to pull more timber and the reality of it is in my experience of being in this business is that they could take the equipment they have now and they they just improve their lubrication practices and reduce their downtime\nThey could run more efficiently and I think a lot of it has to do with film you and I may have touched on this before I Know Joe from Walker enterprises have\nThis is something he and I have discussed for years now is one of the things that consistently comes up as Greece has always been viewed as a consumable to pump it into a piece of equipment beer quit ... runs in a few hours later you're gonna have to go out and bought more Greece add to it so it's very difficult for people I think to mentally evaluate that and truly\nBut then run than a few hours later you're gonna have to go out and pop more grief and so it's very difficult for people I think to mentally evaluate that and truly justify putting more money into it so we can go in and we can talk to people all we can sit down and we can say look at these numbers I looked at the figures and what we're going to do is we're going to reduce aware\nAnd your equipment is going to run more efficiently you're going to get better performance it's going to run the equipments going to last longer\nBut at the end of the day is still asking someone to invest forty fifty sixty percent more and something that\nThey are going to pop into a piece of equipment they're never going to see it again\nBut there's been some interesting articles and machinery lubrication and in a number of other publications on line ... over the last Fifteen Years that have talked about how special the lubricants like what we manufacture has really shifted people's mindset from looking at grief and other oils and other lubricants as consumable and looking at them more as a commodity\nRight so you're buying something\nThat you should expect a return on you do that with the Clinton that you do that with\nYou know a number of aspect you do that with employees you know when you hire an employee and Ukraine employee you pay an employee to give you a return on that investment lubricant should be looked at the exact same way there's absolutely no reason that shit look at the same way\nBecause of how many areas that impacts and your operations

they hate that uh okay let's\nGo to a caller eight is Ralph who woke up nice in the early for us in the bay area how low Ralph how can I help you out today\nBy Jill thanks for taking my call of course what's up if\nI wanted to ask you about qualified longevity annuity contracts\nThe famous cue lack yes ma'am what's going on in your life that you're considering it well\nI'm a single man without children about to turn a sixty five and retire or for teaching\nCongratulations\nWell thank you sick or other receiving a small pension and a little bit of Social Security of saved about a hundred eight hundred and fifty thousand it'll fall through the uh some of the traditional Ira and a little bit of raw okay I don't have a vet\nAnd I was thinking says I'm probably not going to have the errors of\n... a good idea to pluck out about a thirty thousand a and plays in a Q lack\nThat supposed to begin whatever around eighty years of age ... understanding of July it pays about two thousand a month depending upon which insurance carrier you choose right and uh for the rest of my life\nAnd one of the concerns I have about being a single man without family is that you know I may make bad decisions as I got older I may need long term care ... uh I make I become senile I'm frightened of market volatility\nAnd are having a ... might be sort of a good thought for ah for me um\nSo I get older suggest so I understand that you are using the you would be using the most people look at the cue lack as a way\nTo kind of push off year requiring minimum distribution till later in your eighties\nMid air you know said to mostly it's used as a theoretical way to kind of delay receiving required minimum distribution is that what you are using it for or would you be using it to create income\n\nOkay which would you say is more important at this point\nI Would say probably I'm I'm probably to have the added income towards the end of my life okay private insurance uh-huh\n... I'm from ... to help you out an income towards the out of our life and I thought of insurance\nUh-huh I mean I might okay so I went to one of the smartest people I Know because I'm not a cue lack expert\nBut on ... it's a guy named Michael ... says he he writes a cool um he runs a website called nerds I view and it's mostly for nerdy people like him which would include me he's\nA financial advisor and he wrote very eloquently about the ... so I went to him and kind of wanted to see what was going on\nAnd she thinks that\nUm unfortunately that although it sounds good it turns out I'm going to quote him here it turns out the unique nature of the longevity annuities payment structure is not very hospitable as an ... strategy it can take until the retirees late eighties just to break even\nAnd recover principle which means the retiring risk significant foregone growth by trying to merely differ armed ... through the use of a ... so here's what I Would have to say to you about that\nI think the problem is that if you want income then it is reasonable for you to say hey I think that I Would like to add some income to my pension and my Social Security I have this traditional i._r._a. how much is in the traditional i._r._a.\n[noise] I'm a hundred and eighty thousand\nMhm and and there's eight fifty in the forest rebate and even right now the traditional i._r._a. how was it invested generally\n[noise] about ah six three for ... for for ...\nAnd you like doing this yourself are you doing this in a no load mutual fund environment okay I mean if you really are concerned about income than what I might look at is um to actually look in at a low cost annuity\nThat is just that not necessarily a cue lack and doesn't have to be you know could or could not be but I think that low cost annuities are\nHard to find okay they really are\nOn and so what I think you might want to do is to say All right where can I find a low cost annuity a or a low load 'em and I might start with vanguard I'm just to uh where are you hold it holding your accounts right now your eye or a cat right now\n[noise]\nOkay I've heard of them [laughter] and I think you should say since you're doing this I Do think that I'm a low load 'em annuity might be something that you should explore I all I Know one that is at that they have through vanguard I don't know ... offers a low load\nBut if you're seeking to create a stream of income that is going to be uninterrupted and then maybe perhaps you look at an annuity on the other hand\nIf you're really worried about sort of like what happens if I lose my mind I'm Wondering have you done your said plant look there's a really realistic I like have you done estate planning yet know about\nSo I mean look I think there there is another issue here which is\nA ... if you have nobody in your family do you have a friend who would trust a younger friend who you trust or should you just hire someone to act as a trustee on your behalf an institution\nThat could help oversee\nAny issues that arise if you take a turn for the worst and so what I'm going to tell you is actually first and foremost before you starting to look at an annuity and doing this I think you should start looking at your own estate planning\nAnd even though you may not have any air is maybe you want to leave money to charity and maybe you want to have someone to have some flexibility and and you know some ... maybe make a charity the\nThe beneficiary of your traditional i._r._a. and then if something happened to you then it goes there or maybe you want to pay an organization\nTo act as a trustee if something bad were to happen for you I think this is a story that begins with estate planning it Dan incorporates what you are a lot like what you're thinking\nAnd then you may find that if you had that person that was in your life\nFor you know again you you find a good qualified as state attorney then you don't need an annuity that and you just have somebody who's going to help administer assets this could be a really important step for you and not get involved with any insurance product at all so I think that's where I Would\nStart to think that makes sense sure All right good then\nGo off and make some money keep teaching what what do you teach by the way\nA church or ... or ...\nYou got a lot on your plate right now Mr rally sure there's a lot of government and there's history being made everyday thank you so much for calling let me know how it goes okay who wants to take ... good luck\nOn sometimes you see it's funny there we are we get to the nuts\nQuestion but only by doing a little digging it's fascinating to me it always is and uh hey estate planning we bark you missed it coming to the end of it right now but\nIt is so important it is important to distill what is the issue that is really underlying\nQuestion that's what I that's what I think is fascinating here and\nSo thank you so much to Ralph that was a great question fantastic question if you have a question like\nRalph maybe it's not a state planning maybe it's an annuity question maybe it's a plain old retirement plan question career decision send us an email ask Jill and Jill on money dot com that's ask Jill and Jill and money dot com we'll be right back [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nA good night's sleep starts with the right pillow that's where my

[noise]\nUm if you could pay this woman and you were impressed with her and you check to you know kind of looked at our credentials and you felt good about this\nWhat I Would say is I'd be interested

who deals with Morningstar investments they sold and re bought stocks\nOh boy I wound up paying thousands of my taxes\nAnd I believe I'm paying more in taxes than iron I don't hear from just the statements I Want to take my stuff elsewhere but where hundred and twenty thousand dollars in stocks I'll be sixty eight in November still working collect Social Security still have a mortgage is Seventy thousand dollars please help out OK so\nFirst and foremost I think you have to decide do you need an investment person or an advisor\n[noise] um if he just wanted to invest some place if you had a hundred and twenty thousand dollars in stocks first of all I think you don't probably have enough money that it it actually makes sense for you to be buying individual stocks\nSo then you say okay well I Want to buy low cost mutual funds index funds you could literally open up an account anywhere you want you could open up an account at vanguard or ... or a T Rowe price or TDY America trade or you can go directly to Charles Schwab\nAnd then you sell all your stuff hopefully there is no big tax event there because it sounds like you've paid taxes along the way and you buy a couple of index funds and you go to sleep at night but\nMaybe you're actually thinking about this and wondering if you should actually have\nA good relationship with someone who can give you advice and in that case there's also some more choices you can go to a an automatic investment platform and you know an online financial advisor\nA betterment is a company it's fun they sponsor my my a pod cast but you could go betterment you can go to a well front or you could go and check out vanguard has these personalized services they may want to check those out\nBut if you really think you want a person it's going to be expensive because you just don't have that much money that has invested in from their perspective I Know it's all your money in the world so I Would suggest that you start\nThe process by going to our website Jill and money dot com and\nYou can look at the questions you should ask before you hire financial advisor okay hope that helps\nUm Margaret right 'cause I donate part of my twenty Eighteen required minimum distribution from my four oh one K. plant to a charity can reduce my taxable income by the amount of that donation almost close but not all not all the way here Margaret you can't do it directly from your four one K. but\nIf you are no longer contributing to your four one K. you could roll over your four one K.\nRight you could roll over the Porsche a portion of your four one K. into an IRA roll over\nAnd then from the IRA roll over account you could do a qualified charitable deduction and what that means as you would give her some portion of money to the charity directly and that could be are required minimum distribution\nYou don't take a tax deduction for it but it literally bypasses taxation so let's say you had to take out\nYour arms deal with ten thousand dollars you took a portion of your four O. one K. you put it into\nYou roll it over from four O. one K. to an IRA then you make this cute C. D. okay and that qualified charitable distribution I said the Dutch and I meant to say distribution that cute C.
