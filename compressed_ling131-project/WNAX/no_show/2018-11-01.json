just started playing paying three times as much money for a laptop just as always stuck in my craw and I thought well one day they'll probably make a ... a laptop the same cost is everybody else but apparently their business model doesn't support that so what do they come out with was knew\nA lot of native ice and he'll be an avenue I've had the I'd had pro is a factor is actually a better

not it soon Springdale there but\nIn my book air got also got a refreshed so not major news not new products but refreshes on ah some old familiar classics\nSo they've improved all the products but nothing really that jumps right up they said there's the new retina display chair seen the retina display on some of their products and it's a very pretty screen them if you're looking at photos and things like that it's it's great if you're watching a movie it's great but but nothing really dramatically new right\nThis ... nodding major product announcement a lotta times apple like the news these sort of off cycle announcements right before the holidays to announce new things we didn't see anything that we hadn't seen before a lot of updates on existing products you mentioned the Iraq has written a display for six years and the ... pro so it's about time that the air saw that display\nAll right let's talk about Congress I mean Congress we talked about almost every day but\nAre they going to do something about Google and Facebook when it comes to data privacy and uses their job to safeguard the data or to force a private company to safeguard the data of its customers or is that the job but the company in the job of the consumer to be a you know consumers aware that there is a threat out\nThere and certainly I think it has to start with the consumer the consumer how can we ultimately responsible for knowing where their data is going\nAnd browse the Internet at all in the last couple of months you notice the results of the genie PR the general data protection regulation that from the new but it affects websites everywhere you've seen that David set these cooking is that what it says\nThat is a direct response to it and European Union union laws and the question is will our Congress enact similar laws ensuring that company\nOpt end users to collect information about them and their data privacy now I I Would argue that most listeners and really even when you and I\nDon't fully understand what that warning message means we click to get to the content we're looking at we assume that every website is going to be tracking our behavior and tracking some information about it the question is how much\nHow honest and open and transparent are they about that and they give the give us as the new regulations require\nThe ability to take our information out of there and say I no longer trust too I no longer wanting attracting my data cleans delete it and the companies then follow suit is that we have a complicated issue and it's going to say what if anything Congress can agree on\nTo propose to the American people that say hey this is how we're going to protect your data but I think even before any of that happens bars at the airport and that we take an active role in protecting our own private do you\nSuppose that any of these ... companies like Google and Facebook might say to you we understand that some of you have particular data concerns I worry about that a bit Brian because the nature of what I Do for a living and some of the crazy people that have occasionally come after me or my family\nUm but frankly that's been at a ebb tide for a while so I'm Glad for that but there were times where it was truly frightening\nSo would they ever offer somebody like me well you're going to have access to all those but you may pay a little bit more but will agree not to grab your date at all because you think\nThat is that a you know a private company would say let's do things that meet the needs are consumers some of them don't care if you're gather data other people care intensely why not why not have the private company meet that need by saying yeah you can have access but if we're not getting our data we need to pay for some other way\nGetting our data I mean it's important to point out that the reason being companies want your data is because that's where the money is Facebook can target more effective ads too if they know a little bit of pouch or in some cases but a lot about two and so here saying large you know hey I Want to pay ten bucks a month for Facebook to have a\nPrivacy or a free version of attracting favors and if you will\nGet all the content of the book but to contribute to pitch in to the kitty for example you're willing to pay a monthly subscription\nAnd I think as these rules and regulations get rolled out and people have a more in depth conversation about privacy somebody has\nTo take a look at that now that Facebook so that kind of Google's of the world could probably afford to have a few million users to opt out of tracking with no tail but if you're a small start up and that's how you're making your money based on the data and targeting advertisement\nYou may be looking for another option and frankly I Would welcome that it but the service like Facebook that I use and and they can provide a level of service may be a phone number I can call when there's a problem I'd probably be happy to pay nine ten bucks a month for something like that if the value proposition was there and I knew my data was to care\nBy the way we had a tremendous little success peace with phase I mean we've had our troubles over the years but but wait to hear this plan to do a broadcast from a University of publicly supported the college Republicans said\nCome down Lars and you'll speak to our group and you do your broadcast from here and we will up what we were celebrating the second amendment week\nI said I'd be happy to do it well the last minute the college shut it down because you know I carry a gun everyday although for me to do that is completely legal it's within the law and the university has no power to stop me well the university than threatened the students the ... they said we'll take away your funding for your college Republican club\nA will will ah sanction you use students maybe drawing you know pulled up in front of a disciplinary committee hearing all these things\nAnd in the past I never would have been able to do much to respond because like it or not when you do a broadcast you have to have permission to be on some of these you know to use a room or whatever\nThen and I plan to have you know as many kids wanted to stop buying and talk during breaks and that sort of thing well that didn't happen because the university denied the space could denied access to the Internet connections\nSo I said to my producer let's go up and we'll do Facebook Live stream from the campus and we did exactly that and do you know that thing has had so many hits it's somewhere in the I think it's four hundred thousand plus on that piece of video where I just\nStood there and the ... on the on the campus in the student union and explain what had been done how the students were threatened how they were told you cannot invite this person to campus\nAnd how they were literally threatened with disciplined as ... as individual students that you can't do that to a young man or woman who's Nineteen or twenty say you may end your college career right now because you invited somebody we don't like\nTo come to the campus and it got a tremendous response from around the whole country\nWell and and let's talk about Facebook Live and some of these other tools and you know we're talking about privacy and how we can pay for the how these companies can pay for these products haven't won from you know think about Google mail and all of the products that they released largely\nYou know we're talking about privacy and how we can pay for their hobbies company can pay for these products everyone from you know think about Google mail and all of the products that they released largely for free well they're not free because they're using your data to be able to sell advertising and Facebook Live broadcast\nWhen the only possible because you opted into allowing some of your data to be shared and advertisements to be targeted to you\nAnd the four hundred thousand people that have used that that Peter video up on our own arguably Facebook is where the audiences and for broadcasters like yourself and myself\nThat's where we need to be and it's great that they find a way to pay for those even if that is with our privacy but it comes back to that we have to be concerned about our own privacy there's no sense of waiting for Congress to decide what if anything they're gonna do take an active role taken yup\nAbsolutely Brian thank you so much for the time they got ... Brian ... happy Halloween to you as well such Brian Westbrook you find what he writes that Brian Westbrook Doug come on and tell you about zipper good of you know it's not smart job sites that overwhelm me with lots of resumes ... you know what his march zip recruiter dot com slash large unlike the other job sites\nHas gone down like a percentage points in that same Pew study over the past ten years that's a lot\nNow you are there's a lot of people who are Christians but there are that's gone down quite a bit\nOkay so the number leaving has we we now have eight percent who dropped out of Christianity\nIt was something like on the order of Seventy eight percent proclaiming themselves to be Christians and now as down around Seventy ... whereas we have now you know\nThe nuns ... the so called nuns which have atheists agnostic fears witches are probably and they're mostly uh like twenty seven percent\nEurope philosopher what what causes people to turn from conventional route religions to religions are really have to be described as on the fringe [noise]\nWell [noise] if if a religion is not going to say it is true and their religion is only going to say it as one of many and that you have options people are going to say you know what maybe this religion isn't true maybe this religion is just one of many options and they're going to naturally\nGo to some place that does say hey this is true these wiccan they're saying this is true and that Christianity is false and people are hungry for this kind of ... that are that we're not providing them frankly\nMaybe they're right in in saying that has become perhaps in some ways more uncertain world or just from that standpoint and you tell me what you think of this doctor Briggs\nIt used to be that we got the truth from three evening newscasts and radio and your local newspaper there's usually one I'm most big cities have gone for many down to one\nAnd so you you know if you saw a story and it was the same story on the evening news on the radio and in the newspaper you thought well I Know what's going on these days with the Internet\nAnd with all the multiplicity of sources which I enjoy uh because I like being able to track well you know this is one version of the story and let me read for more and see if they all match up and see where the differences are\nBut that can also lead somebody and say well I don't even know what's true I sat down and write on the Internet research to particular news story or topic\nAnd and I got six different versions and they all seem to be valid that could lead you to believe that nothing out there is certain\nDeciding that is true for a matter of news in day to day events and politics and the like but as far as religion goes here after sort of metaphysical\nCertitude there after answering these big questions and you can go and read that there's [noise] you know differences of opinion and that's always been available for religion I think most people always understood that there were [noise]\nYou know the Hindus and are Mormons and a Buddhist so all of this kind of thing so that was always there for people to explore if they wanted to and I think that this is probably at least in America to another reason people are fleeing Christianity is that it [noise]\nIt seemed it seemed to them to be more conservative you know we're sort of breaking a part of the country right now at least as far as the pain is go work by forgetting\nAnd a a a good reason that people are leaving is that the Christianity seems to say hey look we have these universal ancient [noise] truth and if you\nSandy seems to say hey look we have the universal ancient [noise] and if you want to be a Christian you need to hold some of these is becoming distasteful to a lot of people who don't want to acknowledge those troops\nWell gosh you know I'll admit I have a dog um if I 'cause I'm a Christian but Dr brings I almost get more worried that the religions that go along and get along and say\nOh you can be a Catholic and still believe in abortion you can be a Christian is still you know in other words it's it's it's like ordering at a Chinese restaurant one from column a one from column B and if you don't want anything from columns see you don't have to I mean if you're looking for ... to the church says well\nYou don't have to leave and everything we believe in to be able to be you know a Christian or a ... or you know or for a Muslim or whatever the Muslims are pretty strong or this is the way it good you go and I understand they buy for patients to\nA primarily between you know Shia and Sunni but but do you think it's the lack of of religions taking a stance and saying this is what we actually stand for and if anything\nThat's absolutely absolutely positively the largest contributing force Muslims are a lot of our increasing because of this reason I\nKnow that there are some differences as you say\nBut even those sects are increasing and not just because of a you know increased birthright\nThere's lots of conversion being made because Muslims are willing to say this is right there it is right this is wrong this is true this is false and they're in there and they're determined in those believe Dr\n...

slightly less entertaining in a city construction zone [noise]\nWelcome\nLarson said pleasure to be with you and I'm Glad to get your phone calls and your emails at eight\nSix six eight large that's eight six six four three nine five to seven seven emails go to talk of Lars Larson dot com\nI'll give you a little something from inside the radio business even on TALK radio you hear a certain amount of music we have what we call get back music which gets us back\nFrom the commercial break we have introductions that have music in them and we pay fees to use those pieces of music and the folks who create the music if we pay the fee we can use whatever music we want that's licensed by the major licensing agencies well you know that a lot of politicians use music as well\nUh you know the you know the Clintons are identified with certain songs and bronco ... certain songs well\nApparently for el Williams is not very happy that his song happy is being used by President Trump for music at his rallies and he'd like to stop him I wanted to talk to Tom cooler who's an intellectual property in technology attorney Tom welcome to the program how are you\nI'm very good Lars thanks for having me\nNow I Am glad to have you and I I can tell you that this isn't the first time this has come up in regards to politicians when you hear a rock and roll band and say it says we don't like it wasn't so and so uses our music has been going on as long as I've been in the business\nBut yes you know what what do you think about the idea that that that uh the musicians want to retain the right to say I don't want that music used with a particular politician that I find distasteful what do you make of that\nWell it's it's really interesting especially and divided political climate that we have now we're seeing more of this in fact we saw this happen with\nNeil Young who was I was a Bernie Sanders supporter and his objection to the use of locking in the free will by Trump's who actually turned around and said listen if you don't want to use it that's fine and you were happy not to do do that and you turn around and said I Wish you would have asked\nMe because even on the Sanders supporter I would've allowed you to use it very interesting take there but you're right this has happened for a while and what we're seeing is a move by the artist themselves outside of the copyright license\nTo assert what is essentially state full slight claims for federal false endorsed claims on the trademark at ... at the are trying to say that by the use of their song and their celebrity there somehow communicating some type of sponsorship\nAffiliation or in door Smith by them of the candidates that using their music and I think that tort stemming from and so uh you're seeing more and more of these things happen it has happened so while John McCain ran into problems with this of course himself a Sarah Palin did in ... and you said this herself even Obama\nRented barracuda bags actually so and he's so\nMuch time tell me this if they were to pay the fees and say we pay BMI and ask cap and there are two other majors that I Can't remember a we pay the fees will use it if we choose to you're saying that under the fold slight ah you you could actually make the case it'd be it'd be like a\nFighter no if you if somebody caught a picture of me standing next to a product and then they began to use that there might be a boat or a copyright issue but there'll be an issue of you saying\nYou're saying that I'm endorsing this and I haven't endorsed it and you and you can't do that without my permission and and that they would be able to do that even if the politician said the licensing fees\nYes there is a cold will claim and it's under a different things one is as I talked about what we kind of encompassing the right of publicity under state law in which case there's an appropriation of in this case the artist named likely\nLikeness or other value associated with it they're trance posing that to their identity with the music itself and that they can identify ... from the music itself and that there were some\nTennis that that's a achieved\nThrough the use of that by the campaign and the color will claim of the elements ... right of publicity the one that I see that it's actually a stronger\nWould be the section ... which is that ... a affiliation sponsorship for doorstep that's an unfair competition area of the trademark act that I've seen ... in case it's like\nWell see I wondered about that because you know that on my on my show I've used music group time to time as you don't use that much but we do we we have a bunch of things called benchmark so if I'm going to talk about marijuana or you know because I'm not a fan of the drug but as being legalized in various places and it causes a lot of news stories\nUh we have a you know one took over the line mixed into an introduction and and I I Would imagine that\nA chances are they wouldn't object to that but Peter Paul and Mary might object to my using puff the magic dragon which I Believe he is a song about pie in relation to songs about hideous doing stupid things on ... because that would also be a it maybe it's too small change\nTo to object to that but but isn't music use that way all the time by both disc jockeys and by talk show host to add music to some subject that may relate to it some way\nYes I mean what's happening here is this that and then we start talking about um are we using this in the context of parity which is an exception as part of the fair you stop turned into corporate law\nAre we taking that in in a different direction and if you bring up a good point with Peter Paul Mary and the use of that song and in fact if I recall correctly I'm\nBack in Ronald Reagan era\nThere was the use of Bruce Springsteen's born in the u._s._a. and it was being used as like this have you know rally nationalist and some when in fact the artist himself through Springsteen was talking about that saying you know this this really is a piece that\nCuts both ways is that a Vietnam vet coming back in and saying that it it may not be what you're actually using it for and so it's very very interesting that when we look at the music itself I think campaign should be very very careful in what they're doing it\nAnd so it's very very interesting that we look at the music itself I think campaign should be very very careful in what they're doing and how they're using it because I just noticed myself like you watch this for a number of years I'm In like twenty six year old law practice and I've seen these ramp up\nOver the last ten Fifteen Years and I think we ... if I was advised campaign I Would say\nPlay it safe reach out to these specific artist in this case full well it's not even under any of the main wants to ask at the ... he's under a new one that was formed back in two thousand Thirteen or to tell some fourteen called global or write a global music rights and that\n... ... a outfit itself covers TRACON others it's pretty clear that the campaign to not have a license to do not seek the permission for al ... use that saw well campaign should be careful but\nBut let me ask you something how much latitude you good if you say I'm going to go out as a candidate whether it's president or dog catcher and I'm going to engage in free speech are you allowed to say I'm I'm making some some use of this but it's in consequential to the sales of it in other words you're\nYou know people may here and say oh that's great song as you get a copy of literature downloaded but it's and and I guess you could you could have some negative effects from it but does the candidate who is engaging in politics which is covered by their First Amendment free assembly and the rest of that does he have any latitude to use it and just say it's fair use\nI think you've got to be careful at say that's a case by case basis let's look at some of the ones that had been used Newt Gingrich using a I at the tiger rocky strikes John McCain's use of running on anti with Jackson from Jackson Browne which in fact he actually settled that case it had to issue an apology um\nWe talked about Ronald Reagan in born in the usa a\nPoll lie and she said we're not going to take it which was a um there was some pushback like twisted sister rage against the machine or a number of cases here where it seems very clear the campaign it's using the song because it's spinning a narrow kits for the specific campaign\nRight and I think that's where you need to be careful because now I I from what I can gather\nAll the way the law sits right now although you can make the appropriate defense and trying to say we're using this as free speech ... parity um depending on its use\nThat as a defense ... most certainly will likely be blocked by a debt artist because they don't want to be seen as being affiliated with that kept guy what you're seeing more you're seeing more of that with Trump\nTom one last question why we got the time ... does the artist have to show that he's he or she is lost out on some ... I've lost sales or or that prove that there is some actual harm to bring the to bring the claims [noise]\nWell that's a great question with respect to copyright uh ... you know because where you have a registered copyright in place there is no need to prove the damages you can get statutory damages which range anywhere from Seventy five\nYou know socialism and that's what we're talking about right now and it is to steal it associates associates sociologist like I don't really know how to call them but\nThe socialist leader individuals believed\nIn a system that is just fundamentally unproven and even these\nIconic individuals Ben and Jerry they say they want to give away all the profits and then when it comes down to it they realize that\nYou know by and large it's not within our human nature we want to be successful and we want to get back\nAnd really the actions speak louder than words and nine line apparel yet nine might foundation we build houses for veterans we are creating a community called the veterans village where they take homosexuals off the street\nAnd we help educate them and get them into some sort of employment but what I asked him that you were to ask to Ben and Jerry's is why don't you put your profits\nWhere your mouth is instead of preaching of all these things talking about the things that should be done by someone else and saying that I'm going to donate some of my money\nOut there you know really we're talking about less than one percent that's a total or why not put some your actions behind it put a little bit more of that that type of the high end it doomed to others as you want like\nTo be done to you it's preached in to see the folks who face a why can't we just it here to it in the civilian practice\nI'd like to see that happen in fact I think it would have been a lot more funding a lot more all American Ben and Jerry's had come out with a [noise] I don't know some red Trump or you know paint Trump ... ice cream and and then the the the resist stop and say just picture flavor because in America we can have all the waivers ruined and then been injured\nAnd paint Trump ... ice cream and and then the the the resist stop and say\nJust pick your flavor because in America we can have all the labor's ruined and then Ben and Jerry's cells twice as much ice cream ... because they're selling your both sides I've seen\nSome other retailers sell soft drinks and cans like that and I think snapple even decided to do a red\nAnd blue version so that they're heading up to the election you could choose do you choose read or do you choose blue I thought that was much more the attitude that Americans can believe whatever they want to believe that we don't stone people to death for their belief like happens in some countries\n[noise] absolutely so one of the things that I really like to see is the fact that people look at the issues at hand it's not red state blue state it's the idea that there's\nIssues that need to be discussed ... if we can vote along the lines of the issues that we want to be addressed which is what happened this last election people are tired of seeing some of the things that we held\nHere and did our hearts deteriorate and keep all believe that the current administration was going to make true on their promises it if we can little or heart belief systems and and are you know

it's a pleasure to speak to you and Gordon guides me immediately we are eager for your thoughts about the meeting between the prime minister of Japan all day\nAnd the prime minister of India and ...\nThey are two parts of what it's called the Indo Pacific Claude India\nJapan Australia and the United states all day and and Modi both share democracies are they both have aggressive modern warships what are they what do they what are they looking to do with each other and how does how do they regard China collectively good evening to\nGood evening John Gordon and to your listeners around the world John I'm very happy Halloween to all of you um you know it's a good good point John the or the Japanese and the Indians\nShare both are common values and also a common threat perception there is a view that is very widely held in both Tokyo and in India\nAh that China's aggressive build up its military capabilities and its use of both military\nAnd economic tools as well as its diplomacy are coming at these countries expense including the region in a bit of a danger where it's possible Beijing may use coercion and ... on toward influenced to try to put these countries\nNational security at risk so you saw the prime minister of Japan visit Beijing where he and she joined paying that late last week\nThe very next day he was back in Tokyo and met with prime minister Modi at the foot of mount Fuji where he invited him to his private residence and signed a host of built in announced a number of other initiatives all designed to signal a very strong bilateral relationship between Tokyo and New Delhi\nGordon Scott you mentioned that a prime minister of Abyei hosted the Indian prime minister at his private home and at the base of mount Fuji\nUm what struck me about all this is the uh when I went to Beijing the and it just seemed a little bit stiff of the meeting city had in the Chinese capital\nBut to his relations with Modi were very warm and and this strikes me is is not just a personal relationship but as you point out\nI'm In Japan and India seeing a common interest um if you could talk a little bit about the the warmth of the relationships that has had with Modi and the significance of going forward [noise] sure\nYeah I think there's no doubt you know the the Japanese generally and the prime minister in particular do feel a a a very strong sense of shared identity as a democratic country an Asian democracy that has legitimately embraced built its own version of democracy\nOr and and that shows through and the personal relations between\nThe prime minister and his Indian counterpart but also between other Japanese officials and their Indian counterparts what's that oversell this working with India is still recognized in Japan to eat or work in progress very promising but it has been very promising for a long time so it is not always easy as you've seen\nThey have been negotiating arms sales and other types of defense cooperation\nFor quite a number of years it's not necessarily the case that this confluence of interest in ... perceptions immediate you reveal the results that one might hope\nBut there is a great sense of optimism that at least that direction is the right one and that they can build a closer relationship by contrast the Japanese recognize that China's in a very difficult place right now I Believe your previous guest just outlined some of the economic difficulties China's facing they're also of course facing a difficult relationship with\nThe American administration and the recent election in Brazil is likely to put even further pressure on Beijing search Japan recognizes that China's outreach now is almost entirely tactical it's an attempt to alleviate pressure on Beijing\nNot genuinely motivated by any change in thinking of by Beijing about the grand strategic relationship it wants to have with Japan\nAnd similarly the Japanese recognize that and say okay we'd be happy to work more closely with you on terms that we can acts\nAnd similarly the Japanese recognize that and say okay we'd be happy to work more closely with you on terms that we can accept but we're not going to wreck we're not going to believe that this represents any kind of a sea change or a permanent solution to the problems that led us to the difficult place where they were the two sides were in over the last several years\nScott were told there is a claw at the Indo Pacific region Claude India Australia Japan and the United states is that aspirational or is that actual I think it's\nA great question John you know I I Do think that this was aspirational about a dozen years ago at that time uh they're there for side there was not entirely a confluence of a belief that China posed a challenge or a threat\nToday I think that it's much more strongly recognized and held as of view and all four capitals I Will say though that uh there continues to be\nA need to build a practical meat around the bones of the quarter lateral dialogue and grouping\nOf course do do some military exchanges of exercises and in fact the recent visit by the Indian prime minister to ban has led to an upgrading in India Japan defense ties with\nMore regular eyes high level contact including a two plus two dialogue but formally been announced where the Japanese and Indian foreign and defense ministers will meet and the two sides will work more closely to invest in\nCapabilities that are dual use including a code developing um artificial intelligence robotics working more closely or in male male exchanges but to be sure there is much much work left to do and it would be premature to say that the quad has reached its full potential\nGordon Scott you know I listen to you describe the relationship between Japan and India one could say many of the same things between India and the United states it's a great relationship but it's got a long long way to go I mean do you see any parallels their show absolutely\nI mean I think that the reality with India is it is a country with enormous potential\nUh and unfortunately also enormous obstacles to realizing the full measure of that potential\nUh India continues to have a large amount of attachment to its previous or and continues to have a non aligned policy or a policy that cherishes autonomy and devoid of any kind of a formal alliance relationship with any other country\nThat is in some ways quite limited of course India also has a large number of captured or vested interests in its\nDefense industrial base as well as the broader economy that kind of complicate\nBlock or at least make difficult any sort of a deepening of really meaningful deepening of economic ties including defense industrial ties so\nDo think there are a lot of parallels I think that they have a good thing here is that the U.S and Japan is very close allies are working very closely to try to encourage the Indians to find ways to work within their system to try to put pressure\nUh from the outside a welcome pressure pressure that new tally can use to say what we want to do this with the Americans and the Japanese in order to cooperate more deeply we need to make some changes domestically\nIn the Japanese context as you know Gordon this used to be referred to end is still refer to as guy out two or use for foreign pressure that kind of pressure can help\nIndia to make forward progress I'm kind of breaking up some of the cartel like structures and it's domestic economy and opening it up so they can capture some

investments in there and for infrastructure but I think their preference would be to have the United states there a with a little bit more of a of a presence there and I don't think we need to\nMeet them on that scale I think there are ways that we can be helpful to them in terms of technology and other\nA smaller initiatives that to give them a sort of force multiplier is and I'll give you an example and Fiji um the Australian government help define day fusion center there for the ... navy where they're able to see and have a sort of real time understanding of the ships that are coming in and out of their\nTheir fishery zones and they're able to understand which which of those ships are actually registered and legal to fish there and which ones\nAren't clearly not and which ones are questionable and that allows them to\nUse the whatever forces they have in terms of patrol boats to go to the places where there might be trouble and that's a that's a modest investment that goes a long way in terms of building goodwill\nBetween ...
