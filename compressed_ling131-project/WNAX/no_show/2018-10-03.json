I went from there or whatever but then then Democrats obviously will do MSNBC CNN and so on\nBut a ... with us we we get share the most from both sides that's become a business perspective ... great point which is\nYeah wouldn't get make more money at a wider audience of bigger than that so yeah or editorial page goes left and right which is fine we we have opinions from both sides\nThat are are reporting a straight down the middle and that that's the way everybody should should do about their business but uh it's certainly an anomaly and then in the exception rather than the rule\nIt also seems odd to that in the coverage of judge Kavanaugh usually reporters are a bit skeptical about just about everything especially claims that you know you can't prove absolutely and and yet I've seen a lot of skepticism go right out the window that\nIf it's if it's Christian Ford making the allegation it must be true after all she says this was done to her thirty six years ago even though she can't remember the details whereas judge Kavanaugh\nHe's just a big heavy drinking loud who was apparently involved in a lead you to rape parties at one point that also stayed secret for the last third of the century you find that believable don't you\nI mean I I think this is one of the worst moments army has had a lot of\nBad moments political maybe I'm Talking about specifically a and ever since the present took office obviously during the two thousand six team but I Can't remember it being as bad as we're seeing it now and I always just kind of put it to this question if this was a Democratic president who nominated\nA as a loophole for third nomination for the Supreme Court\nWhen we see even the Christine forward story getting any legs whatsoever because to your point doesn't know what had happened where it happened how she got home or she's contradict yourself on a couple of occasions in terms of um too afraid to fly I Can't testify in this day and it turns out that\nYou know she flies a lot I mean a little thing that you could say well that's just a little thing big deal but\nHey I mean that goes to credibility and then the stories that we have today Lars like Brett Kavanaugh was involved in a\nBar fight a veil and Nineteen eighty five and he threw ice said somebody I mean ... for for for starters he's a genius because when you think about it the weapon destroys itself right I mean the\nBullet well and the other thing is finding kids in college who drink beer on Friday nights and sometimes get in to either ice fights or food fights is probably not that difficult is it\nTime one of them just confessed on Twitter that I started a massive food fight at Boston College\nMy uh my freshman year I wasn't going to Arizona Emerson College in Boston but I was visiting some friends that I did start one that is true and yes a later at my senior year I did pour a picture of beer\nOver another friend at a free beer festival type of thing and yet I mean this is what you do it's ... years this is all part of it but I think now the goalposts moved so much on this that\nIt seems that Democrats and and partisans in the media seemed to be making the argument that Brett Kavanaugh lied about how much he drank in college then keep that disqualifies him for the Supreme Court [noise] okay so that means that\nBeto O'Rourke who is running for the Senate in Texas against Ted Cruz Jeb who had a DUI\nAnd reportedly ... just seeing that accent or when he was Nineteen and college\nWrote a paper about the the the ... and and but acts of of women of actresses and apply that means he's disqualified and then I can go right down the list of Ninety eight percent of of the of the Senate and Congress where people will be disqualified based on the new rules\nThat are being presented it is a dangerous precedent that we're seeing here and I think that's why people are so invested bars in in Kavanaugh getting confirmed not because he's a conservative and you want to have another conservative on the court and gay in terms of ideology it's about principle that if you allow these tactics to work here\nNo sane person able ever going to public service and be you'll never ever be able to get somebody uh proved on to the Supreme Court again because you could go back and find one thing from their past and not even have a corroborated\nOr any evidence around it and that'll be enough to dismiss that person and destroy their life in the process that's why people are selling desk because they know what the stakes are here and it's scary\nI'm Talking to Joe ... who's a media columnist for the hill enjoy I thought I'd share that this was just made for you as a media columnist to get a question like this from my see CNN and you know chicken noodle news network talking to the wonderful crazy Mazie Hirono of Hawaii\nDo you feel that that is in any way disqualifying for someone to Supreme Court\nBy the way he's a visiting that cases the eyes fight [noise]\nRemarried and had the I mean there are a lot of allegations and any part of LA are about how he behaves raining down\nThis is crazy you've actually got in the media serious journalists supposedly had CNN saying does this size thing disqualify him from the Supreme Court and Mazie Hirono quote to cooperate by saying yes this is why we need the FBI to look into this\nBecause of allegations like an ice fight with Chris Dudley at a bar in Connecticut\nRight and and then when this investigation is wrapped up and it's being reported tonight the wall Street Journal that this could very easily be done by tomorrow morning this FBI investigation because again there than what you can investigate something where you don't know what time or a place where the\n... the bar the event happened or no one can corroborate it so they interviewed a couple of people and they got through that they'll present their findings to the Senate and the and of course the Democratic side will leak out those findings press I can guarantee you that\nAh but yeah and then and then uh that senator from Hawaii will then say you know obviously this was er rushed FBI investigation we use something larger scope and throwing them never be satisfied with this but this boat has to happen soon because they have an ... of the world and I call them\n... because he is like a cart Ashley and really where he has no talent at the same on TV Everywhere said something else will come out that will be completely and totally unfounded\nJust to muddy the waters more and even if Kavanaugh gets confirmed large by the way the Democrats have one here they won the dirtiest way possible but but they've painted the GOP now as anti me too and Taiwan and and it's just such a shame that that people actually believe\nAny of these allegations when you consider there is not a ... of evidence around all three of them particularly the ... the one and yet he continues airtime because no one wants to challenge him on basic facts\nThis is what makes your column well worth reading all the time\nHaving fun with this as well because it is kind of absurd it's like all the writers from Saturday Night live left SNL and you can tell and they all went to work as staffers on Capitol Hill but I've been telling them do you want your son your\nAs a very small and large uh\nDown in city in it on um by all the way down from ... ... drivers to ... to students to ordinary people in the streets and this has been going on for quite some time now and the best change in the best revolution comes when\nPeople rise up against an oppressive regime or does a fuss on the outside can only support them by saying that you know we are with you and of course as I said a\nDoes western countries European countries are still continuing to do business with Iran should also think twice about a continuing to do business with\nA country that has such a great human rights violations not because I say so because it's all been documented or an amnesty reports and buy a those people who ah watch and monitor\n... nations across them go\nClean because that's the part where he obits perhaps the heart is for a lot of us to understand and that is\nThe United states says Iran is a major state sponsor of terrorism the biggest state sponsor of terrorism on the globe and we say we should we should bring these people in the line a as members of the world community I mean I I'm not for global movement or anything like that but I\nI think that when there are potential truck to the United states and when they have this kind of record with their own people end up sponsoring terrorist acts in their own region which are potential trucks to the United states\nAh when when you know if you could disruption in that region could cause problems all over the world\nWhy are the Europeans not climbing on board that and so you're right these people are bad or they just so focused these countries that want to do business with Iran on saying well but they got bigger dollars because Obama gave as you said in the dollars and we'd like to sell them stuff\nYes and they got dollars and they go at all yeah so you know that relationship that the vetting process just relationship and the bottom of the mind when you think about this and that you also mentioned that they don't sponsor\nTerrorism just within their own country for a sponsor the Hamas and Hezbollah outside they stay fundamentalists yet a tighter feed on and that is why they're so dangerous so the money that filter down he\nWent into the coffers of the ayatollah and ... used to sponsor than the other shows abroad owned school a sponsor that it isn't so uh\nYou know I I I also have this question and just boggles the mind why are some western leaders European countries will continue to ...\nUh do do do business with them but then as I said this is a whole other ball game you know it's about money about oil it's about a lot of money\nThat comes to the real issue here and uh you know the amount of money we're talking about people found their souls for it\nSo they they put aside the idea that they are violations taking place a when these countries are part of the human rights council they go there they know that the nation steak place because it's all\nA documented in black and white but I'm a credited with the United Nations Human rights council for five years I was there and I met\nThe victims I met the dissidents and we know that these problems don't exist and so do the PIN eaters but uh you know this is how to worry the books and it's unfortunate because if it wasn't enough pressure that would be a change for\nMe because you know for instance one of the conditions of leadership or for membership in the ... you is that you drop the death penalty domestically so all the European countries while there is support for the death penalty among the population of Western European countries the countries themselves have given up on the death penalty\nAnd said we will not do it because you have to you have to not do this so the same folks who won't have the death penalty for the most heinous crimes in their own country\nTolerate doing business with a bunch of people who have far worse than that I thought he was you said beating people to death in their prisons\nAnd and the thing that or ... how do you say yes it's wrong for us to have the death penalty because we're such good moral people but it's okay for us to do business because of the cash involved with a bunch of people who will be their own and torture their own people to death that doesn't mean\nIt's making me a cognitive dissonance [laughter] well it's ironic isn't it and you know here\nIs that what went on strike that it is but you know when is the need to look Lyndon the women's march in terms of the aisle seat on twenty twenty Eighteen I stayed and cultured and it's I mean\nAgain it just boggles the mind that look at the ... and

this is going to extend to ladies as well imagine how easy it would be to make the accusation\nThat you were you know in some way groped by another woman or man by another man\nThese days just about any of that as possible but Julie sweat Nick had told the story to the media hoping to be accuser number three and the lynchpin to getting rid of the cabinet nomination once and for all thankfully both cabinet and the president had the backbone to stand up and say this isn't true\nAnd another chance for scattered rain showers in the late afternoon as we cool off in the mid fifties and then heading into Sunday we continue to expect scattered rain chairs likely throughout most of the day otherwise we could see these guys with highs and the mid fifties again I'm meteorologist Jeff ... on radio five Seventy W any acts right now it's fifty seven\n... why they're joining us from Nebraska game in parks commission time now for another Nebraska outdoor update so what to do this time of year in Nebraska is outdoors plenty there are lots of state park activities in advance\nThere are many different hunting seasons don't forget about the upland slam and there are tons of stock paying size rainbow trout to be caught by you and your kids your grand kids go to outdoor Tabasco dot org for more details see out there I'm rag Wagner\nFive Seventy ... than a the radio stations your grandparents parents and you grew\nListening to the big friend of yours big family five Seventy ... than a dog\nGlad to be what he wanted to take your calls do you want to jump into the best conversation and talk journalism it's eight six six eight lawyers that same six six four three nine five to seven seven\nEmails go to talk at Lars Larson doggone well the economy is booming America is producing energy like it never has been for and I thought it might be a good to talk to de Carter was president of the Carter financial group and the author a bitch now or never how to enjoy your life and not let your investments\nDo you welcome to the program\n[noise] thank you very much a large I really appreciate being on where you it's not\nSo when people talk about oil and about energy and about ways to make sure that they have the money they need when they hit retirement age is that a good place for people to be a parking their money\nFor their rate should be or is it really depends on the company and what they're trying to accomplish there are a lot of smaller oil companies that are doing very very well at West Texas ... especially as if you're probably aware of the west Texas a\nCrew is probably the number one all in the world right now maybe the ... might be right up there close to it but there's a lot of small companies that are that if I Would say good investment opportunities I'm not so big on the larger companies because you really can't control what they do but if you're investing some of the smaller companies by the way you can buy stock in those things to really\nYou can almost into what you're doing and what's your investment is doing right now\nSo in other words if you buy an Exxon BP or one of the larger majors you just going to be one more little fish in that big pond but if they're buying stock in a small company did that with ... and the ground because an awful lot of the actual wells are not drilled by the big guys are built drove by the little guys right\nThat's exactly correct to eat the small drilling companies are are are\nListening themselves out to the larger companies\nAnd the large companies really don't care about the little guy I always tell my clients so they'll come in and say you know Warren Buffett's great investor I say no Warren Buffett's a great buyer\nBecause he can afford to buy into the axons and he can control what he does because they combine that stock to make their control but the little guy can't do that like most of my clients are not the kind of investors obviously but what I tell them is supposed to take a look at the small guys take a look at what they're doing right now we've got oil contracts drilling contract for some of these small\nCompanies that go out three and four years in the future because of the time of all and the oil is being found you know we're now that number one oil producer in the world is you're aware of the United states damned upgrade percentage of that\nIs coming out of West Texas out of the Permian Basin\nNow here's the question you wrote a book called how to enjoy your life and not let your investment zone you find a lot of that people want their investments wind up controlling who and what they are\n... people come into office almost every day and they're concerned about not only were they put their money but what it's doing for them and they're having to watch that on a regular basis in fact are losing sleep over it\nBecause they're reading what the big guys say in what the stock market's doing and what some of the pundits\nAre saying stop and Stein just came out with an article in the ... just a couple of days ago talking about three things that you gotta watch out there's going to be a bus coming up those kinda things will panic the average guy and what they end up doing is letting their investments on them they are afraid to get in\nAnd then then when they get in their right to get out so the reason I wrote the book for those people that stay there are other ways to look for things there's ways to invest for income as opposed to growth and a lot of my clients are of age\nThey're really not so concerned about making that money they made it already now they want to make sure they tape it and they have it on they get ready to retire and for as long as they live\nHow do you go about doing that without losing it all because I I I get worried when I see people parking all of their investments in one place one small area and and that sounds like a bit of what your suggestion when you say you can own stock\nIn a small oil driller to actually be in control so that means you may have a lot of your your net worth parked in that one little company run\nAs a matter of fact I don't do that I tell them up so I said you do not want to put it all in one place what you want to do is still diversify but you want to go to the evaluation are having someone steps are professional that is involved with this thing on the day to day basis that will do the evaluations for you or someone that you can trust\nIn fact if you'll notice and there are a large I've got a paycheck estates two hundred and two I quoted there's so many times that actually gives you ten questions you should ask your advisor and one of those questions is\nIf I put my money into places that will provide income as opposed to growth and still get a good return can you provide me that kind of investments as well and obviously what she tried to do is give the client the best possible return they can get some of it and drove some of it in income\nBut as they get older as you're quite aware as they get older they should really be a little bit more conservative what they're doing and that's what we try to do here in West Texas we don't let them go and ask to all companies we think it's a bit opportunity for some of them but not for everyone\nBecause her an awful lot of people who have good retirement age or they're getting close to it or they're already in it\nThey're not too concerned with buying stock and then holding it for Twenty years I mean to be honest some of them may not be around in Twenty years they're already of a certain age so would they want is something that will make crude producers is solid stream so they can pay their bills and enjoy life\n[noise] ... actually when I wrote the book\nAnd why is it that you're not let your investments on you I won't be my clients to enjoy what they're doing without having to worry about it I Want them to be able to go to bed at night and sleep well not worrying about the fact that the market could come down tomorrow and it very well could fit on the situation as you are very well aware and I listen to your program a number of times that really appreciate\nThe advice that you gave an some others that have been on the show\nThat the market is it strange it goes up it goes down and we've been up now for a long time\nThings could get kinky around here so I tell people all the time you really need to watch where you're going it's especially if you're getting close to that age where you're going to be Seventy five after that area you and I live on that if the market goes down and look for another ten years and then what do you do your income is gone you might have to go back for it can be a greeter at Wal Mart if you're not careful\nYeah well I think all of it was worried about that but let me ask you this do you worry about those folks who politically seem to hate oil with a passion to you I I think it's a great fuel and no it is because\nI Am so much punch it there's a reason that a twenty gallon gas tank all will push you you know several hundred miles down the road\nAnd that they haven't been able to come up with something that is really the electric alternative\nOr even the natural gas alternative so I think the fuel is going to be around a long time unless you got a bunch of the political types like Hillary would promise to shut down every kind of fossil fuel that you could turn the off switch to scan\nAnd and I'm worried about that\nWe we were concerned about it from the standpoint of the politicians they tried to get on the other side but they're also going to lose their jobs are going to lose a whole lot of the things that killed him does that not\nAll based on the automobile I mean there are so many things you have to call your product produce that electric cars can do and that and the windmills out here you know we've got a window you can drive in El Paso Texas Texas\n... drive across the state and I promise you ... you will always be one of these giant windmills ruining the area a seriously all the way and also all the way across Texas nine hundred miles you're stuck with when males\nThey produce two percent\nTwo percent of the some of them are needed to protect it to the grid\nThey're just popped up their heads will going around in circles and making nothing or if we we just laugh about that and ... as we know what the basis for the economy is we know what it will do and if they want to have the oil companies that's one thing but they didn't use a lot of oil based products out there if they if we didn't have the company is\nIs there may not run but they couldn't button their shirt either their parents as far as that's concerned because everything's might have oil\nI'm Talking to the Carter who's the author most recently of it now or never around\nOh you live and not let your investments on you you do you I don't know whether you're ... you're probably do agree with me based on what you said but\nYou know there are those windmills irritate me because I Know that Texas has its own little interesting scheme on electricity where I Can't really be sold out of the state\nAnd so there are literally been times where people have sold electricity for less than than zero where they've actually pale absolutely because and if people say why would you sell something for lessons are on the answer is because the tax incentives the subsidies are attached to it to make it worth selling for\nTwo dollars a a megawatt less than one what is what does it mean to a negative two dollars that is you'll pay somebody to take it off their hands\nOr check out the Iran is now or never the it's a pleasure to have you on the program we'll have you back some time [noise] hey Lars I look forward to reach out to be with you that I that is Dee Carter his book is now or never coming up in a moment Canada has now agreed\nThey they boosted that bubbling out to a great but it's forty dollars and so that's twice as large so that's that's a that's a good they know that chapter on currency\nCountries are supposed to leave their countries Canada and Mexico weren't doing it [noise] but that say hey marker for agreements with other countries that that would be a sausage they try and if we ever had and agreement with them but other factors as well so there there's a lot of you know these are what I Would call\nA quite a quite good and positive steps\nAre going to go to the negative\nWell before we get to the negatives I Want to know you mentioned China and I want to know whether or not this is going to have a side benefit of sending a message to China\nThat when we come to do business with them and renegotiate our deals with China because they're not involved in this that that they will get a message of how the United states wants to do business is that going to have the desired result\n[noise] well it certainly is carries that signal you're absolutely right I mean I carried a very strong signal and whether China without changing its economic model\nAt least in some respects to become more of a market oriented model that remains to be seen but to signal could not clear\nShow yes I agree with the top of your your questioner no doubt that it was what to say to China but the rest of the world for example talks with the Philippines are going on and some African countries and so forth\nWill they take it seriously\nDoubt China is the big question mark ... predicts you know better than yours or the Chinese economy is slowing down partly because of the trade friction [noise] ah but\nAh other countries for sure they will take it very seriously say see the Catholic miss new agreement and I know it's\nYou know it's a very long it's a thousand pages a lot of tax to sort of details but this is now the template for any trade agreement that the Trump Administration to try and do it [noise]\nAny other country and John McCain key provision\nBlair and they they know that they want to go vote they will recognize Adam so that's part of Japan were wearing talked with Japan which of them just pick on\nFull professor now let's go to the negative what's the downside to us into your\nOkay there's no uh it says I Want to emphasize these are my in my ... my mind that trick bigger negative and positive but they're very small compared to the fears before\nThe agreement was you know put it on Sunday night [noise] firstly I'm not a fan of managed Craig ... is that if you like managed trade you liked disagreement show their big\nBig heaps of managed trade and the automotive sector which don't have any impact now but the agreement is meant to go for sixteen years with a six year review and in that period of time they may very well\nRun up against the Islamic that's also in a textiles and apparently there's more of a managed trade and flavor show\nThat will try and go like yours yet um government put kill them and between us and Canada\nThere is no longer open to the companies or the other countries by this agreement might be open up a lot but they're they're not committed to kind of like competition for government for Germans to either get because their quality a lower price [noise] have you\nBack or not a fan of managed trade either although I certainly understand why the concerns that are there that when you say we're going to let automobiles come in from places in North America Mexico and Canada ah\nWe want to control the amount of content to knowing that sort of thing I understand the concerns people have because if you said what's the cheapest place on earth to make automobiles it probably wouldn't be the high tax and regulation and part of the United states before you even get the labor cost [noise]\nYou you might be like that's the way I look at the state of low cost shoveling all a lot of biblical large trucks pick up trucks\nCandy and he or she should yeah you know small automobiles I Would agree with you there are smaller called that closed but he he really calls debated change to these\nQuite ingenious elaborate supply change what's going to cause to love the early ... place to go to college\nSo it's

lead to jail time in some cases could lead in this case to the end of an entire man's career that he has spent more than forty years building\nI think that you should take her accusation seriously but

TV networks seem to be ignoring some of the best evidence out there that is coming in from folks and I thought I'd get ... draining on who's ... senior news analyst for the media Research Center ... glad to have you back on the program\nGlad to be back with you on the on\nSo tell me about this there is one big piece of evidence in a letter that was written by the former boyfriend\nOf ah Christine Ford or the the big TV networks seem to be ignoring to some extent tell us about that\nYeah basically a Fox News or got a copy of this letter or that or an ex boyfriend of of course in for a sense of the Senate Judiciary committee and it was basically him telling them listen you know when I was dating her for her for six years\nShe told me specifically things so that contradict what she said in her testimony up the Senate Judiciary\nCommittee hearing a namely that you know she was asked specifically by the prosecutor Rachel Mitchell did you have you ever advised anyone on how to take a polygraph test or anything like that and\nOf course ... said now but her ex boyfriend in this letter says no actually she told me in detail about actually advising people\nOn how to do a polygraph test on what it entails and how to prepare for it and you know the whole process so that seems like a you know glaring contradiction with what she testified under oath about\nYeah she does trying to do if you lie under circumstance like that it's perjury even though it was before Congress and not before a court and this wasn't just a man who dated her some of that six years they lived together so they were in\nClose proximity and they were they were at that level of a relationship he actually said in one of the cases I witnessed Dr Ford\nHeld Monica McLean her best friend at the time to prepare for a potential polygraph exam she explained in detail what to expect how they work\nAnd help McLean become familiar and less nervous about the exam\nThat's a significant answer because she directly contradicted than are sworn testimony and yet how much time or the networks spending on that any at all\nWell ABC and CBS or completely ignored it this morning on their morning shows and uh NBC it was mentioned by Megan Kelly\nWho I have to get bank credit she has been the only people on the block that were actually trying to be a journalist about this story and cover all the facts are coming in so she covered it the today show did not cover it so from seven AM tonight I Am\nYou could not find the story on NBC at nine am\nYou know once every body is at work no longer at home watching the show then that's when finally night and Kelly brought this this story to light on on NBC or ... you know a minute or so and that was it so yeah they have not touched the story really and they're not very interested in the\nTile or I'm Talking to college running from the media research on the other issue because and I want people to understand why I think this is so significant and that is\nIf you have a case that is entirely he said she said in other words there aren't any other witnesses there's no physical evidence of the crime of this solved that she says Brett Kavanaugh committed against or thirty six years ago\nSo you have to either trust her testimony or trust his testimony is being accurate so it's very important to evaluate whether somebody is trustworthy and whether or not they tell the truth\nUm she also had testified in was questioned about\nThe after effects of this terrible you know incident that happened and she described the Jews claustrophobic that her new how she insisted it had to have\nTo separate front doors instead of one and that she was so you know frightened of of or claustrophobic that she couldn't fly who for the most part could not fly on airplanes except in extreme occasions or this letter from the boyfriend a contradicts that doesn't it\n[laughter] yeah I Know basically it's it's ... yeah she said that the second front door was right as a result of you know the ... late into the sensitive but\nIt turns out well not all of that separate front door was so you know she could see clients you know have have been doing a separate entrance uh when she would you know seek lines out of the whole I mean she's a psychologist so it like that was the\nIt was already practical\nProfessional reason that really\nReasoning that she gave an are testable\nRight and she also also the ... the question about flying on a new that early on it was established that while she said she almost was incapable of flying that she actually gone on vacation flight tour she flew to\nFrench Polynesia she flew to Costa Rica and the boyfriend describes that they took frequent flying trips together even including one on a small propeller plane that apparently she was able to do that but she was telling the Senate Judiciary committee\nThat she might have to drive from California to Washington DC because she was so frightened of flying on airplanes\nNow and I mean yeah that was one of those things that was even for a fact checked in real time by Rachel Mitchell who\nPointed out well you you have flown on other occasions we we know you have so why you know why the wire you suddenly afraid to fly and you know in this situation so yeah I mean there's\nThe media has been so obsessed with trying to every single word or phrase that Brett Kavanaugh use meanwhile there's glaring\nChristine for you know has made here in in her testimony according to this is a ... exploits or as you know they should be examining that just as surely scrutinizing that just as much as their scrutinizing everything brick cat on a lot to say\nYou know I saw a new twist and I call you'll have to be watching for you know that the FBI's review or their further background check I think is the way they're describing it was delivered to the White House so short time ago today they expected a copy of it will be sent over to Capitol Hill here shortly but then I just saw Richard Blumenthal the man who himself\nYou know the senator Who Lied about his service in Vietnam he had said that he served in Vietnam during the war he did not in fact serve in Vietnam during the war he lied about his service he's now on suggesting that he's read the other six background checks there were ... done on judge Kavanaugh\nAnd that they're full of other reasons to question whether or not they should vote on this\nDo you think Mitch McConnell is going to get to a vote this week and do you think this justice is going to be confirmed\n[noise] [laughter] well yeah I think it's there is always a new twist and turn every every day with the story that made that's it you never know what what what they're going to come up with next but a\nReally everyone's watching you know of course Collins Murkowski flake there the the undecided vote see are so I mean you know Richard Blumenthal and the rest of the Democrats are already said hey we are not alone in the sky and allowed a lot\nSo ah you know they're not really a ... the votes that matter here so uh you know we will see I mean according to people like Jeff Flake they kind of just they want to see ... or ... assuming they are comfortable with it they they seem like they\nAlong those transgender students to use the bathroom of their choice led to the sexual assault of a five year old girl the investigation is happening in Decatur, Georgia which opened last month signals a major development in the education secretaries policies on transgender bathroom access that seat of Oz\nHas handled things differently than the previous administration the complaint alleges that the girl was assaulted in the girl's bathroom at ... elementary school by a boy who is identified as and this is where these things get even stranger he's identified as gender fluid\nWhich means they could be male he could be female he may decide from time to time that he's a boy and he may decide from time to time that he's a girl\nThe complaint was filed in may with the help of the alliance defending freedom which is a conservative group that is filed many lawsuits challenging school district transgender bathroom policies nationwide\nAnd I would tell you that over the last two years probably the suspect the subject\nThat has generated the greatest number of emails the greatest number of tweets the greatest number of Facebook post directed to me has been about this subject\nBecause so many parents out there look at the policies and they say you are creating a situation that is at best uncomfortable for my daughter or son at worst it puts them at physical risk of harm\nUnderstand what's happening target the big retail store got all kinds of heat and probably deservedly so because they said we're going to honor transgender policies and our bathrooms in other words a\nMan who dresses as a woman and calls himself a woman and says he identifies as a woman is free to use the ladies' room and the target stores as I said at best that situation if everyone behaves themselves is at best uncomfortable for some people\nBecause you could imagine when a mother is going shopping at target takes her little daughter into the ladies' room and see someone who is clearly not a lady is a man and is using the restroom that's going to be an uncomfortable situation\nAt worst it may provide an opportunity for people who are up to no good to use that kind of access to sexually access or to molest or at at the very least to harass little girls and that's wrong\nNow from the email files today by the way the email address is talk of Lars Larson dot com pat pond says Lars turnabout fair play is there any way the Democrats can be investigated with the same gusto\nThat they're having judge Kavanaugh investigated I bet it would change their tune real quick there is plenty that they are being investigated for right now including Dianne Feinstein I think totally illegitimate decision to hold back information from that Senate Judiciary committee for months\nThe last minute that was the accusation by Christian Ford against Brett Kavanaugh\nDianne Feinstein knew about it she kept it close to the vest she agreed that she was going to allow this to be an anonymous accusation against Brett Kavanaugh which flies in the face of almost everything we know about how we do things in this society\nYou
