check it out at any time\nOn the live stream so yeah I mean we're we're we're getting ready for a big election\nAnd the president's out during the campaign trail and he's going to take a name for a lot of Republicans that are in tight races and it's starting to look more and more like the Senate not only won't go to the Democrats but it looks like it's probably going to gain some Republicans\nCould be as many as three or four and then you'd have a majority of fifty four fifty five Republicans would be great to have sixty but you've got a super majority you didn't get really get some some things done that house however still up for grabs and it's interesting\nBecause um it was a an alleged blue wave not very long ago\nAnd then all of a sudden something funny happened on the way to the election\nThings started changing\nPeople started saying I'm I'm not so sure\n... and here's why and we could break it down very simply\nThe left in this country\nReally shot itself in the foot when it comes to Kavanaugh that's what happened\nThey really did have momentum\nDon't no reason why they have momentum was simple they were saying stuff like we just have to be together we have to be diverse in diversity is our strength and we weren't built on immigrants and we we're a country that's accepting that open arms and loving it it's a big tent and there's a big meaty with with uh you know orange hair or something\nIn the White House and he's just a mean guy who who grabs the women in the says the things and he's just a big ... stupid face who who doesn't have the the temperament to be the president than the twenty Fifth Amendment that impeachment is the right way to go\nIn and they were saying these things that people were buying into\nWell yeah I Want peace and harmony own understanding diversity I Want to make a big tent where everybody's welcome and we love immigrants and so on that was working\nAnd then came cabinet\nAnd the left showed who were really was\nYou had Spartacus grow up because\nYou had Dianne Feinstein sitting on a letter that she had that somebody alleged sexual impropriety\nThere Coons just as outraged at all times as it was not going his way you've got Richard Blumenthal who's a liar about his service claiming that he went to Vietnam when he never did you ever got Kamala Harris who brings you gonna run for president when I don't know that I've ever seen somebody more negative a nasty toward her political follows\nYou may recall Bashar who thinks they're drinking beer at six am he was cool you had acted like it was bad bad Brett Kavanaugh had to be back in in college so\nYou have the left was interrupting that was rude that was outlandish that was out of line bad\nActually used as a pawn lousy forward or when she she has to be anonymous and not be out there in the public lied to her or her legal team did\nWho by the way it was suggested by Feinstein\nLied to her about whether they will come out interviewer in California\nI mean the entire thing really showed little left is so they can stay together there so we want to work across the like we got this idiot Robert Francis O'Rourke running for Senate in Texas goes by that for some reason he calls himself ...\nHe's not Hispanic but all of his bumper stickers just say ... to go and all of a size just they'd be geo\nHe wants us to believe that his name is Beto O'Rourke is Robert Francis do work for the fourth generation Irish American nothing wrong with that just don't pretend you're somebody or not\nHe's the guy that was it a punk rock band and word dress\nHe was arrested for for DUI DWI in the late nineties the guy who reported him because there was an accident says he tried to flee the scene\nThe police report says he tried to flee the scene\nHe said things like I'm open to the idea of abolishing eyes he said things like we basically stole half of\nMexico from them which is patently untrue\nSaid things like he would definitely want to impeach the president of the United states should he get in he's an open borders guy he believes in open borders doesn't want a border wall yet when you see these commercials or here's commercials he's saying things like our diversity use our strength and we need to be together and work together for better Texas\nWell that crap doesn't work anymore because people with America actually watch what you people did\nDisgusting or you would from probably winning the Senate till you're going to lose it now\nProvided people actually go out and vote and vote and and a guaranteed when in the house doesn't look so likely to be more\nAnd the reason for that it was people understand better right now under this president of the lower taxes we've got more jobs and we've had ever\nGot black and Hispanic unemployment through the roof women unemployment ...\nYou've got manufacturing coming back our standing in the world is much better for the terrorists are working because we're getting better deals with Mexico and with Canada would be you [noise]\nThings are shifting\nThe leftover plate at ten [noise]\nAnd that's what we're seeing now have to pretend like the president does or doesn't like us granted loves Robert ... which is just dumb when we come back\nDue to hear from Sarah ... with former governor of Alaska right here\nOn the weekend don't touch that ah\nThe weekend when your town\nAre you considering a safe to secure your valuables or firearms let's face it sinks or not very attractive they usually end up getting stuck in the garage or in a closet wouldn't it be great if there was a state that had to look a beautiful antique so you could display it in your living space as an air a little while also having easy access to it while there is check out the rhino\nShare what her action was was essentially bolstering the Ninth Circuit had she had her her way and that's the night circuits out of a San Francisco right he\nTalked about in justice and justice being delayed for Alaskan because that court sixteen million people they are to quote unquote served it's the largest by far\nUm the second largest as the eleventh and they are only thirty thirty five million right so there is such a backlog of cases and not even talking about the ideology behind that very very ... very liberal Korea is just a practical reasons why we don't want to give them any more power anymore say over Alaska so\nFor at least be messing around with that uh that was that very very dangerous and the other thing is that\nTrump President Trump saw the lights and is allowing an ally in decades of the nation understanding what Anwar has\nIn terms of resources to help our country become more energy independent that inherently between energy and security energy and prosperity staffed Anwar that's our oil and gas development here in Texas and elsewhere\nThat Lisa would put that in jeopardy and\nGave that to her she gave that to hurt you Alaskans but it went through her and poor I mean that was a\nReal nice thank you Trump or ... ...\n... it just it just doesn't make any sense of Sarah Palin of course you know survey one I'm a I got to jump on that we're relying on people in the middle East that don't necessarily like us\nTo want to go and get it from what some of the geologists have said it's two hundred years where the world there in in ... why wouldn't we going to become self reliant and turn this big it off to these bad guys and and by\nThe way we used to Murkowski voted no I Want everybody watching and listening especially those of you in the last year she voted no on Kavanaugh officially it's in a prison vote because later\nShe changed for dangerous going back to his daughter's wedding so she said I'm just going to vote president disorder counterbalance what his vote would have been what she on the record in the first round said no\nLiteral absolutely so that that typical political ... that's a typical politician wanting to kind of play both sides truly had a problem with Kavanaugh being on the bench and she said he's not the right man for the bench then she her boat then at the final vote what a reflected that instead of saying oh well\nDo this because it's not really count anyway if you really believe something if you have that come with pointing due north knowing what the right thing is to do then you fight for that but instead very wishy washy and she learned you know in\nAre getting hit on both sides and\nJeffrey Rosen deserve building a former vice presidential nominee for the Republican Party to vote and also the former governor's race state of Alaska in just a great person\nAnd I love the we're having this conversation or you're going to take a wrong because your tweet might have been the best we have ever seen this entire year it was a Lisa Murkowski I can see twenty twenty two from my house talk right is that going to happen\nYou know the only thing that keeping me from just being close to the wall enthusiastic about the idea is it twenty twenty two so far away does that yeah I mean that's almost frustrating looking\nReaching the people stand up make a difference the gifts and talented opportunities God created for you and\nThe different well you know I Can't just keep preaching it and not jumping in also hopes at some point one of the position I Would so desire serving of this country and we'll see where that goes before forget you're sure what we're talking about the second amendment on which\nJudge Kavanaugh is he's he's absolutely constitution right now the second amendment\nLisa heating Leigh voted for President Obama's tax on different judicial positions including how to get there on the DC circuit she pro abortion totally anti gun anti commonsense constitutional is is she and we had no problem at all\nSo she can choose to um exercise back to vote 'em up and down it was always up\nFor Obama's picks but wouldn't give that same we're back to and I think consideration for a good man like cabinets\nAnother problem that leads to has and the Trump path is that Lee had many never Trump burst around her neck approach and um she hired a lot of never Trump worse\nThan has hired a lot of never Trump worse and some of these folks you know we keep warning him about he can't win them over there going to continue to undermine and that's quite unfortunate for the ... movement\nThe water lives were given are under her name is just to get the votes in Alaska hoping that people won't pay attention to the record what you just are just now in the past minute we're told me I can never vote for\nYeah job and that is why yeah that are by the name I mean not that it's the consummate right oh\nAbsolutely right a surveillance the vice presidential nominee and also the former governor retreat Alaska there in the moment I have left I I wouldn't be remiss if I didn't go back to how you and your family were treated by the media when you were announced it and I imagine some days and my wife\nThough really great also told my family I Do succeed or doing something I could imagine when you're told John McCain wants you to be the vice presidential nominee almost like Brett Kavanaugh being told\nDonald Trump want you to be ... record it's gotta be jubilation it's got to be unbelievable Julian and high fives and belly bumps and and much left\nAnd then all of a sudden the media says wanting to get her mission and dozens and dozens of people to find anything they possibly can on using committed with Kevin Oh can you relate to what are you must have gone through in the past month I'm guessing you down\nBelow and you're right um you know the Obama administration and the media they sent that dozens and dozens and dozens it was right here where\nI'm standing right now in my yard but early in the yard to find anything but um yeah I could relate the thing that I disagree with judge Kavanaugh on is a proclamation that it has devastated or destroyed the family\nNo it doesn't destroy your family your circle the wagons it it actually um it can be used as he can get out there all that that um the marking that lies told about you know\nAnd really use it at empathy for other people who go through a bunch of crap in this world because everybody does um use that to\nPower you to get out there and do the right thing and fight really really hard for the underdog fight really hard for those who don't have that platform that microphone to speak up for justice\nThat age they're apparently a little less cost you to thank you so much for doing this or just have to know as you see the left becoming even more on ... when you hit the\nNational spotlight it was ten years ago now I'm ... and it was on his show ready but now it's ridiculous you know when people literally scratching the Supreme Court door as if they get in and stopping for being sworn in they've gone completely nutty\nHow do you counter balance that and how do we get the voices 'cause I think the majority of America or like that how do we get the voices of a normal people among us\nTo to rise to the top again or is that is that a really hard because the media\nDo show enjoying the ratings are getting from showing these idiots\nWell yeah I mean there's a triple threat against us that the media the opposing party and then rhinos within our own party letting this happen like that so\nUh you know three against one but no we are already made manifest I think our need for a change in this that and um the corruption in the lack of accountability in twenty sixteen when what\nGenerally how bad the man as a person but that Trump movement where the people stood up and said enough is enough quote gotta go will make a difference but it's funny a couple of my girlfriends and I were checked team the last couple of days during the the cabinet discussions going\nOn in our little group of girlfriends out there that we would like these radical [laughter]\nYou know we're getting I haven't gone how do they think\nThat's a fact of more become unhinged I I think the more that I'm reasonable rational Americans which is the majority we say not enough is enough of that and we're going to get in there we're going to put government back on our side get it off our back we're going to follow the constitution constitution all about\nLimiting government so we can govern ourselves and I know I think people like you who have the guts to be out there every day in the arena make it a different where you guys so keep it\nSo we're going to do that is there a ... million along with millions of other Americans I voted for your two thousand eight I'd vote for your heartbeat again I really appreciate your reaching out thanks for taking the

university offers over one hundred and fifty highly rain degree programs one hundred percent on line\nYes it is it's um the among roe Institute which by the way I'm calling from\nHow great it is urging him only\nTwenty four people can attend it's a world renowned as being the center for the exploration of consciousness but in my workshop I'm\nGenerally what I Do each person is in a check unit or Bob Monroe had a real thing for ah these Akron ... and um when that controlled holistic\nEnvironmental chamber in other words each person's in and personal isolation booth and I speak to them we're doing a technique through headphones so everybody's in their own isolation chamber\nAnd then I present Emmy sank which is a ... a ... a brain synchronization kinds of technology plus guided meditation and we do five of these uh day typically\nAnd more with the idea here is to guide each person to go into a nice deep meditative state\nAnd every person listening in their own isolation chamber through the headphones\nNelly hit like a cubicle or a ... and and the client or I Know it's\nA it's a it's a cubicle each person has their own\nBut well that's the size of like a single bad okay and you can it's you can close it off completely you can block out um it's the whole idea is to create an isolation chamber\nWhy is that because you can go deeper with no or external stimulus factions like\nI'm In many ways the same concept behind um the flu chambers exempt in this case you're not floating you're you're in this this controlled unit and all the sound is piped into the room of we use special technologies like him he sank\nHands headphones on\nYes everybody wears headphones and I talk to them and their control unit and I guide them through these series of exercises\nSo they don't feel a loner isolated right\nNo that's the idea you are isolated and they don't feel alone because you have headphones on you know they\nThey're listening through headphones and eating exercise minor typically about a Fifteen minutes long each one\nAnd and people go on these incredible journey and your friend who see this several times on wet when he had anything to volunteer Ellen de ... tiny ... data hate\nYes the idea is to get them as deep as possible um and the U.S said is of course are ideal for many people but the idea is of course to put yourself\nBy Nora will be technologies been around for a long time that it helps us to go deeper faster that's a concept\nOkay All right and then where do you go on this journey where would you and I know that anything pattern that you can't people silly it's kind of a funny line right\nWell there's a yeah so the relaxation I use sometimes what would be considered to be light hypnosis\nUm there's different progression center used but it's basically a meditative type of program that guided often guided where you would just go along with a program\nAnd um and have your own experience everybody has different experiences during even my program I'm teaching people how to self initiate\nTheir own out of body experience but in my class for instance people have pets fly for aggressions\nMhm they have contact with all kinds of such as say a non physical being different\nKinds everybody has their own type of experience when we open up to her inner self people experience different kinds of ah let's just say ... opening a mind opening expansive experiences mhm so it's not limited to just out of body experiences\nA for instance past life or ... or regression type flashes are quite common\nAnd there's the whole idea is to open up to this inner party yourself for the answers are where you can begin to explore your true self\nIn to open up to that awakened to that multi dimensional self within you\nLike to question could you ask yourself and then you write them down when you come out of this like write it down right away\nYes what I always suggest is that right after the exercise you everybody receipt gets a journal or they bring a journal and you immediately after the exercise you begin to journal\nWhatever in whatever kind of information may have come to you or imagery because information can be\nTransmitted many different ways\nIt's not necessarily all the boy can be imagery or through a just a um memory download or all kinds of ways so it's it's important to be open to the way that you receive information\nBut uh people have all kinds of profound experiences\nAnd they awakened to\nTheir their true self and the answer is within them\nMhm yeah so the implications there are some growth in the initial awakening that are happening in the can really be transformational and I like it because you find your house and then and then in a way you're\nExpanding you William have died in the direction that\nI Would have my own personal experience now my friend mine and I think it's been a guest on the show as she said that she has in the past encountered those that need help and I think that's fascinating council to\nCure a we actually have an entire class devoted to that where people meet and guide those people that just mean need assistance\nOr that's but that will happen in um\nIn all the classes that can happen I that comes up in my class as well or where people have contact and um provide guidance let's say to people that and there are people that have died but they are law store\nFor instance someone that may have died um quickly and they're just disoriented and they may need some assistance\nI think that that\nType of thing does happen quite a bit and I'm at a ... that the Monroe Institute we all for sixteen different classes and one of those classes focuses on that type of guidance it's called guidelines\nI'm which I'm you're trained to literally assist the others in that um [noise]\nAnd to let's just say a system to go to a higher dimensional space\nMm mhm so to assist him in crossing or have you ever done this after a\nTragic incident national tragic simpler masked is still Reno one\nI have because I ... I was practicing out of body experiences uh during nine eleven era\nAnd myself and I received a lot of contact ah during that period of time um that was a that was one of those events where there was a lot of people that were just totally disoriented let's put it that way imagine you're having coffee one morning and your office\nAnd suddenly your entire body is gone\nI mean can you imagine I mean it's hard for us to even wrap our minds around that so there was a lot of people that we're assisting those um people that died and this is a this is an ongoing process\nDown by many around the world and it it functions in different names and different cultures and then I went\nTo we we presented in I think I'm more a let's just say I'm very grounded in a scientific waves at least the scientific as we can\nDo that goes for all the training here there are it's done in a way that's presented in a very logical way that a understandable with no cultural or religious overtones in other words\nWhich yeah which is great because you really allowed to have their own experience and all that\nI Want to find out a little bit more in town one of the culture that does this and what it's called the culture is going to take a quick break William thank you so much\nAnd when we come back we'll talk about what are their culture just existing and also a little bit more on how you can get

out of body exploration\nNot treating trauma that to an actual workshop or it sounds fun regulated type of out of body exploration citizen thing and it's also\nWell done very well and something that William Bowman has led for almost Twenty years that's ... it's typically but this is something you can do on your own William where what other cultures has this existed in history\n[noise] Alicia from the very beginning of time I'm Out of body experiences are probably the quintessential I'm\nA way that throughout history people have profound experiences I mean look at a biblical bite the revelations begins with I was in the spirit and if you look back through all the biblical text all the transformational type of experiences people\nTheir their consciousness was projected or extended let's say beyond their physical limits\nAnd that is in itself a form of out of body exploration it shifted to was in two thousand years ago wasn't called that on the train it goes all the way back to ancient Hindu the Buddhist text [noise]\nUm [noise] to every culture and religion known to man if you start to read it objectively you'll see their comments about this uh [noise] I was in the spirit or I was beyond my physical body let's put it that way and there they had this profound experience\n[noise] how can an out of body experience validate life after light\nWell it gives you that infant number one or two a shocker for many people just to be aware of the fact that oh my God I continue its a verification that you continue beyond your body [noise]\nAnd that's a that's a ... in itself a big life change or for people it's a Wake County because then they realize oh my God there's I continue there's other things that are that are going on beyond a single experience\nAnd it really opens people's minds to the potential what they are I think about it there's a seven and a half billion people on the planet and people don't have a clue where they're going to death they don't know where they come from before they were born and they don't know really what they are\nAre they they assume there are human being because they were they found themselves in the human body mhm but in actuality a consciousness\nUh can take on any for I I Know from having out of body experiences encountering all kinds of life forms including by the way animals many people contact a law and\nWho love pets six cetera during their out of body experience since ... and the pets are having out of body experience to\nSee any new ones that have crossed over already\nKnow or even the ones that are alive I write about this my first book where my my dog McGregor would would follow me out of body and I also had a cat that would do that\nI mean these this is er just real events that are happening the fascinating people all over the world\nI mean we're a multi dimensional beans that's what we are and are biological body\nYou know we have to realize we're not we're not biological beings we're only here for a very brief period of time and then we exit and we move on to another state of consciousness and another energy body and that's what we've discovered without a body exploration\nIs that it's multi dimensional and that death is in a ... really I'm no no that's been said but\nOnce you encounter and experience and communicate with loved ones who are passed\nAnd you're doing this face to face this is life changing you no longer need a psychic the actors the intermediary you you you're empowered to discover the answers for yourself\nAnd it's really to find out what kind of journey or we all on 'cause this is an amazing journey of consciousness we all share\nYeah it is but you know what I did that I interviewed Raymond Moody on my show and you know the ... the grandfather and clean the term life after gas and\n[noise] um [noise] he had expressed to me after Fifteen Years doing that is that\nHe doesn't know for sure\nThat that yeah flights to get things yes because scientifically it's never really been proven even though he's heard\nThousands and thousands of report to people who live here in his life after life ... he killed a dozen as a scientist as a load Jewish and right now I Know for sure is\nExactly why self initiated out of body exploration is so important because you get that verification absolute personal verification that you need\nBooks study research will never give you that kind of verification you can read a thousand books\nYou could spend your entire lifetime studying this topic\nAnd it's not going to give you the inside and the verification you'll get\nFrom one out of body experience because suddenly you know you go from being a researcher or a believer to an hour and that's the big huge step that all of humanity I think is moving towards\nI mean we need to we need to wake up to what we truly are\n... and to get away from this big green and confusion and division I mean once you realize that you're you're not just a biological being manager continuing as you're involving beyond this temporary stage of development\nIt puts everything into a whole different perspective\nAnd I'm not the first time I mean this is not the Buddhist up and saying this for a long time that you know we're more than our bodies and that were involved in beyond the body and we are all life is evolving beyond the body this is a temporary stage of our revolution\nYeah and I meant to say that ran in ... near dancing saying sorry I didn't mean like a afterlife that says let's say you know when I did my own Google Search on\nI just typed in near death experience and it was like twenty five million searches come up on Google or not the only ones that are interested in is becoming more and more of a\nA phenomenon a popular topic people are interested in what beyond disorder now I have been not sort of similar as here anymore but\nI Want to ask you you can you had an experience like if you were and you had this experience for you you were that can you use this out of body experience to help you in some way can you tell us about that\nWell in two thousand eleven I discovered I had a serious a stage for cancer of the lymph nodes and tonsils\nAnd I it was a shock was come on very quickly out a large tumor on my neck lymph nodes\nAh yeah the lymph nodes and anyway it was a serious issue and I had to get immediate had to make quick decisions on this because it was a you know it spreads I'd ... broken and kept solution [noise]\nSo I I went through traditional um because it was so quick and so fast I did a traditional medicine\nBut um during my recovery\nI was having some really profound out of body experiences and in a sequence of events\nWhich I did not itself initiate by the way these are just spontaneous out of body experiences which I was having why was recovering from cancer is a I had the ceiling experiences\nOh my God who gave me this\nAlso give me the wisdom to know how to live and\nAdd ... to ...\nWhich he also gave me\nThe wells loose\nSomebody I\nAny all of them I tell you become America's not selling brand seven o'clock [noise]\n\nPumped into this program does not represent the views or opinion so five Seventy W. N. A. X.\nAlone won't have to another edition of discoveries in hell on your host for McCain I'm really glad you're with me today because they were going to be talking about an issue that affect each and every one of us and that stress\nAnd believe it or not whether it's job stress financial stress family stress or even the little things that were told not to stress about\nAny form of stress takes a serious physical toll on your body\nBut don't worry because there is something you can do about your stress and joining me today on the phone is Dr Michael ... and Dr bank is this going to talk about stress and\nGive us some great information on things that we can do to reduce or even eliminate the negative effect the daily stress has on our bodies for those you that may not know Dr Parikh is he is a nationally recognized authority on natural an alternative health he's\nWorked with top Hollywood celebrities professional and Olympic athletes and he continues to be involved in the latest research into today's top health concerns and Dr ... thanks so much for being with us today\nThank Chris great to be with you\nSo let's get right into this whole stress issue you know stress is such a normal part of our daily routine these days but why should we be concerned about it and more specifically what's going on in our bodies and one of the warning signs that we should be looking for\nA while you know there's two ways to look at stress on is what we call mental stress on the other the other is how stress affects your body as a doctor I'm more interested in how it affects your body sure so the way stress affects the body as this I'm going to persons under stress the body transpose as the stress into tension\nAnd your muscles end up contract and everyone feels that in there in the upper back in ... right as a doctor I'm more concerned about the muscles that you don't feel\nSuch as the muscles in the arteries snow up and the muscles the heart is a giant myself over and the muscles in and around your digestive tract mhm because these are the things that are resulting in\nIn a heart disease digestive difficulties and I want to talk a little bit in your show today about nutrition because there are two nutrients\nThat it's completely handle the body in terms of stress okay according to the research that I've been involved but it's it's as simple as calcium and magnesium\nCalcium and magnesium right okay\nWhen you're deficient in calcium and magnesium a lot of things can happen\nKelsey magnesium for example is needed in order to go to sleep at night and how many people you know they just don't sleep while you wake up tired your body hurt more\nPretty soon it starts to wear you down and pretty soon you get sick and you have a condition that people are suffering for pain and osteoporosis and fibromyalgia and cramps and their legs and weird illnesses so there's something wrong with this picture and it has to do with not how much calcium someone taking in their diet or how many calcium supplements or\nHow many ... acids you chew it has to do with simple absorption is that calcium getting absorbed into your body\nWith calcium being something to do with stress isn't calcium for building bones well\nYeah OK yeah and it does build your teeth but he's the one percent of the calcium actually circulates in your blood\nSo in that one percent starts drop it could affect your heart your brain your kidneys your organs and your body shutdown actually died\nWow this is all one percent of the calcium always has to be in your system on either two sources of calcium one isn't the diet you know and to is from the bones themselves\nThe body will exist ... absorb it back from the bones if ... that's right but I say\nAnd what you just discussed right now leads to one of the major causes of a condition that's affecting twenty five million Americans right now which is called ask due process\nRights which is a weakening of a ball and it's due to the body deriving the calcium from the bones instead of from the ... tradition yep\nOkay and so we have to do is we have to find a way to put calcium back in the diet now you think that would be really easy\nIssue or just drink milk\nJust drink milk or you know eat a lot of green leafy vegetables and that sort of thing but first of all people don't do that right\nAnd second of all the the quality of the calcium that comes from our diet has been decreasing in the last fifty years really because things like pastures Asian Luther irradiated um the calcium as leach from the soil and\nPeople are taking medications that block it so\nThe actual calcium is that being absorbed in the body okay and then you see people taking toms and calcium supplements you know they buy the health food store drug writer right but these things don't absorbing the body topic for a couple of reasons\nOne when you take a let's say on antacid that had the calcium in like a dumb first of all calcium does not absorb in the body unless it's in an acidic environment but see what happens when you take a Tom antacid\nOh okay so even if you're getting calcium in the in the anti that itself is that being absorbed\nIcy because it has to be in a in unanswered environment for it to be absorbed\nExactly okay now we have a product called the ... formula\nBut comics formula it's natural\nAnd the differences is that\nA powder and what happens if you put it in hot water and you mix it up and you drink it don't do it in a liquid instead of a pill\nAnd it absorbed into your system\nWow so that's a problem that\nWell yeah because when calcium and museum earn a liquid state it absorbs ten times better than in any other state\nWell that's great matter of fact yes I'm I'm reading the can right now says the fans absorbing calcium and magnesium beverage powder\nWell it comes down to absorption one of the ways to tell if you're not observing calcium is take a look at what drugs they're taking\nAre you on high blood pressure medication do you need something for your kidneys or you want pain medications you need sleeping pills because the calcium and especially the need is being absorbed mhm you're not going to suffer from all these things\nMy comment formula does absorb incredibly in the body the thing is is that what do you take my comments formula but not like well well I feel better\nI have thousands of people ready to the doctor pain 'cause I Can't believe it thirty minutes after I took the counter\nPain in my wrist went away or I was able to sleep for the first time

dramatically different ways of life American cities and American farmland had so little in common when it comes to the daily grind political leanings and their views on money and\nWorking hard in this curiosity has come up boom the books about the residents of rural America the latest is by\nAnd journalists Sheryl ... so I grew up on a wheat and cattle farm thirty miles west of Wichita\nAnd in some ways that I was a child in the eighties and the teenager in the nineties and by then there were some major technological ships going on in the country but because of our socio economic station we didn't have any of those things so I didn't have air conditioning and have cable TV didn't have a computer in the house or access the Internet\nGoing somewhere he's my upbringing on that farm was more like a Nineteen fifties childhood then the two thousands childhood maybe\n... writes about her upbringing and life in rural America in her book heartland a memoir of working hard and being broke in the richest country on earth\nThat was actually a pretty beautiful thing I was a pretty solitary kid by necessity to start sort of geographic isolation but I always had animals and in nature to interact with\nMeanwhile within the walls of our house there was all sorts of strife and dysfunction much of which had to do in my view with economic struggle and so that's part of the story too but you know it is an experience this\nThing we call rural America that I actually\nFeel quite privileged to have lived in that is an increasingly rare experience an urbanized country\nSmart his book is about growing up on farmland in Kansas but more than being a book about geography it's about what do you just don't like to grow up poor she says she was inspired to write her memoir because of the way she sees America putting such important son Wilson status\nI Can't say that in those moments let's say as a child qualifying for\nFree school lunches or as a first generation college students not knowing what the term graduate school man when someone talked about applying to graduate school and not having the right clothes and so on the other thing that I see now looking back that I did feel\nDiscomfort Shane embarrassment I was not necessarily conscious of that I wouldn't have necessarily articulated it that way\nBut the thing is we live in a society that is full of messages for people who struggle financially that that your value and worth is somehow tied to your financial value and worth and if that's the case in the context of capitalism and my family and I are\nWorthless [noise] that's of course the impetus for this book is to provide a sort of corrective of that deeply ingrained social attitude I think that even politically liberal and progressive people I find sometimes hold\nSmart said it was her experience as a college student that really taught or what a disadvantage being from a poor family living in rural America truly was\nI was a first generation college student I had already been working as a teenager for years and really also hustling as a student to work hard for the scholarships that I knew\nWould be my only ticket to a college education so by the time I showed up on campus that age Eighteen hours already tired [laughter] and then those years they're double majoring working to make ends meet keeping my grades up to maintain the scholarships that paid for my tuition and and all those things as a financially independent Eighteen year old\nWas you know while for some of my friends they might remember College of the most to care for years of their lives for me they were really the hardest years of my life and that's the class divide in this country sort of manifest in my life\n... book is about much more than having to work her way through college and not having as much fun as her classmates she says some members of America as upper class don't recognize the full scope of what it means for others to live in poverty\nThe most crucial thing to point out would be just a very\nPhysical nature of poverty and the dangers often model ones that actually that come with that life so\nI when I was in second grade my dad who was a farmer and a carpenter still couldn't make ends meet and those two industries for all his hard labor so he took a side job driving ban for a company that basically picked up industrial waste and then disposed of a percent whatever laws and regulations\nAnd so he would go around and said to places that new oil changes and pick up their spent oil and such\nAnd somewhere along the way you know nobody knows exactly what had happened but likely one of these are businesses that he picked up their chemical waste from had improperly mixed things that weren't supposed to be mixed [laughter] and so that was in the back of this than my dad was driving and the fumes seeped into the cab of van and\nAnd nearly killed him so he was in the hospital for weeks and for probably three years after that was in a kind of mental Hayes\nAnd you know this is just being a human being on planet earth comes with dangers that you can't necessarily escape with money but so often people who need money than most are the ones that do the least desirable job and they're the least desirable jobs because they're the dirtiest than most dangerous work\nMarsh indicated that there are two particularly destructive causes of the wealth divide in America first the way our capitalism to push those living in poverty for their own to the fold\nSo I'm not a political scientist and I'm not a policy expert\nBut I Do know that the regulation of private industry has basically over the course of my lifetime I was born in Nineteen eighty has led to a country where okay perhaps we have\nAll one eight

are living with Alzheimer's or dementia two thirds of those at least in the United states are women and according to a number of studies presented to the recent old timers association international conference it appears that whether a woman develops Alzheimer's disease or not\nDepends in part on her reproductive history doctor ritual Widmer is professor of epidemiology at the University of California Davis it's\nKnown for quite some time that women are at higher risk of dementia and this\nPreviously had been mostly attributed to the fact that women live lock 'em but now more and more research has come to light at really trying to do that and understand what is it specifically about women and females grain that may or may not put them at higher risk of that show\nA number of children age has been tracing the age of ... all seem to contribute to later life read\nDr Snyder is senior director of medical and scientific operations at the old timers association\nAnd there's something about the hormonal changes happening throughout a woman's life and they and her brain melody is there something about the number of months back at another study coming from the u._k. nail\nChange our bodies are immune than our overall brain health and later life and that the big questions though and kind of at the Y.\nInside that we need to the point is we think about identifying as early as tainted as we think about treatments that Denver and women and men\nOne of the more reliable findings in the literature is that women with a longer reproductive period so by reproductive period I mean the time from when they first get their period to their last period that's considered the reproductive period or their fertile period the longer that is\nThe lower the likelihood of all time whereas disease that finding is actually pretty reliable and the literature and it's consistent with the idea that higher levels of estrogen may be protective against all ... disease in women\nMost Dr Brawley Mackey professor of psychiatry and psychology at the University of Illinois at Chicago She says other studies also show that exposure to estrogen could be a protective factor\nProbably the strongest evidence that reproductive factors play a role in all ... come from studies and women who have their ovaries removed earlier than expected that is earlier than the typical age and then a pause\nAnd those studies show that such women have\nA Seventy percent increased risk of cognitive impairment are all cameras disease\nCompared to other women and it's this early removal of the a phrase that is before that typically a jet menopause that is associated with this risk we move all the ovaries after the typical age of ... not associated with an increased risk\nNow the good news is that the research shows that if women we place the estrogen they lose when they have their ovaries removed\nIf they replace it specifically with estrogen therapy supplemental estrogen pills that risk goes away\nWe actually published a paper on this looking on my own replacement therapy looking at women who commands and men like around the time but none of us versus women who commands\nAnd their teen years later I'm all based on that study was women who were initiating around that kind of mental caught at a lower risk of dementia women who were initiating ten or more years\nAfter menopause at higher risk of dementia and that story which really started the critical window which is that there is not a one size fits all\nThe individual and really has to do with\nMe at that hasn't been an subsequently local gated and several other studies there's been at least four or five to my knowledge that really piece the arch timing of when women started post menopausal hormone replacement therapy\nAnd so a common theme is emerging from this data showing that initiation around him out of causes not harmful and\nCould possibly be beneficial\nHaving more children also lowers the risk of all drivers but researchers are reluctant to say whether it's hormones or something else\nWe found that women who had three or more children were at a modest lead lower risk of dementia and we don't know if this is speaking to levels of exposure to certain hormones I mean there's definitely a very specific or mono\nMill you that only happens when one is pregnant it could also be speaking to just house that women who have more children were possibly healthier we also don't know among women for example in our study\nWho had miscarriages because we also found this association between self report of miscarriage\nAnd in elevated risk of dementia\nPeople with three or more kids have a lot of social engagement and a lot of social support that may be protective against all the time or his disease so in my mind it's not necessarily the hormonal changes that accompany pregnancy\nThat might be related to a woman's risk of Alzheimer's disease later on but rather some of these lifestyle factors that go hand in hand with having children\nAnd when a woman becomes pregnant her body goes through many other changes that are visible to be on\nIt was another researcher who had looked at the number of months pregnant and had found an association between number of months pregnant and certain masters being differential Lee associated with dementia she hypothesize\nThat it was due to changes in the immune system what I Do know is that certainly there are changes and a woman and you just in just a quarter pregnancy because certainly the body does not want to see that very go see you know as something external rights do we want the body to accept the pregnancy\nClearly there are many factors that go into old timers risk yet despite the fact that more women suffer from the disorder the Muslim women are not as readily identified\nIt may be harder to identify ... disease in women because\nThe test that we most frequently used to identify ... is a test that women naturally perform better on than men\n[laughter] that's a test of what we call verbal memory it turns out that due to higher levels of estrogen women performed better on this memory test compared to men women are maintaining this superior performance\nOver men despite the fact that the women and men have the same moderate amount of ... disease pathology in their brain\nAnd so I think it actually worse than the condition of homesickness because people feel all the more alone\nIn fact that we might not want to admit it Matt says home sickness is something most people experience even if you enjoy new places and experiences the lack of familiarity can still be intimidating but if you admit to being home sick then it becomes a legitimate emotion which often a listen so little sympathy\nBut I think it's remarkably commonplace and that lots of people if you scratch the surface will admit to longing for wherever they came from whether it's immigrants in your neighborhood or\nPeople who've relocated just across the country it's visible in so many parts of their culture and the food we choose to eat and the sports teams we root for or and the music we listen to\nPeople are often trying to make that connection back to home I think is very widespread phenomenon in our culture but we don't feel like we're allowed to talk about it so\nI Wish we could talk about it more because I think people would feel less stigma\nThey realize lots of people in America have experienced the feeling and in fact it's kind of a normal uh come to moving but because the pressure under the table people feel a little embarrassed by it in reality you know going\nBack to colonial America I find records of the pilgrims being home that get about as American as apple pie\nHome sickness maybe an old emotion but Dr Chris Willard a lecture on psychiatry at Harvard Medical school says social networks and new technology may make it worse\nI think that makes it a lot more difficult to detach so I think it's I think that's part of what makes home sickness probably even more\nFor kids these days are you know for adults to be kept called our kids are away we're so used to being able to be attached all the time got this kind of digital wireless ... court in a sense that's keeping connected\nOur kids go off our kids we go to camp or somewhere else and it's not easy to get in touch with people when we're so used to that if\nThe economy is much more likely to create or make home sick that's even worse\nWill it agrees home sickness is a reasonable response to a big life change he says a helpful coping strategy is to express your feelings so people can understand\nBut I think any time we get through a typical situation pitch us makes us stronger and so when one of the things I suggest that parents do is when our kids have experienced home sick that\nThey talk about it on that drive home or you know during the rest of the year because it can become that kind of touched on a pay you were home second you got through it you know during that two weeks time at camp\nThat means you can't get through it if you go to a longer camp that means you'll be able to get through it when you go off to college here and another strange situation or are traveling move across across the state or across the country or something like that\nSo it it does give kids confidence when they can get through something called like guilt thing you know that which does not kill us makes us stronger\nAnd I'm like that so many Americans got through adversity and we can start to see that as a strength and cultivate that others trying to talk about it with our cat does that's trying to ... so I really think you know and in that sense it's overcoming health thing that can be really positive\nSo while it may not be life threatening homes thickness is legitimate and it can happen to just about anyone when they're away from familiar surroundings\nThe results of our

to North Korea this past week and it was your first time in country collie can you give us what your first impression was\nWell people say um that it's eerie on the ground there that you don't see you know many car as many people um that felt even more true when I was there\nA as we drove from the airport um to a guest house where uh they kept us kind of cooked up waiting for these Kim Jong un meeting to um take place I thought maybe three cars on that twenty minute drive\nOr we saw a few people walking the streets are they all felt very curated what we were actually saying there were a few women on riding bicycles um but\nThey weren't you know they didn't have their eyes set on us even though we were this large motorcade that was driving through uh the country and I would assume\nA non traditional site for them but they they were very clear not to not to check us out too closely and when we landed a the shocking thing to me was that\nSecretary of state Pompeo was thrown immediately I'm into a pretty awkward situation with North Korean counterpart because his North Korean counterpart Kim Young people who have as many many times now\nI'm immediately told him that he couldn't bring his translator or his armed body man into his meeting with Kim Jong on you know dictating the terms of that meeting and putting the secretary of state on his heels a little bit because obviously\nThis meeting with Kim Jong none was why he came last time that he went to North Korea he was denied that meeting and it it didn't look so good for him\nSo what ultimately happened I mean do you do it without a translator you're flying blind\nYou know they've gotten to the motorcade I watch them all get into the motorcade yeah secretary of state Mike Pompeo on us special representative to North Korea Steve began gotten one car and then behind them was the CIA director of the Korean mission Andy Kim and the U.S translator\nUm and so they sat in their cars you know all prepared ready to head off to this a meeting that everyone was anticipating and then they sat there\nFor about five minutes but it felt like a lifetime because North Koreans were running around and kind of whispering to one another and\nI'm us Secret Service personnel were giving each other I'm nervous glances as to what the hell is going on here and then they went to the secretary's car a had a discussion that I could not here\nI'm from where I was standing and um right after that the u._s. translator was got out of the car behind them and didn't go to the meeting\nNow I Want to point out that indeed Kim\nWho is the CIA mission I'm director of Korea he speaks fluent Korean I mean I saw him interacting with the north Korean throughout the time there he's very comfortable so he was in the meeting it wasn't as if\nThey were just taking Kim Jong un's translators word for what was happening um and ... did go with his Secret Service detail\nBut you know that conversation on the runway wasn't forgotten by North Korea and say they hold us accountable um to what are their standards and their rules when the U. S. is on the ground in ... and it was very evident\nUm in that moment that they were controlling what was happening the narrative and uh the logistics\nAnd yet at the end of it Pompeo comes out saying we're farther down the road we have some ground for potential second summit between the president and and Sherman gym so obviously they feel like a they made some yard and joined us\nAs he did make some yard edge in terms of continuing us North Korea discussions on\nAt the end of August a beginning of September ... trip to North Korea was canceled we thought that it looks like the two countries weren't really interacting anymore or now at least discussions seemed to be back on track\n'em and North Korea did agree a pump has had to allow some inspectors into one of their nuclear\nTest launch sites but\nIn terms of what we tend to really change about North Korea's nuclear capability and it's highly developed nuclear program nothing\nCBS has Kiley Edward thank you this week a judge in New York there are some of the charges against disgraced Hollywood Mogul Harvey Weinstein WCBS reporter Marla diamond has more\nLucy ...

administration seems to be taking a cautious approach in part because of its ties to the Saudi kingdom\nAnd critics let's say that the president is already taking some pressure off us as it came to an air raid there and saying that if even if they didn't do that we're still going to continue doing this clip that senators on the health thing that they shouldn't be a reason to stop a commitment\nIt

blame for the scouting I\nWork I Do ... the Democratic committee staff\nAnd what do you think their motivation was to help her or dissing travel I think\nIt was to think Kavanaugh I think they put her

testify under oath and public\nKnows she did not seem to be reluctant by that point she had already been outed and I think it was at that point then she was able to make her statement I'm and she did

you see or did not see Dr ... testimony that reminded you of what you actually experiencing those ...\nWell I think that um it it did remind me of the fact that I felt that she actually had been abused at some point I felt that\nAnd so I have no doubt that she has been abused at some point but what there was was a lack of cooperation from the witnesses said she identified and so when they came forward and in their statement basically said you know what that didn't happen or there was no such party [noise]\nUm it can't hurt her credibility\nSenator Joni Ernst of Iowa was CBS as major

S. is on the ground in Pyongyang and it was very evident\nUm in that moment that they were controlling what was happening the narrative and a diligent sex\nAnd yet at the end of it Pompeo comes out saying we're farther down the road we have some ground for potential second summit between the president and and Sherman gym so obviously they feel like a they made some yard and joined us\nAs he did make some yard edge in terms of continuing us North Korea discussions on at the end of August a beginning of September ... trip to North Korea was canceled\nWe thought that it looks like the two

to you happy October\nAnd a fall and hopefully all that fun stuff\nThis is a program to take the mystery out of your financial life uh I was asked to do a little research for a segment I was doing last week on TV about financial independence retire early FIRE movement\nYou know about this I got to like get\nA personal finance people have come down hard on it I think it's cool\n[noise] um fire financial independence retire early started with millennials who basically said I Do not want to have a soul sucking job that does not reflect my values and I don't want to be a cheerleader for an economy that fueled by consumerism\nNow of course when you do that if you're a millennial then you start to say a ... you you basically are inviting these comments like ah you know your generation doesn't have a work ethic\nI think that I liked his idea why not I mean I may not say that\nMost people are going to be able to actually retire early but they but by saving money and living a lifestyle where you know you essentially don't spend more than you earn and you avoid excessive debt and you cultivate them hide some some side hospitals or and you invest in low cost index funds\nAnd you don't withdraw too much money for your retirement I like it I'm On board Marc let's try to get Mr money moustache on the show\nHe want he doesn't do that he has his own\nOkay anyway Mr money moustache dot com that's one of the guys who's really started to be the big proponent of fire or anyway I it's cool\nFinancial independence to me it doesn't necessarily mean the end of working but it does create a lot more potentially satisfying career options so you can check it out\nFire Google it and a checkout Mr money moustache dot com I I Want to be a proponent of his and it'd be a cheerleader what the heck [noise]\nAll right we start the program with a call usually end today is no different we are on the line with Kim who is calling from New York Hello Pam welcome to the program what can we do for you\nIn jail a pleasure to be talking to you\nGreat to talk to you as well what's up\n[noise] um I retired this past April a which was a little earlier than intended but my uh company had offered a very good uh incentive plan so I decided to take 'em up on it [noise]\nThrough his employer is that maybe I don't want to oust him on the air\nBut I'm going to make a gas anyway and so this is actually a really good situation because as you mention in your checking savings kind of like just your\nHe's got a high yield savings would Seventy two thousand CDs with a hundred and forty five thousand so that's all like good chunk of liquidity you need about five thousand dollars a month give attention that's giving you Seventeen hundred dollars a month\nI mean you're pulling Eighteen hundred dollars a month from your IRA I'm from the roll over IRA or the ...\nOne of the roll over IRAs that's the one with I thought it to take it from the biggest chunk okay that was my uh one of my race was over six hundred thousand dollars\nOkay on and search for now I mean it doesn't actually mean you're not pulling out that much money you're I mean you say any five grand a month but your pension Seventeen hundred and your IRA you say you're pulling Eighteen hundred that's not the adding up to five thousand so is there something I'm missing here\n[laughter] no I'm probably just taking the risk from a saving okay\nThat's fine ugly during the month\nMakes sense and so there's I've got two ways to think about this um one is that normally when I had this conversation with people I say\nHey you got all the money saved just pulled out of your high yield than your CDs don't worry about it and live your life right but I'm I also recognizing that for right now\nI'm Wondering whether taking that money out of one of the rollovers is actually a pretty good deal because you're in a fairly low tax bracket right now and so you know you you have twenty grand of income already right so because uh you know the pension\nYou could potentially take out\nYou know up to say thirty eight thousand if you took out another uh you know and I think you're going to get there you know basically if you keep your your income under thirty eight thousand seven hundred dollars let's just you know recalled thirty nine if you did that you would stay in the twelve percent tax bracket\nWhich is really low and I'm sure when you were saving money that you never would have guessed that you would have a tax bracket that is that low\nNo no no it's more yeah right and\nUm and so I I guess there's a a couple of things to think about one is that you know ... and you know\nAnd he just got to grand a month from the IRA would be fine and you know you pay a little bit at the twenty two percent that I wouldn't be the worst thing in the world on but I think that it probably does make sense to use that money and let it be taxed\nAt a lower rate because twelve percent men like it may go up in ten years you know that it may not be there for you so I actually think this is a good idea for you and you can use a roll over IRA on is possible since you have money there\nI might delay my Social Security until my full retirement age\n[laughter] yeah that was my other quandary that I've been debating on because uh you're right it monetarily I really don't need it I have both plenty savings to handle it [noise] um so I've been on the fence\nAbout what's your full retirement age a B six sixty six so you would have a\nTwo more years where you'd pull money out I don't know I mean you've got the money I Would do it and may be that way you wouldn't take this permanent hair cut to your Social Security you have any plans to work in the future because your young and you sound like you're kind of rocking and rolling here\nAre not well I Do a volleyball officiating part time uh I don't plan on really working fulltime but that was a sort of a hobby of mine really on some money doing that\nAll right well that's good okay so I mean maybe a little bit there and a little bit from the account and you know you keep your tax liability pretty low and you know you're in a high tax state New York but you are I think that it it just makes a lot of sense to me you've already said should I guess on the air mark and edited out if you want me to\nBut sure no that's going to work for horizon no oh darn it I\nJust had another call that was very similar to this and it was her eyes from person\nTo work for and some and some L\nO O K interesting anthem healthcare offered to pack and just you know these packages are very hard but um to to actually analyze because there's the you know you were probably making a good chunk of money before you retired and to giving up that income is hard how did they sweetened the deal for you\nWell they gave a much longer severance package yes the normal ... who was and I was very close by to children have graduated from college and I was planning on retiring after they graduated anyway so the timing was almost\nAlmost a mystical so but you know I think I'm going to take them off on as well I think\nThat that is wonderful and I think that you're in great shape I'm One less so you've got some company stock that you did us or is that how does it have a low cost basis or\nWhen I originally purchased it it was severely discounted okay you know unfortunately ... when I got laid off the first one and only time um when I was really hard I did not pick up on the spot plan so the the uh it's eleven thousand dollars which was purchased\nThan me I Would say pre two thousand they time periods so it's worth you know it's it's worth food you know let them do themselves which is a bit but unfortunately it and continue to point\nOut seems like you did pretty well yeah you know committed and what I said for yeah exactly\nAnd you know you're you're in a pretty low capital gains rate um you know timeframe so if you wanted to do that that's fine are you any any um charitable inclination that you might have that could be a good thing to actually use to gift you\nKnow you can gift hairs in that stock\nSo yeah it's a good idea yeah if you\nSay you might say like hey I you know gosh I I always give I'm going to make it up I give it a thousand dollars to a breast cancer research foundation you can gift the money from that company stock\nAnd then it goes directly to the ego it goes straight to the charity they know how to do if you would ever charitable institution you deal with they always have somebody who can receive at\nAnd what happens is in ... you get the direction for the thousand dollars you say I gave a thousand dollars to charity ABC right and then there's no tax liability for it\nOh okay so that's a nice way to use those those funds that have an embedded gain in them and not have to pay capital gains you use your charity\nThat's a good idea because you know I Do get to charities and that would be um a good way to handle those stocks\nHave suddenly excellent All right I Wish you all the best and a good luck with the volleyball recovering I'm sure that the parents can be a little annoying\nBut hey you know usually a little more oh really okay that that's good to know thanks so much for calling and good luck to you have a good move to\nA that's\nI I ...

I've got three hundred thirty thousand dollars in my four one K. and I will have a pension a five hundred thirty two dollars a month at eleven thousand dollars in a rough my wife is fifty six she's going to retire from a teaching job and two years\nAnd she will be do at twenty five hundred dollar a month pension\nWe'll a hundred twenty two thousand dollars on our house and I should be receiving

just pay off the house because you may not need to and you're still going to be in a decent tax bracket because you're both getting pensions are going to have three grand a month and you'll also have\nA Social Security check so I think that what you may want to do is definitely pay off the other data twenty thousand on and then make sure you've got plenty of money in your emergency reserve
