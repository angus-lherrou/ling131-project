candidate to agree about eleven o'clock last night on a Sunday night at eleven uh\nBut definitely a nice surprise to see that happen I think on top of that at least that shows that there is at least some negotiations being done and maybe a little quicker than what's being polled at times now we're starting to go ... what Japan and also with Europe or are ongoing so\nThose would be the other ones if they would pop up and all of a sudden get something done there could be a little bit more of a boost as well and of course\nAs mid term elections get closer you you might look for something that a gets done here maybe prior to that that's what outside possibility weather wise you know it's cold it's kind of a slow harvest I think is so far\nUm you know just what the colder than normal weather in here\nDoes look like there is a potential for some pretty heavy rains over the next six to seven days in Iowa\nNorthern Illinois southern Wisconsin would take the brunt of that and they could see upwards of four to seven inches of rain total a in that window so that we don't need that and the other thing I Do hear a little bit more rumbling this\nIs talk quality is a little bit suspect in a certain regions hearing that an Indiana I appear in that in Iowa\nAnd I'm a a little bit here in Minnesota as well\nYeah we've been hearing that from a lot of the ... been talking to you on harvest report let me also ask in terms of the fact that we did get some things sign on now does that give leverage or where does it put heat on China maybe can step up here and trying to do something or not\n[noise] well I think it's I I think anytime you're starting to see other countries come to\nAgree that we want to see lower tariffs across the board and they were starting to see agreements and that's why I say if if for all of a sudden you could get something to or Japan or in a a a Europe agree on something\nThen yeah I Do think it puts out a little bit more pressure on that they they feel that they're out there and they are by themselves and then we might start seeing a little bit more talk going on in that department\nYou know I think when you look back here we're still doing quite well with our exports sales on corn or still the cheapest and the world and going lower certainly doesn't lose or any of that\nYou know we have that grain stocks report on friday which was a probably a more of a very surprised to the corner and anything else but\nI think the numbers still remain a little bit ... suspect to me about where and how we got so much more corn and basically when you break it down a came from about two states and that would be a Iowa and South Dakota that followed a more corn out there than what what they should have had\nRight but we have at least turn that off at the time being from a technical standpoint in corn and beans today because we did get above some objective here what did that open the door to and we'll start covering more they're short positions as a result of the ...\nIf you'd poke above now are the three sixty seven on this corn a then you're ... you're certain other maybe at three Seventy five a three Seventy eight something like that on December corn and I could see where it where they would start to unwind a little bit more of their short positions if that happens the soybeans\nA you know harvest is going on I think the ... are still pretty good I don't see any problem in South America but technically we're all talking about this bigger crop uh we got bigger stocks and yet we're still move with the market is making new highs has gone up you're going to run into selling\nOn any farmers that have override and things like this are going to start selling some of these beans up on the rallies that that's been noted as well but my guess is technically looks like he could make a bold move up towards the eight eighty maybe even get a chance of a shot at Ninety eight or nine bucks if it's going to hit nine\nI think you'd have to have something where the heavy rains come in and really get into a delay of the soybean harvest that's a word that outside possibility would come from\nWhere we market going in is um it's direction going to serve as an anchor we can't get it going on the corn market\nYou know I I Would say I was disappointed with the wheat not performing or uh any better now granted at one time we were up five to seven cents and then gave it back here towards the end and closed up just slightly\nI'm here to or competitive in the world market I still think the one thing that with with weight is we're not big in the export arena yet I think that's coming down the road but I think you just have to get more of the of the wheat crop to disappear globally and mainly from the Russians who are still selling weed\nOut or a cheaper than the u._s. and moving out and they just have the advantage with afraid but I still think in another thirty days maybe forty us is going to be probably become more competitive in the world market\nRight about that features obviously they both stand to benefit all sectors from a new NAFTA deal but especially hot curious was cattle though we went about some resistance areas means new heights been moved technically today but then we couldn't stay up there so was that bad technical close are you worried about it\nYeah it wasn't it's not a bad close ... you know the one thing up I had to be concerned I thought the\nFunds in both pork and beef but I and be adding a little bit more to the length and here's the other thing with the cattle versus the hogs the cattle are still trading now at a premium toward the cash is out here the movement of beef is built backed up ... were obviously still going to stay pretty strong with cattle numbers in here\nBut I still think this is the fourth quarter a stock market stays at record levels I think fourth quarter demand for beef is going to be pretty strong in here so I I'm Still optimistic on this a beef market\nCorrections you're going to find people willing to buy it\nUh in here and I still think it's got some more upward momentum to go in here on that market but short term could be a little over done but all your deferred contract fit into two thousand Nineteen all new contract guys again so\nIt's a it's still acting very good hogs a very impressive I thought the hog and pay report myself was nothing more than neutral in fact I even thought maybe neutral even a little bit on the negative side\nOr just because we're still going to have three percent more hogs and expansion still going on but uh that hard market shrug that a setback off real quick and strong performance on friday and follow up again here today suggests we're probably going to still see maybe another\nThree to four dollars up on this market before it runs into the next level of resistance\nWe got a little help from more cases of African swing fever though generally\n[noise] uh yeah we did a in here I think pets

shop and another in Virginia conceal\nThe readers with in those signs so it's actually the drug Enforcement Administration which is really the federal government so are you illegally transporting trucks\nFred doesn't matter if I'm doing something illegal or not other than speeding it probably should notify mia or gather information\nShould I don't have a safe if somebody was sitting there and just taking notes of cars that combined writing no license plate number than\nLike ah my friends used to in New Jersey where they were tracking gang members right well who who I was at that party down at the shore there oh okay\nOh license say be three a be one way or their\n... those guys are whoa whoa wait a minute he's on the list of that that could be yeah but that was on the ground a face to face a gathering of the information that's what that was certainly a the way I mean there was somebody sitting in the back seat of the car maybe but\nSo do you think that it is a fair for the da to using those little machines those little or what you do something wrong bead machines to gather information that kind of stuff as a truck driver I got to tell you that bothers me a little bit one of the things that I always disliked is that there's data bases there\nToo All right so when I Would leave [noise] let's say for instance I Would leave plug it in South Dakota and my Peterbilt right and I'd go out west than I Would go um I Ninety west\nAnd then a through white would up to belt food and then to twelve to crow agency when I got to brought us Montana there was a scale right there right and I would roll through that scale and brought us Montana and they would type in my deal team number mhm\nAnd then just on the other side of billings Montana there was another one where I Would roll through that scale and they would\nType in my deal team number how's your log book [noise]\nAnd then there's another one that you go all the way across to there and you get to the continental divide you're just pulling off the interstate and there's another one of them scaled Nate type being your deal teen number and then you end up\nIn post Falls Idaho right which is right on the border between quarter lane Idaho and a and a Washington state right\nOr Spokane and you drill through and they type in your deal team number and if you were doing everything legally you have nothing to worry about and keep track your progress and ... year old you are one of them a little bit too early and they would sometimes pull in there now\nIn those days they probably didn't have systems that were um updated enough or didn't have the capacity probably\nTo track where you're at and when you should be at the next place or when you should not be at the next place\nBut I'm guessing now days they probably have information right that right you know they ... author to use and I remember my very first time going out west\nI had portion it all out so I knew exactly how far to drive each day I knew at the speed limits were and I worked it out uh before I started going out there and so I could figure out exactly how long it was going to take me\nI got the Missoula, Montana and I stopped in Missoula to do something\nAnd then continued on and there was a little portable scale set up right I pulled through there\nAnd the guy says well you got an update your logbook sealed updated to the moment they pull you in the scale so I did that and then he sat down with his little calculator and calculated how fast I had been driving to find out if I'd been speeding to get where I was at that particular moment in time\nAnd he goes huh I'll be it appears\nThat you're driving exactly sixty five miles per hour the entire time you know I said well yeah and certainly trying to maintain speed limit sir\nHe goes yeah I'm I'm going to guess though that you probably don't have enough horse power under the hood to pull the continental divide at sixty five miles per hour\nAnd don't tell me you were making up for it on the way down either so a next time maybe logging at sixty two miles an hour I ain't going to give you a speeding ticket\nBut I could so I had a you know somehow calculus\nFlat ground right\nUh-huh oh yeah yeah I guess I'm kinda I I don't I have a problem with Uncle Sam being able to find all that information on you that that bothers me just a little bit I don't like being the subject of database after database after data\nI think the way I should interview anybody that they want her within reason but within reason they should interview but they should also be guided

would be you have to choose you never speak again right or you got to say everything\nYou on your mind do you think that I could ever completely shut up\nSomeone you've known me now is that you could

a because of the dog because of their fans are we have let better than we ever have a really feel\nAfter we watch the tape we should've won the football game and it's just one play there are some crucial plays in the game but a number of times had we rose up a\nMay play a little harder maybe made it a better decision is coaches or we don't want that football game and and\nUh that is taking the next step which ... what we've been talking\nAbout I guess that to me as a watching it from the outside was the beauty of the game itself was that it was in a perfect game or everybody made every play there were\nHuman errors in this game on both sides there were turnovers when each team was driving deep and and the opposition's territory each team is to feel go there were a lot of chances on each side and as we talked about so often and talked about on Monday in games like that one play can decide the football game and you don't know if that play to play twenty seven or play Ninety four\nWell and and and that's football you know football in a in a well matched a contest it's got to be one or two or three plays and that made the statement I'm going to keep making that day with\nThe national championship we're gonna watch the film the day after we said we could play better 'cause that's football there's a lot of moving parts a lotta cause a lot of things like that uh\nBut we need to strive for that because that's what these guys works of art for\nThe again the biggest takeaway from Saturday was how your team responded in that environment\nThat and and I thought we played a the run their their pure run better than we ever had\nA you know certain ... certain to or they lost yards you know our guys did a phenomenal job that they started to go into the jet sweeping third short are you a sense that Curtis we knew he was a great player he he heard us and that's a big place hurt us and then they're done conversions are hurt us or lack of their ...\nOf the interior of that line Crockett Kerlikowske\nAnd we'll be talking about winter it's our station of the week here and just a second the rocket Kerlikowske his first term ... because he had he had what five snaps at Iowa State if he played all five of them and even Clint brown said the defensive coordinator going any said\nRocket Kerlikowske not bothered by anything but until you actually play up there you just never know how somebody is going to respond hit seven tackles one and a half sexy forced to fumble ah he was tremendous sitting there and there were other guys as well but he really led the charge and plug in those gaps up\nFor it you know he some guys respond better to that type of exam and gets going I mean I Walk in there and I get excited ... I Love that type of uh\nThe environment and so on the track it's a really good football player and going to get better Saturday line backers played really well in a lot of situations\nWhere we've got a lot to digest about this football game and also talking about what else is to come obviously because this is now one down seven more weeks in the Missouri Valley football conference couple of eyebrow raising scores this past Saturday as well we'll talk about\nThat but again want to hit our station to the week ... Ninety three point seven I was growing up it was a magic Ninety three out in the winter but to in the central part of the state tend to\nUh you'll have more than for so long with associated with ... and our friends out there and uh uh you know just a a really cool thing going on out there in in in central South Dakota with mo bridge and winter and all those and we're delighted to have ... a part of the family yeah and\nAny place in the state in the region that is willing to help you tell her story help spread the story I think is great and we appreciate that I'm at\nDistance I Love that area of the state uh love those type of people I grew up real close to that just appreciate their support\nFake thank you to ...

thanks for having me well thank you for being here and we talked about it with coach said at the top but you had to be delighted on Saturday against a a very good op instead of line and one of the best teams in the nation\nHow the interior of that defensive line you're that he tackles coach how those guys played on Saturday because for all the top the man that will buy that effort was exception\nIs I I'm Charles those guys early in the week and you know 'cause consistently be physical I'm from start to finish so I think they really road to the challenge and it really helps what it is a rival game and you know they really put some things on film but they have to continue to do throughout the course of the season\nLet's talk about the two starters to begin with and SAD award a kid who played some last year as a true freshmen so now here he is a true sophomore small town kid from a can of soda and Freeman and and you look at what he's done just tell me about the acts as a savior war\nI'm actually the really good kid goofy kid I was really quiet and when he came here and now he he's a he's got to be around I'm really works hard\nUm it was kind of shocked when he got ... football kid and uh now he he has a lot more copies any confidence and he had last year so I'm excited aside and the coach him because he always asked a lot of questions and um\nHe he stays out of the practice and and does things at times and he really work really hard to summer to give themselves a chance um and he's doing a great job right now\nCan you describe him as goofy case uh what do you describe the crock pot crack at Kerlikowske as well believe\nIt or not a lot of guys making like make fun of crack it all the time and he he doesn't really respond nothing bothers so does it no not really know everything just right off the water off the ... is crazy um\nAnd we talk about breaking point uh been trying to find is breaking point and ... you can but not there for twenty five plays and he's just going to be ... you know so um you know ... he's a great kid works hard and I'm a pleasure the coaches well so\nNow we saw this uh we have video of it from the spring practice season one of the scrimmage as he came up with a stack and then he got up and he immediately started as if he was stirring something and we then discovered that he was stirring the crock pot\nAnd then on Saturday he makes a stack he gets up and then he stirs the crock pot so how long did you work with him on the choreography for this Christ\nI actually didn't work with them I think ... worked with him I think they talked about it on his home visit when he refers to deal with him coming here and promising that he does that every time he\nGets to say well if you know somebody asked last week what songs stick with the same with Isaac Wallace if we can get him to the crock pot dance I think we're on to something here but you know in all seriousness these are too young guys will become stars and you have a young man and Spencer he'll do who started a year ago with with Kevin Kevin graduated\nAt Spencer has given up some playing time to those guys and we know how it is that can be a tough situation and Spencers handled that very well and still getting some time as well\nAs um you know Spencer the oldest guy in a group and has done a tremendous job and you know I I have no hesitancy to put them in the game um but the production that those other two guys um had in the spring and fall\nI'm really solidify them to be the one into the guys but a ... has done a great job would continue to get better and I think a competition is usually your best friend as a position close when you have that your best players play better and you bring other guys along with you\nAnd you know uh that makes my job harder but I Love my job is harder because of the company a competition um\nIf you only have one guy than it is hard to\nTo to win a lot of games so um it's other guy Thomas ... there was a great job coming in and in a true freshman ... who's a was a walk on his really I'm starting to defense and moved over to interior and gaining weight and you know\nKind of trying to come into his own and develop a row so I'm really happy with the group as a whole\nAnd again with that point we all know in the valley you've got to have more than two guys that that position 'cause it's just what how this leak place you've got to be able to have three four or five guys to run out there and you feel you have that right now\nNo question um you know my reaction out of the coach from someone who goes down as is your opportunity to step up and are in the plants on um when I was pressed play on the film\nBest you're auditioning for me to play 'em 'cause a lot of guys ... none of our guys but you know you hear about kids complain about transferring from schools because they don't play but when you have the opportunity to go into the game what do you do with that you are more rapidly you lose rep when your time\nSo I'm rotating guys and with with what a good off as a lawn and fall camp going against tea on a weird and all those guys are really developed some of those younger guys to to to be better and is helping us on Saturdays right now\nLast question before you head back to campus Indiana State on Saturday we'll talk more about this was steak but they are a run first team three plays out of four they're going to run the football they'll put six offensive lineman out there this is a unique challenge for your front for particularly your interior alignment\nNo question I'm obviously every week or or no one goal is to stop a stop to run 'em make one sided and then get up to a quarter back there but they're run games a little bit different North Dakota says more power team and there are more of his own team so we've got to do a good job of been a physical with our hands and and when and a lot of damage and keeping 'em\nOff as a long time and the line backers and all that stuff so I'm just simple simple a job as a defensive tackle you get about five block reaction and you have to master those so uh we'll go back to work this week in you know try to do our job to help our deepest be successful it sounds simple\nIt sounds simple yeah and then in the middle east the easiest position on defense but physically\nI was the hardest at the very good way to strap a
