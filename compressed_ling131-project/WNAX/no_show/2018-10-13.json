FDA for example or does this all the time and had a good example is another kind of regulatory dark matter\nIs back up a little bit of a second kind of regulatory dark matter is the issuance of guidance documents or memoranda ... instead of formal rulemaking\nFormal role making specifies that there has to be an announcement on the federal register public comment consideration of public comment and then finally ... of the rule\nBut the agencies Walsh and get around that by issuing guidance documents\nAnd then uh within the uh the guidance that they specify which is often new policy making new law making that really wasn't contemplated by Congress they can specify carve outs for enforcement discretion within that\nAnd that's a sometimes a bridge too far too much autonomy that was never contemplated for a for regulatory agencies and yet they do this\nDo this all the time some guidance is good so that for example if the ... as the food truck cosmetic ... a law that says a there has to be a\nPre approval inspections of drug manufacturers suitable manufacturing facilities but uh but guidance documents can tell the industry what nature of those are in a tablet Schmidt\nInspections will be do they have to be announced or can they be unannounced are they supposed to avoid disrupting\nThe pharmaceutical production uh how long should they last should be the outcome on in terms of paperwork and so on so that's good [noise] but uh but sometimes guidance makes brand new policy which is far beyond what anyone to contemplate it and it wasn't that brings\nGo ahead do and and that and that brings up the sort of a conflict if you get tore agencies to much autonomy\nOr you get them making new policies that are beyond what was intended if you give them too little you have found a unable to adjust to situations new technology is new situations that might arise\nSo what's the best way of raining it in and and I guess well you tell me what you think the best way to rented in would\nBe well the best way to rent it in it as we've discussed in other context is for Congress to exercise and perform its oversight responsibilities a much better much more strictly much more conscientiously than they do\nDoc I'll tell you this this stuff drives me nuts because I guess I expect that people work in the federal government and poll of federal paycheck out of the public treasury would be people of good faith\nAnd to some extent I I imagine there are plenty of people who meet that description and then there are other people who seem to think my federal job is not just a great paycheck and a great pension but his mind a license to go out and fix things to be the way I think they ought to be instead of the way\nThat I'd been directed and I know that some of these people didn't like the choice of Donald Trump I frankly don't care I didn't like the choice of rock Obama\nBut I also didn't suggest that well if you didn't like Brock Obama then you should work from within whatever agency work and to try and sabotage his policies which I don't think I've done very much\nA but people are certainly saying I'm going to sabotage the policies of of Donald Trump and make sure that his policies don't happen and when they do that as far as I'm concerned they're spitting in the face of the voters who approved Donald Trump whether you like him or not he was the choice of this system that we have Dr Miller you're ...\nYou're listening I got a break but I I really appreciate the time you can read about this a doctor but Miller has written about this

X. radio class dismissed\n[noise] we're going to the mid west\nFive Seventy [noise]\nAmendment friday night you know a few years ago Sheena and I got\nTo do something that I look forward to the opportunity to do for a long long time but I got a chance to go down to Mississippi and try to help the man become a United States senator and it didn't happen that time and I think honestly\nMan was cheated out of an opportunity or by a senator who labeled himself a Republican but actually acted more like a Democrat\nWell Senator Chris McDaniel is back at it he is now a Mississippi State senator who's running for the United states and and he joins Mennonite a senator McDaniel said Senator Mitch Daniels it's good to have you back on the program and or I Want to see this one come out differently if you don't mind\nYeah absolutely and thank you for having you know four years ago we we had that race and you remember what happened ... we thought the good side of the night of the primary we want fifty nine percent of the Republican vote but because of that again\nThey pushed forty thousand Democrats into the Republican primary and the Democrats elected our nominee and then as you know how the establishment of works they can't they just right for us that are going to step down then they hand selected another Democrat for the seat so here we are back in a very similar city fight here at the city so it's really great to be here\nWhat do you mind you explain to my audience how it is this complicated the Mississippi ends up with the system in which Republicans can have their choices taken away from them by Democrats cross the aisle\n[laughter] you know it's remarkable we helped is very conservative state no joke when the campaign trail if you can't find a conservative since the United States Senate from Mississippi where he got to find one it's not going to be for Massachusetts California it's good to say so but what happens here\nWe have a large lobbying presents because apparently Barbara and others at the party and they want to keep that gravy train ... and what they do is they find a these are so called Republicans who are really big\nGovernment Republicans they believe that big spending big tax scene and another liberal ... sales but they hide behind that are\nGoing to be over the years we've always managed to have these types of individuals and yet we still remain dead last economically speaking so or suggesting this another direction we think that this state can do better we know it can't just do away with the good old boy club blew away the\nLobbyists and the qualities and re impose liberty for everybody and that's what we're trying to do\nSo how's the race going at this point one of the polls show very well\nThe polls are all over the place I mean I you know what do you do the polls show Donald Trump we told they told us he had a Ninety nine percent chance of losing any one show\nUs some polls have was up a there's a pact poll shows us up eight to ten years or NBC poll shows us down by all the polls are being whispered about this off up two or three\nWho knows what I Do know that we have all the momentum\nAnd the reason I Know that he as we can feel the buzz on the ground and guess what will run against someone who was a life time Democrats you served three terms in the states it as a Democrat she voted for Hillary Clinton has this all\nDemocrats that ground in fact before she came back to see it being ran for state Senate she was a federal lobby says she lobbied to help to organization that pushed for Obamacare and pushed for universal healthcare\nSo when people find that out about the appointed senator guess what they rush away introduction that run toward our campaign that's the conservative and the great so as long as you're spread that message that people here in it for when it\nSo tell me this is a columnist recently said that your star is fading so how many how many how you've closed the gap between now and election day\nWe got to drive a we have to drive interested obviously there's a financial pulled up there are there is also just a a a person a individual component there were people have to reach out talks their neighbors and make phone calls and inspired Mississippi is get out to vote and I would disagree with the stars fading\nThe establishment spent ... million dollars in negative I Can't speak it twenty four team\nThey had a billion dollars at this time to get space or Fifteen million dollars in negative money in a small state like city\nAll to drive me away and what's the big problem I'm a conservative I'm trying to hold him accountable and they don't want to be held accountable I don't think my story's going anywhere as long as the people on a champion that wants to fight for him I'm going to be that guy\nTell me this do you think that the Kavanaugh hearings are going to have any kind of effect because I I understand that there were senators who they are a lot of focus on Murkowski and flake and Collins and fast and and yet\nI also wondered about the effect\nThat it was going to have when people and especially conservatives like Mississippi looked at this even if you're a Democrat and a bit conservative and you said gosh I don't want my son or daughter held to this kind of standard where a single false accusation with such\nThin evidence given it it was basically her story and her story largely incomplete I Wonder whether that's going to have any kind of effect on the electrode Mississippi\nI Hope that it does I Hope the people of our state come to the conclusion that the Democrats have gone completely I'm completely to the welfare other words they works to so far left there more socialist now that they are Democrat more radical\nThan they are moderate and frankly it's a dangerous party and if we don't find Republicans that can stand in that gap but not just Republicans conservatives that standard the gal to push back\nAgainst that party will go lose this country so we always argue\nThe days of reaching across the aisle or over the days of chase them in the class to the left or over we have to stand in the Gallup male and force discover that took light back toward liberty back where it belongs oil is this country so I Hope people will recognize how dangerous got party has become and how much we have to fight to preserve our way of life\nI'm Talking to a state senator Chris McDaniel who's running for the United States Senate from Mississippi so how can people help you out financially because I Know and he's closing weeks of a campaign a lot of money gets spent and often times like it or not money makes the difference because of advertising and get out the vote yes\nSir it's a big deal to she's out spin on us right now probably Fifteen to one she's got all the ... money ... money in the U.S chamber of commerce suspended buddies out here trying to save her we just need you to help us you guys out there listening met Daniel twenty eight teams dot com\nGo to Daniel Tony Eighteen dot com you'll see my plants or what I Believe in and if you get a chance please come help us Mississippi would love to have a conservative US Senator and I promise you will fight for everybody\nSorry Chris one last thing and that is let's assume you become the next US Senator from the state of Mississippi I'd be pleased by that because I'd love to see you get there I I you got the right values\nAnd and I I fully endorse your candidacy but but tell me is hit in what are you going to be your top priorities is a brand newly minted US Senator staffing\nNumber one ... we have to build that border wall that has to be funded number two term limits\nIt's just time to shock the system and bring some of these career politicians hole and lastly and every vote that I cast but every speech that I feel we have to de centralized power of the federal government at bringing those powers back to the states it back to the people with those powers always belong that government\nIs broken it's dysfunctional it's disconnected I'm sick of politicians and it's time to put the people charged again and that's with every boat that we cast we have to restructure this government\nChris it's a pleasure I it was a pleasure to help you four years ago\nOh wasn't nearly enough I Hope that this time the next time I talked to you after the November election that you are the next US Senator from Mississippi\nShaky so that means a lot to make just keep your prayers and look for to work and we did get one day thank you for everything\nI look forward to it Senator Chris McDaniel who's now a state senator running for the United States Senate glad to get your calls at eight six six eight Lars that's eight six six four three nine five to seven seven and if you want to measure of where America is going right now\nConsider the me too movement consider the movements that openly opposed the choice of American voters in President Donald Trump and then consider this brand new poll reason magazine talks about it\nThey asked Americans about political correctness now\nYou might get slightly different definitions of what political correctness is but I think we all understand it and it's like the old definition from the Supreme Court justice of obscenity I Can't define it but I Know when I see it\nThree fold greater than what he got just six or eight months before and then you say well we're gone this year clearly he's been painted as a racist bigot for the last year and a half by the media\nHis ratings can be very good no they're not ... percent they're not twenty three three times higher they're thirty five percent more than four times the support he got to the polls and sixteen\nAnd I think the left has looked at that and said\nWe're in trouble we bones these voters or at least that's their attitude I think toward black American voters we all these people and they're they're going off the reservation they are now supporting Trump\nI mean what am I going to say when it goes from thirty five percent to say fifty percent by twenty twenty for the next election I think the Democratic party is going to lose its mind\nAll right so I Want to give you some data points to\nMe the number of votes that for about ... what God in two thousand eight at a record for the number of blacks voting for Democrats [noise]\nIt was it had been approaching a higher and higher number from all the way from Ninety two to two thousand eight guess what we've seen it go in the opposite direction block Obama in two thousand twelve set a record for nominee\nAmong black voters actually true for everybody but he is the only president\nTo be successfully reelected and receive pure black votes than he did\nWhen he was first elected in ... Roosevelt named the candidate whether it was a Republican or Democrat\nThey always managed to get more black voters the second time around what did those black voters know here's what we got to see in two thousand six teams in the you just look at black men they gave Donald Trump\nThird team per cent of their vote if in fact black women had voted the same way that black men did that would have been nearly a thirty year high the truth\nIs we hadn't seen this divergence we didn't see it in two thousand twelve two thousand eight two thousand four fish divergence\nYou gave me that that are accurate about the overall numbers there has been a spike among black men for Donald Trump and for rejecting progressive ism that most in the media aren't even wanting to talk about it has more than quadrupled\nWhile and you can imagine the effect tours all of us I think react this way if there's someone I highly respect\nWho comes out and says I'm In favor of something I'm not going to avoid the I I won't ignore the facts on the ground I don't always support what those I admire also support but it's a factor there and it right now the facts are pretty good black entrepreneurship\nFor absolutely ... percent increase in the new black businesses in the last Eighteen months and then record low black unemployment and then a couple that with\nAdmirable figures for both black Americans and white Americans ... they're going to be people who look and say well Connie likes the guy may maybe I should do and that may just pushing them over and I think that's what the Democrats are so concerned about that they are losing what they thought was a guaranteed piece of their electorate\nWas the message that everyone was supposed to understand who don't worry about what you said don't worry about what you feel just believe if the progressive socialist agenda\nIs being pushed forward you're better off well here's an interesting data point three of the five worst unemployment\nDuring the Obama administration's guess what the Kurds unemployment live in the bureau of standards have been recording it within the department of labor\nHad the lowest unemployment now\nWe have said ooh Kurds in America for the number of people in just a last Eighteen month old went on their first ever think family vacation in a decade you are not easily going to be able to convince people that that doesn't matter\nHow do I know because Iraq Obama\nGot fewer votes among black people when he was getting reelected\nThey saw just like everyone else sees policies\nDon't appear to work you know\nThey dumped or us it's a pleasure to have you on well have you back some time to talk about project Twenty one specifically but we appreciate your work with project Twenty one and also the national Center for public\nHealth research we can get you to back adjustable glad to get your calls at eight six six four three nine five to\nSeven email go to talk and Lars Larson\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\nTo the flu season one long green sleeves I can make a world of difference though you can protect yourself and so you're talking co workers helpfully\nNeighbors two month old niece ... loving and specially trained ... provided over ... million police on two thousand and time for your time today with the dollar coated with ... because protecting the world starts with protecting you are plump green thank you know one\nThing to avail ability stage and health related restrictions may play now but I Know\nRight now by poor jokes with an apple synthetic Motorola ... protects your interest from sludge an extreme temperatures so did you know it also protects our troops you know what each purchase of member both synthetic breathing Ninety nine a portion goes to the intrepid fallen heroes for all the parts of the people\nKnow just the price of oil prices will say look exactly the recycling offering seven thirty one Eighteen I'm\nPretty handy around the house but now that I had kids I don't want to then my Saturday and selling a toilet or fixing an air conditioner but thankfully there is ... ...\n... or help me find them back home to my area to handle any kind of project you can read her due to the pro kick their bail ability even book appointment on line and what my wife I Love most is at home in lines are completely free to you at ... dot com Roy download them ... to get started\nBuying somebody W.

streets\nNot clearly about the partisan divide however in these last days there have been exceptions and I remind all of us you cannot be certain you're in a civil war until afterwards that is the case for every civil war going back two thousand years to the Romans so we're doing some guessing here Michael a very good even though I report\nThat earlier in the weekends we all know Mrs Clinton used in temperate language on CNN\nAbout the ... case that the Democrats make running up to the mid term election and in her language she said that it was possible it was likely it was intentional not to be civil in these days because and then she gave a reason not to be civil\nWithin these last ... hours I have a report from the chairman of the Republican Party in New York state at Cox that the New York state Republican Party headquarters at the Manhattan Republican club on eighty third straight he stayed there she was vandalized\nVandalized by unknowns at this point the investigation is underway including having an AA pray at large let her a spray painted on the front door a for anarchist\nAnd having the security system interrupted with gum there was poured into it and a document

have good conscience and clear mind no this state of oppression\nCannot remain the U.S fashion political system is one of the most Savage institutions in history and we will combat it relentlessly until all are free of Americans barbarism that was left behind the threat\nEd Koch tells me a CCTV camera recorded the attackers it was very early in the morning neighbors called the police but they were too late because the attackers were way they were two men a large or small unclear but they were wearing hoods so their faces recovered\nThat's consistent with other things we've seen in Portland

wearing hood to her acting according to Ed Koch center professional matter in other words that are ...\nAre we seeing them everywhere and they're not Republican they're not Democrats their anarchist but is that the force that done least by the language of the leadership and you make the case for that Michael so I Want to press you on this one in this escalation cycle is next to watch for we've had our painting of Sumner that was Kavanaugh\nWe now have individual actions of renegades or outlaws or red flags that's what they called them in Missouri or the riders in Kansas the men who rented Lawrence where is that what next to watch Michael\nWe have permission granted by the leadership at least a blue not quite yet but we have the leadership of sanctioning more aggressive\nActions direct action and that is translating already end of the kind of situations in incidents but you describe and that would correlate to say the kinds of things that emerged in in Kansas and they\nHave the right on Lawrence right All right but also you have\nA more generalized\nAcceptance of the need for resistance as the only possible way\nThat would be that people are getting national ... national laws say in California and she sat right underway defiance of the center because it's regarded utilitarian but\nNow the only way an election outcome that was positive for the levy it would be to suddenly shift focus to blue legislative options\nBut if those took a turn that inflamed read but then you would have a situation\nWhere only talking impeachment Michael that's all I hear from from the man who was appealed his head of the Judiciary Committee who is a representative here in Manhattan he's talking impeachment not only of President Trump but also a ... capital\n[noise] so what do you have is\nThat there is no longer a police bad governance however you define governance whether it's a Supreme Court decision or or laws statutes that are passed by Congress no\nAct of governance can alleviate theirs and in fact any decision\nIn any uh government sphere only in flames\nBut situation so this is where I come up with this idea of of a curve that that at some point gets beyond control but there's no way to call it back and you know other countries like China seeing this\nUnderstand but this is there a moment\nTo potentially intervene once the U.S is fully a mobilized\nTo achieve all of their objectives\nLiquid they just did Michael they disappeared the precedent of Interpol in front of everybody and I have no explanation for he says he resigned his post he's a member of the Communist Party in fact he's a senior figure in the ministry of state security\nAnd they're that China is arrogant to the point of believing that the international community cannot in any way make them pay for that\nMoment the president is through some sort of event shown to be not in charge or to be made\nHim a tent and some form an impeachment would be one of those processes at that moment something will happen abroad and that will be an earth shattering historical moment for the United states in the world and the the\nThe people who decry\nThe president will have been in effect for those who have brought this\nIs Michael there is a reason to make the case now that it's already too late for this that we can stop it that the escalation cycle\nIs there there's pleasure and the escalation cycle for too many parties China Russia to name too but also those allies who are not all that friendly say Germany or Great Britain already going through their own disorder\nAnd that a bit with the American superpower weakened by internal strife\nOr our allies and our phone believe they gain another word that maybe there a moment to take a chance\nAnd we're not we're not prepared to defend ourselves Michael were not an estate I I Do not know if the Democratic party presuming it takes control the house I don't know if they'll follow the constitution I mean going after the president with\nCharges of impeachment based upon you understand that that kind of ...\nShouldn't make a make America a disorganized to the point of not being able to defend itself\nWell people living in the moment who wrapped up in the beliefs that they are in charge\nOr we have less than a minute Michael go hey\nRepresent the leadership those sorts of paypal or not I'm sensitive to nor are they want to shift in which the entire situation ships and there\nIs today I think a larger atmosphere shift in which expectation is now the driving element in other words the Chinese\nAnd the Russians and of course even the Europeans expect that this is going to be a kind of game for America and as a result they are going to act accordingly\nAnd in America people who are in power whether they are red

millennia to different degrees and we're there is a huge aspiration to do a lot more with new pipelines\nNew shipping routes Newport's new rail links and I think we are we're seeing good progress with all of this but I think for for to really see its full potential we're talking another\nFifteen Twenty years there right now we're already seeing huge improvements in a way east and west um travel transit of goods on the Eurasian land mass uh takes place and and I was about to such an important part\nIn all of this so there's one point there's one longitude and the whole year Asian land mass where there are only three countries from the Arctic Ocean to the Arabian Sea and that's Russia or is it by John and Iran\nSo if the U.S or European partners went to conduct trade with East Asia over land and they went to avoid Russia and Iran all the trade has to go the wiser by John\n... that's what makes us so geopolitically important\nAnd with this new port that they're constructing and buck who um the new ... just south of buck who actually uh the potential is really unlimited uh there's a lot of space they have a broken down in different phases they're making good progress\nOn opening of opening up different aspects of this port some of the some of this port is already operational other bits are under construction\nAnd the U.S uses this port actually to ship stuff to Afghanistan and in fact when I was at the port in February there was a ship heading out across the Caspian towards Turkmenistan and I asked where you know what what's on the ship and they said chickens for us troops to eat in Afghanistan\nOr so and it's important for us to here in the United states even though we're several thousand miles away it's important to see this development take place\nAnd what's unique about what's happening in ...\nThis particular port that we're talking about has no Chinese money involved with it so it's about Johnny's doing it themselves knowing that it'd be more appealing

bright for Amazon that is a solar system brand for heaven's sakes do another self made man or is he he is now the president of the United states Donald J Trump the New York times has reported\nAt that they can document and I don't doubt them than Mr Trump inherited more than four hundred million dollars from his father who was a very successful real estate developer in New York and in the boroughs\nI joined the puzzle here is does receiving four hundred million dollars from your father make you a self made man when you're worth billions [noise] Ah yes\nIt most certainly does make you a self made man let's look at the force four hundred there airs in it and there are self made man it it's very rare that there's both in it and Trump's case\nNo one's going tonight it surprised exactly no one that he inherited more than the one million he claimed what his father was a very successful outer borough real estate developer\nObviously a brilliant guy there's no question about that but Donald Trump has his name on buildings and Manhattan the most difficult and competitive real estate market in the world he has his name on buildings around the world by the New York times\nVery own reasoning he is one of the great marketers of all time or relentless marketer relentless dealmaker if that's not self made what he did\nTurning what his father gave him into a global brand I don't know what is\nBecause Mr Trump is often in the news and because we're watching him as a president quite apart from as a business\nAnd what I read in the New York times is that Fred Trump and then the family took advantage of the uh the IRS seeing in in the in\nThe rules that the IRS keeps changing over these last decades about inherited wealth I didn't see any law breaking John So I'm quite puzzled there's resentment for people who have inherited money or the resentment for people who are self made there's this suspicion is that they're doing something sinister\nJohn they're creating jobs it's it's entirely lost apparently the New York times that that money that Donald Trump translated into his branding is worldwide branding has been responsible for generating lots of livelihoods around the world you say it all the time John So I Want you to\nHelp the audience understand why it is that rich people are the job creators\n... let's say I want to stress ... your your point to New York times acknowledge that everything Fred Trump did to avoid taxes was okayed by the Internal Revenue service there was nothing illegal here and thank goodness\nFred Trump did and the Trump family did what Bill gates has family does what Mark Zuckerberg's what any rich person does is try to minimize their tax Bill Bissett gets to your question the rich create all the opportunity precisely

time thank you thanks for calling\nUm George it's always a pleasure I've I've called you a couple of times about turmeric and everything else but Jeffrey you treat me extremely a great late at night and I have some questions I have some issues\nI didn't catch the beginning of the program and I'm not sure where you're from but I Am a up in Minnesota and\nI have had a problem I created when I was back in the marine corps a prior to the war\nUm after I went through that what happened often ... may as I said it would [noise] and I've lost two families or Twenty years worth of family and so I I'm a dedicated man\nAnd I met the bottom of the barrel at the moment and I've tried\nClinton thing my house with same age and everything else [noise] um I mean I've I've I've done everything I've talked to some of the the best people George has had on his show I mean and I'm I'm not kidding anywhere do you have any recommendations that I might not have heard of yet\nPaul definitely give me a a call or email me certainly sage loosen up emotional energy boosters up negative emotional energy soldiers Frank concerns\n... many substances that work very very well loosening up energy is kind of like springs something on the wall to get something off of it\nDoesn't along get rid of the home\nSee that's the problem is is that the age will release it you know out into the atmosphere but it will not move it from your home well not removed from your living environment it has to be actually pushed down into the earth and away from the property in order for it to be removed because\nEssentially what I think it's going on here to Jay Z you've been releasing it by doing these you know really positive things sage Franken sense all of these things you know I recommend them certainly\nBut we're it's releasing them into the atmosphere there's still have to be released from and pushed out from the home\nIn order for them to be out of your life and I think it was going on is that is just accumulated a to the point where it's all around you and you're doing everything you can but now it needs to be forcibly pushed out of your home\nAnd this is where a lot of people have issues you know they do things you know that they they learn on the Internet or from you know qualified people that actually work in to some extent\nBut emotional energy in negative spirits and all of these things need to be forcibly removed from the home so it's kind of like you know\nTaking the Bruins pushing it all the dust into the center of the room we still have to take a dust pan get the you know a broom and get it in the dust pan into the garbage has got to go into the garbage and that's what's not happening\nAll right thanks for them now tell us a little bit about what is exactly negative emotional energy Jeffrey\nPeople generate both positive and a ... a negative emotional energies from the very first day that were born shortage\nAnd these things can become trapped in our bodies energy fields also known as the ... but the or it's not just a bunch of pretty light it is who we are as part of who we are a personality are our emotional systems\nHave an energy field that extends out from the very center of our non physical body which is our spirit\nOr maybe three or four feet outside of our physical body and emotional energy can become trapped over a period of time in just about everybody everybody has the issue\nSo emotional energy that's negative that we generate can be trapped in our bodies energy fields\nAnd we can also pick it up in any kind of store restaurant somebody's home I'm watching TV or you know a tubs every place there is a motion energy enter ... energy field so we don't protect ourselves\nAnd most people don't that it actually permeates into our energy field and mixes with our own emotional energy positive and negative and causes havoc and this is one of the\nBiggest problems that people who call me have it's not it was just demonic spirits the idea is that we are filled full of emotional energy not a positive energy I don't touch I'm not even capable of doing that we only let go of what we want to let\nGo and so I deal with essentially clearing out the negative emotional energy and negative emotional energy is something that ah people want to release\nThey feel a hundred percent better when it's natural\nLet's go to Terry in Houston, Texas welcome to the show Teri go ahead\nYeah George or idea of why I'm a he was going to the original language of the scriptures and my actually writing\nAnd I tell you the Bible with by the navy when I go with a lot of the party a thing and I was going to ask you Jeffrey are you a Christian\nI don't belong to the Christian religion I Do believe in God I also think that ah the argument over creation is a theory is and a true scientific physical theories as ridiculous\nThey pull work hand in hand first principle is creation ferrets don't just sit around and clouds and do and do not paying\nHigher spirits angel God\nYou know they create almost like a bad or of a cake on a non physical level the design of the universe and then comes the physical fill the non physical proceeds the physical\nSo the idea that you know creation is does that happen as the universe created absolutely\nBut also the big bang theory why not so essentially like I said like baking a cake you know that spirit guide angels are in the business\nOr in a wonderful business of actually creating and designing these things perpetually right now as we speak not just the beginning of time but right now\nAnd that filters up it's connected with the physical all things physical so each person has to levels of physical body which is very finite sixty eight years or Fifteen Years or whatever\nAnd our spirit which is completely eternal enter personality which never dies and and I'm really amazed at the argument that or not you have but I mean that is\nBeing fostered out there between religion and scientists which I agree with\nI'm I Am a non physical scientist essentially\nSo I Believe in all of this is science to me you know and I think that you know God has a personality you know whether there was one or two I don't know I'm not sure you know but I Do believe that there I Know there are higher spirits out there because I work with them and I work for them\nAnd so I Do believe you know I worked Christians all the time and I respect that religion and so I you know I think what you're doing this marvelous you know I think that it's just that there's a misinterpretation and needless argument between these two are theories that are both correct\nAnd let's go back to to refer another question go ahead Jerry\nAh yeah what I was going to say is you're talking about religion religion gauges that probation a guy go to church give your money do this don't do that that's not from guy the problem is is that we have many ministers out there that the beach\nOr this type of stuff then basically do they make money off the guy the problem is with the with the whole\nScenario as it turns people off like you Jeffrey\nAnd and I understand that I I really do understand that and I feel sorry for people that don't know this but you got to understand that the only Christianity is not a religion if it if it's a relationship between you and God now why is that\nWell to be an arbitrator you have to be God man Jesus is title is Jean\n... Lord Jesus Christ lord gave the genes is means humanity in crisis means anointed why\nOkay so what happens is because we don't do this in order to be because none of us are perfect on this earth in fact\nIn fact Peter said that I'm a ... ... that God is no respect or person so we're all in the same boat it would be no matter how much knowledge we know we're all in the same boat with God because we have is the nature\nBecause we're we're born in stand because of Adam's then because we carry out and then ah our entire life we we are and and even Paul that this that that none of us are the glory of God we were all on the same boat\nBut those demons seemed to be every where we're going to come back and take final calls in a moment on the coast to coast am\nNow is your ... vitamin D three formula a manufactured here in the U.S Dr ...\nAbsolutely my formulas manufactured right here in the usa critics in fact we have a facility that is a C. G. M. P. certified lab which means current good manufacturing practices and this isn't the mandated set of rules that we follow as a matter of fact just recently the\nAction and they said hey guys keep up the good work\nNow you mentioned earlier that there's a strong connection between vitamin D and diabetes talk a little bit about how your ... will be three formula could help folks that are dealing with diabetes or even at risk of getting diabetes\nDiabetes is a huge problem and in type two diabetic what we find is that there's plenty of insulin in the body but the insulin is not recognized by the south and so ... vitamin D street does is it takes that problem and it seems to fix it now\nThey've studied the vitamin D three and prove this insulin sure by sixty percent and compare it to the most popular diabetic Dr improve the Thirteen percent\nWow now let me ask you this doctor bank is how can you fast smelled these three formula help boost your immune system\nVitamin D is responsible for two hundred different chemicals that you're immune cells produce to fight off bacteria and viruses that says here's something on that susceptible to having any type of called ... I Would start right now taking one of my vitamin D three miles every day\nAnd one of the nice things about this is that the size of your immune system being better\nYou'll find your energy better you'll find less and less arthritic type pain more mobility flexibility fatter muscle strength and if you're someone who is concerned about falling it'll have better balance and a better sense of walking which is so important is that\nSo and then how do you take a doctor being as\nYou can take it in the morning you can take it at night if you don't need water can you put in your mouth and you know maybe ... to thirtieth going\nWow and maybe you can share again for those that may have just joined us some of the responses that you get from people that have been taking your formula and what kind of results of basing\nLet me tell you my own story so over the summer I didn't take as much you might do three I was actually traveling and I ran out of it\nSo what happened to me is basically a pain free but all of a sudden I started having pain in my hand I Know what is this this is weird but then I realized that I had run on the streets formula and I went off of it for several weeks and the minute I started going on and it took about\nSeven maybe eight days the pain went away\nWow crazy isn't it\nLet's say you know something's working right if you stop and the health issues come back well there's your answer\nSo that's the best that anyone can listen to especially if you're on the fence\nYou go I Wonder if this is really for me and for it I Would do the next time you give up the number to have people orders is go ahead and order it I Know you mentioned that the risks free offer and go ahead and try yourself and stay on it for five six weeks and then if you're still doubt it then go off of it and see if anything gets worse\nAnd again folks and want to take a moment here to let you listeners know that if you want to try Dr ... says vitamin D three formula there's a special toll free number for you to call it's one eight hundred for six seven zero to nine age\nAs we've been talking about Dr ... vitamin D three formula is a fence dissolving meld that's available for immediate absorption by your body for rapid results and by getting Dr ... says vitamin D three into your body\nYou're going to have bolstered immune system improved balance stronger muscles\nAnd fewer aches and pains and keep in mind folks Dr ... says arranged a very special offers only available to you listeners so when you do call me surely mentioned this program and you'll get a risk free trial of Dr ... vitamin D three\nAgain this is only available to your listeners in only if you call this toll free number\nIt's one of eight hundred for six seven zero to nine eight\nPlus if you'd call right now you qualify for an extra free supply with the order to keep yourself or share with a family member or friend but you must call now because this special radio off or is not available in stores or on line so the number to call is one eight hundred\nFor six seven zero to nine aid and keep in mind you have absolutely nothing to lose here because Dr ... vitamin D three formula is guaranteed to be safe and effective or your money back\nAnd when you do call and order you'll not be enrolled in any of those monthly subscription programs as as a one time order folk so the number to call is one eight hundred\nFor six seven zero to nine eight and I give it to you again it's one eight hundred for six seven zero to nine eight [noise]\nSo what do you think folks are you one of the Seventy percent of people listening most likely taking the wrong type of vitamin D supplements joining us today is our good friend Dr Michael ... and we've been talking about his fast melt vitamin D three formula\nAnd Dr biggest what you're saying is that most of us are deficient in vitamin D\nAnd because of that deficiency it's causing health issues like pain muscle weakness immune problems and the most vitamin D supplements are not the best form and more importantly is not the right amount of vitamin D to really make an impact is that what you're saying\nExactly what I'm saying if it's a multifaceted problem where one for not getting enough vitamin D three in our system\nVitamin these trees are responsible for activating two thousand different genes in the body controlling everything from diabetes to hormone production to\nMuscle strength of eating correctly digestion immune system\nIt's a really long list and honestly a surprise me because in medical school\nWe learned that vitamin D was necessary for the bombs we get enough being outside and in our milk and end of story right and for the first\nTwenty some years I practice I never prescribe vitamin D I just didn't think it was necessary and then in the early to thousands of the study started coming out and now there is over twenty three hundred studies\nThat just show that vitamin D is absolutely necessary it's not just a good idea it's absolutely necessary and it's a hormone that should be in the body and it's not there\nAnd you share some of that research Dr ... and more importantly what conclusion of the research related to vitamin D\nWell one of the biggest studies ever on vitamin D for from the U.S navy\nOkay so I think it was like a hundred and forty five thousand men and women were studied and they found that\nThe number one and a non combat reason that people died in the navy\nWas due to melanoma so skin cancer so I'm reading this study you know I I kind of plot is right there and I went yeah it makes sense you know people are out on the decks of ships in the equator and all over the world and they're getting the harmful ... young raise and and they're developing skin cancer but then I read it\nAnd I said most of the victim office workers like clerks and people in hangers and inside and out all night it was a link going back to vitamin D deficiency in the body\nWhat about muscle and bone strength can your dean three formula help with that\nYeah it's critical like if you're someone that's over fifty especially here seeing a progression of the core muscles in your body is starting to slow down for us it's kind of a closet thing is\nThat people kind of feel like they're getting clumsy physically and then it's a lack of flexibility that you start to stiffen up and you feel at night especially if you're in bed\nBerlin from side to side you wake up with your knees hurt in your legs are restless your shoulders her that this set in the end that's associated with a lack of vitamin D three and my formula\nSo if you're someone listening right now and you're having a lot of joint pain ball and pain muscle pain\nFibromyalgia I Would say on my formula like immediately and start taking one or two of my ... three's a day for the first week or two to get your doses up quickly\nSo let me ask you about these gummy vitamins does that work can you put enough vitamin D into a little gummy bear and is that the best way to get it in your body\nOf course Chris you know they'll go to any type of lengths to try to market things that theme good but you're taking a lot of sugar and gelatin waxed and my thing is it's not what you what your body absorb\nWhile I Want to talk more about what happens when people start taking your fast smell the three formula\nBoy that's a really good question because the first area that vitamin D seems to affect your energy\nYour sleep your outlook your mood and then after being on it for a while here core strengths will come back so for those who have slowed down you're going to feel more energy like physically and so it's kind of like the only in a little bit younger crashed\nYears that's just not what do you see is all

administration seems to be taking a cautious approach in part because of its ties to the Saudi kingdom\nAnd critics let's say that the president is already taking some pressure off of\nThe kingdom and Saudi Arabia and saying that if even if they didn't do this we're still going to continue doing business with Adam ... senators on the health saying that they shouldn't be a reason to stop the though is a commitment that we have made to Saudi Arabia is a hundred and ten\nBillion dollars that the Saudis are buying in terms of US military equipment so that is a lot of money and the president is arguing lesson I don't want to jeopardize the business that's happening between the U.S companies and Saudi Arabia\nBecause other countries are going to come in and fill that void like China\nAnd Russia but at this point the question as well if it is proven that Saudi Arabia\nIs to fault did actually murder can now show he didn't miss a commitment is military agreement sale a be in jeopardy and that puts editors are arguing that the White House has yet to say that that would be the case\nAnd there's clearly a difference between how the White House is approaching the showcase compared to the senator's we heard from from the Foreign Relations committee\nAnd so it's really a disconnect and in terms of how they want to approach this situation the Trump Administration is saying we need to get the facts here yeah the Turks day that they have evidence and as you read earlier the Washington Post is reporting that they have both video and audio of this murder\nHappening but the U.S does

you see or did not see Dr Ford testimony that reminded you of what you actually experiencing those coach\nSaid well I think that um it it did remind me of the fact that I felt that she actually had

points in two days here to make sense of it all and she always does is CBS News business analyst Joe singer Jill no one likes to see these kinds of jobs but in perspective we've been there done that got it back and then some\nWell you know it's an interesting time because the economy is growing and in fact is growing at night clip probably for all twenty Eighteen will see somewhere around three percent GDP and that would be the best and a bunch of years\nBut as a result of that stronger gross what we're also seeing is that interest rates are rising and actually quite good that when an economy strengthens we're no longer at these emergency zero percent levels\nAnd we know that the Federal Reserve had already started to raise interest rates as early in the end of twenty Fifteen\nSo what does that mean as interest rates go up and the economy is strengthening it means that the cost of borrowing right is backing go from ... from a credit\nAn auto loan mortgage a corporate bond up the company borrowing money all of that gets more expensive and the fear that we started to see this week was one that was\nI Would classify as a very classic investor fear or what if interest rates go up by so much that they know that economic growth and I think\nSame time considering that the stock market is so well especially in the last three years or so\nWhat would it mean for me to just take some of my money out of the stock market and rotate that into the relative safety of the bond market and that's kind of the yin yang of what's going on in the marketplace right now\nAnd so what you have is you have some analysts saying look I mean interest rate rises as you point out uh can happen in an economy like this it's not the end of the world we can move on on the other hand you've got the president who is saying [noise]\nUm I don't really like what the fed is doing at this point I Wish they'd slow it down and uh so you've got to at least on the surface different messages happening there\nI think that that the president is missing a very good opportunity to actually pray the Federal Reserve and don't forget\nThis Federal Reserve is essentially comprised of most of the people at least you know who are on the Federal Reserve board including the chairman our pick of the president\nAnd I think instead of saying oh the feds moving too fast what I think he should be saying is\nIs the fed doing a smart thing because the economy's go growling wages are starting to ride this is the lowest unemployment rate in forty nine years isn't that sad really smart like investors you know wake up to the bed in fact\nThis kind of an economy can absorb higher interest rates I think that that would be much more credible message and one that economists could actually get behind instead of rolling their eyes and saying it's not normal for a president to call his bed share locale Ben\nIs always long term investors or you know just to keep the blinders on and keep looking forward\nWell it's funny I got a question from a radio listener and who said I'm retiring at the end of this year I'm sixty six years old\nI presume that I should do something and my response

... certainly hope everything's going well around your house today we've got a lot of things that we've been dealing with on this week show and you know one of the things that we that we like to call to your attention every\nYear is fire prevention week that took place just this last week of October seventh through the thirteenth so we always feel like we need to\nThink about some ways to keep you safe around your home you know about fire extinguishers you know about how important the smoke alarms\nAnd carbon monoxide detectors are around the home but also would your improving your home you have an opportunity to choose different products that are a little more fire resistant right now we\nHave our friend Dave Smith on with the rock hall who is I'm very excited to be able to tell us a little bit more about rock cool and some of the things that it can do to really help a kind of making a little safer around your home for your family stayed always great have you on the show a great can be here thanks for me to any\nYou know when you when you think of it of course we've been able to share um um the advantages of rock ... roll\nThere are TV viewers and radio listeners for for several years but you know now that has been out there a while people are really resonating with how um how important it is when you're choosing some products and ah it's so good\nThat rock well is fire resistant but why is it more resistant than other installations\nThat comes down to what it's made out of 'em\nSo rock will but the main\nAlerts do it's made of rock and rock's don't burn\nAh so what do you think about materials that you can use it in your house and then your installation you're doing a space or an addict or you're finishing a basement or putting an addition on your home you have the opportunity to you know choose the insulation\nI'm that you want to use and um the fact is a lot of other materials you know are made of material that is a non ... um but because our ... that song about small and and it won't it won't burns it won't help spreading the fire Idaho a block\nFire and then sort of it's sort of a passive resistance when it comes to fire\nYeah Dave I'm Glad I'm Glad you mentioned that because I think a lot of people assume that almost all the insulation is fireproof\nAnd it's not even fire resistant and most of them are now and the great thing about rock well being made on the rocks you know it's the fire resistant and I think I remember when we spoke last time I had quoted a number\nThat it was fire resistant up to a certain number of years since upgraded that right now what what is it it's like some ridiculous like fourteen hundred degrees or something isn't it\nThe number is actually a two thousand one hundred and fifty degrees Fahrenheit that sort of was right\nTwenty one fifty degrees Fahrenheit so at that point it will melt\n'em do it it's non ... meaning it won't ever at any point at all to the fire 'em but it does have a a melting point right with that at a very very high heat at ... at that point and there's really no other inflation um comes close to that melting point I mean I think it's important to note\nI mean other types of insulation like fiberglass material is also non combustible\nMelting point of it is much lower and I was saying\nYou know much lower it\nIn any insulation that has facing on whether it's Kraft paper for oil I mean that in itself\nThat in itself is absolutely\nHave any right rock well doesn't need or how the facing on it right yes correct\nYou know another thing day we like to point out the homeowners that that they want to do some things to their home and improve it and so forth it it really doesn't matter what insulation you have any ... now you can really use rock will to supplement that because\nI'm a you know there's so many houses over half the houses in the U.S and Canada just don't have enough insulation and I'm\nSo rock ... works very very well on top of anything right\nCorrect yeah yeah for sure if you're if you're just adding a an addict situation um for sure you know it's a very dense material so any anything about addict it will settle or it won't\nBlow away or you know there's something to the issue that that happened in ... states overtime you know because of the density of it\nMakes it makes there is a good solution for that sort of an area\nWell because of the way is made up at all so it was about the easiest insulation I've ever dealt with in terms of installing it's you know you break out the old ... knife and you're able to kind of carve out the little areas around any a roof supports that you have\nOr any of the plumbing pipes or anything that you have to cut around and in that it can really be a headache when you're using other type of insulation but and the important thing about that is that's important to tighten it up around those pipes as much as you can and ah I've never seen anything easier than ... and being able to do that very thing\nThey exactly I mean that's that's one or the other benefits because of the friction fit uh that you get out of it when you cut it a popular sort of forces you to do it correctly and when you get that takes you get a better insulating factor with a lot of people\nDon't want to you know especially contractors don't emit through his is what it was a specially with with fiberglass as people sort of push it to shove it\nAnd could sit around obstructions which essentially you're just giving them for some insulation on that point if you've crushed it though it's not going to be it's not going to have any sleep exactly at that point\nAnd certainly another benefit of course with a meal do resistance mold resistant\nAnd just you know overall moisture resistant properties to making great for crawl spaces are just about\nAny place so you haven't we we want to remind everybody we've got some great videos on line at today's homeowner dot com where we've actually installed a lot of rock cool in addicts under houses all over the place\nAnd certainly rock full dot com Lance or any other questions that you may have stave it's all always great to to have you on the radio show and

get set that up with wires are touching the wires on the eve and post\nBetter on the deck and have a mangled as they come off\nRight so is it is it son or rain\nBut it's not so much as the sun but also the rain to okay so so you want a blocks on an rank well somewhat of the rain it got assigned is most important because that the dries out the wood and write write dries out the people on the
