who's an attorney and an expert on victim culture false allegations and attacks on due process not to mention title nine Michele welcome back to the program\nKen Hi thanks for having me\nSo what is the victim culture doing to America\nWell pretty much ruining it I mean you know you only have to look at what's going on with the judge Kavanaugh said that um that we've created a victim culture where it is a an honor to be a victim is something to be tried for about\n... something to boast about and it's causing a lot of problems because when you're a victim you get a pass on everything you you don't have responsibility for whatever you did you know I made a bad grade on the class because bill in the blank you know on a victim so it's it's causing a\nProblem and a lot of ways um and creating a whole generation of women do save it sounds as victims is no one's idea as a as a good thing\nI agree with you in fact we see people complimented on their courage for bringing a charged forward I Would imagine that\nYou know to the extent that Christine Ford believes what she said under oath last week let's assume she actually believes it whether it's true or not is another matter that she was you know she was congratulated on her courage for bringing in foreign she knew the Jude phrase a certain amount of\nPublic or I guess negative reaction what you would also get an awful lot of positive reaction to not to mention some of the financial rewards that have already begun begun to roll in in the form of about I think at last count about eight hundred thousand dollars into ago fun me account so there are negatives but there are positives as well\nBut she's congratulated because she had the courage to say something about it she says this has trouble there for more than a third of the century\nAnd these other two accusers Debbie Ramirez who doesn't entirely remember what exactly what happened at Yale University and then we of Julie sweating it apparently didn't NBC interview today in which he began to back off of some of the claims that she made she had said that\nYou know bread cabin on mark judge had spiked the punch\nTo ah intoxicated young women children really\nAnd and to take sexual advantage of them will she's now backed off of that\nSaying merely she saw cabinet off by the punch bowl which I don't think is exactly an indictment but I mean literally she said well when asked by NBC News Monday whether she saw Kavanaugh slip substances into drinks which is what she said as recently as last week ... said she only witness to him by the punch well\nIf you say why is that a big deal\nIf the FBI has been out to have a chat with her if she told a lie to the FBI that's criminally punishable so I'm Wondering if maybe that's the reason that her story is changing just a week later\n[laughter] well I Wonder a lot about that and taking politics out of it completely because I'm not looking at it I I Do title nine representation I represent nails to falsely accused of sexual assaults\nEvery day that's what I Do so I see that when I look at it I I don't see a political issue I see exactly what\nIs happening to the students I represent every day somebody makes a statement and they're the hero and they're the victim and the one with the courage to come forward and being a rape victim these days is an honor it's that bad you know where\nBecome the trends and it's really really concerning because first of all it destroys so many lives of the ones they're accusing\nAnd what they're calling rape is no longer the definition of rape that we used to have and the criminal definition it's changed completely and they're taking away all the due process concerned so I just thought the whole idea of it is\nFairly ridiculous and you know there's ... there's a pride that goes with is the victim mentality and I think that's part of what is is\nStirring it up on it it's kind of silent pride that you know I'm a victim and therefore whatever I've done to screw up in my life is not my fault it is not my responsibility as someone else is it because they did that to me it is not on me\nYou know all the problems that I've had any fault you can't throw it back on me because\nIt's not my fault victims\n... sounds like you're trembling me for the last Twenty years because I remember Twenty years ago saying doing producer who happened to be a young lady\nI said to her I said I Need to find my victim status today and she said what do you mean I said it seems that everybody who is a victim\nHas status that ordinary human beings do not have and she said well where would you find it and I said well let's see when I was ten my mom was killed by a drunk driver I was in the car and I dragged her body out from under the car when my my father and I managed to get her out from under the car\nAnd I said so by that standard I should have been a victim status that I can get away with just about anything\nExcept I I never thought of that as a way of saying well if I if I yell at one of my co workers I can say well you know my mom died when I was ten or if I drink too much alcohol I can say well my mom died when I was in other words\nEvery single thing I might do that somebody might object to I can say it's because my mom died when I was done I think my mom would reach down from heaven and slapped me upside the head if I did something like that because I don't have to do\nBecause I mean I'm also a therapist and and I say that just to turn it back up what I'm about to say but even you know you go through life and the goal is not seeing them as being a victim\nIt stunts do you does your ... and your growth as a person and what you're going to do in your life and in it and he's a relationship everything so the goal is to not be the victim and can help people recognize when they're being the victim and snap out of it you know you don't really\nThat's not really a real terms snap out of it but seriously to kind of open your eyes and see that being a victim is not helping you it is hurting you it's and now we have this group of women that are coming along and they're taking\nIt taking on that with that but it's what they want to be as a victim I mean I've never seen anything like it it's really bizarre it's it's like a cult and such a victim cooks\nAnd unfortunately as you point out when somebody begins to say if I don't perform as well at work or need to take more sick days where I couldn't finish my college degree is not because I wasn't studious enough\nIt's because I'm a victim as opposed to saying you know and and we're all proud of those people who came back from World war two the greatest generation and I saw her referred things that make most of what's\nBut you know pale by comparison and then come back and cry and their beer they came back and built the modern America that we live in today so I get a little irritated at people who say well everything about me is is defined by my victim hood Michelle keep up the good work do you have a ... do you have a website real quick\nAnd I thought I think he's right it's the same kind of thing I've said that you're really playing a trick on a whole generation or two when you say to young ladies if you have a baby you can have a ... as long as you don't get married and and provide a father for that child abuse the government will send you a check\nAnd I do some ... marriage and cohesive families um the w._b. ... boys uh you know back back in the day was the guy who pointed out that you you had a largely intact black family structure in the early part of the Nineteen hundreds Nineteen hundreds of Nineteen twenty or thirty and it was largely intact\nAnd then in the sixties came along and the great society under Lyndon Johnson and they dismantled all of that I think for political reasons under ...\nA lot of these policies have been in place for so long these policies these missiles into the job and it said that he's going to have the words loading a Democrat for the rest of the for the rest of their lives I think that these are the things that\nThat that that the left is not a black a black people in the left aren't looking at that not that no one is educating them all that you have an doctor in the colleges were there and Dr ... where they're pushing all of the Democrat policies but then you have\nYou know people who are ... degeneration of ... of all my payments voted Democrat my grandparents Democrat so I'm going to go Democrat and what happens is Kanye West is saying that uh nothing now if you don't have\nTo vote what your parents loaded you don't have to go for what people for what a what they knew what the society says you must go you can be an individual use your hard drive for what your heart both ... with your heart says don't just vote because it's popular vote Democrat\nAnd actually I think it'd be great of every group of voters instead of voting based on as you say skin color age or gender or whatever if every group played a little bit hard to get so if I'm going to vote for you the Democrat or you the Republican what are you going to do to make my family and my country better off\nAnd whichever party gives you the you know the the kind of policy that will actually produced that result you vote for them and if you voted along for a couple of cycles and they don't deliver you say hey I voted for you you didn't deliver I'm going somewhere else\nOr large organization currently is what we're doing a national day of action\nFor black conservatives all around the country but one thing that we're doing is we're telling people is to make politicians work for your vote and I guarantee once we start was that starts to sit in the Democrats will not no longer have the power back because they haven't done anything I was in Chicago and I was met with people [noise] um\nI met with representatives on ... and some other individual I said well our representatives aren't and soon followed our ultimate on answering the phone I said because that's because they already have your vote because you've already given to them and you won't voting thing they'll send you have been married to them and so they say that they don't have to work for like a marriage\nIt's like a marriage when you had that honeymoon period and then added a honeymoon period in history that they just do whatever they want to do because you're not going to get a divorce that's how it is\nAnd and you know id onto that applies to men and women look I my wife does not take me for granted and I don't take her for granted we've been together for almost twenty five years and married for almost twenty three years now but we understand the minute you start to take the other one for granted\nYou're really you're you're casting them the worst kind of insult you can throw him which has beer here you're going to stick around I don't have to work hard\nAnd and my work hard I mean what can I Do today that will be good for my wife and good for my family and if she she should be thinking the same kind of thing\n[noise] I agree and that's the problem and so we have to change that we have and do we have there has to be a news or the best is Republican probably we have to simplify a message and we have to make sure that we're going into communities where Democrats aren't because they figure they don't\nHave to do we have to go into this community and we have to share the Republican message that's why the black conservative federation we're promoting economic stability education of Aspen in community involved and three Republican principles\nAnd the the African American community\nAnd we are pushing the conservative message\nI ... I Know people can Google it a black conservative federation what's the website for the group\nAnd you can visit us at B. C.

S. M. C. A. that includes both Canada and Mexico has this way of approaching trade deals by saying we will use terms of we have to to get our trade partners back to the table and negotiate a better deal for America has this worked out the way Donald Trump said it was going to work out\nQuite I have to say because you know like is that there's absolutely no doubt that there's a big relief uh\nFrom investors and the market and uh and everyone honestly about the agreement that was a there was announced late last night but that is because it took a\nVery ... of an edge that was created by the chaos a of Mrs Trump won overwhelming benefit is that now we have a deal but the only reason why we were um you\nMay not having a deal is because Mr Trump said he was going to go out for a lower terrorists here in really not getting any of this because the mental terrorists\nAre still on me that that we tell your story Therese from Mexico and Canada are still on and honestly that concession that Canada did on bury 'em they're they're pretty minor I think we have to remember what we're talking about terrorists the the\n... we have to remember what we had under NAFTA under NAFTA all us exports we're going to Mexico unity free all non ag exports\nFrom by the U.S we're going to Canada duty free\nAnd Ninety seven percent of the value of I exports we're going to Canada duty free and so yes they were so stubborn like the dairy dairy um um terrorists and they are they were about but they will mostly bad for Canadian consumers\nFor some of our industries dairy for example you mentioned we got concessions from Canada what we've been able to get those any other way\nYes but so you're you're a thing like basically yes for a dairy producer that don't forget we have a massive trade surplus when it comes to dairy Canada so they were already you know a\nFarmer's American farmers are doing really great under NAFTA and um and and but a few\nDairy farmers will be able to have more access to the to the to the market a market that they had fair a fairly good access to in the past but Canadian consumers\nAre going to be ripping off fairly better because the prices for them is going down\nQuite you know quite important place\nShowed shows their prices will go down but more American farmers will be able to sell their products in Canada we heard famously about the two hundred and Seventy ... there were being charge on American goods that meant that\nAn American farmer who's costs are probably relatively the same as a Canadian farmer\nOwned cows he's got to have for equipment and buildings and he's got to feed the cows that they use products had to be sold said maybe one third the cost in Canada to be able to compete with the locally produced milk cheese butter all the rest of that and\nAnd yet we had we had a massive trade surplus and dairy with Canada\nAnd then we ... we shouldn't be getting the impression that because I could tumors in Canada I we're ... we're going to have to pay a really much higher price um than uh because of the terrorists than they would otherwise they weren't buying a ton of dairy\nFrom from from the U.S they were and it's and it's because you know the the way the\nCanadians suddenly the work is very different than ours it's like it's it's a lot of quotas on how much that can produce still and much higher prices and things like this so I'm it it it's a different system and it's one where he in spite\nOf the the import tax imposed by Canada Canadian it was still in their interest to buy a lot of dairies from the U.S that said I think it's a very good thing\nIt's a good thing for the farmers they'll sell more it's a great thing for Canadian consumers but it's also worth putting it in perspective that tariffs although we're not an issue\nWith NAFTA because most terrorists were zero most exports\nAh with this one example where we're actually at zero if their problem was trade barriers they're mostly on found in regulation than other things and and I don't know that we're getting a good deal on auto because I'm going to lead to higher prices of automobile now\nYou know if you think that um uh maybe some of the small benefits to union\nWorkers is is a good thing and then you'll think it's a good thing if you're a consumer of cars in the U.S it's not a good thing but again\nIt could have been much worse and and and and it's a deal that people will learn to live with I don't think we should expect expect expect massive changes in employment but I don't think we should expect a expect massive jobs\nTo come back to the U.S because a lot of the loss of jobs and manufacturing started in Nineteen fifty is due to automation but\nIt's better to have a deal than not do you have a deal and it could have been much worse\nThan let me ask you about some specific so I'll watch the president this morning talking about the deal and I've I've done some other research on one because we don't I mean some of the particulars we don't have publicly yet\nBut they said that more car and truck porch will be made in North America and that that is a boost from the old NAFTA and forty percent of the work on a ... truck we'll have to be done by workers making at least sixteen dollars an hour and they said that and obviously this\nAny trade deal has to be a winner not just for people buying and selling things were making things but also for people who are employed in the manufacture things\nIf there is a minimum requirement that forty percent of the power to the work on a car has to be done by people at sixteen bucks an hour that is for the most part Canadian for American workers and probably not Mexican origin workers' rights\nThat that is true but it doesn't mean that actually they will that the supply that first let's let's\nFirst say that um it's not as if we're going from a system where they will no requirement\nTo assist in that now has all these requirements on neighbor or certainly it is but I'm actually quite surprised but you actually find\nThat a good to impose increasing the cost of labor because if the Democrats were asking for an increase the minimum wage you're sixteen percent you will understand that this is a great distortion to the American labor market and it's not a good thing\nBut now let's let's just say that that are under the deal as a weakness especially\nConsidering the protection\nUh the Canadian and the Mexican from potential terrorists and the future it is very possible that\nThese requirements are at higher wages and also the more towards saying in Canada and Mexico and um and and the U.S auto parts will just means at oh the makers are going to not change their supply chain\nBut instead well this guy just face a two point five percent care\nThat the U.S has in place is going to get in on their on their\nOn their own you know fitness bottle light and they're not going to be a one size fit all but it is the assuming that everyone will change their supply chain I think it is wrong\nBut um we we have continued to move on we we go to country music outdoor festival all year long we continued to do it we'd been back to Vegas we we're not going to stop living\nBut it's still in the back of your oh it's here for the for until\nJust a few weeks ago I was still afraid of my own shadow loud noises we can't stand the

going to go\nIt almost sounds like more a little more ... you're giving the best testimony for what we always ... you know to be advised folks we get from some other folks who talk about these things is when you walk into any place doesn't matter where it is more creative ways to get out before you answer now left\nAnd my father my father was always an advocate of that growing up I mean he he taught us to be very aware of our surroundings at all times and [noise] you know\nI think I think that really helped and again my husband kept the whole head and we just followed his follow his lead and um but we were we were some of the very last groups to leave we were there during the entire gunfire\nOr your husband do some good advice student in retrospect to go down and dirty don't\nYes yes and then again there were just\nRandom people who were who said that\nYou know there were two police officers on the other side of the rail they'd been there all all evening long just standard protocol that concert you know you have off duty or you know you have often there's that are here to come and my instinct was I got down I knew what my husband told us to do\nBut I wanted over that

with a whimper\nBecause remember Russia gate park with ultimately a political investigation\nBecause they're never really was that much man they're so ... is conducting of course in church supervising a criminal investigation but it seems to come up largely dry for Eighteen months other than for the predictions of Paul Manafort Sticky Fingers and what what other people\nSo but bottom line is how to

the\nRussia investigation that's also trash I mean kidding aside it affects ah it's fresh and I I have to say you know Washington has been consumed by the Russia investigation\nBut when you talk to Democrats about what their holders are concerned about and what are the party is concerned about what they're running on\nRussia and its merits issues and it's it's cultural issues and policy issues\nAnd so I'm not surprised that this has taken center stage way from the rest of the Russia investigation that's always been a sort of noise of the election the under current but it's never been what everybody else was talking about out in the country right or left\nThat are used to have a question for us you know what are some of those issues that they're running on you guys for the Democrats are using John healthcare\nTo in some areas immigration namely the seizure of the children's supposedly the border and of course Trump Trump Trump Trump is the director of democracy\nThat Trump Trump Trump David a Trump is the message is that it\nWell I think John trying to hit on it they're running on health care but I have to say and this and the irony of irony there finally ... running on Obamacare in and they have traction on it it is not a liability anymore and they're running to preserve the elements of it but you know they try and running on all of the ...\nSome of it when Obama was president when they just passed it and then a couple of years after and it was all the big fat belly now it's finally\nWorking for them or at very least it's not hurting them and in fact it's Republicans that are here and there on the defensive you know say no and not going to take away your pre existing conditions protection and things like that\nSo it's health care and and then there are economic issues that are running on it and as John said put the brakes on Trump\nTo put the brakes on ... so John and and Thaddeus and David quickly wages have ten seconds no Russia gate and

I'm told that I'm following the reporting the deal extends to ten years the minimum data protection period for biologic drugs\nAnd that means that Mexico and Canada will wait longer for lower costs

spend\nYes that's exactly right I'm In for the past decade\nThe defense department on October first as been dealing with a continuing resolution which is a document the Congress passes to say we didn't get our work done on time so you're allowed to continue spending at the exact same rate on the exact same things that we're spending on in the previous fiscal year\nUntil and then there's a blank there that they fill in with a particular date\nNow there are some smaller agencies this year that are working on a continuing resolution until December seventh but what is noteworthy is\nThe defense department is not it has appropriated money starting today the department of Veterans Affairs has appropriated money starting today\nThe Labor Department the department of health and Human Services and others have fully appropriated budgets for the entire ... entire fiscal year starting today and that's a rarity over the last ten or twelve years in Washington\nHundred billion dollars for the VA so let's spend it now we go to mar a Lago which is a very expensive place so we can spend two hundred billion dollars there there's a golf course the president of the United states is very happy when he's been Simon mar a Lago however there was a flat\nAnd that's the way I describe it in stars and stripes about the new secretary at the VA Mr Wilkie Robert Wilkie and whether he hangs out at the at mar a Lago whether he has instant messaging with mar a Lago how does the flap go France as well\nIf this was the first hearing that secretary Wilkie undertook with the Senate Veterans' Affairs committee after being sworn into office and so it was the first time he was before the committee since a report came out and ProPublica in August\nThat has now become a debate because judge Kavanaugh before the Senate Judiciary committee within these last days defended himself from allegations that are completely over the top craze and yet because he was in Tempe print in defending his honor his family's life\nThat means he can't sit on the court goes the argument Andy I don't back it up with any facts because there are none but the idea of judicial temperament is late to the game what is it that the Democrats hope to achieve by throwing this down good evening to\nAnything John well what they want to achieve with every single aspect of their strategy with respect to Kavanaugh is delay so the more issues they can raise but more things that need inquiry into the more witnesses that need to be a deposed or interviewed\nThe more they can argue that this needs to be pushed back in time and the ultimate objective here of course is to push it back beyond the midterm elections in the Democrats hope that they will\nTake over the Senate take control of it and then be able to defeat Kevin ... on the numbers\nSo the judicial temperament argument is just noise that it doesn't come doesn't actually exist or did they just make this a\nWell they didn't make it up I mean they're they're reacting to Kavanaugh's are very uh indignant at times passionate\nSpirited defense of himself in his honor which is not only been smeared\nDragged through the mud but I I I Believe if you um if you look at what\nSome of the things that have been set about cabinet I mean they actually called him a serial rapist on absolutely zero evidence\nThe ... even a stick in the case against him is collapsing for want\nOf any corroboration or verification\nThese outlandish uh and and really smearing a awful things that they've said about him continue to ring in the air so he reacted to that as any normal person would react to it or they regard that as an temper it I thought it was actually quite temperate under the circumstances\nI mean I guess uh you know\nAristotle would would remind us that we have temper for a reason right so the question is what is it for and if it's not for occasions like that I don't know what it's for that is\nAlso plays a part and now ... seems to bring into the argument that he drinks too much just quite any\nCorroborating evidence for bats actually the case [laughter] as part of it or are these are ... are looking for things now in addition to just ... temperament anything like an anger head on to extend their sort of car to swear Republican broke\nYeah I think that's exactly right of course they'd like to to sway Republican votes and they've seen in the case of a Jeff Flake who\nCollapsed after say he was going to vote for Kavanaugh or it turned into a vote with the caviar to delay when he was accosted in an elevator by what turned out to be too hard left progressive activists so they have reason Thaddeus to to think that it works\nSo why not do it but I I Do think that while they hope to collect Republican votes along the way they they realize that that's less likely been the strategy of delay which Republicans unfortunately bought into\nHow does the allegation of had drinking in college work for judicial temperament or is this completely separate uh allocation\nWell I I don't they haven't John to my knowledge tied the the drinking allegation to judicial temperament and I guess we should tell our listeners that ... in terms of judge Kavanaugh the allegation of a lack of judicial temperament is particularly absurd\nBecause unlike some nominees to the bench he's actually been on the bench for twelve years\nAnd is widely acclaimed by colleagues by people who appear before him by people who've worked for him or as one of the most a civil and thoughtful people to appear before a model of judicial temperament in fact a Kavanaugh's very diverse\nStable of law clerks is coveted by a\nNot only are members of the bar but also by the Supreme Court he has sent more uh clerks to the Supreme Court ah than virtually anybody at his experience level so\nYou know the idea of all the things to attack a\nTo attack Kavanaugh for judicial temperament would you would think would be the least likely a I think that's an outgrowth of a ... the fire with which he reacted to the beast marching of his honor at the hearing the drinking allegation I think is because they won't dare\nTo his face at least while he's sitting there suggests that he actually\nCommitted sexual assaults and was a serial rapist or one of the arguments they want to make is that they think that his denials of this are very a credible and passionate but perhaps he had a drinking problem and committed rapes that he forgot I suppose the idea being that is\nA you know his his mind may not have been in it but it is but his body was it's it's absurd but you know anything that might get traction Moby try it out here that is\nFor anything they can put the press this was going to protect running low point the median covering or any confirmation hearing for such a crazy on their part to do this question that Andy is\nWhat's going to happen now and we're just going to continue to see this we're allegations accusations anything that can ... your ... going to Portland print but at the end of the day there should be a vote shouldn't her one way or another\nYeah there has to be a vote that he is and what that means is that eventually the Republicans are going to have to have the gumption\nAnd the number is to simply say enough is enough\nYou know we have to keep reminding ourselves that\nA judicial confirmation proceeding is not a trial it's not a counterintelligence investigation it's not designed to to do a full blown criminal investigation and prove beyond a reasonable doubt that somebody's engaged and misconduct it's actually not even an executive branch function\nIt's a Senate function of exercise\nThe FBI's role is just to support that it's not a normal FBI functioned in fact uh if you think about it there was no FBI until Nineteen away so the Senate was confirming\nA judicial nominees for over a century without any assistance from the FBI the thought that the the ... Congress needs the executive branch perform it's a constitutional function is absurd and I think that you know Senator McConnell who runs the Senate\nOr as long as the Republicans have majority have said that they are going to vote this week I Hope he's serious about\nThat Andrew McCarthy right the national Review Online Thaddeus McCotter W. J. are the great voice of the great lakes Brett Kavanaugh nominated to be an associate justice of the Supreme Court pending one more the seven FBI inquiry about his character\nThe advise and consent of the U.S Senate means that it will go to the Senate floor when Mitch McConnell called\nYou know my longtime colleague Bob and\nYou're kind support is most well two dollars or five dollars for a monthly subscription or twenty five dollar donation\nBob's then and then I I I Want to thank your listeners for their remarkable long term generosity behind the black\nIt's really appreciate most welcome by John ...

because it seems like the obvious answer would be to and more strength button many wars are fought over\nFood insecurity and\nLikelihood insecure and they and so I have a feeling\nA hunch here that if we were able to solve world hunger the instances of war well not completely eradicated food code damn Sima however just sending more won't make anybody like hunger I\nAm going to go with the ah the feeding people\nGonna get you're going to end world hungry hunger I guess you're going to get rid of world hunger St little kids will no longer be hungry and absolutely no they they are now grown ups you may still kill each other but little kids still may be victims of war Fred you're not protecting\nOr if you just solve hunger mutt but but my contention is is that you will eliminate a portion of wars by a lemonade in\nCongress [noise]\nBy the way in army travels on their stomach it has been said so far not hungry travel back ah yeah the army's not hungry can you imagine how much more

that that worked out for you you know I thought it was a sham anyhow\nSo [laughter] I agree with Fred\nSo you'd you'd end world hunger absolutely and all the wars in the world you'd let ... there and they made it very good point there you know you say you you think you got something going in that brain is absolutely\nDevious were hunger some of the wars would go away huh well I don't know them guys you know them generals and dictators and stuff that they start to wars they ah they're dirty and hungry\nOr not but a lot of their people are right and they count on the hunger of their people in order to feed their wars\n... ... they do submit\nSubmit to their their their their dictator or their their their yeah\nYeah but it was army ray everything else so here saying North Korea might not be what North Korea is if it's people weren't hungry maybe\nThat's a pretty valid point that's a ... you might have something there are you there are a lot of third world countries in fact a lot of third

one\nThink about the man or woman in in your life and this at some point will probably applied to women as well as men in this case with Brett Kavanaugh it applies to men\nIn particular and as the president said said to be to be accused of something and you are guilty until you prove yourself innocent\nThat appears to be the new standard push by one side of the political aisle Republicans aren't backing that standard but Democrats are saying if you're accused your accuser will be believed and you will be just believed and as Chris Coons the senator we played the soundbite last week as

with the president's comments that were in a terrible spot today where a man and it primarily applies to men although you could easily see the same kinds of scandal involving women\nBut that a man is accused and if he's accused he's guilty until he proved himself in a son that's been the just the Kavanaugh investigation from the beginning of this which you'll remember I'll point out\nStarted at what was supposed to have been the end of all of the hearings into confirming him as a Supreme Court justice offering gap and he joins me now who's founder and president of the center for security policy and Frank\nIs a little outside of what we usually talk about here but uh but I Want to know do we know which FBI's investigating Kavanaugh is this the corrupt one that had to have a ... a number of people like call me and McCabe and others\nFired or is this one that can actually turn around a a good solid investigation and quiet some of these Democrats protests [noise]\nWell I don't think anything's going to ... democratic process is this isn't about\nHis record this is about what he would do on the court they're determined to wedge political warfare against until they destroy it ended I of course the state of the court\nOutlook lawyers I I don't know the answer that question I I think it's a tremendously important one that we have a reason to believe that the guys who would\nBe doing the investigation of the charges would be you know drawn from the large ranks of patriotic law enforcing and law abiding FBI agents\nThe trouble is that\nI'm quite certain that there are among the ranks of the leadership of the FBI still people liked in the caves and like the cold Mays unlikely pages and strong accent and bakers and so on and so those people may or may not\nBe able to do much at this point a to corrupt\nWhat comes out of the field investigations the background of destination but I think we have to take it as a gift and that they'll do whatever they can because this is part of the counter state it's not just deep state truthfully it's counter state and they are\nAs in bed and is determined to defeat Donald Trump and his presidency is any of those Democrats on the Judiciary Committee or elsewhere in the Senate or for that matter you know the the resist and anti foot tapes I'm afraid\nWell here's what I'm thinking about Frank because one of the questions of because we have this press corps that is just dead set against Trump\nWhat they never considered is that we have three branches of government you know judicial legislative and executive\nThe judicial who is you know that we're considering coming off of that the legislative branch because of the insistence of Jeff Flake said we want the executive branch the FBI which is under the executive branch to investigate this even though\nThe legislative branch has its own resources to do this I I Know that people maybe haven't thought of this\nBut the Senate Judiciary committee has a huge staff of people who are professional investigators and who have the expertise to do the very same thing that the FBI is doing except I Wonder whether the Democrats no we've got some deep stayed friends\nOver in the FBI who as you said are still there and they're still willing to carry water forests will produce the result we won\nInstead of the result they might get from the ... from the Congress his own investigators who are perfectly capable of looking into this because all the FBI is doing right now for the most part\nIs interviewing people and asking questions well there are people on the Senate Judiciary committee staff who could be doing that too and it would be directly under the control of Congress although it would be under the control of a Republican Congress\nWell that's the rub is that\nYou know I had an interesting conversation today with that's all about those jak cash show who you were in Denver I chose a you interviewed back when he published a book about TWA eight hundred [noise] wish exposed what\nThe corruption that the FBI and the CIA during the Clinton Administration [noise] meant in terms of essentially covering up what actually happened taking down that flight accidentally five but it was devastating effect and you put into the mix\nUm I think the well the elation and abuse of a couple of other investigations Oklahoma City being on\nTop of course the Clinton Hillary Clinton email scandal thing another and and this most recent one more cell of celebrating barking I should say the anniversary of\nIn this week and that is the Las Vegas shooting I think all of these have been instances where people and the leadership and the FBI did\n... and ... and co up\nThe work of that organization which is needed by our country\nAnd unfortunately has damaged the reputation of the whole enterprise as a result of what these guys have done so I think that was operating for some Democrats it's kind of amazing to me that it wasn't a concern to Republicans given what we've been watching play out here while I was just one of those those are those rates of Hillary's\nThink about this Frank I mean I think this is relevant they missed the pulse nightclub and I won't even have the whole is because I'm doing this for memory they missed on may lose cruise Parkland, Florida\nThe up by you know I understand there are good people that work there I Know some people who work at the FBI the lower ranks in the region ranks either took that agency as an agency even at the local field office in say Florida\nHas screwed up and we've seen these screw ups and we've documented number of these corrupt where we watched in real time as their screw up led to literally dead bodies in American cities and then we said but we can trust them to do a competent job of investigating something that seems well the the longer that\nA week since last Thursday the more we seem to be seeing this story fall apart\nA Julie sweat story is falling apart the W ... story is falling apart and even a a Christian Cooke story is falling apart and yet still vote we've got an agency that has occasionally produced a you know bad results or no result for political results doing the investigation\nOr you know you talked about this a lot over the years large but\nOne other piece of this which again I think is a function\nOf bad leadership has been um the fact that lots of these ages good people Mosul without it stipulate that virtually all of them are good people the field level people\nBut they've been denied training [noise] about the nature of the end and they were facing a specifically the ... that's been since\nBob Mueller\nOr the man now most closely associated with this a witch hunt against President Trump but we all look all these four was the director of the FBI and he said we're not going to have people training\nIn a way that would offend a Islam or Muslim since so these are the kinds of issues that have caused people that I admire greatly a fellow particularly I'm sure you know Chris sorrow\nOf judicial watches said listen we need to start over you know the AIDS suggest using the U.S marshals office says this sort of\nA nucleus of a new Federal Bureau of investigations but basically uh this one up by the roots and start over look great believer that we need the capability but we may need a do over\nYeah I think we do less than a minute Frank ... comment on the attempt apparently to assassinate the James Mattis today\n[noise] I haven't heard about it\nOver to the regular anything about it at all and below full of rice and sent to the Pentagon address to general matters so uh you know I mean we're in a strange time and and I and I hate to say it but I kinda think that that was a domestic\nAnd he could get a second pick I mean of Ruth Bader Ginsburg leaves the court for some reason the next two years that would give Trump not just this pick the pick of judge Kavanaugh but another pick on top\nThat would set the courts ideological direction I Believe it to say we're going to follow the constitution or for the next forty years or so given the age\nThe current justices if they do if the Republicans do not confirm Kavanaugh by the end of this week two things are going to happen one cabinet won't be seated too there isn't enough time to pick a replacement and run them through the vetting process\nAnd a lot of Republican voters will look at the cave and by the Republicans and say\nI may not show up in November to vote and when they do that likely we will not get another conservative justice on the court and we will not to ... and we may lose the Senate or the house or a little bit of both and if that happens that America changes\nForever probably and if we do get them on then we have a court that will follow the constitution instead of following ideology\nAnd I think the Republicans are voters or a head of the mid term election will be invigorated if for lack of a better word by saying oh the Republicans actually followed through and did what they were supposed to do and that will reflect on their votes in November So we really are at a big divide right now\nIf Kavanaugh gets on good San great things are going to happen if he does not I think America but we ... we may lose the Republican Congress and Donald Trump won't get another thing done for the next two years and they will set themselves the Democrats will set themselves up well for twenty twenty\n...\nCertainly a lot regard that as the Democrats are saying like they they pick and choose what they want to follow up to date a lot of all that by the way around it as a way to reword it\nLike this fear as they have no immigration since all of the border and there'll be a systematic ... that it's a good actor so\nI think you're absolutely right and and and and consider that that not only do the Democrats invent invite a oh boy we just got word cliff I'd mentioned to Frank ... said James Mattis at the Pentagon received a letter didn't go all the way to him but they intercepted at containing rice and\nA ... my producers just alert me that we just got word that Trump also received a letter had they confirmed that there was rice and or are they saying just white powder at this point Ted Ted Cruz's office Scott alone\nEr and apparently President Trump's office also received a letter with white powder in it which is designed to it leads to frighten and terrorize or if not actually do damage will have to find out what the white powder is but I wanted to work at it in but\nThink about what's going to happen if if we go this direction we want people on the court who will follow the constitution the Democrats actually invent things that were never in the constitution for example it might surprise people to know that\nThe privacy is not mentioned anywhere in the constitution but there had been Supreme Court decisions that have been triple A. rated privacy end of the constitution marriage is not mentioned by the constitution so now we have a famous Supreme Court decision recently\nFound a right to marriage and a right to gay marriage in the constitution the Democrats are allowed to gain control and put people on the court who would say we can invent things that are not in the constitution and it feels Congress won't pass a law will get the Supreme Court to effectively write a law\nSuit in a lot of your rights are going to go away\n[noise] I don't think they realize as there [noise]\nYou know what I lost your cell phone and I'm Sorry
