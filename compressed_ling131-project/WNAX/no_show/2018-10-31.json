out\nKind of the unofficial way that he announces a lotta new policies that he's going to change the interpretation of the federal government reading the fourteenth amendment that catch anybody off guard\nNot caught off guard at all this and the president has been trying to fix the problem of immigration a sense of became president of the United states you'll remember to October's ago he put forth a a Seventy point plan of how to fix immigration Democrats wouldn't come to the table eventual that down to four main pillars\nAre the Democrats\nCut down the government over there were a few to address the\nIssue in any reasonable rational or sane way\nAnd so the president said look I've got to look at my powers under the constitution as a full power I can can execute on the executive branch\nThat is legal to try and solve the problems that we face it are decades old the Democrats will come to the table we have a crisis at our border that's been there for a while and now we have

of this has not been written yet but since you and I and the president or on the same page on this thing I told you I've I've asked for Twenty one years for a different interpretation of the

most recently debts of an Asian which is on DVD now but one of the other things we've talked about before dinner a long time ago is that you're an immigrant\nDeath of a nation which is on DVD now\nBut one of the other things we've talked about before dinner a long time ago is that you're an immigrant to this country illegal immigrants to the United states of America now an American citizen who's worked for president or a president and you've done some great things\nI Want to know your thought on the president saying we have in misinterpreted the fourteenth amendment to the constitution for a hundred years and he wants to straighten it out and I think he's picked the right ... mechanism that will eventually bring it to a court case what's your take [noise] well I think\nIs that he is um uh he is\nPicking up a topic where people have taken something to be off the air that is in no way all the uh the language of the constitution particularly from what I take the ... the quote ... born but I'm\nA which can be interpreted uh uh you know a bunch of different ways including the fact that it was a match or devices area and um I don't need to be sort of\n... about it but I think Trump is\nIt makes a point when he says listen found it probably did not intend some illegal person can cross the border deliver a kid and boom they get that he or she is a U.S citizen for life that was probably not what they had in mind and so yes I don't I think it's a really good for him to test before the Supreme Court\nAnd over the years I've been on this hobby horse for about Twenty one years and all admitted it's been a something that has bothered me I started talking about it on the radio about Twenty one years are going to say\nThe fourteenth amendment ... I read all the history or read the various legal pieces about it I'm not a lawyer but I said this this is the wrong way to interpret it illegal aliens are not subject to the jurisdiction of the United states they've entered the country illegally\nShould we automatically grant that we've created moral hazard like birth birth place of birth writes a tourism where people literally fly into the country have a baby and then fly home saying there's our little retirement plan right they're all wrapped up in swat ... glows and you say well this has to get fixed in every lawyer I talked to said well\nThere's not really a good legal mechanism to bring a case\nOur challenge it in court but now the president's found his own unique way to say if I pass if I sign this executive order you can almost guarantee that by the end of the week there's going to be a court challenge and then we'll actually see what the Supreme Court says about it [noise] exactly\nAnd it's only been in some sly and the court as a little different than it's been in the past I think part of what the left does in these situations is that they use the kind of ... shoulder is about that because of the pose the helplessness thought to create a situation which politically benefits them um but\nUh that's I think Trump is showing a certain kind of bold nests on all fun even Reagan didn't show in the eighties so for me it's always a fascinating exercise to move back and forward in time because it's you know I became a conservative as maybe you could live in the Reagan Era\nAnd I think I'm ...\nPoints for that because\nI have to admit it didn't actually for the longest time I was kind of a political not that I wasn't interested in it but as a reporter I kept my opinions out of my stories I had personal opinions that I Would say but I was always careful to keep them out so for a lot of people they\nThey looked at me on TALK radio a long time ago and so you're a conservative or you're not a liberal you worked in television I said yeah I had my own opinions\nBut I kept him out of my work is that was my job at the time\nI'm ... I Want you to describe depths of the nation your most recent documentary that smell it on DVD and why people should go out and get it now but it's available in that form well\nBecause we talk a lot about fake news but we don't talk enough about snakes scholarships and fake history and steak narratives makes accusations against Trump and the conservative for example they said Trump is a fascist\nThe Republican Party is the party of fascism behind that is that kind of an hour to a big story and the big story is that fascism it's on the right to accept them as as a white plains Saddam and it it's actually more likely to find out that the whole argument would collapse that know fascism as are likely phenomenon that's been something that left at\nAll since the Nineteen forties they've got it into the textbooks they've got it on the History Channel they've got it in the wake of media and so a lotta people close to you know to be true even though it's not true of fascism was never the not the right prior to that\nBut what we're seeing is granted his story object that is a kind of ... and all of us that sort of captivating died when I watched the movie is try to do that the nation is\n... out of that law show you like it was actually experienced by the people who lived through it and the twenties and thirties kind of fresh look at our own American story so when you see it in a new like you'll never be the quite the same like at\nNo in fact I think that's true of all the documentaries you've done and I cite them frequently in conversations with people and say go watch this documentary and understand the real relationship this store relationship between say\nThe United states and Mexico where our current relationship is a little bit strained but some of that may go back in history but some of it was settled a long time ago in the United states\nI think acted very honorably and its relations toward a much less powerful a state of Mexico back in the day and and and we settled at your your own country great\nUh but but then you have to be responsible for your people\nYes absolutely so movie in a new typically a book that goes with the movie all the ... is an emotional narrative it is at its core for inspiring because they don't do references and flip out\nSo it's kind of my way of putting out at one two punch and a lot has not been able to poke a single hole and to this day like this they screen in general and misrepresent what out Damascus planning that Hitler was a liberal Democrat nonsense I'm not saying that it got even remotely what I'm saying but what I Am saying is that if you're looking for the vestiges of fascist\nTactics in America today you'd be far more likely to find them on the left and on the right\nOne in fact aren't most I mean many of the policies that are being pushed by the most radical elements of the Democratic party including cause you according to as an Gillum and others is one time nationalized healthcare let's do this you know in a lot of policies that they weren't the let's take over the world policies of the Hitler regime but they certainly are socialist policies\nAnd I always like to remind them what Nazi actually stands for\nYeah I mean when the part of the costs me think back to fascism and not be as than we think of World War two and get a\nChange and why does it come out of the war over fascism was not was not\nPortrayed like that that's not how the fascist became the largest political party both in Germany and that and and I know earlier in Italy or they became the largest party by hand painting on government takeover of the banks\nAnd health care government control of education that said government control not only of the organs of the economy but also over the life of\nCitizens that mold and kind of a single unit like chicken pox fuel oil with leftist ideology that is what they're not the it's called like ... song meaning and innocents coordination and that's what the left is trying to do in their own way in America today eat at all in this\nIt's called like ... song Mimi and in coordination and that's what the law is trying to do in their own way in America today eat at all and that shouldn't intimidate us all into the same to you know ... old slapstick apply overall balconies\nSlowed it'll be interesting to see what happens after the midterms a week from today did ask congrats on ... nation it's now on store shelves anywhere DVDs are sold it didn't actually it's always a pleasure to have you on thank you sir\nThank you set is diminished as soon as the best selling author and filmmaker\nAnd want to remind you of something that's very very practical it's about sleep\nHow does a great night sleep improve your performance I can tell you how about more energy less brain far better mood and more productivity I work twelve or Thirteen hours a day to sleep number three sixty smart bed it helps people like me\nTo get great performance every day my sleep number setting is sixty five Tina's is more like a thirty five or forty much softer mattress\nYeah I think he has taught the mainstream media a lesson and I think he's taught the American public a lesson not to trust the mainstream media so close to the president laid and Enron around the media conservative talk radio what you do you been doing it\nFor a long time we launched an hour ATV um you know before the president burst out of the same but that was under the same model that we we were not getting our message out at the at our age mainstream media channels certainly not in a spare cash and so we said you know ... that work\nAnd and so we did the same thing that people are fed up with hearing lives with hearing propaganda with with hearing hatred\nSimply because somebody disagrees with them and you talked earlier about the violent rhetoric\nI have not heard one Republican large have you that does not denounce violence does not that now by the whole ... does not denounced breaking the law yet it is all the Democrats that either enable them to do this ... to do that you hear so many layers said well we need to give them room riots\nYou're not going to hear a Republican or conservative say that now and it's only the Democrats that pushed that\nI'm Talking to ... who's a host for enter a TV you might remember him as the guy who smashed the TV that was showing liberal news and I'm sure grants that will be brought back up when they decide to tar and feather you for your violent actions which were merely to convey a you know convey a message and of course at the same time\nNot acknowledge that they've done things like you know showing image of Paul Ryan allegedly throwing somebody off of a ... off a cliff in a wheelchair you know because that was that was an okay message mid smashing an inanimate object that's pure evil\nYou know I Want to tell you it was one of the most fun shoots I've ever been on and I've been in t._v. for a long time my background is mainstream media was an investigative reporter before I ran for Congress and then got into talk radio and working that enter a TV and that was the most part I had so we did for people that hadn't seen it as we play clips of\nAll the deceitful media say horrible things about the n._r._a. and the president and conservatives our way says a lot of ads that all these things and it pulls out with me wearing a T shirt that says socialist chairs and I have a sledgehammer\nAt I smashed the TV and I had to look really mean right while doing it but it was the hardest thing because what last little of this thing is the TV's going fly at all we did is what the left doesn't do we smashed our own property we pay for property we didn't do it to anybody else's property you know what the brilliant part of that video was\nLaws that I didn't say a word that we did not have a gun and they still\nWent ballistic over at no guns do speech nothing and of course they said we were being violet were not being violent we were just acting out what everybody wants to do they want to smash their TV when they're tired of being hammered over the head with nonsense every\nI'm Talking to ... hosted in or a TV you know one thing that bothers me grant the fake news doesn't all have to come in statements of of of untrue fact\nIt can also come by omission and you know when I heard about the shooting at the synagogue on Saturday I was following Twitter and I thought oh my God this is horrible I said a prayer for those people\nBut I also thought about my friend John ...\nWho runs a crime prevention Research Center who points out that Ninety eight percent of all the mass shootings in American I'm tired of hearing about them to I Want them to stop\nBut they happen and gun free zones now I I didn't do a full catalog and what network news did but I'm willing to bet they're not a single one mentioned these mass shootings happen in places that are disarmed and then make the very simple point\nShe I mean if a reporter at a network I ever had the inclination say\nHow do we protect the important stuff and he he or she just went through state and say well I went to a ball game at a stadium the other day and they were armed\nThe nation say how do we protect the important stuff and he ... he or she just went through his day and say well I went to a ball game at a stadium the other day and there were armed\nCops or guards there I went to a shopping mall armed guards the building I mean right now armed guards most banks aren't you know go right down the list lots and lots of places the important places are protected by that\nWell I've always thought the schools in the houses of worship should be protected as well not by government edict but voluntarily than it when you decide not to do that\nIt's like me deciding not to wear my seatbelt I'm not blaming the victim I'm just saying I wear my seatbelt even though I've never had a seatbelt saved me from Syria's arm but also where a gun every day even though I've never had that saved me from serious harm yet\nThat's right but you never know when it's going to happen you never know what you're going to get a car accident you'd never know if you're going to get out of sight it all comes calling and so with you\nI mean let goal is to empower every single person that wants to carry a firearm all in a law abiding fashion to have to like to do so so many places are trying to take away that way but that's all the second amendment is about protecting yourself and your family so you have a right to\nDo that and as soon as the liberal ... Second Amendment is the oldest recorded on it is\nNot going away anytime soon quicker they need to get over the hurdles are trying to live in the fantasy world or somehow evil doesn't doesn't\nExist and so when the about the line by omission gun free zones are dangerous and you can see this in\nEvery single loose story that you either read or see on TV what they don't tell\nYou in the story that is really is really the er deceitful methods\nThat these dogs is that's the dog doesn't bark watcher\nGrandson field on enter a TV and granted it's always great talking to you thanks so much hold on for just a moment so my producers can talk to you got the Lars Larson show\n[noise]\n[noise]\nI'm Jay foreigners seal Quicken Loans America's premier home purchase lender\nToday's fluctuating interest rates can leave you with unexpected higher mortgage payments Quicken Loans we created a new way to protect you from unpredictable interest rates so you can buy a home with certainty\nIt's called ... and here's how it works with Rachel you can lock your interest rate while you shop for a new home so afraid to go up you don't have to worry and here's the best part if rates go down you get a lower rate with ratio we really have you covered\nHere are more reasons why you want to work with America's largest mortgage lender for eight years in a row now JD power has re Quicken Loans highest in the nation and customer satisfaction for primary mortgage origin nation and for the fifth year in a row they've also ranked is highest in the nation for mortgage servicing rate shield\nAnother way we can save your money on your mortgage calls today at eight hundred quicken or go to rocket mortgage dot com\nBasin right where he said in comparison to get a record racial upheaval only about on thirty thirty approaches turned back and cover confirmation conditions equal housing let her license and all that he said I don't want them or thirty thirty additional conditions are excluded may apply\nThis story is called the ugly truth about time share everything that you've done your family fiber about buying a timeshare you need my help hello I'm shot McDowell CEO and founder of Wesley financial group ten years ago I started helping folks canceled our timeshare contracts and then the process started what's now called\nThe Tom sure cancellation industry Tom ... the only thing that you can buy that you can't tell me how much is going to cost or when it's going to end what do you buy timeshare you give them a blank check to fill out any amount they won't ... annual maintenance and assessment face sound crazy\nThe crazy thing is there's never ends\nEven when you die your family is now going to be stuck with this burden stop the insanity to de ... now I guarantee if we can't answer your time to contract you'll pay nothing goal for your\nFree information kid eight hundred Seventy six Ninety three hundred that data entry Seventy six Ninety three hundred eight hundred and Seventy six Ninety three hundred\nFive Seventy W.

I. X. news\nYour big friend in the mid west feelings\nAnd a five Seventy that when you in a\nThe wars Lawrence his show which is a disservice radios\nWith his lawyers are so\nPeers Lars Larson\nBack to the Lars Larson show pleasure to be with you and glad to get your phone calls and emails of course the biggest story of the day and these days there seems to be a brand new huge story every couple of days in fact some stories from just a month ago seemed like oh yeah I remembered seems like ten years ago [noise] anyway here's the situation\nI see American we have a caravan\nOf illegal aliens and I had somebody question me while I was calling the caravan and Mexico illegal aliens they said they're not illegal aliens till they reach America and I said oh no that's not true or those people legally in the state of Mexico\nAnd the answer is you know you just know they forced their way into that country\nNow the Mexican government has been pretty accommodating toward them\nBut they didn't end of the ... the state of Mexico legally they're not they're legally in Mexico is said to them become to Mexico City\nWill make sure that you can stay here will help get your jobs and all the rest of that and they've said no so they're not even refugees because refugees who are fleeing from a country in some kind of persecution international law says when you're playing as soon as you get to a safe place\nYou're no longer refugee so that's all going on\nAt the same time that the president came out this morning and said I'm going to ride an executive order in which I tell the bureaucracy of the government to stop miss interpreting the fourteenth amendment to the constitution\nWhich for a hundred years well effectively about a half a century about fifty years\nEverybody in the federal government has said well you know if you have a baby in America the baby's automatically an American citizen and as I've said read the fourteenth amendment I've read it on the air it's not very long\nIt says your baby as an American citizen if you are under the jurisdiction of the United states that is you know allegiance to a foreign king are potent paid that era legions is to America because you came into the country legally\nSo the president launches that which I think is perfectly appropriate will finally get a court tested likely won't happen for years but you know Donald Trump is going to get sued over this\nThey're going to be people saying we're going to sue to stop that executive order\nNightclub mostly clear skies low temperatures different in the upper thirty but it was becoming might tend to be a Wednesday good deals sunshine in store reaching in the effort fifty West Wing\nBut there were becoming might be your Wednesday could deal sunshine and store reaching into Europe or the west wins thrown ten miles per hour\nInto your Thursday so expecting dry conditions once again to prevent these a chance for showers Thursday night pepper thirty NPR friday partly sunny upper forties\nAnd for your friday night do the chance for rain snow mixture developing this low temperatures drop back into the lower thirty in the day on Saturday mixture of rain and snow especially early in the day then change nobody rain in the afternoon to science push up into the upper forties trying out for your Sunday at least impartial sunshine there once again upper forties\nAnd meteorologist Michael care on radio five Seventy WN am\nCurrently forty five\nApplying a starter fertilizer plant is the best way to make sure you're proud because that's our\nParents' plan would have been fighting with high quality stars\nFour years they want to start or something at all major in minor element there's nothing else to add\nAnd all ours ours are one hundred percent and they started your problem to just anyone who wants to call one eight three four one zero zero too because\nThat enrich all we do as fertilizer\nWe're going and what\nDo you\nGo back to the program glad to get to your calls a bit later at age six six eight large that's eight six\nSix four three nine five to seven seven I mentioned that caravan of illegal aliens which now I think my prediction that they would be her by election day is a was going to be wrong unless of course some rich guy decides to send a bunch of buses to get them to the border faster there's still a long long ways away\nBut they include all kinds of interesting people including the son but I just played for you or from the man who admits he was convicted in America of attempted murder third degree felony before he was deported and now he's going to walk back in with the care of in because he says he hopes to get a a pardon I wouldn't put money on that\nBut I Do want to know what's the best way to get this whole effort stock ... Rachel boulevard is the senior policy director for conservative partnerships Institute and the former director of policy services for the Heritage Foundation Rachel good to have you back on the program [noise]\nHi there thanks for having me so how do we go about maybe if we can stop this caravan what can we do to get the rest of the caravans that might follow it on a regular basis stopped so that they don't challenge our national sovereignty and tried to come into across our border illegally [noise]\nWell I think the first thing that has to happen as resource thing at the border I he just really congressional question you know President Trump has spent\nA thousand trip to the border and that's great and that'll buy you know I think some security but the issue is we don't have enough judges in order to\nProcess and close and we certainly don't have enough resources in terms of border security and in order to patrol the border and we don't have the president's border wall to all of that has to be funded by Congress any future caravan of going to be\nYou know I saw a number today that says that the birds to illegal aliens parents in this country that are primarily covered by Medicaid and public funding through hospitals and such\nThat total amount of money that we spend a every year is greater than the amount of money they're talking about to start building the wall so it's to me it would be a fairly easy economics choice would you rather have a wall and stop people from coming into the country illegally\nOr would you rather just leave the border opened a lot of people come in and and have babies and we'll we'll we'll pay for all the costs are I Would rather they didn't even get to the other side of the border\nUh but I Want to stop the legally in humanely but I don't even want them to stand in front of a judge I I Want them to be stopped before they get to the borders there is there any hope of that Rachel\n[noise] well I think for that to happen we have to clean up our asylum laws because right now that but then if I think a lot of these people to come here and if you listen to the interview with you on the care of and that's what they had you become an acquaintance island and now there are legitimate asylum claim\nBut right now because of changes at the Obama administration made people can claim what's called credible fear and that's a very low threshold for asylum because we don't have the resources of the border to hold everyone that we we take their asylum claim and then we release them\nInto the interior of the country and they're given a court date sometimes years later which many cannot ever show for\nAnd then they are here illegally and that is what many split attracting I think a lot of people in the caravan is the idea they know they can come clean up island and the lead into the country and they never had to show again we need to fix those laws that before anyone is going to get hurt and the teacher\nBecause right now they know they know that the process we've we've tied ourselves up with all this bureaucracy saying yes we have a border but if you managed to get across to you have full constitutional rights we have to give you an order to appear we don't have a lot of judges\nSo that's going to take months we can't lock you up for months there's another court decision that says we can only hold you for a certain period of time so people know there'll be catch and release on the north side of the border and then they just disappear\nAnd if they don't show up for the court hearing there's not much enforcement there because many of the big cities they disappear into our sanctuary cities to say we're not going to help ice enforce the law\nSo we've strangled our society by writing a stack of laws that work against enforced one of the border instead of four enforce the border [noise]\nYeah I think that's right and that's honestly what advice and a lot of people to come here and the fact that we have loopholes we have the ... century city we have all these things that they know they just have to get into the country and they'll likely be\nAble to stay and that's a huge incentive for people point out you know that's not just a threat to our security and our sovereignty but it's a threat to people as they come here and I think that's the frustrating you know in in ...\nNorth of the Caribbean but they also do are huge humanitarian crisis that is within illegal immigration has drug traffickers is sex traffickers who pray on these people so it's not just changing a lot for our benefit it's changing lives that for for the pizza the benefit of people who come here and that and and are exploited\nKnow as as we began this conversation Rachel and made mention of his son but I played a few minutes ago where the Fox news reporter drift Jenkins talked to one of the people in the Caribbean\nAnd the guy freely and easily said yeah I'm a I'm a third class or third degree felony because I was convicted of attempted murder in the United states and I'm coming north so I can ask for a pardon and you know I wouldn't put money on [laughter] but\nBut that's amazing that that there are people in that group who are so concerned about their own criminal act\nThey say yeah I'm a felon I tried to murder somebody that I was convicted of it and then they kicked me out of the country and now I'm coming right back in I Would think that would scare the daylights out of Americans who've been told by Donald Trump\nThat like it or not the crowd of illegal aliens who come in illegally contains a disproportionate number of people who are violent criminals\nThat like it or not the crowd of illegal aliens who come in illegally contains a disproportionate number of people who are violent criminals and then they're told by the mainstream media all that's that's a bunch of bologna Trump does nobody's talking about well the fact is\nI've looked at the the stats in my own state and found that it's absolutely backed up a you know in ... Oregon is a very blue state where we ever broadcast studios\nAnd a Eighteen percent of the convicted rapist and the state bar illegal aliens and fourteen percent of the convicted murderers park illegal aliens even though the percentage of illegal aliens in the state might be three or four percent at most\nBut they they are vastly over represented in the crowd of killers and rapists [noise]\nWe have that problem with criminals coming here as illegal aliens and the first place to look at sanctuary cities because we aren't getting the proper setting we aren't getting the proper enforcement that I think we move a lot of the people\nI think Americans largely are welcoming to immigrants that come here legally saloon here legally yeah we can't that you can't do any of the take any of the matter is necessary to make sure as security and that's why I think\nYou know you have people taking advantage of the lack system because they know they know they're spending all they can come here and be protected and I thought they'd out backwards and then\nI'll go to Rachel assuming that Republicans get a decent result out of next Tuesday's election assume that Republicans maintain control perhaps even gain some seats in the Senate but at least main getting control of both houses of Congress\nCan we actually get something done because you've got a powerful forces working against the president like house Speaker Paul Ryan\nWho didn't wait ten seconds today before he jumped out and condemned Trump's idea of re interpreting the fourteenth amendment which is not a change in the law's not not anything outrageous are extraordinary just saying we've been misinterpreting and the first thing Paul Ryan who thank God can be done soon enough\nFor my money uh he uh he comes out and immediately says it's not possible it's not true and it's not going to happen so can we get something done if we maintain control of the Congress says\nWell look I think it's a Republican is maintain control they absolutely have to get done I mean not a band aid that voters that immigration is still one of the top issues on the minds of voters get a Gallup poll in July so that it was\nThe top issue on the minds of voters\nBiggest eight out history in terms of identification but I think something but I Do think even before a January Republicans in Congress comes back in December and have to go down to funding package you think the ... the new Congress get sworn in that it may be their last\nActually doctor can do and maybe this is too blonde but I'm going to say it anyway I don't care if the conventional schools could hurt and here's why what I mean by that is if you have schools successful or failing schools\nThat you know that that uh then they have some competition in the form of a charter school\nAnd the parents look at what the charter schools doing for their kids and they look at what the conventional schools doing and they move either a sizable minority or even a majority of their students\nFrom the conventional school to the charter school because they now have a choice and they say do school is doing for my kids what I Need which is to get them a good solid education\nSend the conventional school says hey we used to be a thousand kids here and now we only have five hundred to we can only just try half the staff and a half the teachers because the resources have gone across the street to the charter school that's OK even you know and and I and I wonder why\nYou know you're in a part of the country that has a lot of liberals but but it's also I mean there are businesses that are run most people who are just you know not government workers\nAre government workers and all the majority thank God would look at it and say well if my company does a better job than the competition the competition may lose business or even go out of business so what that's how you breed excellence\nOr in in any field in education and business in almost anything you know competition breeds excellence but competition usually means somebody wins and I mean somebody has to lose why are people so concerned about saying oh we have to preserve this whole model that has been disturbing her kids [noise]\nWell I I agree with you completely that the older you know it's not something that should be preserved and charter schools here for example are closing achievement gaps for are low income children of color especially at at me\nSaying that should be preserved and charter school up here for example are closing achievement gaps for are low income children of color especially at a rate unprecedented in this nation I Would say that one of the places where not only Massachusetts gets it wrong but so many states get it wrong it that we have this cap\nOn the number of schools that can exist so the reason they care about uh what how the district school they're performing for example is that not everybody has\nAccess to a charter public schools so here in the commonwealth with twenty six thousand\nIndividual kids on the list to get into these high performing charter public school if there weren't that cap I Would agree with you completely let the let a charter schools do what they know how to do closed up when they don't do it well and if the traditional public schools don't fare well in that system than they should close unfortunately\nOn in too many places around the country as we do in Massachusetts we had the charter school cats which means that\nEven when families want to leave their district schools they can't\nWell and that's the problem is I guess what I'm Wondering is why\nWere the voters the taxpayers the parent willing to tolerate a cap if if you said these schools are going to be great and clearly if the legislature and the people that voted in favor\nOf of having charter schools to be made available it must be because they believe there is at least as good if not better than conventional schools why would you say this is going to be really great but you can only have a little bit of it [noise] yeah\nWell I think it's because believe me I I Wish that we would have a much more of it um but aggressively you know what we got here is special interest groups that have a huge hold on the politics of education that said they do and many others\nAnd part of the ... as what we had failed to talk about here is a complete outlet shut the cap and said we may feel that say over time let's raise that here let's raise it there and so in that context you're always going to be vulnerable to the argument well\nEvery time you open a charter school in the community of that community it's going to drain funding from the traditional public pool which by the way even true here because I'm with ya and ... and ... and ... am whereas it should I Believe money follows the child is for the child and not for the arc or the or not but at the school not for the adult then that\nWould that would work but unfortunately here say in the context of the cap it it's not\nNot work by the way can I ask a detailed question about charters and it's not bad detailed but in a lot of states the charters get eighty percent of the money that a convention or does that also true of Massachusetts [noise]\nIt's not um I Would add that even when charters nationally get less funding that traditional public schools they tend to outperform them right now I'm\nHere in Massachusetts we actually believe it or not having them for charter school funding where the money for charter school both the child which means that um when I when a kid\nThat you know what I don't want the district school I'm going to go to a charter and that\nThe money that is due to him or her go directly to the charter so it actually\nAt one of the most equitable officers that Sunday in in the whole nation of course we don't get equal facilities funding which means that we are to get that because our charter school operators either have to raise money to put a roof over kids' heads are given to the money that they could use for operating schools but we still manage to even with less money\nOutperform proving that throwing money\nAt education isn't always the answer as high as not answer all\nDr Kandel I've got a break but you'll\nBe glad to have you back anytime you have the time and thank you so

agent in the election was their opposite number Michael Foot in the labor party\nAnd in the new election or they did they the Obama administration their intelligence apparatus their FBI their D. O. J.\nShouted to the rooftop salary Glenn shouted that Donald Trump isn't it as a Kremlin agent with no evidence that the world we live in the new Cold War is a ... and with farcical elements but\nThere is damage here and Steve I Want to begin with legitimacy what does the allegation a week before the midterm do for the legitimacy of the American government\nWe talk we talk about the potential and put a implications\nRamifications of this Russia the allegation that the Russians were manipulating the outcome of our elections in the case of Trump in two thousand and sixteen and as you say the media's pushing us now in regard to the house congressional elections\nOn November sick so we talked about this a little bit and it is a subject in my book war with Russia this question mark after and\nI think about that I don't see this going away in the sense that as you said damage is being done we need that sense a process so here's what I asked myself and it's it's more a question that an assertion but I think our folks listening to think about it\nPeople say\nAnd you say it's for two and a half years\nEven though you can't produce any evidence that the Russians may have put Trump in the White House or what have you done to the institution of the American presidency\nBecause it won't end with Trump because the idea that the Russians could do this the Kremlin could do this and now they're saying the Chinese may want to do it that a foreign power can choose our press\nAbout ten surely dean legitimize is the presidency as an institution to cast a shadow on it\nOr let's go to what's going to be the normal reaction the next Democratic president is going to get the same kind of style thrown at him or her that the Democrats have been crawling at Trump it isn't gonna end so what we have to ask ourselves his first\nWe get a\nAlmost a daily generalizing our elections as a process\nBeginning with the presidential one and two sixteen now going into next Tuesday these questions have been right so I have no doubt that if\nOne and two sixteen now going into next Tuesday these questions have been writing so I have no doubt that if\nThe Republicans hold the house\nRemain a majority that segment of the Democratic party and its media will be saying that the Russians were behind this or that the Russian ... you know tip the scales\nBecause they wanted to protect truck so when we then have a shadow over the presidency and over\nThe next Congress that's fairly serious in my mind mine John [noise] and then that raises another question in my mind\nIf these people take this seriously\nWhat are they saying about American voters\nOn the American people\nIn democratic theory and you don't have to be a political philosophy notice the bedrock a representative democracy and that the agency\nFlies with voters and voters will make a rational functional democratic decision and you live by their decision you would agree with that quite a loss for yet again with a premise and go on from there to talk about\nInstitutions are representative government but you can't have\nInstitutions are representative government [noise] ah unless you have people to elect them otherwise and some\nAuthoritarian systems\nOutwardly democratic parliament for example correct but there are assessing appointed and control\nIt's called managed democracy but a real democracy\nAnd representative democracy is the one we know\nHow you need the voters but if the voters are said to be as they are I mean he's Russia gate\nAllegations [noise] forever susceptible to a hundred thousand dollars worth of ads out of about forty billion ads bought or whatever it was a by some\nRussian wacko social media operation in St Petersburg what is that saying about the American people\nI mean we've got to take this through at about a coup all you and I John who lived are higher life inundated by advertising on television that we don't believe for a Mac I mean I Know\nThat if I buy that beautiful car\nIt is not going to get me all those beautiful women that are leaning over the car I mean we have been raised to be\nIntuitively skeptical\nOf the things that come to our attention I think that's fair to say I mean advertising agencies try to manipulate us but we know what's going on\nSo to say that the Russians are capable of Being American\nBoaters is saying something less about the Russians\nThan about our own people but ... what these Russia gate allegations are saying\nIt is striking to me Steve remembering the election and just I was participating as a reporter and I was watching on Twitter I could tell when the Russians were on line because it was morning time in Petersburg\nSo I Would often wish them very good morning in Russian and they would never respond because they didn't have a sense of humor they were working for money I understood that but it wasn't a threat it was kind of sharing\nThat they were so keen on trying to influence us with awkward statements like Tennessee for Trump you know that kind of thing right really very ... very thank you very much picked a real hard dates their court for the Republicans imagine ...\nSo I I it never occurred to me that it would be it would be concocted to be a threat to democracy it seemed\nIt seemed kind of sweet of them that they want to get it that they that they wanted to get in on the process because they don't have anything comparable\nAndme me cause we talked about this I won't go into it but historically whatever method way or interference and the Russians did into sixteen\nWas part of a long history\nOf ... of all it let's turn to that just moments said press back meddling in their elections where we'll check when we come back professor Stephen F calling the new book is war with Russia question mark I'm John bachelor [noise]\nMm [noise]\nPersonally I it here\nOh God [laughter] well there's two different versions of the war in Syria [noise] personally I Am here to the version that the pipe bomb proposed that but I didn't get it from Russia so\nSteve what does it matter\nCould lines of le matter that up that a character who works at the bed nails strep again just how could it was a matter that he had anything to say about Russia my goodness Steve that the hair I call that an stretches an understatement\nYou know why it matters because for better or worse\nApart from the ... bachelor show I Would say\nNinety to Ninety five percent\nOf American broadcast media [noise]\nCable TV and the rash is in gender is shaped by stories that appear in the New York times and the Washington Post I worked for almost Twenty years to CBS News\nAnd most of their programming\nCame out of the day is New York times in Washington Post and nowadays we we we we detour a bit from our subject so people know\nTwenty years ago Thirty years ago the major TV networks had major news gathering organization so their own abroad and big bureaus and bought a scout for example that's not the case anymore they don't generate their own news stories they take them from the New York times in the Washington Post so the answer to your\nQuestion is is ... or ... I mean it's preposterous that this guy if is broken soul down in Florida [noise]\nDecided some were you for some reason to post a story about Syria\nWhat are they care about Syria we don't know yet what matters is as he got it out of the New York times Washington Post\nI I Want to ask it Shapes Our media and ... and when people walk up to me in the street and say ... uh is going to decide is putting gonna throw the house\nTo the Republicans and Democrats they are kidding and where did they get this they got up in the New York times the Washington Post or they got it from cable TV which gets their segments from the New York times in the Washington Post but that's why it matters that's one of the virtues of John ... you are kind of alternative source\nOf news and news analysis but\nHe only got so many million viewers a\nOr a big country and a lot of people do believe that this stuff\nNon I Want to go to what is to be done with these allegations are one version of what has to be done is censorship how we see that underway right now in all directions because the social media sites are acting uh intermittently and\nAnd non transparently to censor or weed out ... Russian interference or other things they're doing but we're ... I'm concentrating on Russia right now Russian interference\nHow that actually affect the election I Can't tell you but I Do know it sets up the possibility that whoever loses on Tuesday is going to blame the Russians\nIt also sets up the possibility that\nThere is never going to be a safe space for elections in America in perpetuity if this is a theme continues tape our elections are always going to be vulnerable we can't shut the door fast enough\nAnd we have to find another way to go forward as the government which means didn't trust the mob trust the leadership that's where we're headed deep trust the people who know best\n... that's what worries me among other things and that's a theme and a Bible all that whereas this leading up to me and he got to get the language right\nRussia gate has been an elite project and one of the things I Do in the book as I trace it back to the CIA and Brennan\nMaybe even before to sixteen and this story to the extent that it's known I put it in the book I don't claim to know at all because you never know everything that the intelligence services do that's why they're called intelligence\nServices I guess but the problem here is is that they set into motion lesion narratives about what's going on [noise] people believes them they were coming to a moment\nAs we now it's a week away we're one week away from the election and as you say are the losers I blame the Russians they will\nWe've already had that in off year elections show where how do we get our elections back\nNow one thing we do you and I talked about it I won't go into it at great length I heard something the other day that reminded me up and [noise] we did a broadcast maybe more than one on the long history of American meddling in Russian actions are Russian politics short\nNinety six Ninety United States we throw money at it\nWhat we could start with Woodrow Wilson who sent troops to ride a bike ride Russian so I ...

scarier for your budget than anticipated homeowners and auto insurance claims tend to jump during the holiday more on what to expect and how to prep for Kelly grant consumer reporter at CNBC dot com she's also a certified financial planner Kelly what should we know\nThing you want to be thinking about is what is your insurance coverage because for most people you were looking at homeowners vandalism crime that's going to be covered but even when you look at those numbers you know the numbers are up\nYou know these are just claims that are big enough for people to be worth it filing a claim you could have a doctor below several hundred dollars before it kicks in obviously when we're talking about the spike we're talking about big\nNow for people to be worth it filing a claim you could have a direct a bowl of several hundred dollars before it kicks in obviously when we're talking about the spike we're talking about big collar claims [laughter]\nUm so you might even have a couple of hundred dollars on the hook for your insurance kicks in um worth it to know what that coverage looks like and then on the auto front with the folks tell us at the insurance information Institute is about eight and ten people have\nUm comprehensive coverage which is going to cover them vandalism shaft of auto parts all that sort of extra damage that's not a collision or if you're one of those you know to intend that don't have that coverage might be a good time to be making sure that you really are okay with that risk\nThis spike in claims that includes I guess what someone was called mischief night doubles night or the night before Halloween\n... that was always a big thing when I where I grew up in South Jersey with the night before and travelers when they were pulling in this data they said that they did see\nA little bit of an up tick the day before but they suspect that you know for most people if there's damage that's occurring at eleven o'clock at night the night before you're probably finding out about it when you wake up on Halloween rather they assume that does that spike on Halloween has some wrapped into it from the night before\nWe're speaking with Kelly grant consumer reporter at CNBC dot com she's also a certified financial planner and she's written a piece entitled Halloween is the scariest day of the year for this financial shock we're talking about the jump in insurance claims around Halloween for things like perhaps the damage to your home or your car\nOr what kind of steps can we take to minimize potential damage\nOr liability coverage is another thing you want to look at their because that's everything from you know a trick or treaters trips on your steps and you know sustain some injury to if you have a pet um you know maybe they are not as fond of all these costume and visitors as as you might be she want to be thinking about your liability there as well um so\nYou can do things like clear out your yard and sidewalk potential hazards make sure the path to your doors well lit and then consider you know keeping your pets away from the door if you're at all worried about how they're going to react\nOr what's the best case I guess for checking for these potential gaps in insurance you might have not all of us read fine print obviously I mean\nIt's obviously ... read the fine print if you've been working with an insurance agent or whatever company you're using for your coverage just reach out to them and get a sense of what your coverage might be for some of these things especially for something like liability coverage or dog buy coverage but a lot of variation within their that you know it could be worth a quick phone call him\nAnd then in terms of securing your home that's another kind of key component of this if you're going to go out and do some trick or treating where you're going to some other sort of festivity you know that's where you know you want to be thinking about ways to you know just make sure

there's a specific hotel in New York City\nThat I might buy him a but that might get a house that he actually ... ... email um they do you know we have this little place that we stay at some times when we go to New York city\nI'd love to own that place [noise] but I have an idea to cost me somewhere around sixty million to buy it I Know he's gotten forty and sixty is my guest I Know a real estate developer he moved to Washington but he used to develop a lot of property is in New York he might be able to help you if you're saying like there's a power vacuum in New York City\nI think there's an opportune actually maybe that's sixty million dollar hotel is probably a lot less right now because I've understood that the whole uh property values in New York City have just taken a

that more inflation could be brewing in the U.S economy\nLabor department's employee cost index rose point excuse me yeah point eight percent for the period ahead of an estimated point seven percent from economists surveyed\nAh wages and salaries way rose at point nine percent well ahead of expectations of a point five minutes to to get a raise\nI didn't neither man so here's the crews are making all this money we probably need to get raises in order to than to just\nTo keep up well not only that but to be part of this statistic right we should be part of the statistic and we're not right now\nOur wages and salaries on their way up point nine percent so almost a one percent increase in the salaries where's where's the well I had of expectations it's the biggest a jump in ten years because on a yearly basis now there's different figures benefit costs were up point four percent a a\nIs so here's the thing they they add all these together right and what they say is wages and salaries jumped three point one percent the biggest increase in ten years\nIs with me a ... would it be if a our wages weren't included here's the dirty here's the dirty secret uh well I don't know that as a dirty secret but here's what you hear all the time\nI right when the man makes more money never pass does any of that money down right when the big boss\nMakes more money he just stuff's more money in his pocket and expect more from his workers and they get paid the same so what was the historic say that that is incorrect if you're one of those who believes that that's true you're probably wrong because in most cases no matter what where you work\nThey typically are wage increases bonuses\nYou've been there for six months you get a bonus some ... a year you get a bonus whatever

of\nWhatever has now fourteen thousand or ... thousand or seven thousand people that are aiming to march all the way to the American border where do you see those contradictions [noise]\nEating lunch it take the entire open borders movement is sort of trade Kate it on a he Cleveland against like state ... or racist or national as to catch people want to come in here so the obvious\nConclusion is

moment of violent they have to leave but then the answer to that\n... to flawlessly cross the Mexican border and then ... enter the United states than in law's continued to resolve again and that almost begs the question I mean there are a Central American\nCountries all all us because of the collective values of the population some some cases and that is people don't see the contradiction that they're breaking the law because they're angry about others breaking the law then why would they come to the United states and not assume they can continue to\nBreak the law which causes reasons for them to leave in the first place\nYou know Dr I literally play the sound by last night that the drift Jenkins of Fox News ... he was interviewing just some random caravan go or through a

attempted murder and uh I think drinking a little taken aback this guy was just talking about yeah I've got an attempted murder and I think I'll go to America and see if they'll clear it up for me a\n... not ... not an accusation but a conviction and and these are some other people that are coming north and the care of it\nI I think there's also a contradiction here in the United states that allow the advocates\nOf open borders are welcome in the care of them do so in the abstract but the concrete some\nManifestations of their advocacy will fall on the Hispanic community for their schools will be impacted for crime will increase or African America is allowed to compete with entry level jobs are just rural people where I live for we've had a lot of gang incidents by people improperly at

kind of very poor abroad and they're very well be at home without consideration of how that affects the middle ... in the United states\nI'm Talking to Dr Victor Davis Hanson is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and the author most recently the brand new book coming out to in March of next year the case for Trump and of course the ah the is one of his parents moved to Mexico ... state of becoming so among the other contradictions of the caravan\nIs it you know I mentioned this to them I'm going to go there they're not truly refugees too in that case\nWhy why are reporters and worm American citizens seeming seemingly willing to buy the story that they're refugees when most of them are in the interviews I've seen them say I want to come to America because the jobs pay better there\nI think part of our people are naive and they always want to be under privileged on that may lead to some of that and the more likely I mean this was more or less time to um criteria one was that when that happened in July\nIt was a media spectacle of children separated from their parents and it resulted in immediate\nSlop and Trump's approval ratings\nFor about four or five points and the surgeon fundraising the Democratic party's\nYou don't mean primaries and and the Trump and so I think people thought people being sympathetic people bought it and make perhaps here as well but if we time another caravan and lives in or near MIT terms and we'll have the same crisis effect crop will probably react\nIn a way that does not appear therapeutic are sympathetic and made me right before the midterm golf data pool a move his six or seven points by points\nAnd down the aisle that will held back because I think it's kind of our long including children on it but the caravan come as a bind and then that knows right on the eve of the costs\nAre these people coming north or those people who've entered recently are they likely to assimilate into America the way other generations have seen people from Europe and and I'm from ... even Eastern Europe as well as Western Europe assimilate into our culture and become part of what is\nThe American culture all Americans but but with characteristics that we bring from all kinds of different background\nAnd no I mean I live in an area that second third generation Mexican Americans who came legally and measured numbers\nAre and the ... and they came with people as you mentioned about all these other countries are completely assimilated inter married to emigrate impediment so that ... melting caught processor usually will come

not legal to upward mobility so we know what works and what does an unfortunately we know that people on the left\nField that when people come illegally and mouse and without easily assemble assimilation scale they tend to vote and block capable of promises and title ... that's been true since the Nineteen century and I I think that's\nAn American citizen so he sued saying boy yes I Am I was\nBorn in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction of the United states and the court in that case says\nNo you're not a citizen when you were born at the time you were born you were born subject that in large part to the jurisdiction that an owing sovereignty to your tribe so you were not a\n... in that ... in the moment you were born you are not subject completely to the jurisdiction of the United states and you are not a citizen and so that was something that as you noted essence it wasn't under the fourteenth amendment Congress ... years later passed a law\nGranting citizenship to Native Americans that should they accepted that she should they should they tried to be okay with that that and so that was not something another fourteenth amendment and in fact something that the courts and and everybody involved the greed that\nEven though they were born in the United states the geographic United States they were not subject to the jurisdiction of the United states under the fourteenth amendment\nNow Amy I'm dark movies were legal policy analyst heritage\nHere's the foreigner your issue except I I think this one's got a simple answer too but I'm a non lawyer so you know I don't worry about billable hours I don't have to make things complicated ah the president says I can for those who are the executive order and I of all these losers who's very large you didn't like it when Obama did and I said no I didn't like it when Obama\nSaid I Want to train federal immigration law says you have to cook but Dr kids out because that's what the law said and he tries to fix the law by signing a piece of paper is bad news ... law by funding piece of paper you can't\nPresident Trump does not proposed to change the constitution or amended he does not proposed between federal law he merely says all the way along the federal bureaucracy has recognized or who have said in effect\nThe the the fourteenth amendment says if you're born here no matter what your circumstances you're an American citizen we're now going to change that interpretation\nCan he do that with an executive order\nSo let me start off by saying that it's incredibly hard to speculate because we don't have an executive order in front of us don't have the language of what he purports to deal with it but that being said this is very very different from a for instance what you saw under DACA where\nThat Congress passed a law there are laws regarding the deportation of people who are in the United states illegally and the Obama administration essentially said we don't like that we're going to prioritize so that certain individuals are not deported and also on top of that even though Congress gave us no authority to do this we're going to uh make it so that\nThat certain individuals have legal status or outside of what Congress has stated that that's a lot different from a president saying look there is no clear authority especially not from the Supreme Court not from Congress as to what the\nFourteenth amendment means with regard to the children of illegal aliens and so it would be well within his his\nConstitutional authority to save\nA instruct executive agencies who issued passports and Social Security numbers that they're going to to execute the laws in a manner that is\nConsistent with this very limited a view of of who is and who is not a citizen that given that Congress hasn't really said one way or the other and at the Supreme Court certainly has not ruled on that but\nEspecially not in the last hundred and Twenty years ago so it's two very different situations there um but again hard to speculate we don't actually know what this executive order might say\nWrote at least we finally get a test of those who will I mean I'm sure it'll be fairly quickly challenged by someone although do they have to wait until somebody is through harmed in the eyes of the law by the implementation of this before they're going to actually ...\n... yeah my my guess is\n... you would see just like what the travel ban almost immediately dozens if not hundreds of lawsuits being filed by asking for an injunction almost certainly one would be granted by some\nJudge somewhere with a nationwide injunction and and it would ultimately given the gravity of of the question that the serious nature of it it hits at the core of of the constitution\nIt there's no way this would avoid the Supreme Court other than they dismiss it on some sort of jurisdiction all thing um\nBut but ultimately it it's a question of Supreme Court hasn't touched for about a hundred and Twenty years and showed an executive order be issued there there is a good chance that the executive order does anything meaningful way it's going to make its way to the Supreme Court out\nAnd use earnings on your mind that the fiber originalist will vote to say we're going to do with the original meaning of the fourteenth amendment or do you think there was in a courtroom there about how the nano vote\nI think there's there's always a question when you're dealing with medical especially when you don't have the order in front of you um you know and it it's always hard to speculate what I can say is that it it is heritage is position and that is the position of of many\nOriginalist scholars that it is very clear based on the jurisdiction all history or sorry on on the um the legislator history that the origin\nIt didn't let sellers that it is very clear based on that your sexual history sorry I'm On a I'm a legislator\nOriginal intention what Congress intended to
