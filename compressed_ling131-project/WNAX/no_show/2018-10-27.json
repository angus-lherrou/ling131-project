Twitter poll we bought a brand new question each and every day at Lars Larson dot com that's our website\nAlso at at Lars Larson joined Twitter should President Trump be held partially responsible for the bombs\nAbsolutely not my answer to that is now if you choose to answer yes the only thing I'd like to know is\nDoes that mean that each and every time that a president is critical of people from the opposition party critical of the media as Donald Trump has been critical of democratic politicians and critical of a lot of Republican politicians as well I might remind you that one of the unique things about Donald Trump\nIs it while you didn't hear Broncos Obama criticized people from his own party very much at all in fact I Can't think of a very good example where Morocco bomber for Bill Clinton\nOr or Jimmy Carter or any of the other Democrats who have served as president of the United states chose to criticize their own party\nBut I Do see them you know criticized the opposition party Donald Trump criticizes anyone that he disagrees with\nThat as far as I'm concerned that's a good feature in a president\nOur Twitter bowl should President Trump held partially responsible for

that are way beyond my ability to read and the popular press as well\nMiller welcome back to be with your lawyers\nThat are way beyond my ability to read and the popular press as well Dr Miller welcome back to be with your ...\nSo we've got a lot of other threats in this world obviously today we've been spending a lot of time talking about the bomber and that sort of thing and I wanted to grab you on a couple of those things at the end of this interview but\nWould you mind talking about the fact that we see continued that bridge to try to ban plastic here and banned plastic there\nAnd the fact is I thought plastics has actually been one of the things that we had done that actually made our lives we take for granted but it's made our lives a whole lot safer from a lot of the threats that human beings have faced literally for thousands of years and plastic as the way we've escape from some of those threats\nOh absolutely and in fact uh as I wrote this article about the ego fundamentalists attacks on plastics or I thought back to that Nineteen sixty seven film the graduate uh and you may remember that uh Dustin Hoffman plays the title role and she said his\nGraduation party and and the guy comes up to him and says uh then I have one word for you [noise]\n... ah\nAnd and a half century since then plastics have really revolutionized [noise] uh so many industries\nUh and uh you know when I was training and and medicine we hit just converted from glass bottles for intravenous solutions and blood to plastic bottles and it was such a remarkable improvement they store better they keep\nBetter they're safer because inevitably glass bottles would we be dropped a and the glass on the floor and what you would never get up and people would get caught and and\nSo on a but medical devices or electronics all sorts of things uh plastics had been really a revolution and yet the activists continue to attack it ah Earth Day in April of this year\nWas a devoted to ending plastic pollution quote unquote [noise] and um we continue to have a a tax on various plaster size or things that make plastics pliable at ... and more convenient like\nThis fan all a BPA\nUm and the attacks just go on and on and on a a base with avoid without much basis um and uh without thinking about it carefully and considering the science\nWell and I thought about that too because I Know a lot of people say well you know there's food safety but I buy my food in tin cans what a lot of people may not appreciate his those so called tin cans with ... which have very little pin and them are actually lined with as you said BPA and other kinds of things that make\nA tin can a whole lot more save\nFor containing any kind of food you buy the grocery store and and and and the plastics\nYou know dog I think about the plastics where products you know including a lot of food products are packing sometimes dramatically sealed and you know the air taken out or some other kind of gas put in so that so that everything last longer and or is or is better better protected\nAgainst the kind of common contamination that could literally take your life or a few decades ago\nYou're you're absolutely right and you you bring up a a a broader point which is\nThat you have to you have to do with the risk analysis folks called comparative risk assessment you have to ask if you if you were lemonade a product day what are you a substitute for what are you left with\nA and so we're seeing that in California because there's a a a state senator who keeps introducing bills to ban Styrofoam containers from restaurants for takeout and for a for hot beverage it sort of cold averages and uh\nIt seems popular because we see a Styrofoam trash around but the alternative of course his paper which is more a consumptive of oil and electricity interesting late\nBy the way I Want people to take note of that and the fact that they say well there's a ... I remember the McDonald's Styrofoam clam shells they'd put hamburgers and because it both insulated and kept the juice worried belong and they said well you have to get rid of these because they don't degrading the landfill and when I went on research in a long time ago\nI had people say well we're going to replace them with plastic coded paper oh how does that'd be great and they said well it doesn't quite last as long in the landfill it it may be the Styrofoam would degrade over a you know hundreds of years and the paper will degrade over fewer hundreds of years am I right about those numbers are you are my aunt or\nDo you are absolutely right that the the other thing is that a ... a generates less waste water and also occupies less\nSpace and landfill and the other thing is that we have we now have\nBacteria that will degrade a Styrofoam\nAnd and other plastics and the landfill so I you know this these objections these attempts to ban things are just not well founded and well thought out so which is typical of what we say about the anti corporate anti technology it go fundamentalist\nHey I Want to ask you about something ... about an hour ago I was talking to a guest who's a former police detective we're talking about the bomber you know the bombs that went through the males and he said well he ... he thought it was interesting that we found out he's a he was a ... a retired top investigator for New York city's police department\nAnd he said we found out the postal service has things like this going through it and we don't even know it and I thought and we're always hearing about other kinds of contraband whether it's illegal drugs from Asia uh we're seeing a stuffed come through that it's\nThat marijuana good ship that way and if states haven't decided to legalize it it shouldn't be ship and I asked him\nWe had this technology we see at the airport and I you know while I don't know all the particulars of it I Know that when they watch your bag with computers and cell phones and this and batteries and all that go through\nThey know what color the screen is supposed to be and they know what colors indicate it may be some kind of contraband whether it's a fluid that liquid or possibly explosive\nYou know I don't know what color explosive comes up as ... I Would imagine I haven't been through the TSA line when somebody whose putting explosives through but my understanding is the color coding helps them spot those things pull him aside and do some more examination I said if you wanted to scan hundreds of thousands of uh packages the postal service carries\nCould we do that and could we say to a computer\nWhen a certain kind of material or what appears to be that kind of material comes through you know as we X ray could we X ray\nYou know say hundreds or thousands of packages by running them through a computer controlled line and then when it sees a box that they may not be sure it's contraband or explosive or whatever it kicks set aside and and let somebody else take a closer look at it\nThat's all technology that within our grasp isn't it\nIt it is and with artificial intelligence the system can actually learn what it needs to reject and ... that red flag and pass all are in fact it's my understanding\nActually learn what it needs to ... and ... read sly can pass all in fact it's my understanding that checked baggage is a analyze that way as well as the the the baggage that you put on the conveyor belt yourself\nSo we could we could literally said of the postal service I Know they they feel like they're strained just doing the job they do now but they're losing first class mail but why don't we make sure that the stuff that's going through the post office get scanned by the same kind of thing I think the public would be all for it\nYeah I think we could certainly do that for packages you know flat flat letters a could probably sail through and then maybe do it just for packages that's very good idea laws\nWell I just it just struck me that if that's within our grasp but I'm the same guy who wants to see a chicken irradiated before I did get sent to the supermarket sweep kill all the salmonella or the other bacteria\nHere Joe I thought you were keeping most of the nuts and Virginia and the purple part of the state around Richmond is don't you try and keep them confined up there\nAnd try to at least get them elected to office and then they can do crazy things like you know a ... on a\nBoard member from at jails to try to get you know arts catch and release program to complete it at our local jail but aside from those nuts [noise] um yeah we we are short a few nuts in this town and I and cross for ... for Judea end the mid Atlantic is is seeing this for\nQuite a bit of what they are in the are coming to the side of the road\nSo maybe more hunting do you suppose that's a ...

and I we were pretty good friends and and um but no I you know we make whiskey and I'm also still and counterterrorism but I'm also seeing her consult them at the Pentagon for electronic warfare and countermeasures so I don't have much of a\nPolitical background that people were asked a while I was running and it was really when I was building lettuce celery was a regulatory burdens and the fact we're being attacked by lobbyists and I never had any control and I'm like if I don't get involved you know at some point um I don't know what I'm going to do and that's why I actually got into politics I explain to people that\nIt's at my DNA my service and what I Want her to do and I don't need this job I don't need a retirement and the fact is I was fighting for my wife's company and I and I had a lobbyist telling me one time large who said hey if you're not at the dinner table you're on the menu\nAnd um I'll never forget that comment he also called me collateral damage and military that show but so they asked her why she ran she goes well I I resist Donald Trump that that was that a certain region for running you know she she's a sort of a fly and candidates who are district kissed multiple homes you know she's a sixty minutes producer her daughter's Olivia wild\nUm so it's pretty interesting is that I actually ran 'cause I thought I could help people based on my business

have Trump more than any other candidate in the country\nFor that is that that's interesting it's interesting that you're up against somebody like that and the Virginia voters my embrace her\n[noise] I mean we just we had a poll this morning and we knew that there was one of the ninth hole say we're tied and the other ones we've done pretty well\nBut it's been interesting that um there are certain sectors in my district too you know Charlottesville and end up closer to northern Virginia I don't know if you know the SARS my district is bigger than New Jersey and parts of Delaware it's Twenty one and he's um there are several hundred and thirty thousand people spread on this massive\nDistrict it looks like a dragon riding a scooter I'm the way that it sort of gerrymandered into you know right

you know a different kind of government than most of the the left coast or the right coast I'm stuck here on the left goes surrounded by liberals\nBut I find that when you ask people about specific issues are often more conservative than you might guess based on who gets elected to Congress\n[noise] I think it\nShows coming into into the commonwealth you know we\nAre Kenya was the first colony but I'll tell you a large trudging you're born and raised right I I mean\nI was born in the bustling metropolis of Annapolis right and my dad live down near Charlottesville and then put it in a county um I've seen a huge change since ... since you know I was a kid I was in the military went around the world but what I'm saying is that it's changed that and I know this sounds like almost\nThere's no common sense coalition left it's almost like there's this progressive and I made up this word ... people saying that the ... I Can't I have always feared government\nOr even being in it and and supporting the constitution some of the government has always been sort of where I'm always err on the side of liberty so when I see now is is that people seem to just want somebody to take care of them in a sort of scary that that American Dream or that that individual is that we all\nThink is part of the fabric of our country the DNA of our constitution it seems that some people now saying that the government is there to help them or protect them and I think the government is usually there just to sort of um enforce equal misery amongst the populace and so I I'm just trying to get this liberty name back to this liberty same\nBack into this campaign but also back into the ... because it's it's where I was born and raised I Love this I Love this place Larson meadows I'm an optimist I Can't help\nAnd I want to see you do well see I'm One of those ... I find there's it occurred to me the other day I was thinking\nMost of those on the left or more about well let's do things naturally and let's say you know and all that I said look to me natural is not a group of people who were directed by government they're individuals I mean for most of the history of human beings on this planet we've been self directed people and occasionally we organize into\nTowns and villages or or larger communities like states and counties\nBut but we do that to you know to to say well we need some things done that could really be best done by a government\nThese like states and counties but but we do that to you know to to say we need some things done that can really be best done by a government agency and it's tough for individuals run in jail or a police force or or a military and thanks for your service but for\nThose very same people who want things to be natural but the natural order of things I think is not to have\nHuman beings being told this is how you're going to live your life so I'm all about pushing for liberty in Virginia as well what's your website so people can help you out with the campaign\nSearched ...

the war\nHe presented the story of fugitive slaves and the struggle for American Soul from the revolution to the civil war this is a a historical analogy if it works and Michael is identified the the

avoid crushing the opposition denying the legitimacy of its existence or values or inflicting upon an extreme and gratuitous humiliation beyond the substance of the games that are being thought\nThe

in value of comedy can be best appreciate it when we contemplated society in which is almost completely lacking Michael that's a warning that I wrote it in Nineteen sixty eight we know that at some

that we're out to\nTo to reform you and make you submit and if you refuse it will be expunged is exactly what drove south to the intense aggressiveness that they exhibited in the Eighteen fifty it's not just the fugitive slave act but all of the\n... of terrorism and and and the like\nYou can send the canning of some ... and the Dred Scott decision and the fugitive slave all the laws are going to Boston and humiliating the Bostonians by having to deliver up a young man we we've gone through all of this is Michael and we see the same the same cycle going on today one side seek to humiliate when defeating the other side\nThere is no possibility in the minds of either of the a radical debates today that they can survive without destroying the other and the fact is that the\nRebel side\nWhich is a smaller league as we've discussed and which is\nLess are connected to the thing is of national power in Washington and in the economy certainly they read a side is on the defense and it's quite clear a and you can see it from the larger national media\nBut there is a dominant voice uh and and the preponderance of of a ... she might say a ... on the part of blue and blue is seeking um\nTotal an absolute objectives right\nNow as high a highly Michael pie asleep thinking there is there is a self election that does not truck debate it's it's a it's a it's a third and that's the end of\nThis is why we use terms like virtue signaling and wind up ... uses a a term of art like an evangelical progressive is some because even though the um\nThe radical of blue elite is permanently atheistic

[noise]\n... about a week or two ago the New York times had a front page report about how Jared Kushner has not paid any taxes in the past five or six years and [noise] you know it was kinda referring you know in ...\nTimes had a front page report about how Jared Kushner had not paid any taxes in the past five or six years and [noise] you know it was kind of referring you know in ... you know what kind of sketchy deals is he doing worries\nCheating the government out of taxes and that that's just not the case I mean whether or not you agree with with Jared Kushner is politics or not um she did not paying taxes because he took advantage of certain incentives and attacks on set up that have been around for a while that I think a lot of business owners need to understand as well ... and the real estate property business\nHe buys buildings in rehab damned renovate salmon rents them out\nThere are some specific new depreciation allowances that are allowed for businesses like him so he can take them up front adoptions um that that offset any income that might be coming in business owners themselves have the availability to take some significant deductions on capital equipment\nThat they buy for many case of a million dollars a year John and if you're a business owner and you want to buy equipment\nLike Jared 'cause you don't necessarily have to pay for it you can put a down payment you can finance the rest as long as you put that equipment or that property into service you can take a big tax deduction for Cushing who did this\nTo the extent where there's the directions were even exceeded his income and then he was able to carry forward those losses or even carry them back as well\nSo everything you did was completely legal and above board and not only that it's good tax strategy a business owners themselves should be paying attention to that kind of tax strategy making investments like that\nAnd capital equipment property taking the tax deduction I think it's a very very good you know strong business move and I hope that a lot of accountants are making those recommendations to their clients did\nThe tax cuts and job back to twenty Seventeen make this even more attractive as because this is all be the first year we discovered that\nGood so do these these deductions\nThat I've been in place for a while I mean the big one that a lot of business owners need to be aware of its called section one Seventy nine deduction just ask your account and about that that deduction year after year um it's kind of up for whether or not it was going to be renewed ball and the taxi format\nNot only was it made permanent but it was increased from like five hundred thousand dollars up to a million dollars that businesses can take as a as an accelerated depreciation to touch and\nNot only that and the tax reform act the act and allowed an added more deductions for certain business used vehicles trucks in your business as well that didn't exist before so these are all things that are there and you and I are talking about this now it's late October there is still time left in the year business owners\nThat you can you can make investments in capital of the equipment you can get them finance put him into service before the end of the year and take a significant tax deduction while doing that and why not\nWhat the number again Jane [noise] you can the section of the iris code is one Seventy nine one section one Seventy nine you want to ask your account and about\nTrade war we are\nPuzzled as to where it is and where or when it's going to visit our house such trade for\nThe dispute with Canada as you mentioned in Mexico looks to be moving toward resolution the dispute with Europe\nHas not has not at this point crashed anybody's economy and Europe is talking but there's a dispute with China as I indicated is going to drag on does this war a small businesses because they're worried about the macro economy or can they see this in their prices\n[laughter] well there is that there there were a lot of impacts on small businesses most small businesses themselves um or not to ... affected by the trade war but their indirectly affected by the trade war and\nThere are large companies like Ford who right now is approximately twenty thousand employees that are going to be laid off\nBecause of increasing costs and Harley Davidson that's moving operations to ah you know other countries that side of the U.S to avoid ah the terrorists that they would have to pay and\nCompanies like three am and caterpillar that are facing increase costs on on some of the corn materials that they buy 'em and also some of the market but they might be losing because of the war that's going on right now and it is a war\nWith China that as an indirect impact on on small small contractors\nSuppliers vendors that that work up to those larger companies and then of course there's the consumer effect there is you know the most recent round of of terrorists do affect electronics and consumer goods that are being sold by the Wal Marts and the targets of the world and\nThat you know filters down to consumers who for many you know our our customers of small businesses and if they're paying more there are willing to take away some disposable income that they could be spending this holiday season a at a small merchants are or restaurants\nSo it does have that impacts right now like you said things are pretty much resolved with Canada and Mexico to be aware you know all the legislature still have to approve this right\nSo that's still up in the air depending on how the midterms go Europe right now we're sort of at a truce so discussions continue on with China like you mentioned before is the big thing\nI I was at a meeting of ... a bunch of small manufacturers just this week in Minneapolis and some of them were saying that all of this you know if you ... yelling and screaming between the Chinese and and the American counterparts\nIs all coming down to Trump and president gee I'm meeting in November and I am one guy stood up and said you know what I understand but Trump is doing when I have a big agreement that I'm going to make with a significant supplier I Want to meet that person face to face\nAnd work it out with him I don't need my sales guys are representatives doing it on my part and some people think that that's what Trump strategy is that a lot of bravado and all building up to the big deal that ah that that the two of them are going to are going to make in in November um doesn't sound like you're as optimistic about that have happened\nOh I Know I'm not however I Am\nI Do have a positive here to end this the macro consumers are spending gene ending and bending and bending the wall Street Journal notes that the consumer spending it's powered by all the jobs and the really good jobs and that means a good Christmas season and that's what we care about right now\nAgreed agreed and you know I think that the president now at near realizes we've heard that GDP um you know as potentially impacted by a trade issues with China but John I mean right now GDP is growing and like you said consumers are spending in the economy is strong and\nUh you know maybe from the president's perspective is like if I'm if we're going to fix this issue with China an issue that so many of my clients have been complaining about for years why not do it now when we're in a position of a way I have a strong economy Jean right\nMarc since the small business columnist for the

launch was a success and it does indicate that\nThey're getting closer to solving the problem\nIt's more important that they wanted to do a variety of sun man test launches with the soy use to make

where does that end and how far along are they in the pursuit\n[noise] [noise] yeah well you know what I've been reporting on that story for some years now and um it began with a a small number of scientists um who experimented on monkeys and it gets a little grizzly but this being Halloween okay\nAh where they yeah they separate the monkeys head and then they re attached it\nOr just to prove that they could so there's a lot of plumbing involved right I mean you have to show up they\nThey the the veins in the arteries and the nerves and so forth and so on and they've they've scientists have achieved to\nA level of success with monkeys and so now embolden by that they are turning their attention to doing it to humans and there's at least one guy in Russia who's been quoted a frequently\nOr who is a quadriplegic or you know otherwise mentally very alert and he says yeah come and do it to me man I'm I'm ready I'm I Want to be that guinea pig\nAnd there are scientists who are over her were quoted as saying yeah they're going to do it so we're once again you know remember I'm I'm old enough to remember the first artificial heart transplant\nSure you remember that uh the ... or the um the what was his name Jarvis writer yeah something like that\nAnd um everybody ... oh my God way way putting that much mechanical heart in a human being and the you know was in South Africa right and\nYeah he jumped in and\nAnd and and and you know now artificial hearts are pretty routine thing although now you know with stem cell research and other things going on a show where even getting past the mechanical hearts hey by the way in a you talk about things that\nGive me some pause here's one there are three groups of scientists in California and Minnesota hey I read that it's like Minnesota that's like so random but okay there you are\nNo you know the ... University of Minnesota's a monster persistently does he had a huge research you it's a it's an hour one it's a big school\nNo no you're right you're right I just I just I don't know why this gives me an article but\nAnyway you have three groups of scientists\nWho are creating a creatures that have never walked the face of the earth before they're called ... shape human and pick him income areas so these are creatures whose DNA has been knit together using human DNA and ... being a or human DNA pig DNA\nAnd they're creating these creatures because they will have human Oregon they will have human kidneys human livers human hearts for the purpose of you know transplanting them to patients in aid\nAnd you know I get that I had a friend who who died recently because his kidneys just went south and he couldn't get a transplant and boom\nAh but now what that's done is to raise the very real possibility and I discussed is the book that\nIf you put too much human DNA into the recipe so it's always a question too much human DNA too little human DNA then you don't get the human organs\nRight if you put in too much DNA then you can have an animal a creature that thinks like him and that has basically human brain trapped inside of a body of a sheep or pick I mean these these are the things that are very real now because of our ability to tamper with DNA\nUm so that's one of the things that gives me it gives me a little bit later\nThat we really wanted to and what's interesting\nIs that these guys are doing it and by the way I quote one of the researchers that says yeah that's that's a real possibility that this is not like you know made a pie in the sky I mean they even the researchers admits yeah we got to be careful this possibility\nBut they're doing this research against the wishes of the anti age the national institutes of health which is the government's never won funding body for biological genetic engineering so even the anti age it's kind of very um [noise]\nYeah you know forward thinking of funding organization is saying you know maybe we should just pushed the pause button and decide do we want to do this and if so what are the guidelines\nFor the guard rails are all I'm sure I'm sure these guys are not just doing it in violation of the you know you're probably doing it against the advice of their moms like what are you yeah yeah they don't\nMind the oh my God it reminds me when I was growing up in east LA and then montebello over to the town over and I was a real geek I mean I was speaking out when I was a kid and I found a way to make hydrogen gas using stuff that I found my mom's kitchen\nAnd I look back and I'm Out there in the garage at the ... of our [laughter] making hydrogen gas and you know that stuff is explosive\nYou know ...

Know\nIt's so big brother in a way to because it's not just I mean that story\nAnd ... and again I remind people will get to the phones you're coming up they're already ringing and will line of people to to talk with Michael deal in the end of life as we know it in a few but\nBut that story out of turkey about the supposedly the audio recording that was made by this guy ... um you know apple

that matter\nMay be in there in the Saudi constantly they have a they have Google and they had the Little Syria or whatever and they monitor it that way but however it happened\nThat kind of the debt that passive listening\nThat is going on that we had not yet fully come to terms with what that could mean for our jobs for our relationships are for our communities\nAnd for the security of our ... a country I just had an op ed that it's going to be published very shortly I'm a U.S a Congress issued a report on Thursday so a saying that um\nThe Chinese are hell bent on um a exploiting the vulnerabilities of something called the Internet of things and that's what we're talking about\nThat kind of a ... year treasury rate or your dishwasher everything that's going to\nAll these smart devices that we're talking about the Alex's the smart watches the smart as you say refrigerators the smart thermostat on and on and on ... there are now I'm more than eight billion\nInternet of things devices so we call it I O T I talk about it in the book\nAnd the Chinese or the this as an opportunity to ... to spy on us and we are they willing accomplices because we're buying these gadgets bringing them into our own home you talk about the show the thing in\nAnd we're finding out about the damage that everyday stress can do to our bodies the warning signs that we should be aware of and what we can do to alleviate and even eliminate the effects of stress and Dr ... you were talking earlier about calcium and magnesium and\nHow we need these nutrients in our bodies to fight the effects of stress in your ... formula can help us in this battle against stress I'd like to talk for a minute about how the magnesium factors in I mean\nUh I I'm starting to understand about the calcium but what does magnesium\nOr we're talking about stress and we're talking about dress affects the body and first of all in order to function at all your body needs magnesium it's probably of all the vitamins I could list magnesium is probably the most important vitamin on the planet right now\nI've not heard a whole lot about magnesium ... why is magnesium so important\nThere is over three hundred and twenty five bio chemical reactions that magnesium is involved with it it's almost like a hormone wow and for example if there was a low levels of magnesium your heart won't be very important factor in life\nYou would say though\nIn fact let me just read a list of some of the conditions are associated with magnesium deficiencies okay um you have attention deficit disorder Alzheimer's anxiety asthma autism\nChronic fatigue syndrome congestive heart disease caused the patient diabetes fibromyalgia high blood pressure insomnia migraine headaches multiple sclerosis muscle cramps Parkinson's Bastille Perot's is getting a list just goes on and on and on\nAnd this is this is associated with a a lack of magnesium in the bunny\nSimply a lack of magnesium bully too so it's I think that really mess around with now what happens is that we need the magnesium in your body in order for the cow seemed to be absorbed\nSo it's it's a necessary thing in order to get the first component which has calcium\nThat's right they work in combination with each other\nAbout there's many more practical applications of this ... formula ... first of all like I said you drink it so it gets into your system and one of the first things we use it for in our clinic is for people who are under a lot of stress\nAnd they can't sleep well at night it works better than anything I've ever seen for people that have trouble sleep it really because it relaxes you ride any do actually fill the relaxation after you drink the ah they have to drink a cup of the comics formula\nInteresting\nNow the other thing that it's really really good for people who are in pain [noise]\nOkay and I have a whole bunch of stories to tell you and and a case studies of people actually taking account max formula and getting rid of pain and this is included arthritic Taipei\nFibromyalgia which is a form of arthritis back pain muscle spasms migraine headaches there's a whole category of of areas I'd like to discuss with you\nWhile that's fantastic some of those things that you've named seem to be age related or or things that we experience as we grow older [noise] is there a link there\nYeah there's a vicious circle that I'd like to discuss\nWhat happens is that when a person has\nA magnesium deficiency specifically make museum they don't absorb their food as well\nAnd so they go into what we call mal absorption syndrome which millions and millions of Americans have and it's not like you feel sick or you know this that use it might be over time just starting to feel more tired and tired and tired mhm and that's just a real graduate overtime type of thing and a lot of people justify that they're getting old and they just need more\nGrass or whatever right that that's what I Would think that what happens is that when when you get less absorption you actually increase the efficiency in your system of museums\nAnd that and that started to take the count them out of the bones to start getting goal in life you start getting 'em all muscle loss because it also reduces the muscle mass and pretty soon before you know you are feeling old yeah and your body's actually starting to manifest\nWow all due to a simple lack of these nutrients\nAnd let me tell you and it is simple the problem in being a doctor researchers how do you get this end of the system the formula we have the ... formula is so fantastic because it's in a powder form\nYou take hot water and you make if you put it in a cop take a teaspoon of this powder and mix it in any drink is cut down this great my absorption rate is really incredible because it actually goes right into your blood stream\nAll right and this was probably a good time folks if you want to get a free book about calcium and magnesium and tried Dr ... formula\nThere is a special toll free number to call it's one eight hundred eight two three eight to one nine ... is a unique blend of calcium and magnesium that gets absorbed into your blood stream so you can replace those vital nutrients that your body burns up when you experienced stress\nThey don't want to let you know that Dr ... says arranged a very special introductory offer it's only available to your listeners so when you call be sure to mention this program and you'll get a risk free trial of ... again this was only available to listeners and only if you call this toll free number\nIt's one eight hundred eight two three eight to one nine\nSo if you're feeling the symptoms of stress the lack of sleep the low energy pain and stiffness in your muscles and joins your body is telling you is lacking the calcium and magnesium it needs to handle the effects of everyday stress you know if you're concerned maybe about bone health or osteoporosis do you want to improve your heart health your digestive health\nAnd even reduce or eliminate the effects of stress I encourage you try to kill max formula only have to do is pick up

eighty two three eight to one nine I'll give it to you again it's one eight hundred eight two three eight to one nine well if you're just joining us I've got Dr Michael take us on the phone today and he's telling us about stress\nAnd how important it is to ensure that you've got the proper nutrients in your system specifically calcium and magnesium\nAnd how much of an impact that has on our overall health\nSo I guess one of the things that people should really be aware of is because this is an instant thing that triggers you to say oh I'm sick but you know instead happens gradually over time it's very possible that people might not even be aware that there is a deficiency of calcium and magnesium and thereby\nWell that's the thing is that a deficiencies are not like I'm a water main break in or you have a real noticeable thing the right to their little trips a little leaks here and there and so what we have is a cumulative effect\nWhere a person starts to go downhill a little bit at a time to the point where they don't realize how bad they've actually gotten before it's too late\nDr bank is you'd mentioned insomnia we talked about that a little bit what about back pain\nThan many of them is excellent for back pain because the calcium goes into the muscles magnesium actually helped the translators and the nerve\nAnd when you take this ... formula many times it will calm your back pain wow I Know I I have a couple of years ago I heard he ate at a desk and my back and I always try and everything and I took out the comics formula\nI drank it and I couldn't believe that difference within about a half hour functional again not wasn't completely gone but I I drank it over ten day period it completely alleviated the problem\nNow what about heart disease\nHeart disease is something you have to watch out for both ... and going down the genetic line yeah and if anyone has any history of heart disease or even even had bypass surgery you\nShould be on this count acts formula and I can't say that without enough emphasis because it's something that will completely give you a new lease on life\nIsn't that amazing we talked about arthritis what about joint pain\nWell they arthritic joints really respond to this and I recently gave a can of this lady was suffering from fibromyalgia where she was having pain and just about every join her body being hernia could be in her neck it could be in her elbow\nAnd um and I gave it to her one week and I saw or the next week and I swear Chris I did not recognize her really just that the lady that was sixty four years old and the first time I saw her she looked like she was\nEighty four years old and a week later she was she had a beautiful smile her eyes were claiming that I I honestly had to ask my wife who this lady

on with that but I think part of it is also understanding your identity and executing that are just better than your opponent uh there's so much familiarity\nIn our league and so I think the other thing is you start way these games are off so many times also come down but beyond just making the playoffs but you're seeding opportunities then\nThat's where a carry the event additional importance

unbelievable goalkeeper and so I think that combinations been posting\nAbout one thing that's under rated though is our defenders ability to not only do that but then turn around the turn somebody over and take it the other way and our transition and get into our office which allows the chance to score some goals and\nWe we've been out shooting teams you know Fifteen to five and twenty that

forced\nConsecutive turnovers on two straight Illinois state plays you are involved big in that first on the path to Spencer Chanel\nAnd this and she'll ... throughout the week forced\nConsecutive turnovers on two straight Illinois state plays you were involved in that first one the pastor Spencer Janelle walk me through your set of events and what happened is you come up with that from\nA I was just first off his player to play like a jazz play and ah just hospitable no matter what I mean even though you're on the back side or on the front you guys get to the ball and that was my mindset just to get off the blocking get to the bone be tried to be different maker and everything we do and then what happened\nAnd then he was cutting back and I just saw my opportunity I took it wrapped him up at the ball and\nThis is really about is fun [noise] All right\nSo then jak scored a touchdown Europe fourteen seven the next play there was a football and the staff or did you see\nYou know honestly I I I didn't see the fumble honestly but I knew we had a ... going on where ... comes in and crack center so\nI feel like that that made a part in it and when he dropped it I was just like this is crazy this is fun\nTime it's fun but I mean something like that you don't get the happens a lot so that's how big was this when it was good I mean we need to get our we need to get our motive American I guess that really helps but\nThey they were hard fought to you know what I mean they're all line their coach while in every thousand plays a cultural fast and physical and it was just a fun game on around when you have teams that are like that have your ward\nThank you very much regulation I we had a couple other jak student athletes will talk to here is don't make their way down tearing Christian and and ah Mikey Daniel also make their weight out one at a time we'll hear from them again the Jack rabbits eight thirty eight twenty eight weigh in\nOn the road here in normal Illinois as the Jack rabbits and the battle of the top Fifteen rank teams come away with an impressive world victory and the senior quarterback from the Jack rabbits tearing Christian is\nDone to Mike and he joined us and I know that the game was expected to be a back and forth battle and you come out and you make a big plate early in the game you know it wouldn't be that easy but what a way to get things started for you how long touchdown pass on the third play\nYeah just exciting ... shot there uh I forgot who is to animators at those to Adam uh that's my job right now I'm trying to picture everything right now is but when you do\nAs many as you did you really have to get one\nBut yeah it was good to just get the moment of our favor and then just a kind of just going from there you know just asking her job doing our job every play I'm ... now I'm thinking of it as a scramble or out of random okay I got to know ah but yeah obviously a huge play or you want to start the game with some points on the board says those you'd start\nHad some opportunities unable to get points throughout the rest of the quarter and into the second yet the defense kept rising to the occasion\nTo defense played great especially for the the first three quarters and the fourth I Know there are lots of touchdowns or they're not happy with that but really they\nThey put us in a position to get that lead a cause I mean when you when you get to turnovers oh and we only after you get less than thirty yards I think both times uh really makes our job as a lot easier so so really credit to the defense for for allowing us to build a lead\nA because we weren't a move of all time uh getting into the red zone and things are to the first quarter and then in the in the end of the second quarter of like the last five seven minutes something like that I think we have three touchdowns\nAre really just describes the difference for that uh they they really built that lead force\nAnd that final touched down to the half the long bomb decay Johnson really seem like the back breaker what did you see on that play\nA we're reading uh the safety or in the middle there hum he a\nJob and I think what Blake was running a little cross you're out of the middle he drove a kid who's gonna come open a and then I think the corner or just got tangled up with his feet and kind of fell so I mean that it kind of made a little easier actually took it looked like he was going to trip\nOver here is the only one there and then he goes man I was I was really nervous about that was going to drop their own but uh he brought it in a and it was a huge play obviously so\nAnd then as the game or a law and the offensive line performed better and better and being able to generate some room for Nike Daniel what a job like you did this afternoon\nYeah it's great to really pick that up in the second half and get their running game going a lot more I Know that one drive a things got the ball with\nA twelve minutes after seven minutes off the clock and that was already in place I think there's one passed away and I think I missed that uh so I mean a credit to them a little line and Mike you are really turned out some tough yards are\nWell you've been on the road a lot of times in the sleep is not an easy place to win\nSorry I mean anywhere in this in this way if you're in a way game it's not a nice place to win a you know the last couple of times we've been here we didn't play very well uh so that come out a start fast to get up big and then a whole leaders damage game was obviously a huge storm reserve I Would\nHave to ask and I know Jack rabbit nation was holding their collective breath salary feeling right now 'cause you went down there for a play in the second call I find that we were ready to go

doing that to me\nBut a lucky Daniel with us here in our first Dakota national bank post game show and Mike is similar to what I talked to tear it about the defense and the first half of really puts you guys in a position mad that they play well for you\nYeah absolutely I mean they've been playing really well the last two weeks honestly I'm and like parents that are there for them to get a supposition and get those turnovers a and give ... give us a call within the dirty yards are officer so good that we're probably going to score you know if not feel go we're going to we're going

happens I always get very excited about that and somehow those airports I think seemed to convert seemed to handle it so I'm not sure what Apple's doing in terms of profiles but normally when you use Bluetooth anything there's different profile depending on how you're using it and when you're using a headset profile\nYou know you wouldn't you wouldn't want to listen to music on the headset profiling sound like a phone call so I'm not sure\nIf that's what's going on now there are um and and scooter exes mentioning his plant products BP has said there are headset to support HG high def voice\nAnd I would imagine that what they're doing is is flipping over into a a you know in ... some sort of a a too deep pain mode is ... ... you would think that apple their pods would be as good as it can get\nA but I'm not sure\nExactly what Apple's doing overall and I haven't I haven't heard that you've seen people complain about this and the forums and so forth\nOh yeah I've done like ... you know mainly I always make sure that if I asked a call that no\nChemistry kind of let me on today but you know I also noticed something else I Believe or at a Bluetooth five point zero but they're using for point too I Believe it is\nEither and that's it that's exactly\nThat's gotta be why we why are we not what's going on there apple so I have a letter going out to the company to say why is it your behind the eight ball where we're not using the latest and Bluetooth\nTechnologies Eric calm and this is a I think people sometimes think Apple's going to be a tech leader they're not they're tech follower they never want to be the first one to use any technology so it took them forever for instance to use 'em NFC near field communication is well all the other phones are using touch to pay and\nYou were able to tap I'm On a Bluetooth devices to pair and so forth apple only\nStarted doing that a couple of generations ago and even then only allowed for Apple particular uses apple pay and specifically\nAnd only recently have they started to open up the NFC a PR so they're way behind same thing with wireless charging same thing with a lot of things and so it's not at all surprising that the airports would not support Bluetooth five\nApples are funny beach because of course they count the fact that we're we we developed a W one ship just to make sure Bluetooth sounded better and worked better actually they didn't say sounded better I think the only said worked better on the air but\nEverybody thinks there's an air pods second generation\nJust around the corner maybe they'll announce it on Tuesday although I'm not seeing the rumors of that uh I Would I Would really expect the second generation and until then I don't think the airports are the best Bluetooth headset you can get a Bluetooth to me is really troublesome is one of the reasons I'm Still angry\nThat apple and Google and others are dropping the headphone Jack really bugs me of the of the four phones in front of me only one has a headphone jacks ... nine really drives me nuts 'cause honestly wired is still better going sound better and it's not going to drop out and it's not going to have problems\nYeah I've noticed that yeah so glued to the point the rails on things and yeah well yeah I'm with you that but you yeah yeah\nI'm apple apple will adopt Bluetooth five later [laughter]\nYeah I'm with you that but the idea\nOf apple apple will adopt Bluetooth five later\n[laughter] when we don't need it\n'cause when six comes out which is five uh is fairly new I ... it was it was a the the phone supported by the way um they have Bluetooth five in the ... everything from the phone up so they started that last year um\nBut I guess they didn't you know maybe they're ... came out a little earlier they were in developmental earlier and they didn't feel like well we're going to wait and make sure it's all good that's just apple and I I don't think people\nBuy\nIf you shouldn't buy apple to be on the cutting edge\nThe theory that apple lives by that most apple observers say apple you know\nActually in bodies is we're gonna take existing technology and make it work better\n[noise] that's where the you know the W one ship in the air power to take liberties we're not going to check which is five big blue do to make it work better\n[noise] um [noise] you you you iPhone is not by any means cutting edge technology\nIt doesn't support five gee for instance uh although no phone yet supports five you the only one I Know it was the Motorola ah\nUm is it the or\nPlay now the Motorola the three which has a doesn't really support five gee but ... has a place you could snap on a mode of mine that will give it five gee if that ever comes around apple won't do five gee first\nThey won't do any technology first but their theory is but we're going to do it better so you might as well wait\nI Wish apple made an iPhone that was three hundred four hundred dollars as well as all these expensive what's 'cause then I compare it with great happiness recommend just don't even consider any other phone just by accident but honestly they're they're so expensive and packed all of the apple stuff it's so expensive there are better Bluetooth headphones out there\nIn fact I'd love to hear from you which ones do you like a scooter ex Lexus plant products um I think there are better ones that will\nSound better [noise] and and some of them are wireless [noise] let me ...\nYou know like their pots where there's just sitting in your\nFace all the\nEighty eight eighty eight

this winter\nThe latest uh winter weather outlook that uh that was issued by NOAA are paying current agency is calling for temperatures to be above normal for this winter season people to think well that's good well that they got to wait for the other shoe to fall and that means when we have a typically a warmer winter like this that usually means more snow\nAnd then what looks like a the way

but there are few that aren't what is the Iowa to help you can't get\nCalled a stage yet and what does it do\nIt all old ... year old a tablet\n... here by a ...\nThat is exactly the kind of thing that is that it is proprietary that often is only on Iowa as they just going to assume you must have an eye pad because well why wouldn't you have an eye pad right or the ...\nThe monitor ... or ... or ... some of the other ... it to the elbow and go on and uh oh yeah this one\nIs you see all all you can do is is a Yamaha he said it see I'm a ...\nYou know you can do is pastor Yamaha and say you

we looked at making an app\nPodcast network and we actually spend a lot of money on it [noise] uh where the developer or and we wanted to do I owe us an Android and it more than double the cost it's a big deal [noise] usually it's a separate team because people can write fryer with our Android developers or\nSometimes and this is what they were our this company was going to do for us they they use

tell you that much 'cause it's embarrassing\nUh so yeah I'm a ... it's a it's an economic decision and they probably look and see and they say well you know almost everybody who's doing mixing an stages is using an eye patch so you know we're not going to do it for ... there's also the issue of\nThere are a lot of different ... devices if you make it for the pet it's easy because\nYou know we're not going to do it for a hundred there's also the issue of there are a lot of different Android devices if you make it for the eye pad it's easy because you know only apple makes I pet there aren't very many to make it for an Android platform you don't know what you're getting\nThere's also another issue which I think they've licked in the latest versions of Android they've been working on androids based on Linux uses a Linux colonel and Linux has a built in issue with late and see\nThat makes it very hard to use for real time music applications one of the reasons and this is one of the one of the big categories is music\nThat Iowa has a huge lead on Android probably always will\nBecause of this late in the issue and it's for live music applications so it may well be that they don't feel like the Android platform is performing enough for them to even work on\nSo I'm just giving you all the potential\nReasons [laughter] why they may not do it but all you can really do is big um there is no way that I Know up to run Iowa taps on the Android period\nI Know that's what you really want there's no way to do it\nUh that's that's Apple's proprietary platform it's the same reason you can't run Mac OS on a on a windows machine while you can but they call it a hack in touch for a reason\nThere's no hacking touched that I Know that what you run Iowa is on a on any Android device that really requires a apple lock that down to a certain ships that\nThe difference is ... ... on on Macintosh they're using standard PC components in pill chips and so forth that's going to change by the way it's widely agreed that apple is going to move to\nUsing its own chips on Macintosh computers\nChips it designed\nAnd when that happens in the next couple of years I think it will be around twenty twenty you you won't be able to run hacking touches either\nBut they've already got that kind of walking on Iowa so there is no such thing I'm Sorry\nYou're stuck with the getting yourself and

I'm not here but I just I hear you talk about the size\nOf the story is you can't take money there was in a traditional four one K. and put it into a Roth without having a big tax bill\nDoes all that money they don't end was pre tax correct so you go into a traditional i._r._a. without money not a Roth IRA okay and you can over time migrate the money\nFrom the traditional to a Roth as you could afford to pay tax on money each year or you know you got money that they are that's going to grow over the years you're going to have to pay tax on Sunday so let's talk about the other one the seven thousand his ... in a big employers plan or small\n[noise] ah it's a very large employer they're trail the stock exchange so\nIt was a big employer the odds favor that that will be an extremely low cost plan probably lower than you could find in an IRA [noise] okay so\nAre the only exception to that would be if they have that money administered by an insurance company for them the four o one K for by a bank\n[noise] it's it's it's just through one of the three that you mentioned\nYou could just leave at seven behind and move the Eighteen\n[noise] okay and then as far as contributing to that ... and you're able to contribute straight to the IRA versus trying to go through that\n... great question so let's say let's keep it simple I in fact let me let me really think about this who is the company that administers the plan for the big publicly traded company used to work for its vanguard\nSo if you wanted to keep it simple\nUm move both of 'em demand guard\nAnd an IRA and just be done with the old employers for one case 'cause it was with vanguard the costs will be low enough as an individual anyway and then you've got the simplification just having an IRA there and then at vanguard open a raw for any future contributions\nThe twenty five to grow and the vanguard IRA\nAnd then you open a new account with vanguard for raw than any current or future contributions he may go into the raw [noise]\nOkay and then those can be a so just so I'm Sorry I I'm not a hundred percent up to date on all these states that Iraq says post tax correct\nExactly yeah and you're already going to have twenty five grand that center pre tax account you want to have money in a post tax accountant or raw truly great to have a mix of both but tilted more towards the Roth\nThis'll be a way for you to do what you simplify your life you just have an IRA vanguard a Roth IRA vanguard old money and the IRA new money and the Roth IRA and that would be a good way for you to build up money going forward\nChris is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Chris\n[noise] hey Clark thanks for taking my call\nSure you've got a puzzle you want to see if I can find the pieces for\nHis or a wife and I were looking at clean Nineteen health plans are currently we're we're all on a family plan and under my health insurance cover the like many starts search hurting a surcharge for a spouse that's able to get health insurance through their employer\n'em and using round numbers it's roughly fourteen hundred dollars a year so it's like ... and then to myself the premiums would be nine hundred\nVersus including her which would be Eighteen hundred on top of that fourteen hundred dollar surcharge annually\nShe's nine hundred extra month plus an additional fourteen hundred dollar surcharge a year correct so she's ten eight a lemonade twelve twelve thousand something a year\nFor health coverage through your existing employer how much is it for her if she goes on her employer's plan", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Yankton", "day": "27"}
