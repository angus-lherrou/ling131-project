the country might sound impossible to fit into your workload\nBut what I've learned from watching your share of mark ... County Arizona and from watching other law enforcement officers on on shows like pd and others um it is that when you walk up you generally speaking don't want to put somebody in a bind I mean there really is a lot more discretion that I think I ever knew there was\nA but again if somebody's going to get with the program you probably have three or four or five different charges on some cases that you can lay on 'em and but they're also minor enough to know where you could still get them home tonight I mean that you do that it's kinda it's I didn't know that do you hear from other people like me who say you know I had no clue you guys could deal with it that way\nYeah you know a lot of people don't realize that and we do have a lot of discretion and that's why I Try to tell people look\nJust relax you know this is going to go a lot more did a lot differently and and you think if you just stay calm was work through it um and it does give us the ability to use some of that discretion but you're right they said we want it to we get stuck on a ton of charges to go and it really just depends on on where they want to take it\nWell when I got pulled over him and you don't know what kind of cars but when I get pulled over and it's often a hey have my hands attending to I've got the inside light on the window rolled down and I'm thinking of ... who's the man or woman just walking up you know for for certain image immunity sometimes that helps me sometimes it does and I have had a ticket or two in my life\nBut it also helps having a radio and TV show just like to say hello to the officer on the air and that seems to get me somewhere too I'm sure mark lamb or should we talked about this in Washington how close to the ... county are you on the border\nNow we're not on the border we're about Seventy miles off the border and\nWe have an Indian reservation Donald I'm Indian nation that's on the south into our county a very big Indian reservation that actually runs all the way to the border and across the board or well part of a reservation in Mexico\nAnd so it's a very unique situation that's one of the or their community as as a ... been opposed to a wall across their reservation\nWhich split the slick them apart yeah\nYeah and so and that's one of the big reasons that would split their reservation apart and so what happened is that there is only a three strand barbed wire fence across that area and that's\nOne of the top spots where it's easy for these people to come across it's about a six day hikes through the desert um unless somebody a there's a coyote that transports him in a vehicle upright who so about five miles south of the I ... interstate is where the reservation in\nAnd they have that five miles spot where they have to try to get across\nA lot of people will realize on the other side on the reservation\nSays would be responsible for charging training drug possession right now we have a ... five hundred pound threshold of marijuana so you don't have more than five hundred pounds which any individual backpack or only probably as thirty to fifty town right and they know that and so they wait till\nThey'll sit right on the edge of the reservation and when they think it's a good time to make that last five mile push because if they get caught and put our county they're going to get charged with state charges and that's where the agenda\nBut we'll get a week ... would you bordering right on the news on this uh um Indian reservation I'm guessing you have to cooperate with them do they cooperate with you I I Can't imagine they would want four thousand illegal immigrants on the reservation overnight\nYou know they're a good partner um people don't want to end up on the reservation there's no jobs there's not a lot of job opportunities in their ... want to get the Phoenix because some there is a lot easier for them to get all over the country so their goal is not to stay on the reservation I'm although I'm sure some do\nNow their goal is to get up to the I ... interstate so they can transport the humans and the drugs that the cartel that's what I tried to tell people all over this country is it's not about this guy come into wanting to work in this country and roses about or tell controlling human trafficking and drug trafficking in our country\nSo quite literally if I'm if I'm geographically getting it right in my head if they get through the the reservation the first time they step in to the United states would be in your county\nCorrect yes our county now our county goes quite a few piled into the reservation as well right now\nThe big portion of the county of the reservations in our county but where it really starts to affect those bringing the drugs and the human trafficking is that about that five mile mark when they get into to where they can be charged in ... county in the state of Arizona\nSheriff mark lamb he of course ... County Arizona you may or may not have seen them on a ... which I loved it hopefully you guys will be on there and getting sued 'em for me\nWatching the caravan of two to five thousand people none of whom really need political asylum they've actually said we're going to remember what we want we want jobs you or whatever you know you and I are are are you guys we we want people to have a better life I'm Glad that my my grandfather immigrated here from Italy legally\nAh when you see an influx like this and it's also very close to to the election that there's probably a political slant to it you work closely with ice the or close to the chest your closely with the White House who weren't worth of seeing this mass of people who may be heading into your county soon what do you do to prepare for something like that\nYou know I was actually a on a phone call about three weeks ago with a our eyes director because you know we got some center here nice [laughter] out on the phone about three weeks ago the ... the director vice here in Arizona and we were talking about this issue about this this large group of people that was coming\nI like you shenanigans or going on to those too intellect\nAnd I've been in these foreign countries these these small villages to rally this many people something something behind um\nRegardless of that we still have to deal with the problem right even the whatever regardless of how they got here who's behind it they're still coming on our doorstep and we're having to deal with it um and it's a tough situation\nOn like you like you said I Want people to come here I Want you to bake a better life\nBut then again you have to follow the rule that's what we're asking follow the rules that are set for they're not coming for political asylum that they were they were stopped in Mexico right there really coming to get into America and this is a push too dangerous thing about this hoard\nIs as they've gone further and further there's less and less women and children right it's ... ominously man it's predominantly young man\nIt's very easy for gang members and uh people that are that do not have good intentions to get mixed up into this and it makes it really easy and for that matter it's really easy for terrorists to get they tend to this group and that is alarming for US law enforcement here in Arizona\nI talked to ... yesterday she is a ... for America done or degrade national security outlet it and she's just a really smart person she says that they've already found several\nPeople who aren't from ... south or or Central America they're certainly not from Mexico they're finding people who speak Spanish who speak em some other language that you might find in the middle east so there are I'm with you there shouldn't shenanigans going on this is ... somehow to balance the power after\nThe capital hearings and now you've got all go horrible Trump is on on the um on the border and really getting into\nIt was going on this is some ... some how to balance the power after the capital hearings and now you've got all go horrible Trump is on on the um on the board really getting into that with you but but the real boots on the ground and and that's who you're literally are you guys have to deal with the how prepared are you\nIf you get four thousand people all of a sudden the next few days what do you do\nYou know we were very very well with ice a border patrol the different situation than what we're used to deal with because what's happening is these people just want to get in the country do typically what they do they run from they try to hide for border patrol and from us\nRight now they're actually running to border patrol and try to because they know that once during the country\nThey can they're making these political asylum claims and then what do we do with all these people you know this is a cut this problem that should have everybody in this country\nTheir ears should be heard that they should be wondering what are we going to do you agree Tom\nWe're going to continue to protect our community uh we uh we're concerned about the amount of people that are going to flow into this country and there are communities and so watching this very closely but\nYou're from law enforcement guy and I say that you're yes it's a compliment but it's also your job I've got people up in Travis County Texas not far from where I Am a when we're the share of just doesn't care about enforcing the law I'm going to ignore those laws force these laws you seem to be a guy that says no here's the book this is what the laws are going to\nFollow those I'm going to enforce those going to make sure people abide by them and what reaction do you get from people in our county residents there last question mark I appreciate\nThe time about what reaction do you get from them when you say\nIf and when they get here we're going to make sure that we we stick to the laws are in are you a sense of nervousness among the community with all these people had no way\nYou know we're very supportive community because we deal with it so much you know in this county everybody understands majority of the people understand the immigration issue where\nCars running from there almost every night we're dealing with the drugs coming into our community or you've been affected by heroin and by a by standing on by these other drugs that they're trying to get our our American public and are you hooked on so\nHere in Arizona and here in our county to get it for the most part yeah and uh so we get a lot of support and they they expect to be I was voted into this position on those grounds that I was strong on border security and protecting our community so we have a lot of support from our up from the people that\nAre good they certainly very good people and they certainly have a great sure sure mark lamb but al ...

it was fascinating go back if you remember of\nCoast insider and listen for it but coming up next our faces another sort of historical trip I think you're just going to love along the rails of America the men from the train\nDiscovering America's most elusive serial killer\nSo this ... this is this is a great story you'll love hearing about it with Bill James who was a [noise] a writer and not just of um of general interest books like that but also he's a a sports writer or in Boston and he was of course following very closely what happen tonight\nIn Los Angeles we're not competing again he\nExtended the Dodgers ended up playing last night uh it was like a double header rolled up into one single game but but but tonight a little different uh Bo Sox lead the series now three to one the\nDodgers will get another shot at it coming up tomorrow night to send the series back to Boston three to two but\nBetween you know the creator and the creation or and effect\nBetween you know the creator and the creation and in fact in the very first version of our robot before the ... version of a robot um the robot that has created\nIn the very first version of by robot which was in the late Nineteen thirties the sits down and read Frankenstein\nAnd then has a better understanding of life afterwards anyway the experiments that inspired Frankenstein are up at coast to coast am dot com to a great story to read and and also just wanted to from the sun\nAbout eight or a cover up\nThat may have been exposed Google Earth blind spots over the experimental military base maybe where US government hides crashed UFOs that according to a defense insider you'll see more about that about the the total ... test range in Nevada\nUm and what they have recently uncovered but but if they did well then you know they would want to become the new Roswell\nI'm kinda happy with the old role as well and I'm very grateful that we have a chance to talk to who was needed Jennings who joins us on the phone on coast to coast am good evening Juanita\nThat evening so well Anita is the director of public affairs for Roswell\nI'm and she promote trials well as a travel and and you know as a professional opportunity and people move to Roswell all the time but this time of year where you get a lot of tourists to come in for the Halloween festivities so I just wanted to ask you what your plans were for Halloween what do you do if if\nIf Ross was kind of Halloween all year long in a way for some people with the discussion of\nAliens and invading armies and all of that it's if it's if it's a Halloween all year long what do you do special for Halloween\n[noise] um most people go out to grade farm which is a local farm and ranch community just about seven miles out of town where they participate in the corn ...\nAh the grade family ah the coordinates together like the hieroglyphics that\nWere supposedly on the UFO spaceship that landed in Nineteen forty seven or they can get every single year and it just a great opportunity for people that go out and really try to experience you know that ... that feeling of getting off the NFL life you're so ah\nCrashed in Nineteen forty seven other people go out to bottom or break state park ah which again has a mystery at the bottom with and and it is out ten miles from Roswell beautiful a great place to RV camp and things like that but\nAgain I'm more more of the stars and the telescopes and people get dressed up and they feel that they become one or they may come down and uh you know it's just that that theory of there is something here that land it and they're trying to connect with them especially around\nHalloween and during the year after festival in July\nSo I'll be traveling through Roswell I'm moving coming up I'm In a couple of weeks and I'll be driving up through Roswell on my way to\nA new position I'll be teaching it to Kansas State and my my older my younger son and I was always wanted to go to Roswell right so we we we mapped it out from Phoenix even though we have to go a little bit out of our way to dip hunter Roswell before we come back up again\nAnd it seemed totally worth it to us just to be able to see it but how much can people tour when they're out there is anybody we're interested in in being able to\nGo to the crash site\nOr ... or to go to any of the other locations that are linked to the famous story of the crushing Roswell where what can they do\nSo they can go to the rival on international year from him and Research Center which is\nA great opportunity to really dive into their historical and the research a part of the crash I'm definitely with tech out the library for those who are really the speakers and do you believe\nIn addition to that we have a U.S a tour that it's done by a local researcher he's been doing research on the crash and your first for over twenty ... years and he will take\nYou to the exact location of the timing of the incident\nAnd on top of that during the festival not next week but during the festival\nFor the first time last year that broke or families where the crash occurred allegedly they will take it out to the crash site where a ... rent a house is still kind of in in place and you can see where the crater landed in in the land\nAnd so those are just a couple of of things\nThat I Would definitely recommend that people check out and um you know search for the truth and so\nOkay so plenty to use the word allegedly in there which makes me suspect you're not a true believer of what happened you know something we don't know\nI I Do believe there are some people still are kind of on the fence until we invite people to come and find out for themselves\nA we know there's a lot of research there's a lot of a local people here that people can talk to when you go into the museum uh the locals know who the tourists are because\nAt the stature and you will come and walk down our main street and go into areas that wind which is a great story I bring your camera take pictures stop in the rock visitor center we have to amazing alien that we'd decorate our economy especially now for Halloween\n[laughter] and puts on a big festival with our police officers and things like that for the community but on these they're about six\nFoot alien or not people love to take pictures with them and you'll hear the story of you know are employers them on his name is ... and ... and uh you know people really come here searching for the truth\nAnd we as local we we don't want to say one way or the other we want them to figure it out for themselves and and you're very very\nWell that'd be great thank you appreciate the let me let me ask you how many people show up every year in Raj well for the Roswell festival for the for the crash festival that happens in the summer the UFO days\nAnd so our population has doubled in size we're we're a town about forty thousand and especially on the big anniversary of the festival um you know we've hit close to doubling our size on average per\nYear for tourism we hear a little over two hundred and thirty thousand visitors back on the UFO museum and Research Center\nTiny good pretty good and pretty close to what they get in Salem, Massachusetts or and so I'll I'll bring in our next guest next protect you Anita and if I'm if I'm driving through town and get a chance they'll say hello okay\nYes please their thank you honey to Jennings\nYou ... and if I'm if I'm driving through time we get a chance they'll say hello okay yeah cream hair care honey to\nJennings is the uh the the the director of tourism public affairs in uh Roswell\nNew Mexico a season with the which GW Oscar the subtitle is the magic and mayhem of Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts a Gemini let me just tell you who very funny book you resist great sense of humor I really enjoy all the sort of a comic inside\nOn a serious subject because and we'll get to the second this is this is a very unusual place in America but it has an even more extraordinary place in the timeline\nOf American history but I thought it was interesting you mentioned that in Salem, Massachusetts they do about a quarter of million people that come to visit during the month of October is that about right\nAbout right there are about forty thousand usually I'm On Halloween just how I mean so it's about a hundred thousand people come um and of course the month and a quarter million so the massive amount of people that small city to have within the borders\n[noise] well I Love this idea so this is one of my favorite kind of bugs it's a deep drill down on like a well I mean it's on a narrow subject but you picked\nHalloween in same as the subject so it sort of you use that as a as a sort of a lens on all of what happened in and the implications of the uh the Salem witch trials um but it's it's really important I mean we just get a guest a couple of weeks ago\nAbout ... on the popular opinion on how historians have been shifting their views\nOn Salem and I you know I learned a lot then too but we'll learn a little bit more tonight for example I didn't realize that a ... ... ... there are other places around the world outside of Salem\nThat had mass is\nHanging and burnings of of which is before Salem, Massachusetts did\n[noise] I always try to tell people that are more than the first hour which trial wasn't the last ... and all the trial wasn't the biggest one of the strangest for the you know there are [noise] you know the first trial in America the victim was in Connecticut and in Europe they're reaching like thousands of victims of injuries\nBut we don't really hear about that which is really I mean I Know that there there are some festivals in Europe that they keep it alive but still that's an extraordinary number of which is killed\nThe honestly it's really a problem today even in in um developed country there's still we're being people being executed for being with us but the the strange thing about that to me of course all of the planet that have had this problem which is pretty much every day on the planet there's only one which city and that Salem, Massachusetts [noise]\nIt's just incredible to me why the editor in two months later something amazing which don't taste while I was actually a contract staggering it it's one thing that you can check\nOn top of the kind of sweet ... results coming target market kinda barbaric ... well I think that works beautifully\nOwner Richard astro here we're talking about the power of waking up your immune system which has hail this gentleman's hot perhaps the immune system can be called one of the bodies fears this powers to he'll visit C.\nA. R. N. I. V. O. R. A. dot com or call\nOne eight six six eight three six eight seven three five that's one eight six six eight three six eight seven three five\n\n\nThe J W ... author of a season with the which I just had to look at some of those steps that we had mentioned\nMore vaguely two thousand eleven bar do Norway erected a memorial to the Ninety One victims of seventeenth century witch hunt linkage shirt England a long ago turned its tend to which is incident in which ten people were hanged in sixteen twelve and toured tourist draw\nIn Sweden there's a witch memorial for more than Seventy victims who were be headed in burned in sixteen Seventy five in Germany a staggering four hundred and fifty victims in the late Fifteen hundred generally sixteen hundreds in Spain a whole museum dedicated to the witch trials in which some seven thousand\nHundreds of nearly sixteen hundreds in Spain a whole museum dedicated to the witch trials in which some seven thousand people were accused and that's just some of them and not even all that happened\nIn America but at Salem that sticks out and so why why do do you conclude Salem, Massachusetts has become so synonymous with the craft\n[noise] it's it's really a mystery honestly even that's one of the big question that go with the book and I think it's a combination of probably two dozen different factors honestly that gets Salem has which city one of which of course is that where you know it's in the United states of America and the U.S kind of invented marketing [noise] oh\nYeah that's a big part of it but I mean\nI'm not a big part of it that's a small part of it but there's about a dozen other reasons why kind of Salem grabbed onto that monitor and kind of held onto it over the course of about two centuries\nOf it you know you it's a moniker of shame ... right I mean it's not that not usually what it sounds holds onto you know that even you know it's we just talked to somebody from Russia as well and and that that was an incident that was that happened there\nBut ... and they they take advantage of it for you know tourism purposes and for whatever other reason they want but it's like usually for you to you don't hear about Chicago's celebrating the fact that it was the home\nOf that crazy serial killer treat the famous worlds exposition right you don't know did he do go on their way to put up signs and go it happened here folks\n[laughter] right that's true and I think to to fight for that one is that you know the tragedy in Salem itself\nWas basically just to the court happened in Salem right it was the ... part of the trials actual family members and you know the people who really bear that shame over the course of generations around Salem the actual the actual hysteria started next door and what's now Denver's was at the time to film village\nFor sale itself doesn't really have a kind of kind of a generational connection to it it was justified of the proceedings [noise] um\nAnd then on top of that today which city means way more than just the victim of a witch trials I mean the actual which is that live there today it means the cartoon which that's kind of represents Halloween since ... sounds kind of become Halloween town as well\nSo it's a determined which has a lot of different definitions for Salem today in twenty eight team\nYeah I guess this is important and I this is this great distinction can't help but feel do and sometimes I Can't get away from just remembering that this this really is about innocent victims of\nMurder they were executed and they protested their innocence until the end and there's a whole industry tend to build up around them now\n[noise] yeah not a big dealing with that responsibly as something that Salem is kind of ruffled with for you know probably two centuries and a lot in the past few decades especially figuring out how to balance you know the actual tragedy that's kind of underneath underneath there for more so to speak then part of it that's left connected to the tragedy with more just around\nYou know a city identity and all these other kind of thing just become and and twenty a team\nWell go back to many central question than from last half hour which is then how do they celebrate Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts\nWow with with absolute and ammonium [laughter] he is so they they don't celebrate Halloween day I mean they celebrate a\nSeason basically for that they thought it was called haunted happenings which technically starts October first and October thirty first [noise] um but really the blood over into longer than that\nSo if you want to experience Salem don't go in October don't go in late October go in September early October or any other time of the year during a visit sounding Halloween you're just going to get pandemonium crowd there's a lot of fun but it's definitely a different type of experience from the city of Salem itself\nIt's Mardi Gras basically it is\nIt really is um I talk again a hundred thousand people packed to the small downtime with the city for failing to the city but doesn't have high rises it's not like you know massive it's a small city and it's everything happens within you know five or six blocks\nAnd you have a hundred thousand people there to party to wear costumes a freak each other out to you know go to go to bars watch the fireworks all kinds of stuff so you're you're definitely there for you know again Mardi Gras the good analogy because you're not really experiencing New Orleans\nMardi Gras you're experiencing Mardi Gras during Mardi Gras\n[noise] um but it did and I imagine for a lot of times in October it's cold is which is to in ... in in there so you're probably not going to get the same festivities did you get an Mardi Gras anyway but there's probably some amount of alcohol than consumed during this celebration\nOut definitely actually right now or in the middle of a nor'easter so that cuts down right now for Halloween weekend last weekend before Halloween [noise] booze is part of it but this is within the party\n[laughter] okay so you mentioned haunted happenings but I mean is Salem known for\nBeing hunted either Salem witch ... are there were a lot of haunted houses were where there are there still visitations from the victims of the original Salem trial [noise]\nOh yeah there's all kinds of mythology around that it's it's really hard not to have that mythology like if you didn't want it it'd be hard to fight it off because you have again everything you need for what the classic haunting right you're innocent victims\nYou have monsters 'cause of the film which trial then just evolved which is in the story involves demons and em since shape sisters and goes everything we're in the trials for the big monster mash all those kind of elements and then you have a city that has feel four hundred years of history or up three hundred and Thirty years of history\nSo that is just you know a lot of people\nOver the centuries [laughter] so yeah there's there's all that kinda stuff happening and say I'm I'm a ghost tours their spooky places there's the other five executions you everything you need to build the kind of spooky mythology around the city\nNow you've been there most of these I should say you've been there right you go there so oh yeah all the time all the time they're two weekends ago\n[noise] so what have you ever gone and seen anything that was paranormal related that seemed to be still situated didn't and in some dimension around Salem\n[laughter] you know I haven't but that's my fault so I I built a career kind of a visiting strange places spending the night of the band that asylum and murders and all kinds of things and I've never had an experience\nSo my interest in that as more of the stories themselves you know until the day I have an experience my interest is more than the stories of it in Salem is chock full of like this really great spooky you know go the stories are on that but no I haven't had anything cool happened to me\nYeah what's the what's the best what's the best spooky story that post Salem witch trials that you've captured while you've been there\n[noise] um well what are the ones that really creepy ones is one of the Boston trade with victims happened in Salem so it has that kind of connection to like a real you know real actual historical event that then I can reverberate and have come without around that\nHoudini also visited Salem and like escape from the jail they're so all these kind of spiritual is kind of and you know macabre kind of\nEvents happened in Salem that nothing to do with the witch trials it's all that kind of some kind of feed into that kind of ...\nKind of events happened in Salem that nothing to do with the witch trial it's all that kinda stuff kind of feed into that kind of cauldron of a a mythology around Salem\nYeah but Houdini was a bunker right he was somebody there to celebrate and he was there somebody to to to mock these people that we're creating these images so I'm curious do wizard attempt to for him to do like ... or something while he was there\n[noise] no no it was a ... actually still stands it's a it's a condominium our apartment complex now but it used to be the original jail there there was a police station and he was just there doing one of those things that used to do when he was in towns are performing who go to a local police station or somewhere and perform a quick active you know Cape\nPR move for his field next big event so I wasn't down there doing more of a say on busing but if you're doing is a is a scape escape routine\nLike so you you you mentioned that there are still which is in Salem how did they get along with this idea of the the ... celebrating kind to the victim who did these innocent people who denied that they were which is where do they how do they play into all of this\nBecause I'm exchanging a day of my life for it\nWhen tomorrow comes\nThis thing will be gone forever leaving something and its players\nMake God gave me this they\nAlso give me the wisdom to know how to live and\nAdd good to add ...\nWhich he also gave me\nThe wells and this\n\nAny of them I tell you become America's selling brand it's seven o'clock\n\nThe content of this program does not represent their views or opinion so five Seventy W.

number to call is one eight hundred\nFor six seven zero to nine eight now give that to you again it's one eight hundred\nFor six seven zero to nine eight [noise]\nSo how 'bout that folks me what it really comes down to here is we're not getting the right form or enough\nVitamin D delivered the right way which is why we have so many of these health concerns that you probably can't put your finger on and Dr biggest I Want to start just recapping here that there are a couple of different forms of vitamin D it made me explain\nWhy the typical form that you would find in most off the shelf the formula is different from what you put together here\nWhile there's vitamin D to vitamin D three and the two is the title of vitamin D that has to be activated by your body so to be converted into vitamin D three vitamin these three is the activated\nForm so it's ready to go to work now vitamin D three that I use my formula I think it's the best because I've seen the best results\nWith myself and my family with my patients\nI've worked with a lab where the people in the lab of taking this and they they test their blood every day to see how the deal is going to end up going up and out through the roof or should be\nWild so Dr biggest who should consider taking your fast melts vitamin D formula\nWhile I Would definitely start with kids for development and the unity obviously young adults in their twenties need vitamin D to keep their immune system strong men and women in their thirties you're talking about higher health immunity\nCardiovascular problems start to turn on but it's also the child rearing years and\nVitamin D for pregnant women is very very important people in their forties soil you can you start taking more of those aches and pains like you've never felt before you think you're getting older and again it's important for your hormones and to keep yourself physically active\nWhen you're in your fifties you start telling her you can't golfing can't play tennis you know you start becoming aware of your body not functioning ...\nAnd then people over ... the I just wish that every senior citizen would go on the\nFormula imagine living in your senior years where you have confidence in your balance and you're you're able to have the energy to get things done ... clarity you know this is more and more important as we go along because people are living longer but the quality of life is not great\nYou know is it ever too late Dr bank is such that your fast melt do three formula wouldn't be a worthwhile investment\nIf you can see the breath of the mirror in the morning then you know that you're a candidate for this because a lot of the things that people from their suffering from a lack of the vitamin in their body so it's never too late to

so much and has through the centuries we talked to a horror specialist and a psychologist\nAbout the topic and looked into the story of Halloween to find some answers Ben Armstrong is co owner of another world haunted house in Atlanta and president of America haunts an organization of the top haunted attractions in the U.S\nHe says there is some debate over the holidays true origin is it from a Celtic festival a Roman feast Christianity he says no matter who started it\nHalloween a lot in common with each culture\nIs of course it's Harvard celebration\nAt the time of the year we're nights become longer work starts getting a little colder in the classical mythological death and reverse cycle period where we enter into against winter so it's a start if you will\nSo it's both a celebration of the harvest but it's also a time when the fan and people think about the dark and I think about ghost tonight about ancestors\nThere was always sort of in that tradition tradition of Harvard tried with you know the celebration of harvest tried with darker part of the year that I'm going to get a little colder\nCold days and early nights lend themselves to the feeling of impending doom men death and all things creepy and scary even carving the pumpkin has its origins in a dark and unsavory character\nThe pumpkin imagery is tied to the concept of the Jack o' lantern and there was a character named Jack was so or even the devil didn't want him so he fed him loose to roam the earth with burning ember and it was actually in it turn up even after room you're with is running number to turn it\nAnd then when the Irish immigrants came over to America they found a much better thing but it's kinda hard to turn it around the bunk and that became the Jack o' lantern it kept the name of jak traditional character the story\nOf course black cat images are everywhere on Halloween and that's because they were thought to be the familiar of witches and very unlucky to come across Armstrong says that the holiday has traveled from Ireland to America and now back to Europe where children and adults both take part\nIn the u._k. where a guy Fox day in November with a big fall celebration Halloween attraction to become very popular\nI was over in England a few months ago at a very large divide there called ... hours and I discovered that they have a huge Halloween celebration I mean the same parks have embraced Halloween like no one's business I mean it's actually the second largest money making holiday after Christmas but we have\nAnd the other thing that happened with Halloween is that it was a tooth all day but it's sort of kind of grown into\nOn adults and young adults holiday it's now a lot of the traditions that were formally trick or treating you know twenty Thirty years ago now there's a big focus on Halloween parties to focus on going to haunted attraction\nUnlike family holiday times like Thanksgiving and Christmas Armstrong says that Halloween has become more of a party time like New Year's eve\nAnd with the Halloween party come the bass the makeup and the costume we asked Dr Janine a scarlet about that aspect of the holiday Scarlett is a clinical psychologist scientist and self proclaimed fulltime geek\nShe's also a practitioner of superhero therapy and it's coming out with a book by that title next July she says that costumes allow us to hide our true selves for awhile and become someone who's attributes we might admire\nThere's something really exciting about dressing are about pretending to be someone who are not where usually going throughout our day completely may be inhibited are confined by our environment or social rules but when we put on a cocktail maybe we can pretend to be someone differently can almost\nTry on a different lifestyle for a second and at that moment maybe we don't have a beer and have it may be can be very exciting to do that\nFor that reason many people actually really enjoy drafting are a different characters sometimes even ... completely opposite characters up their true personality\nScarlet says that the character you choose me say something about your personality that

suddenly seem dangerous to breathe at all a third of the world's population about five hundred million people came down with the so called Spanish flu that winter then according to the Centers for Disease Control and prevention at least fifty\nMillion people were killed [noise]\nThe United states got off comparatively easy but still nearly seven hundred thousand Americans died the flu that here it's a reminder why public health experts fear the flu and say that the rest of us should give it a little more respect\nTamil yeah already breeds indifference at the very least and people just talk about the flu very casually and kind of throw it off\nAnd That's Dr William Schaffner professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University school of medicine\nLast year was really an ... year we had a terribly bad virus\nWe have a growing older population in the United states and that's the population that the virus has its greatest effect upon in terms of producing complications in hospitalizations and deaths\nAnd even today I think the average person acknowledges flu but doesn't consider it that seriously\nDefinitely is a big deal and I talked to a lot of patients and families that say the same exact thing you said a lot of flu is not a big deal I've had the fruit before the flu oh isn't it like the cold and\nI tell them that well the flu is a little more serious it's more serious illness and get the common cold\nDr gene more John ... is a pediatric hospital is that Arnold Palmer children's hospital in Orlando, Florida\nOn with the flu is that there are people that can have flu related complications and these are people that have\nMultiple medical problems there are perfectly healthy people that can have really bad complications such an unknown yeah which is a long in Pakistan from this little\nLess flu season about eighty thousand people in the United states died of the flu and ditch complications that's twice the number that died in car crashes and while some groups are at high risk even the young healthy um strong can be laid low for a week or so or even worse\nYoung children are at high risk of complication\nStrong can be laid low for a week or so or even worse\nVery young children are at high risk of complications\nWomen who are pregnant far at high risk of complications their rates of complications when they get flu approximate that of seniors [noise]\nLast year in particular young adults adults younger than age sixty five for all so seriously affected and then of course there's the traditional older group\nBut even if you are a twenty two year old Olympic athlete every once in awhile food takes eight perfectly healthy person\nAnd puts them into the emergency room and the intensive care unit within twenty four or forty eight hours of the onset of their illness that's how severe flu can be and we cannot pick you out in advance\nThis flu season hasn't really gotten rolling yet but already flu deaths have occurred\nSo once again public health experts are pushing to get as many of us as possible anyone over six months of age to be vaccinated for the flu were doing better than we used to but Schaffner says we still have a long way to go\nWe produce about a hundred and fifty two hundred and sixty million doses of vaccine each year or so in the forties is the percentage\nOf bull Americans who are vaccinated tire and some subgroups and lower and others\nWe would like coal three hundred and thirty a million people in America to be vaccinated the manufacturers say they don't produce as much vaccine as we can put in arms or blow up noses\nSo it's just a matter of\nGetting ourselves organized and getting the word out and having it except to\nHaving it accepted is still a major problem according to a nationwide survey by Orlando Health Arnold Palmer hospital for children the survey shows that more than a half of parents of kids under Eighteen but leave that their child can get the flu from the flu shot itself so it was the results are stunning to the experts\nI'm sitting here jobs back to I had no idea that the proportion were so high [laughter] get some is\nIncorrect but some mistaken belief you cannot get flu from the flu vaccine\nThe vaccine is made up of pieces of the flu virus\nCan't reconstitute itself and keeps you influenza that's the injectable vaccine the nasal spray vaccine isn't an altered virus that cannot get down in your chest and give you influenza\nThere's no way you can get the flu from the flu vaccine to get a bit of a sore arm just as I always do and a few people get a degree of fever that can last a day or so but that's not flu that's just your body responding to the vaccine you cannot get flu from the flu vaccine\nWhen we make that flu shot that parts of the virus\nAre you in your late response from our body\nParts of the virus aren't completely dead\nDead not alive there is no way that you're going to get infected with the flu from the flu shot itself\nOther parents are scared away from getting flu shots for their kids due to the long discredited claim that vaccines cause autism and yet others say the flu shot doesn't make much difference and they hear experts saying the vaccine maybe about twenty percent effective this year but what does that mean\nIt means to that and this is usually focused on the dominance strain of the virus for example last year it was thought to be over all in this\nCountry somewhere between twenty five and forty percent effective depending upon which study you look at\nIn preventing illness completely\nIn the entire range of populations\nBut it works better and young people than older people it works better in healthier people then people who are immuno compromised and then of course as I said that number doesn't count the secondary prevention you get the prevention against all those complications\nSo for what we ask the vaccine to do Schaffner says it does a pretty good job as long as we recognize its limitations and don't expect it to be perfect\nIs triggered by the infection or immune system\nIt turns out that said we only know about it because I'm not saying that you throw them all of us to stop Twenty years old now that discovery of this incredibly powerful population themselves very small number\nBut when that go on that go on and then you find it very difficult to maintain wakefulness and also he kept purposely put live which is sort of our and a half\nA very sleepy state condition during the day and then they might have classic and some there at night time\nAbout two hundred thousand Americans have narcolepsy and sixty Seventy percent of them have cat Black Sea as well Nicholas ... more than half of them are undiagnosed but those who are most would probably have welcomed getting a diagnosis as quickly as nickels dead after only a year and a half\nThe late ... symptoms and the diagnosis of symptoms ... about ten years on average\nAnd some people are waiting twenty two years that I that I probably that the patient themselves as not pushing maybe they don't have the ... say they have no ... maybe it doesn't impact that live in the way that it does for others say some people have to say\nBut they have not seen that can be much harder to diagnose because\nThe taxes so clear and so strange that it ... off you know if you have ... I have a lot of things in this paralyzing way is very alarming that they sit in the beginning and you're going to go to the does\nOne reason it takes so long to get a diagnosis is that most doctors don't know a lot about sleep disorders one recent survey shows that only a tenth that primary care physician feel very comfortable diagnosing narcolepsy\nBut Nichols says it's better than it was Fifteen or Twenty years ago when doctors in training received only minutes have training on sleep\nSleep lowdown and medical priorities is just to see him to sleep effectively and what do you mean you know sleeping well thought out where they actually there are real\nRocket science but brain focus raise the price for the things that can really go wrong with the brain and then you can't fake ... so there's a bunch of really late to sodas that treats but still not recognized\nToo often I'm afraid because ... says that they said that primary care\nPoint I'm not looking particularly for sleep disorder\nBut you know doctors know that many cases have narcolepsy are caused by a brain lesion resulting in a lack of a specific neurotransmitter there's no treatment to replace that brain chemical that at least not yet in fact Nicole says in some ways treatments still looks a lot like it did eighty years ago\nVery strong stimulants in some cases yes if you exactly the same drug that was being given the Nineteen thirties the outfit go stand that currently typical sodium ... which is a very very strong sedatives love the get go he sleeps too much and what do you treat them with absolutely no ... sedative\nNichols is also concerned about the increase in other sleep disorders which he says are at least in part the result of too much artificial light the body hasn't involved to stay up at night the way we do now\nYou can find out more about all our gas through links on our website radio health journal dot net\nOur studio producer is Jason ...

things about that show if you ever get a chance to attend a logging show is most of them they have a demo area so\nDuring the two days of the show they actually had to areas where they were cutting timber and they had some deep barkers and some some booms and some trucks and they were loading tampering cutting timber and portable saw mills and mobile sawmills and so everybody they're looking at what type of equipment they can afford\nTo run more efficiently and pull more temper and get more loads to saw mill\nAnd there's an irony in it because these guys are walking\nThrough the vendor area and they're walking right past our booth going out and looking at quip meant\nThat's a hundred two hundred three hundred four hundred thousand dollars because they want to be able to pull more timber and the reality of it is in my experience has been in this\nBusiness is that they could take the equipment they have now and they they just improve their lubrication practices and reduce their downtime they could run more efficiently and I think a lot of it has to do with some you and I may have touched on this before I Know Joe from Walker enterprises have\nEither to something he and I have discussed for years now is one of the things that consistently comes up as Greece has always been viewed as a considerable to pump it into a piece of equipment\nBeer quitting that runs in a few hours later you're gonna have to go out and bought more Greece add to it so it's very difficult for people I think to mentally evaluate that and truly justify putting more money into it\nSo we can go in and we can talk to people and we can sit down and we\nThat and truly justify putting more money into it so we can go in and we can talk to people all we can sit down and we can say look at these numbers I look at the figures and what we're going to do is we're going to reduce aware\nAnd your equipment is going to run more efficiently you're going to get better performance it's going to run to the equipment is going to last longer\nBut at the end of the day is still asking someone to invest forty fifty sixty percent more and something that they're going to pop into a piece of equipment they're never going to see it again but there's been some interesting articles and machinery lubrication and in a number of other publications on line ...\nOver the last Fifteen Years that have talked about how specialty lubricants like what we manufacture has really shifted people's mindset from looking at Greece and other oils and other lubricants as consumable and looking at them more as a commodity right so you're buying something\nThat you should expect a return on do you do that with the Clinton that you do that with\nYou know a number of aspect you do that with employees you know when you hire an employee and Ukraine an employee you pay an employee to give you a return on investment liver that should be looked at the exact same way there's absolutely no reason that you should look at the same way\nBecause of how many areas that impacts in your operations\nSo when you agree that quip meant how well your equipment is protected how long your parts are going to last how soon you'll need to replace them how much downtime is involved for replacing them water the parts going to cost at the time they need to be replaced you know it's never going to be at a good time to how much time you spend\nMaintaining that equipment that goes back to the consumption aspect we discussed earlier is it by making bad investment banking that additional investment like you would with a

T. M. I. into your computer the wire cast software captures the video and then has to compress it\nAnd turn it into a format that the site will accept whether it's YouTube or Facebook or I mean they go on and on their many many companies we do this with a variety of different companies [noise]\nSo you need to have it in a format that they will say oh yeah that's fine that works with our live stream and then they'll accept it so the the software is capturing it converting it and uploading it all and\n... get some cash and footage to final cut pro kind of or\nTo up to their the difference is done in live in real time right some live [noise]\nThe only one that's available to ...\nOh no there's ...\nThere's a there's a very popular area but first thing I Would suggest you do is figure out where you were on the Internet you want this to appear\nBefore a temple service so I imagine probably Facebook\nFacebook's a good start everybody has to have a Facebook account YouTube is maybe a little bit more accessible 'cause you don't need to count to view it as long as you can get online you can view it YouTube Live\nUm [noise] you know I I\nYou know I'd recommend in the past this might be an interesting way to do it it is there a budget or you're just getting the job because you have cameras\nUh well yeah that's inquired they asked me and then I said well I really don't\nKnow what I mean look into it to ... yeah smart\nMan so I've used a thing called them and I mentioned this on our last show somebody was asking some like Russia\nA chemical ...
