San Juan Puerto Rico constantly mocked President Trump for how he handled the fallout from Hurricane Maria but he said it was their officials unfold I'll tell you who ended up being right about that President Trump is pushed America to a record breaking economy but the less says it\nAll Obama one expert is going to tell us the real story on that and the Supreme Court has chosen which cases they want to hear and win but some people want to force a hearing on DACA that's the deferred action for childhood arrivals\nThat was the executive order that was illegally adopted under President Obama but it's still effectively enforce because the courts say\nBecause Obama signed his name to a piece of paper we have to take it seriously and I tend to differ with the courts on that and take 'em over to cast a vote and my Twitter pull you'll find it at Lars Larson dot com and at Lars Larson show on Twitter should all high schools require a class on how you deal with the police\nTexas is doing it they've put into law a requirement that says any student entering the ninth grade this year this academic year or thereafter has to take part in a class and watch a video on how to interact properly with officers during traffic stops\nIs kind of amazing that we've reached that point in America where parents some parents apparently are doing such a poor job of preparing their sons and daughters for life\nThat you don't know how to interact with a cop without getting hurt without getting shot without being arrested without resisting arrest without running away and committing yet another crime\nI think I'd I'd like to see some of those parents talk to\nWhen you have a kid that you have not prepared for that part of life\nI'd like to see I mean there have to be kids who have gone through their entire teenage years and never got pulled over by a cop I Know it's rare but there have to be some kids out there who were so well behaved that a police officer never had reason to pull them over\nAnd as I said I I think that there probably are police officers out there are very very small number of them\nBut we are all after all where police to buy a agencies that are staffed with human beings we understand that those human beings are fallible and we hope the department's go out and try to correct the behavior\nOf officers who get out of line anyway our Twitter poll is Lars Larson show on Twitter out Lars Larson dot com on the Web it's brought you buy a Mac the association of mature American citizens conservative values that's what I max about\nA ... word peak oil we're going to be running out of oil so we have to get away from oil just as fast as we possibly can and then of course we've seen the energy revolution over about the last decade or so in which America is gone from a big importer in heavily dependent on foreign\nSources of oil to not only self sufficient but literally enough energy and oil and natural gas that we can literally export a lot of it\nAnd then we have abundance supply\nAnd we don't have to be beholden to foreign shakes or Venezuela or nasty people like that so but we still have politicians who are trying to push us out from a way away from oil um build the bonds the mayor of New York is calling on cities to give up their investments in the oil industry\nAnd I thought I talked to Dan kiss you about that who is senior vice president at the policy and foreign policy at the Institute for energy research then welcome back\nEven Lars\nSo what do you what is your first blush impression of Mayor Bill de Blasio apparently deciding that his mandate as mayor is not just run the biggest city in the country but also to talk all the other cities out of investing a dime in oil\n[noise] he uh well it seems to be a common thread among politicians who are are vying for higher office um it it it sounds good to a certain number of people out there and that\nIts virtues signaling the what it really is doing is ultimately handing off\nEnormous law says that they would otherwise not have a in those pension funds and a ... to the tune for example in New York state of a ... one point two to one point five trillion dollars over fifty years that has to be made up by somebody [noise] uh in order to\nPay people's pensions and you know that's going to be ultimately the taxpayers\nWell and and so if I understand correctly he would like all the big cities who have massive pension funds that have to earn money until the\nPeople who are going to get the pensions get paid and that when they were to back out of oil stocks I assume they'd put the money into some other kind of dogs\nAnd the oil shocks it'd be sold to willing buyers would happily buy them so it won't make any difference to the oil companies\nWill still have plenty of people who can buy them but New York will have given a given up on the returns they would have had from the ... you know ... the business of fossil fuels which is still a business that are very much supplies the energy for America so what's what's his thinking I mean do you have any idea what why he wants to do this\nWell it's all part of trying to show that year virtuous and care about climate change slurs this is all about climate change a as all energy issues tend to be now um [noise] and what they're\nWhat they're trying to say is that by taking that money out of a those\nReturns are those cells they'll simply be taking money away from these companies and they won't have the money and therefore they want drill wells or something um you know that to be nonsense because the fact of the matter is when you compare\nPortfolios with the energy stocks of all kinds in them versus ones without a the energy\nThe sun's perform better and have perform better uh over fifty years so [noise] ... basically what you're [laughter] you're cutting off your nose to spite their face ill in some respects\nI mean aren't because the only way for a city to pull money out we talk about it like it's pulling out a drawer but the only way to pull out of a stock is to sell it to somebody else so you'll have willing buyers who will buy those dogs\nWell when the willing buyers by them the oil company has an out anything they still have investors who own their stocks in fact I guess they could give the city of New York wants to have a fire sale and sell their their all their socks and did they announce they're going to do this I assume some of the buyers are going to say great they're going to give us as we deal\nThey'll end up they may have the I guess they could even take stock they bought\nFor a given an amount of money and ended up selling it to people for less money than they paid for it that's potentially possible but the ... the stock will still be owned by somebody but as you say their stock portfolio they can't replace that Zach with us stock that performs as well as the oil stock does\nSo they'll have to take a loss or their pension fund recipients the police officers and the other civil service workers of New York\nAre they aware of what the city is about to do to them\nWell luckily they have some on in in New York state or the controller who who is in charge of these and he has something called a ... area responsibility which ah anyone who manages money\nTends to have and you're supposed to watch out for those interests to make sure that you don't make bad investments that\nTake away from the value of those people who own shares in it and those are the firemen and the police but and civil servants of all kind and um and he's object strenuously to this for the very reasons you and I are discussing because he knows the\nThe record and can show that and can show an enormous loss to the city and the state because it's just a ... it's also Governor Cuomo well\nCan they even legally divest themselves of the stocks of the controller says no this would cause a loss can he prevent them from doing it\nVaries from state to state and it gets a little dicey because you're dealing with these public funds which don't have the say and some of the same requirements are obviously because so many of them are underfunded\nFloors I mean we're all the time about the states that have massive pension obligations that can't afford them Illinois and New York California [noise] um and\nAnd so there's a little more leeway in that situation but for the person in charge are they still attempt to live up to the fiduciary responsibility so uh it's not as ironclad is if you were dealing with a a U.S turned bank or something like that [noise]\nWell it would be interesting to see what they do because I I just I I think it's highly irresponsible for them to do this and the other thing is New York city itself can't run without fossil fuels candidate they can't run on diesel gasoline and natural gas\nOr no it would have a very very hard time and the northeast is getting increasingly\nBad shape as a consequence of bad decisions to New Orleans pipelines rebuilt and that sort of thing so we'll see what the winner holds but ah last winter they barely escaped it and uh it's it's probably gotten worse [noise] uh and if we get a cold winter will\nWill be able to see ... laboratories of democracy Lars\nKnow it'd be interesting uh I I Know it's it's just fantasy but can you imagine if the big oil companies are said to New York city you want to do that fine you want to get out of funds who feels fine we will stop delivery\nOf fossil fuels to all your filling stations you know we won't cut off the you know the oil heat that some people still depend on but we are going to stop supply gasoline\nSo all you're filling stations you know we won't cut off the you know the oil sheet that some people still depend on but we are going to stop supplying gasoline\nWill do it for a week to see how you like being without gasoline and be entirely out of oil can you imagine I mean as much as Manhattan runs on mass transit they also run on over and cabs and diesel powered buses and the like\nCan you imagine this and you can you imagine where they'd be\nShipped fossil fueled a liquid fuel delivery stopped to say filling stations and the and the local airports\nThat would be one of those what it is always tell us that it's a couple\nOr something like that teachable moment teachable moment and just say you want to try it I'll tell you what\nWill just slow it down and we'll cut our deliveries to half\nAnd and the New Yorkers who ... who didn't get a chance to see the gasoline station lines of the night or early Nineteen seventies could sit in line for an hour or two wedding for gasoline I Know they blame the oil companies\nNow if you work on a farm you know very early in life and that that we need to get young the looks that me give you another example we've got something like twenty million people in college today right like they'd be working while they're in school\nBegan while you're Twenty one twenty two year work when I was kind of natural April we wouldn't have a\n... you know that that student debt crisis if these kids work while they were in school to pay for their education that was that show on reasonable\nNo and in specially Steve I remembered not only I work all the way through the year and a half or in school but I did and then I took part time class after that\nBut I knew people who in the summertime said they'd go and do the hard dirty jobs in the summertime and they'd rank up three or four thousand dollars in the summertime because they live at home with mom and dad works some dirty job make a bunch of money put it in the bank\nAnd they'd have half ... half their tuition paid by the time they got back to school and they didn't have to borrow it\nSent by the way it allows those kinda people 'cause I remember when I was in college my junior year I live with four guys in the house to model and financial aid and the other two were working\nWhich today think get a better uh you know get more out of their education you know it and see if I had to work and they actually or after that so they actually knew the value of the education if you give something away to people for free they're not going to tell you it right I mean so I think\nThat would be an area we can get a lot more workers we need to get the skills for the workers but you know what they the employers will give these workers the skills\nThey will train them out of the job they will train them how to use a forklift or how to drive a truck or you know be a welder or you know all this that by the way in Texas now you know it's truck drivers are earning twenty thousand dollars oh\nLet me tell you I ran into a couple of guys who'd come to a station event the listener event and I was younger guy and they just were friends and I said uh what do you do to the older guy and he said I run an electrical contracting business I said you know I tried to talk my step son into that\nI said I I Know they were both union and non union training programs where they would hire you\nAnd the ... two years ago was fourteen fifty an hour so it was like twenty nine thousand a year and every six months if you stayed in a program where you went to a class four hours a night for one night a week so it wasn't you know it was an asking you to go sixteen hours a day all week long\nThat at the end the tuition for was eighty bucks a month and it was unofficially state approved process where you at the end of four years you had eight thousand on the job training hours working at us\nAnd then and then you have six or seven hundred hours in a classroom and every if you stayed in the program you started and fourteen fifty every six months your paycheck went up by a buck fifty an hour three thousand bucks a year now and by the time you've finished you were thirty five dollars an hour Seventy grand a year\nThat you're a good salary while I said to this guy said so that's where you're hiring your journey man he says large we can't get journeyman for thirty five bucks an hour he said we're paying forty two dollars an hour Steve that's Ninety thousand dollars a year to start as a journeyman electrician\nAnd you know what this the same of that story is meanwhile we spend two hundred thousand dollars and you know cost to the taxpayer to\nPut these kids through college and a half of them are walking out with a sociology degree or ethnic studies degree or political science degree and guess what there is not jobs for a political science degree or sociology degree you got to be able to do something you know and this was a failure education system liars we're not preparing\nYou know these kids are the twenty first century for the twenty first century cats when I was in high school I don't know if you had this we had shop class\nWe do know that we did have had any marketing you know what they have their touchy feely classes now\nA class so we did we did look at it you know what they have to feel it clashes doll cases just dumb is not a parent we spent\nTwo billion dollars a year our education system flowers but we're not preparing the kids for the job so they can compete with the Chinese and the Indians the Europeans and it's one of the biggest failings of this country we got to you know we got to turn that around here there are there are probably ... million Americans working age that could be working that should be working\nBut are even people with disabilities and it just because you got back or something like that doesn't mean you can't work on the assembly line but you could be a new order I well\nYou know workers or clerk I mean we need we need all hands on deck by now everybody working\nI got I got a suggestion sheep and that is that in all these communities or got rid of the shop class and maybe even got rid of all the physical facilities\nWhat would happen if they went to some of the industries in their area and said hey we want to teach kids how to do shop but we need we need to\nDo it will give you the space in one of our buildings but what we need is we need some ... some planners and some ... and all this stuff for my shot

hour\nIn a small change in the forecast as we expect partly cloudy skies heading into Thursday night with temperatures in the upper forties wins picking up at ten to Fifteen miles per hour out of the south\nThen for your extended forecast we still expect for days of sunshine from friday through Monday with temperatures in the mid sixties on friday was some gusty winds possible then down to the lower fifties on Saturday\nRebounding up to the low sixties Sunday and back down again into the upper fifties Monday I'm Jeff ... on radio five Seventy W any acts right now it's fifty one\nOf my brain where no stranger CRC out of one mind we're proud of the local knowing what we're doing really\nNeed to get back to my\nMy main reason\nHow am I going down the dot com\nFive Seventy ... than a radio she's your grandparents parents and you grew\nUp listening to the bigger in your family five Seventy than a\n\nComeback Lars Larson Joe pleasure to be with you on a Wednesday evening I'll be glad to get to your calls a bit later it eight\nSix six eight Lars that's eight six six four three nine five to seven seven emails go to talk of Lars Larson dot com you know for decades TV shows and books and of course the Terminator franchise have all suggested that the world will soon have wars in which the primary combatants a robot\nBut does that fantasy actually becoming reality is that a bad thing or a good thing I thought we did invite Dr Michael Guillen on who's an author Emmy Award winning science correspondent for ABC News appearing regularly on good morning America Nightline and world news tonight and the host of the History Channel series where did it come from Dr Dylan thanks for taking the time to not\nPay Lars uh it's my pleasure I literally just got off an airplane from Amsterdam I'm In New York a lot of the book so you're you're my first guy I met a taxi cab I Hope this works\nI Am glad to hear it a you know and and the thing is I Hope you're not ... because I've taken some of those long flights a few of them and and they're not fun [laughter]\nYeah isn't it especially since I started this morning from crack out all and why I was speaking yesterday to huge crowd and went from ... to Amsterdam Amsterdam New York but you know what I'm feeling good and large oil pipe rather it\nWas nice to talk to you as well so he is I mean we've seen the horror shows that are some of the science fiction movies about robot war is what would it be the worst thing in the world here\nSome of the battles that I guess have to be fought we don't have a worldwide conflict going on right now we're kind of in a one of the most peaceful period in human history uh so what would it be a bad thing if the combatants were machines rather than human beings\nYou know I I I think the short answer is no as long as they're all robots um you know there's the concern right now the largest is um there there is so\nDo we lost him up you know I I I ...\nYou were gone for a second and I was worried about you're heading for a tunnel is as people oh I get new there are ... you were saying no\nI I uh yeah hopefully it at some point I Know I was saying that I Know I don't think that it's a bad thing that robots takeover combat you know say human life that that's a good thing that concerned though is that we're in countries are not up front about this uh so there's some question about it but\nA country like Russia for example has been pretty a pretty clear that they want to create robots that will battle ...\nAnd and that will have and this and this is the kicker liars will have the ability to decide that to to kill or not they'll be completely a ton of us ... do you can imagine what kind of a or a scenario that create\nUm if you have robots that have been given permission to go kill people I'm so that that's the concern but if it's all robot warfare and they become our surrogates in effect that you know let let the last robot stand is the winter\nUm I don't think that's a bad thing you know a recently in Japan for example an ad that nuclear power\nA disaster they sent robots into check\nCheck out the the melt the court so it in cases like that we have very dangerous situations or ... outright combat I think that's um that's not a bad thing for robots take over from us\nWhat let me ask you this though doctor because we've had a smart ends and smarter devices I mean the the the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima Nagasaki were dumb bombs I mean they were ... were electronic to some degree but they were done then we have smart bombs are going to actually steer themselves\nSo when we talk about whether or not we would use a machine to fight against human being human warriors\nA rather than opening our own people's lives up front where are we talking about how many angels can dance on the head of a pin and philosophical questions about if you can employers smart weapon to steers itself to the target and now you have a smarter weapon that not only steers itself to the target and decides which target to take out\nIs there much of a ... difference at the end of the day\n[noise] [noise] that's a good question Lars and probably not at the concern that is so all you need is one country\nTo decide that they are going to create a Tottenham us combat\nStrike robotic combat and that's going to force the hand of every other country to do the same thing so suddenly we're going to find ourselves\nIn a kind of ... the alarms rapes during the Cold War when you know Russia said well I have you know X number of evolves and us said well we have ... plus one number of eight bombs and you know ah that that can just escalate the situation and it's very very critical um\nI you know we're entering into some very unknown territory bottom line I think for for me\nLooking at the immediate future and even right now um the the the thing that gives me the greatest concern our robots that are going to take people's jobs it's already happening and uh in my new book uh\nUh the end of life as we know it I cite some studies recently that said you know up to fifty percent or more jobs right now can be automated and are and not just blue collar jobs large white collar pink collar\nOn a job and and that concerns me because if you put people out of work what are they going to do\nDr I I I Love this conversation we needed a schedule more time but we'll do that another time because let me ask you didn't every forklift on a dock that unload just shift ship take away the jobs of\nOf ten or twenty guys who would have used their backs or a or a hand truck to manually you know so you got a whole bunch of strong guys and I think it was probably\nThe guys who would have used their backs or a or a hand truck to manually you know so you got a whole bunch of strong guys and I think it was probably almost exclusively guys picking up sacks of grain or Saxon something or boxes or something and hauling it off and all of a sudden we have a a crane in a forklift\nAnd we didn't need gender those guys but we found jobs with them doing other things are society did hasn't always been where progress has gone\nYeah and that's kind of the argument that\nUp to ... we saw that even as recently as computers\nYou know when computers took over you know we lost a lot of secretaries\nA lotta secretarial position than others but then we created Silicon Valley\nWhich is you know playing huge numbers of people so in the best case scenario Lars that will have a set fee for every say job search takes over it'll create another jobs for people who are who need to maintain those robots but there is a critical\nCritical difference between a forklift or you know other kinds of mechanical aids that we invented in the past\nAnd that is the robot is not\nDesigned nearly to do a single task it's actually designed to replace us period right and so we have computers now that are actually being developed to maintain the computers we have computers now that are even replace\nA or threatening to replace computer software developers which is the ultimate irony right that these computer developers are creating the robots that are going to put them out of a job so it's not\nI I'm I'm waiting to see what will happen but that is the most optimistic to the most pessimistic though and and this is a federalism shared by a very credible people scientists studies is that there won't be a um jobs created\nTo ... to offset the jobs that are lost\nAnd you know we talked about robots\nTaking over the world a revolt against Sheila's or so forth but the thing that I discuss in my book that we really need to take seriously is that people were if they find themselves\nYou know out of a job and that's their livelihood or are stolen something that may not give examples of ... people whose jobs have been stolen not once twice three times you know then what if people are going to do and that and that is a very real\nOr a danger and people in Silicon valley Hitler cult book out houses\nAre which will be very upfront about about it that that's where they're going to retreat is you know the ... ... it's you know what hit the fan so um\nWe don't know yet as to some degree we still have control over ... and that's why I've written this book so that people will be well informed\nI can help make wise decisions\nEducational project for programs or whatever give it directly\nYou know out of the Congress have them write a bill and say this is why it makes sense to spend five million bucks in the school district or fifty million and that one on on these specific programs would make them justify other than that take the whole deal we not department of Energy Department of education and simply do away with it there's a trillion dollars right there isn't it\nYeah well ... you and I were the same room right now I'd give you a big hug with\nSpecific like let's go back to the penny plan for a second yeah that's the one percent spending reduction act that was introduced in this Congress by congressman Mark Sanford who unfortunately lost his primary\nBut it won't be returning to Congress but he has pushed that you got one percent across the board of one percent of non interest spending so it doesn't apply to interest of the national debt but it applies to everything else you do that for five years you balance the budget and then that\nBill with cats and they got Eighteen percent of gross domestic product basically Eighteen percent of all economic output in the United states uh for for the foreseeable future that's what that bill would do\nThat would solve a lot of our problems in terms of the looming entitlement and not sovereign debt crisis that we face here in the United states but the problem here is looking at European welfare style of rates of federal spending\nWithin a short time we're talking the next Twenty years that's what we're going to be spending and we cannot produce you have strong economic growth\nYou can I create incentives to work in saved\nWith that level of spending it's going to crowd out private investment because people will be investing into government T bonds rather than investing in their business or the economy right those are the problem is worst seat as those problems we face and you're not going to be able to produce the amount of revenue unique because people are simply are going to be disincentive eyes to work with the with the level of taxation well\nGoing to be needed to to lower death\nOkay Jason another idea just a wild idea we're right now we have seven point one million unfilled jobs in America\nTo to lower death\nOkay Jason another idea just a wild idea we're right now we have seven point one million unfilled jobs in America and I would if I were king but we're not a kingdom but if I were King I would say All right we're going to immediately said to every single state we're no longer paying for any social welfare benefits for this class of people\nEverybody who is above the age of Nineteen let's say and below the age of fifty five so working age\nAble bodied son to mind a and we'll start with the kids who have no kids who the people who have no kids at home but we're soon going to get to the people who do have kids at home and say you have to go get a job there seven million jobs\nGo get one of them but we are at like Paul the page did a main saying we're not paying ... we're not paying food stamps for example he cut the food stamp rules by Seventy five percent in that group of people immediately when he said you have to work or you don't get food stamps and a lot of people just simply quit now that would have to say the least tens of billions\nWouldn't it if we did that to you know Medicaid food stamps tennis and all the rest of that razzmatazz oh abs\nAbsolutely yeah I Know and look the house to to their credit I mean I'm not that big a fan of House Republican leadership but occasionally they do something right and they tried to do that in the farm bill this year was to add ... to uh to food stamps I'm\nIt granted the savings will reinvest it into work training programs which kind of\nDidn't defeat the purpose of just defeated the it just took the savings out of the bill but it would've said billions of dollars\nA unfortunately the Senate decided not to pursue that in fact the Senate voted out of it in a an amendment offered by senators I think a bike we attack crews that would have put Walter ... or ... or if it's on us that benefits or food stamp benefits the Senate's been\nHas been and will continue to be the source of most of our problems are and moving a more fiscally conservative agenda because there are too few fiscal conservatives and the Senate\nEven if we get a few more senators in November\nMe look the certainly numbers will improve their there are some mixed there are some interesting prospects this year in terms of Senate races and I hope to see some of those come to fruition but I'm\nThe plot we have a problem you we may be able to do things that we weren't able to do with more senators Republican senators in the Senate but um\nYou still have to ... it's all a numbers game at the end of the day and like one of the reasons we got a spinning deal and February that blew the spending caps by three hundred billion dollars every two years is because we do not have enough fiscal conservatives lot just to the Senate but the entirety of ...\nI wouldn't even mind seeing some reform over the Pentagon I still remember J I've talked about this there was a guy named ... very smart guy and he was kind of he effectively was the CFO at the Pentagon you know he was the chief financial guy\nAnd I said well why don't you know get the savings especially when you're having things bought for you that you say the Pentagon does anyone want this but Congress forced us to buy it\nAnd and he said we can move about three quarters of one percent of the Pentagon budget to Congress locks the rest of it down and we don't have any control over budget well you couldn't run Nike or Boeing or any of those companies if you said you can change the budget but only this three quarters or one for the rest of it yeah he's logged Jason\nI'm up against a break but kept doing the great work to do it freedomworks and thank you so much with the time denied\nDiaper

your best information about the long march five have they solve their problems or do we hold our breath and see if it works good evening to you Brandon\nWell good evening John and thank you again for having me on and hello Gordon and to your question I'm back home in Florida we have a saying even apply pay can find that ... once in a while the Chinese yes it's true they're having some technical difficulties\nBut to be fair we here in the United states in the sixties and seventies had our share of technical difficulties with our space program if you give them enough time though they will adapt and the Chinese are heavily invested\nAnd they're heavily committed to achieving a what we know in the national security policy arena as space dominance\nAnd they are they are offering that so whether or not the next launch\nAnd the next few months we'll work [noise] uh I think it probably will but even if it doesn't they're going to keep trying until they get one right and we hear in the United states unfortunately are not competing the way we should be the way we did against the Soviets in space\nAnd so they basically in China have a lot of time to perfect a the technology they're trying to ah create and you\nWant to translate quickly there's among writes on and there's only one contest that is\nThat that is one hundred percent correct yes garden\n[noise] friend and I'd like to just change the topic a little bit because I heard you speak yesterday and I was absolutely flabbergasted it's something that you said\nWhich I think is critically important which I think every American needs to hear and that is um we all know that Google has declined to participate in a Pentagon contract to develop the cloud some ten billion dollars\nA lot of people and Google are upset that this does not fit in with the Google philosophy of don't be evil\nBut I heard you say and and I just was completely astounded\nThat Google is about to participate in a technology contract in China were affected by the partner on the other side is the People's Liberation army if you could just run through that because there are a lot more details on that but I think everyone needs to hear this\nYeah so basically a quantum computing is it's the next revolution and that's that is the thing it is an ex industrial revolution whoever can figure out quantum computing first\nIt's basically like having the cotton gin [noise] you know the last ... evolution it it will completely change the way the world works or the Chinese presently have what's known as quantum Internet basically it plays upon string theory and basically without getting into the mechanics of it\nIt's kind of show and that too\nIt's an Internet basically it plays upon string theory and basically without getting into the mechanics of it\nIt's shown that to put up a particle can exist in the same place and it was such a different place it at the same time and the Chinese have figured out a way to manipulate that particle to transfer encrypting data between the two particles and it's worked David ... says twenty sixteen [laughter]\nFrom that technology that initial investment they spun off technologies like quantum radar which can be a it's believed can see through the at thirty five that multi trillion dollar\nA program of ours to build the great stealth fighter they can see through it and they're married that to the s four hundred Russian built defense system\nAs well they are now investing heavily in an actual quantum computing center and on and we and they have reached out to Google and about a year ago and Google has expressed interest\nIn not only sending over talent to this massive new center there building which would be probably operational around twenty twenty twenty Twenty one\nBut Google also wants to infuse cash this is under the umbrella of a state owned enterprises and China which happens to be basically reporting to the People's Liberation army the Chinese have actually not been very secretive about the fact that the quantum computing center that they're building that Google could potentially be helping with\nA is actually not only for civilian purposes but also for military assets in the same way that Google and apple investment into a I research artificial intelligence research in China is also going to be used for Chinese military purposes let me\nSet

T.\nRight yes um well [laughter] that's very interesting question and the answer is no one knows because in in all of this\nThe U.S government has said he'd always says in the ... ... ... only as little as possible\nAnd we we really have very few pieces of the puzzle\nFrom the government itself which is is pretty much off the coast wheat germ and frankly we don't even know whether a tip is still an ongoing project\nI I think people like who Elizondo ran it of course say yes it is it still has its mission it still continues he of Kosovo he's resigned from the Pentagon and still has has a lot of contacts and friends that he says it's still going\nNow the other people I think have disputed that and certainly we have been told that the\nFunding has been polled well blue I was on his head so it doesn't matter you can continue a project with you know using can count on ... which is absolutely true but you know it is it is a mystery what do I do suspect that happened is if it is\nStill an addict and program it was probably changed twinkles again this is typical government um alphabet soup\nTerritory we don't even a hundred percent sure about the name of of a tip\nLew said it's a ...

and you know that you're dealing with some pretty secretive stuff when they weren't even come clean about the name of the the program\nThe course of course still interested in all she still funding a lot of projects\n[laughter] again we don't know and the problem is that um we we know the the Robert Bigelow gosh\nI'm I was going to say through through um his his friendship with Senator Harry Reid but that's not that's not entirely correct and I don't want to do him a disservice hair he beat for the tip contract quite quite openly in legitimately and through the\nThe the kind of contractual procedure antique on a large chunk of that ... of course justice the the government requires that people selling their secrecy oh it's\nSo Robert Bigelow and and um he's organization\nHad everyone under non disclosure agreement so actually the people involved in this work what kind of I'm going twice so to speak they had they had to have government security Herron says but also the commercial non disclosure\nAgreement so so again there is a lot of this story that we don't know and that's the other thing in in aliens at the Pentagon and I've seen a lot of you know you pick up the the media um you reports of this you go onto the bulk some\nForums you see a lot of speculation was always taught at the ministry of defense\nYou know when I was doing analyst ... for example and briefing\nHe must always differentiate between ... you know and what you're saying\nAnd that looks a skill that everyone practices when they they make films documentaries but I Try to be when you're a song by accident\nAnd we don't even speculating I say I'm speculating and when I'm not I'm not so hopefully even though there are large parts of the story we still don't know I'm only ... where we don't know those things\nWell absolutely what's the bottom line with what you're going really\nWell I I Do want to I I don't want to get too far into spoiler I think one one thing that I can\nSay which I think it's a pretty good summary of all why don't you think has gone down\nI Would say the ball and I use that would deliberately I Believe a faction if I can call it died within the U.S government\nAnd some of those people were good imminent employees and some were can try because and this believe a science fiction but the phenomenon was absolutely rail and and they were correct and that of course\nDidn't entirely know what to think of it without the possibility that they were dealing with something extraterrestrial paranormal\nAnd actually then led to believe a fraction became or or certainly interacted with overlapped with with a tip\n[laughter] and they effectively I I guess gotten the chance to use those those beliefs and those hypotheses\nWithin government we've taxpayers' money and and then of course gives us in an interesting opportunity to find out about the past because\nAnd I hope we'll we'll have time to get into this late but now of course talk of congressional hearings to to get to the bottom of this but\nBut the bottom line to on the question is is that I think there was a believer function\nThey made them move they came up against some road blocks couple of different road blocks one Rose Bowl was simply going to a point where you know they they looked at this and [noise]\nAnd they investigated but because they didn't get a definitive on to the feeling was that they taking it as far as as they couldn't what else can you do the other sort of road blocks but they had this is very controversial is a hater\nI got a cold is a religious road dog from some senior people in the Pentagon who find play for the UFOs and the paranormal with demonic and therefore didn't didn't think what we should be having anything to do with that\n\nThe U.S it was from the paranormal with him on it and therefore didn't didn't think what we should be having anything to do with that\n[noise] well\nWhat do we [laughter] we don't\nHave anything to do it though\nI mean it it was the whatever the it was as I say there were people in the beginning probably still are hers deeply conservative we let you believe [laughter]\nLead them to think that they are dealing with that they don't make a demonic\nPhenomenon here might come up come up again and there is a couple of times in in the u._k. as well at the ministry of defense in fact one of one of my book says was a pretty extreme with this\nAnd the the the individual who wrote that the defied intelligence assessment\nOn on UFOs in the ministry of defense named ... ... ... he would have wanted to go too far down that road he had some planning own beliefs as well I don't know the passage in the Bible\nIn the book of Asians I think it is where it refers to say as being the print the power of the air and I think he's where a lot of these conservative religious\nPeople get the idea of UFOs might be demonic\nCan just you know and there were a lot of religious folks Nick that believe that\n[noise] yeah and I think it's great to Hannah than because I Need to call me play ironic in another way\nBut you know you have a bunch of people in the ... D the DRA swearing and in the u._k. and the ministry of defense you got a bunch of people who thought this was dealing with a real phenomenon\nAnd we should be investigating it research he had a scientific manner and we come up again to system or you might think well that's fine that's that's what you'd expect [laughter]\nUm but I kept them to go to Nicole or intellectual\nHuman it kept us is that I think most people I associate with that concept it's surely it it's probably trying to leave your trip in ... south I mean it could have effectively the so called us skeptics in the end picking\n'em say that they don't they don't believe in extraterrestrials but they believe these things demonic coil it just in one sense it's paying one on your plate fringe belief for another\nLike this police officer I Know about title fraud sore register with home title walking discovered some states had already taken over title thank God I found out of time\nNo bank I don't eat that program or insurance protects you oh title luck will for heavy snow day hold tight lock puts a barrier around your homes title and mortgage the instant did detect tampering there on it helping to shut down\nFind out if you're already a victim of title fraud get your hundred dollar shirt free which sign up visit home title luck dot com home idle lock dot com\n\n\nWelcome back to coach the cultural back with the pope Nick do you think at all but the alien presidents appears to have any kind of threat to us as a human species\nWe grapple with the ministry of defense and I didn't write the oil in the new year program to finally\nHave only into the question of whether there is a threat and how could you tell and who should make that assessment fight it quite between different divisions in the ministry of defense and and\nUm it it gets quite Frank I'm between different divisions in the ministry of defense and and some of the the left has made quite amusing reading\nAs as the intelligence people killing some of the other people you know who do you think you are to suddenly put yourself into the role of of of an intelligence\nAnalyst and and you know you that's not your job and um what what the intelligence people concluded they they made a a kind of analogy um they said um [noise] uh if if you don't mind I've actually going to document in front of me\nPlease give us some quotes from\nYeah this is this actually hasn't officially been released yet I'm Will\nBe tonight Ted Williams night\nI'm the second in critical question is do you a piece rent present a possible threat to the defense of the well we could argue that seeming for the sake of the argument that something in this [laughter]\nThey have never shown any hostile attend intent and therefore kennel represent a threat however Russian act Croft attempting to penetrate the u._k. I defense reaching the Cold War never showed hostile intent but they certainly represent a threat though is\nThe only logical conclusion that we can come to that we do not know\nIf you ate pays represent a threat to the defense of the realm\nAnd [laughter] they scan it's quite interesting because ah\nParts of the the ministry of defense was saying to parliament the media\nAnd the public know there's there's no evidence of any threat here we we look at these things to see if that of any difference in ... but no no no threat and yet in the way they were trying to fight documents saying well look we just don't know we have not yet made a proper assessment and so we we can't tell\nWe simply can't tell well what about the alien abduction phenomenon I mean wouldn't that be some kind of threat\nWhen I say it would be if we could absolutely say that it's it's basically rail and not not some sort of combination of hoaxes and psychological delusions and\nAnd and all the misunderstood phenomena the the other thing is of course\nWe don't really know what's going on some of the people who claimed to have had these abduction experiences say that it's really really traumatic Ken and suddenly researchers like about ... Jacobs where we're always\nSaying you know the whole style and it's it's a threat on the other hand people like John Mack and and some of the other people who take him on new age and spiritual view of this\nTalk about healing and things like that and he goes back to the idea of who who can really say I mean this sounds bizarre but in millet treat them there is actually in a ...\nFor I'm working out whether this is a threat to our knowledge or rather this this is a kind of ...\nWe don't know the finally there's\nIntelligent some millet treat a cold [laughter]\nWe say that ... is defined as being a construct of capability quasi intend\nSo you look at the capability you look at the intent and then you would count as a threat and if there is\nBut what what kind of a threat it is well we have some idea about the capability of you ate pay and and again the the file leaves the ministry defense files stay quite clearly you know pizza maneuvers\nWay in excess of anything that we've gone so the capability\nWe we know has value what we don't have any idea about the intent if the if there is an intelligence behind this phenomenon frankly we don't know what it is we don't know what it won't we it may be unknowable\nIn the u._k. the astronomer royal ...

whether this would have been in the nineteenth century [noise]\nThe people there were totally use to UFOs flying all over the place about them and called them off needs no one was afraid of the things I took for granted it was just part of their lives so unless you're taught to be afraid of these things you're not really a face at them\nDid you ever talk down about ... visitation and abductions or anything like that than anybody ever see are keeping some clothes yes\nThey thought Cubans but nobody was abducted\nYou describe what they look like\nYou know because my grandmother the granddaughter of this man told me this and uh you know she went in there but everybody in the town when she would go to the exit row grandparents everybody would say oh you have to see any of these you know you'll love\nIt [laughter] what do you think is not a big deal you know\nIt's a great point which is of course he goes back to this this thing that I think a lot of people in this field do no I'm the idea that this phenomenon suddenly started in Nineteen forty seven is of course crazy I mean people have seen\nStrange things in the sky since the dawn of time but I think the other interesting thing about this this cold and these\nThese Emilio recollections says is the fight [laughter]\nYou know these these phenomena are always interpreted through the lens of of personal belief system and Cal ...\nAnd it is interesting when you come up against couches where where this this thing is is almost commonplace that it's it's like oh yeah you know that but the thing we don't necessarily know what it is but yeah it's it's real\nMiniatures real let's go to Andy in Norwalk, California now why indeed go ahead\nI joined your great patron and Mr call it's a real honor I listen to many times and you're very um [noise]\nInformed and entertaining to listen to a two part question if I may uh first of all a based upon all of your knowledge of\nThe western powers all of the needle countries in for that matter let's say the eastern bloc countries ... how many as long as you've been following this how many uh aircraft and uh pilots have disappeared and this guy while pursuing so called UFOs\nAnd are based upon your response I I have a second part a final question if I may okay\nNicky with us yeah sorry I thought you were getting hit me with pot too straight away\nWhile we're waiting for that will ... will do that one\nI'm now I'm going to sound a little bit skeptical on on this I Would say beyond through his last even\nThen it's got a lot of things that I've I've read in in the UFO and pulled tentative belief communities\nI mean I've seen some people talk about pilots carrying missing and and your fires and I think\nYou know unfortunately flying is an inherently dangerous um occupational certainly laws in in the early days in a lot of\n... just disappeared because they crashed now now of course then you have to have some classic cases like a ... ... the mentality case he didn't disappear of course but he\nCrashed chasing a UFO which skeptics say with the planet Venus we coming off of cost to the fortieth anniversary of arguably the most famous disappearance of all time involving a UFO Frederick ...\nOh yes and that was strange I think we're literally days away in Australia right\nYes I absolutely over the or is it by trade I think all the time it's been straight maybe the best straight is part of the task Muncie excuse me I'm geographically challenged in that particular part of the world but\nUm but yeah I I don't buy into the rumors that I've heard the pilots\nWere sharing and disappearing or all the time as a result of of that we had a case in the u._k. tragic case involving a pilot who who just off into the city\nIn in I think Nineteen Seventy it was during a night exercise\nAnd some people years later I tried to a tribute to us for a story on to that but I pulled out the board of inquiry oil which was about two inches thick I went through every single paper in filed and I couldn't couldn't actually substantiate any of these rumors\nSo I think I think the ... question is is very few\nWomen do you okay go ahead and say\nOh okay so the second part question based upon your you're responding to this is you probably know during the Eisenhower administration there were so many aircraft\nThat we're a suddenly a malfunctioning falling out of the skies\nAnd uh yes in some cases just suddenly disappeared that the Eisenhower administration gave the order\nTo stop the pursuit the aggressive pursuit by American aircraft obese UFOs and secondly I spoke to Dr Heinrich before he passed away a Chicago radio station for about a five to seven minutes\nAnd I asked them what are the chances of\nA life or not existing on other planets and not coming and visiting us calm and he said impossible that that was his response impossible [laughter] so I I appreciate your perspective and I do personally believe\nThat they dominate the skies any time and every time that they come a within our airspace there's so many thousands tens of thousands and God only knows maybe millions of years ahead of us\nThey could be entered dimensional they could be a cold or both but I don't think we're much of a match\nAnd they do have air superiority\nAnd I do appreciate the honor and pleasure talking to both of you\nAppreciate it will set by the way and\nAnd he made a really interesting point which goes back to something in the British Intelligence is Aspen ... and that was a I have I don't like to call him using but ah I ... that was kind of\nPoignantly amusing maybe the there was a line about the flight safety and safety implications off you a pay per view which goes directly\nOf of course to the point just made and there was a recommendation in ... combines final report and it said I don't have it in front of me but but effectively\nA pilot's encountering you ate pay extra take no action apart from trying to place the object is going on in other words you know whatever we dealing with here don't mess with it\nAction from trying to place the object in other words you know whatever we dealing with it don't mess with that\nDon't mess with it at all we're going to take a break pretty soon that can come back with final phone calls but I also want to talk with you you got a thriller out called blood brothers don't you\nYeah I kind of a different thing for you\nFor having on the program I did a lot of other things in my Twenty one years at the MIT and my final thing within the direct threat to security we did a

the moment I'm a I'm coming out in paperback in November but it's on Amazon and say say basically I just give it to Amazon and look up ... brother snake or it's on my post on our website on the books\nSuper in your opinion uh assuming we're being visited do you think most of the looks like these so called de Leon graze that people have described or do they look like costs what do you think\nWell it's tricky question because I think the media I'm kind of like to have this kind of\nMean whatever you call it half of the alien gray and then it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy because I think you know when people say oh I've seen one of these aliens gray large\nHead ... shaped it gets reported\nBut when when somebody says they see something that doesn't quite fit the mold maybe it doesn't quite make the caught or get the coverage but in my experience when people were pointing to have just as when they were ... you know they come in all shapes and sizes\nThey're all they sure do but you but you're almost saying then that people basically they hear this they hear this and then they think they see it\nYes I think she plays a big part in this but I can

the Nineteen eighties and when Cruz to ends up on stage and says\nI Want to lower your taxes and Beto O'Rourke wants to raise your taxes\nHow hard the decision is that even for Democrats will John's America is senior editor of the stream and coauthor of the new books be politically incorrect guide immigration John welcome back\nThanks good to be on\nBy the way you're going to add an addendum to the politically incorrect guide to immigration to cover the refugee caravans would have now become all the rage\nYou know we covered the refugee issue in the book and how you know if someone has a safe country they're not around anymore\nTells you if you are being persecuted in our interest among you get to Mexico where the government that person can you you're not refugee anymore you know right and in the United states and I was really the starting point at all\nWell and and aren't you glad that the Trump decided uh because it's a you know he's actually going by the laws that are already on the books but as I understand it it was the Obama administration that said oh when it comes to persecution we're going to include economics and gangs and crime and things like that that weren't covered I went to law go ahead\nOh yeah and discrimination against transgender and ... basically the whole Islamic world would have the right to come here because they get all claim that they live on during a press religion by our status\nTheir ... that that fits the definition right away but why why are so many people around this country focused on this this race between Ted Cruz and uh I didn't know is actual name Robert\nThere you go why are so many people around this country focused on this this race between Ted Cruz and uh I didn't know the actual name Robert Francis O'Rourke otherwise known as bad\nAs I Know yeah and you can call me or one [laughter] because I have as much Hispanic\nHeritage as Robert Francis I'll work though there is that on my story at the same I got a great picture in an address back to when he was in a type that so I've been calling in beta beta male or work um I I think national Democrats\nObsessed with the snake would love to take a state of Texas and the last time they had what they thought was the winning candidate Wendy Davis star manor yeah she we abortion Barbie um she got obliterated\nThought she got a job and the board of Planned Parenthood and that's what I think they don't work is really running for he's running for\nA star star position on the national left even though he can't win an election in Texas I mean he could win you know he's a congressional seat in a very highly democratic district\nBut um I I think we're better than I Am delighted that Democrats have poured thirty eight million dollars into the race and awards says he will launch share it with other candidates so that money that could have gone a lot more competitive races a place like North Dakota\nSo um I think it's it's crucial for America's safety is that the Republicans keep both houses of Congress so that the ... steps are presented it doesn't become a nonstop impeachment show trial\nBut um I I don't think a cruise is going to lose to a lark I think part of the reason the polls showed cruises all over for a while is because the bad blood from the presidential race I was a Cruz supporter through the convention my girlfriend\nHated when he did at the convention I kind of liked it I rallied to ... you know during the general election but still they're still bad blood because\nThere's a lot of support for Trump in Texas and a lot of people were irritated with\nHis dog and fight against the president I don't agree with that but you know that was one of the things suppressing true crews that support Trump has come to Texas and done rallies that its Cruz has worked well with President Trump it's funny in the last debate\nOr work was trying to run away from the rest of the Democratic party he's talking about how he could work with the president uh you know he's worked with ... with Republicans in Congress but saying that he can work with Trump better than cruise cruise pointed out you'll have called for President Trump's impeachment\nDoes somebody the that Donald Trump is going to\n... I mean if if war or elected in Texas it'd be like we didn't have a senator senator had died and we just decided to leave the seat open because that's how little impact he would have\nLooked on the other hand drawn is his real name just two twenty twenty as though I mean we've seen people sort of short changed the\nThe process so I've always thought that a lot of people had to go through to become president you expected them to perhaps run for the house the Senate maybe become a governor run a state for a while get some real experience we saw Obama short cut that\nBy saying oh I don't doubt that I can be in the state legislature in Illinois I'll hop right to the Senate all immediately start running for president I'll spend very little time and accomplish almost nothing in the Senate never having run a big organization of any kind never signed the front of a paycheck\nA short cut all that is better or thinking well run for Senate I'll get some name for a million earning a raise a bunch of money and then in twenty twenty I'll run on my good looks and charm\n[noise] yeah I think you know somebody needs to sit down with Robert Francis at work and say just because you drive drunk as he does have an accident does it make you a Kennedy\n[laughter] that is a great line I Hope I Hope you've already said that one out\nNow it's all auditioning for for your own you\nKnow I Want you to put that one on Twitter because I'm so tempted feeling that if you don't put it on an ordeal I'm going to put it on Twitter and\nOut here one I already have in the article without twenty million dollars my hope is that recent refugee from New York City to to get to ... I Hope or use it at twenty million to pay for her to the rest of his life so we never have to drive again that will make me feel safer on the road\nNo kidding well I just I I look at this and I understand that there were people who said that the slam on Trump was well this guy's just to reality stars well no he's not because in addition to having a very popular TV show he actually did a lot of things in business\nAnd they say oh you know the only turn you know even if you took his worst critics in New York Times and said he inherited a lot of property from his dad great\nJohn I Wish somebody like you would write the piece that says how many people in America have inherited\nA million bucks from their parents I didn't uh but how many of ... million or ten million or a hundred million and they have quickly turned it into half that amount or attempted though yeah but you try and go ahead\nI I Know I Know someone who is one of the grand ... great grandchildren of John the Rockefeller are you telling me about going to Rockefeller family gatherings and he said like forty percent of them don't even have jobs they just sort of a dinner around going to fundraisers and ... and then they take their private jets to environmental events to save the planet\nAnd [laughter] you know Trump made something he he he he he didn't get lemons he got apple but he may he may be Apple's new aside or factory he created lots of jobs ...\nAnd look he's done a great dog and the American economy is doing great on foreign policy he's a lot better president than I ever thought he would be back when I was cheering protect\nCruise I Know and I always back Trump but I ... I've said the people we all say well he only made a few billion dollars I said that's very hard to do ask anybody who's going to hurt a giant amount of money how hard it is to turn into a really large amount of money and I said and then go back and ask yourself if you added inherited\nA modest some by comparison from say you inherited fifty million dollars\nAnd you went down to your best financial advisors said well we're going to do with this and he said well fifty million times five four or five percent\nYou can sit back and collect two and a half million dollars a year you know two hundred thousand dollars a month\nAnd you'll never put your money at risk and you can sit on the beach with two fifty thousand dollars a week you can check into the nicest hotel in ... and sit there for the rest of your life or hop on a plane every week and go somewhere else and you could do that and Donald Trump didn't do that\nI went to my rent\nIs about you know sixteen hundred dollars a month we act car payments he O L the bills piled up on top of each other it's it's kind of hard to make it by being honest you know uh and I try to get some government assistance you know I don't I'm not ashamed\nOf it you make a teen and are your girlfriend makes sixteen you said\nThat she works in the restaurant industry says she gets tickets to you know like she she makes minimum wage plus tips\nCried so she's making maybe thirty thousand a year and you're making about thirty ... so you're making seven sixty five Seventy Seventy five thousand dollars a year\n[noise] close to it about a little less than that but yeah\nI was asked to but you want your fellow ... old on you want your fellow taxpayers help you pay your bills why\nWell here's a here's where it is you know I was\nPaying all my bills I'm not I don't have any like extra curricular things I'm spending money on doing the average like\nNo I Try to get a car payment I got I got that on paying yeah but why\nWhy do you think it's immoral for you to ask your fellow taxpayers to to help pay your bills why don't how about this make more money\nHow can that can help them out them capable of working get solved and I don't want I Am working it out on the lead me around\nI'm the first guy you're going to talk to who's going to say\nIf somebody is able bodied and working age they need to have a job and we need to start having these work requirements that the president is pushing their Kris Kobach is pushing in Kansas we need to have people in office who will say if you're capable of working and there are seven million open jobs you need to go get one of them\nAnd if you can't live within the paycheck yearning now\nI've got two suggestions either reduce your spending or increase your work activities find something you can do or your work is worth more\nSo and and that's almost every I can you name me a job anywhere in America where somebody cannot learn how to do an additional skill that makes them worth another two or five or ten dollars an hour named the job called ...\nI I couldn't I couldn't and and I I mostly agree with you I used to work two jobs that they know that two and three jobs my whole entire life me too we kids now we've got kids now and ah I don't I'm not really a big avid fan of you know kids going to sit there is so ...\nTo they're they're really expensive nowadays there they ... how much I make an hour\nSo okay I got and I can I Do is let me do a test with you here's an idea yeah live next to people there are other people in your neighborhood right\n\nOkay how about that on tonight when you get home from work or tomorrow when you're off\nGo around and knock on doors in the neighborhood and say I don't make enough money to live the way I'd like to live would you give me a thousand bucks and and maybe even make it easy to give me a thousand bucks this year would you give me eighty bucks a month would you feel comfortable asking your neighbors for some extra income\nSee\n[noise] I wouldn't personally\nOkay and that and you can tell you if you want the government to go collect the money from the people and then give it to you what's the difference between you asking your next door neighbor they could just spare me an extra hundred bucks a month for doing nothing for you\nYou you won't ask your neighbor for it but you want the government to come take it from your neighbor at the point of a gun and give it to you is there any moral difference between those\nUnder the impression that I'm already paying for this service what service not doing a lot with a ... ... and taking the money for me since I'm a taxpayer\nThey are but in theory what we should be\nI Can't have how can they can how can they don't take that money and just stopped me keep it it's a well I don't want to pay for somebody else they\nDid it hurting the it about a year ago the U.S or what they know about a year ago the Congress changed the law and said you get to keep more of your paycheck they cut the tax rate and they let you keep more of the money you earned so you don't have to ask your next door neighbor for the money\nFor what I'm asking is you're asking for government assistance and you say well I'm paying for it why don't I get it well in theory we shouldn't be supporting any body through social programs other than those who are in capable of doing for themselves so if you have somebody who's quite old\nAnd and you know they they don't have any money\nWe're not going to let them die we're not going to live the ... street if you've got a kid who has no family to take care of him or her then we're going to take care of them but right now I Would agree with you there's an awful lot of those social programs like welfare food stamps ten of\nSection eight and all that is going to people who could get up off their backsides and go out and get a job there seven million open jobs available we should tell them to go work\nBut I don't for the life of me understand Rob why you would want to become dependent on the government's welfare dependency on welfare as one of the most\nThe life of me understand Rob why you would want to become dependent on the government's welfare\nBecause dependency on welfare is one of those ... things you can do to people you tell people don't work and\nThere too many people will say yes to that\nHave no pride they had
