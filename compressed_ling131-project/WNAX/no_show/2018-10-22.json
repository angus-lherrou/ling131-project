you know we try to bring you find an entertaining interviews and the second hour and a I just adored this guy I I wasn't expecting to like him as much as I did however as mark always like to remind me\nEvery time I think and it's not going to be great interview I meet the person and and pleasantly surprised mostly because I Am of all year and I love just talking to people but this guy chip Conley is a I think that a special case\nAnd no one really significant issue that impacted chips life is that he had terrible scare health care\nIn his late forties and um I only bring that up because we just finished we're just finishing estate planning weak and just a gentle reminder gang get your estate planning stuff just get it done\nTalked to in a state attorney qualify to state attorney not the person who did your real estate closing not the woman who negotiated your divorce and the state planning attorney with that expertise\nPlease please do that and you know we're talking about what is midlife yes we're all going to live longer chances are\nThat expertise please please do that and you know we're talking about what is midlife yes we're all going to live longer chances are and one of the cool things is that because of that because we are all likely to live longer chick Conley says we need to redefine what need life really means\nFirst of all ... for those of us who are in midlife and and and let's start by saying mid life I think has actually changed it used to be forty five sixty five today I think it's thirty five to Seventy five because people feel irrelevant earlier\nBecause there are more people in this midlife marathon and feeling a little confused by it I think the key is to start start saying which habitats are gonna be open to your wisdom and uh so\nOne of the things that I had lucky going for that was fortunate for me was I was in an industry hospitality and these the founders of there being be it started in that field but had nobody in the company would hospitality background\nSo start by asking is there a field or an industry you may be in health care\nAnd you have some people want to disrupt health care and I've got some great technology but they really don't understand how the industry works or they don't have the contacts they don't have a rolodex that know how and I know who the combination of those two together is something you have going for you especially if it's an industry where people are learning the industry along the way\nSo I think that was helpful I think also as helpful as it was clear that Bryan and his co founders really wanted to learn from me why because they asked me a lot of questions rather than sort of having the in in the room and then on occasion just saying okay let's try to ship out and talked about hospitality they started looking at me three weeks into friends that you are in charge of strategy now\nSo it's just we just in terms of hospitality and three weeks into it and now in charge of strategy for the company which was not something I asked for but he clearly saw that I had a strategic mind so that was great\nSo but I but let me just say I had a you know the book was didn't work the making of a modern older is full of your samples a hundred and fifty examples beyond me I Am an unusual case in the sense that the founders of this company asked me to join them that doesn't happen a lot for people in their fifties\nI think that there's something interesting you point out\nMany people face their modern elder years with a sense of anxiety I hear that anxiety when people call the shell up and they're in their fifties and I have friends obviously you I'm sure you have the same thing you have a group of friends who grew up with them or you went to college with them and\nThey're in this place where they just don't know how to channel themselves into a next chapter and there's anxiety financial anxiety obviously when you probably didn't have as much but\nI think that sometimes people face suck in a place where they feel like they're becoming obsolete in kind of like running out the clock and don't know how to make a move and and I find that to be it that's pretty consistent and\nReally consistent we have um we started something called the modern older academy which is a social enterprise says it you know we have half the people coming on scholarship where people come to a campus in in on a on a beach front in ... which is in Mexico and yes and they come and they learn about how to evolve into a modern elder\nWhat the four steps that are there outlined in the book so you don't have to go to Mexico necessarily to do this number one you have to evolve and this is the hardest up because many of us\nI I Would have been very hard for me if I think back on it to be fifty two years old I've run my own company you know for twenty four years and now I'm actually reporting to someone who's Twenty one years younger than me Mm ouch forty percent of us in the workplace\nHave ... Abbas younger than us and that's actually only growing as a phenomenon so if I didn't evolve and say okay I'm no longer the sage on the stage if the leader of the company but I'm the guy on the side I'm the person who's helping this guy Brian be successful and I\nHad I had the right size my ego so that was one form of evolving I needed to do and that idea of evolving is not just in your identity but it's in what you know and that gets you to the second lesson which is to learn so the first lessons are evolving learn which are two things that frankly people in midlife often\nFeel like they don't want to do because it takes work right\nAnd it's uncomfortable the idea of uncertainty is something that grips us often as we get older they certainly can come from feeling ages them in the workplace treasure you feel like oh my God I could be you know one\nOne round of layoffs right away from being at the what are some things we can develop while we're still working to try to help us get to the next stage before that happens\nSo uncertainty as painful but irrelevant is worse and so that's a good ... I I did not in the bucket right here right here that's the only job where\nWe're going down the road um so the bottom line is I think that if you do the math let me just start by saying this I'm fifty seven years old I hung out with my dad you know in a scuba diving with him in rural Indonesia in may my dad's eighty one this month\nUm and my dad and I took one of those online tests where it says how ... how long have you lived to we both both for both of us is that we're ... we're Ninety eight\nTo five fifty seven now and I'm able to Ninety eight you can do the math I Am thirty nine years into my adulthood and I have forty one years of adulthood ahead of me I Am a less than half way through my adult part of my life when you think that way you realize oh my gosh I have a lot of time ahead of me\nWhich means that you're may be more willing to have a beginners mind and be a little bit curious about things that you might say yeah let me try that out I'm going to be a beginner and the idea of being in mid life you know let's look back in childhood we had to learn how to walk which means we had to fall down a few times\nAnd we've had to do things in our life where we've had to be not very good at it learning a language at fifty seven among Spanish and money surfing last year when the surf this is not the thing that people in their fifties do but\nThe process is great it creates curiosity ... ... is an old licks her\nFor having a life affirming kind of experience so long story short is once you realize that it's not over at age fifty you're open to maybe trying some things and looking awkward along the way but having fun and being able to laugh at yourself\nCan you explain this rule that you have an air BNB in and you know as a modern elder you say that you have to be an editor yeah explain what you mean by that\nWell there's a great book the Johnson Rausch brought out recently called the happiness curve in a ... it goes into great detail about the fact that frankly people get happier starting around fifty or forty your forties are your worst decorated the reason for that is because we tend to accumulate\nUp until about ... at age fifty what does that mean well you ... friends you accumulate relationships or you know you you might ... children and and having kids you accumulate roles and responsibilities and things you do for nonprofits and\nBy the time you get your forties it's a mishmash of so many things that you really don't feel like you know you have much control or freedom in your life and so you accumulate in the first half your life you edit and the second half your life and we see this a lot with people in their homes\nThey have a you know have a big home then they become an empty nester and then they downsize that's an an example of editing the process of\nBut you don't have a big home then they become an empty nester and then they downsize that's an example of editing the process of editing your life down to what's important to including who you want to spend time with and what you want to do is a really valuable exercise because it means you start focusing on what makes you happy\n[noise] okay we'll get back to our

life that there's an amazing benefits that come the second half of life\nAh and\nHelping people to see that and then I see that companies could use that and then create a new kind of generational compact the idea that the movement would be around how do we see aging as a part of society that isn't something that we just sort of shut shut it off to retirement homes\nBut instead it's actually

and also sixteen\nThousand dollars for personal exemptions for our family of four that told forty two thousand dollars now with the new tax brackets it looks like we will only be able to write off twenty four thousand is that true well so two things\nFirst you've got to determine are you going to claim the standard deduction or are you going to itemize\nThere's a few things about itemized deductions that you should know first of all I'm you are limited in your uh itemized deductions for state and local taxes to ten thousand dollars overall you also um if\nYour charitable contribution limit for a year cash donations is limited to sixty percent of your adjusted gross income I think for most people that's not going to matter medical expenses deductible in excess of seven and a half percent of your adjusted gross income\nSo Utah Boulder itemized deductions and you say to yourself is that more than what I Would claim\nFor the standard deduction\nSo if you had twenty six thousand dollars in itemized deductions in the past presuming that some of that is state and local taxes we don't know because I don't know where you're from\nBut if that reduces if your state and local tax part of it let's just let's pretend that us Fifteen grand in state and local taxes we kept at just Penn\nSo then you have to add up all your other itemized deductions to see that makes sense and if it adds up to more than twenty four thousand dollars and then you then you would have\nTo itemize but if it's less than twenty four thousand then you would just basically claim the standard deduction which is twenty four thousand so you lose the personal exemptions that just went away the real question is\nOnce you've made that decision on that last maybe your tax bracket went down\nMaybe all of a sudden your tax bracket which was you know twenty eight ... goes down to twenty two\nSo you didn't mention how much on what your income was but you may find that your total tax picture improved I don't know 'cause I don't know what last year was but that's the big decision around standard versus itemize thing\nYour standard deduction it's twenty four thousand for married filing jointly you've got to tally up all the itemized deductions including the new limitations and see if it's more and then we'll figure it out but no you don't get those unfortunately those ah [noise]\nA personal

I don't want to have to be told that you don't want to come you don't want to comment that doesn't agree with your comment\nGerry how're you doing over there I bought that meant [laughter]\nYeah I don't get we never talk about it again like I say I'm not trying to argue with no I'm just saying I'm just saying how do you\nParse this with all of the things that are in the Bible all the Christian beliefs that we have ... you could be selective like maybe you know you don't want this was a group of Irish folks that were coming through the Mexican border that we're going from religious oppression and then what would we do we couldn't let them an either\nOr we don't just let them in you have legal immigration\nAre not going to let them just come in here and we want us there and get their well that's what they're doing who's doing\nIt for stopping the border that's all we're doing well they're not even near the border yet yeah so in Mexico should step in their country\nThis is an argument will never be able to do that or when I realized that ... and that I'm just saying how do you party end up with Christian and I you know I I don't\nSee no problem with with partially kind of Christianity fine I mean we keep saying that for instance they interviewed one guy in the caravan yesterday on CBS or wherever and he said yeah I got deported two years ago but I'm determined to get back\nWhile but he probably loves it here I realize that but it is that if he does he get he obviously didn't get deported because they didn't like his looks he must have got deported for some reason\nSo we should let him back now because he just because he wants to come back again\nI don't know Steve I really I'm asking you because it sounds like you that's what you\nWant to know how to use to how do you settled is how you how do you put it you know with the whole Christianity think that's the questionnaire yeah I Do answer I think\nYou show aren't a lot of a Christian support for them if the people that are oppressed and and you have legal immigration to allow them to come in the country\nAnd you keep separating the kids than to right as a discouragement\nNo I don't think that was right I don't think it was already yeah\nWell a lot of these people as one woman said this morning they're leaving their home they're leaving everything you don't believe that because you want to write because they're looking at all there obviously are there's turmoil there there's no jobs are economic issues so they're looking for something better as refugees have for thousands a year and I agree\nI I Would do you know I can understand them doing that it just stick you can always go to the place you want to go\nWell I think we've learned that throughout the years yeah a as we move on to our big stories this morning\nPresident Trump's hammers the Democratic party opponents yesterday over what he sees as the the big issue in the campaign which we've just been talking about

know we've been ah talks over the years I'm going to church reading the Bible I'm just trying to figure it out I don't have an answer for it we don't have an answer for it no one\nHas ... there's no reason to criticize the people who think they have an answer\nIt might be a good idea just to bring it up to them while they're thinking about what they're doing\nI think it has been brought up to them\nI don't know that you don't think anybody has mentioned anything at all have you heard any ... have you heard Pat Robertson say anything about it have you heard any evangelicals talking about it\nI haven't heard anybody talk about anything one way or the other well I'm just bragging about anybody talking about we we should let them in\nI don't know I don't have an answer I'm not suppose I I'm an idiot DJ out here in the middle of South Dakota\nBut that's the thing but we keep discussing it as if we have the answers you don't have and neither should neither of us has answers to it so

I'm with a cow and then Blake emerging and you know a scholar Kavanaugh and Caleb shop for or a good football players too so we we have some depth that tight end and then some competition to see who's going to get out in the field and and so what role and\nUh you know it's great as a coach when you have that that's a they don't and ability to count on a number of guys\nI don't think he's quite reached got her status yet but Coontz have a tremendous one hand catch on Saturday and every time I've talked to Utah to stick ... died this everybody just says this Coontz kids got some special here as he continues to mature he's\nA true freshman yeah you don't Blake\nIs just a you know it's really just the tip of the iceberg right now uh you know he was a really talented high school baseball player and a you know thought he was going to have some opportunities in baseball so he actually when he was younger he was big so he was you know he had his helmet marked where he was one of those guys that couldn't touch the ball and youth football\nUh so he didn't like football very much so he he stopped playing football after the eighth grade and uh you know decided in the spring of ... spring before his senior year that maybe he'd go out again and gives us football thing a shot\nAnd uh I I'm sure glad he did and uh you know it was a great job by Kojak or you don't find them then they under the radar guy like that or you know coming to me saying hey I've got this a tight end he doesn't play football but he looks like a ...\nAnd um you know we're working extremely hard with him or just to get them up to speed on things a ... you know and he's really soak in it in and being a sponge and and working hard\nBecause he he didn't have much of a football background and like you know he played last year as a senior in high school but he actually played receiver and so he you know and put his hand in the ground since he was a Thirteen Years old so [noise]\nBut he's doing extremely well so proud of his efforts\nAnd I know we've talked more about this story because he's been around a little more but ... another story at a guy who wasn't a Harold at tied into made a bunch of catches didn't really have much of an impact on his office in high school was more highly recruited as a volleyball player than he was as a football player [noise] yeah\nYou know I think when when you look at tight and it's a it's a unique position a you know just because of that size and that skill set a very hard to find\nA you know so when someone you can find one you know if they're great tight end in high school a and plan tight and then they're probably going to be going to uh you know the University of Minnesota or somewhere in the Big Ten so\nIt's definitely something where ah you know we're recruiting tight and they have to count on a on tour never stone and uh and see what you can find and you know you look for you know a camp Jones who was a quarterback\nYou know Dallas Carter who played all over ah\nAnd uh and see what you can find and you know you look for you know a camp Jones who was a quarterback\nYou know Dallas Carter who played all over a ... heart was probably more accomplished track athlete in high school than than football um but you know you look for someone with the tools to develop into a tight and so it definitely makes our job harder though are courting certainly\nDoes the lucky we haven't touched on a detail tell me a little more about Caleb shops\n[noise] you know Kayla came to us as a as a walk on and uh you know he he works extremely hard and um you know it was really playing well and fall camp and then uh you know both scholar dealt with injuries scholar got hurt early and fall camp Caleb got hurt later and fall camp\nUm you know the kind of open the door for for Blake to emerge as well uh you know which is kind of the deal and the sport it's all about durability of but you know he's the guy that I think down the road a could be a contributor for us\nAre enough of a titan standpoint we talk so much last week in the un I game on the air about the three main front compared to the form in ... Illinois state it always play to form in front and now they're showing more of a three man look this year when it comes to a tight end standpoint we know what he does for the office of line but\nHow much does it affect that tight end if they're running three compared to for men and their defense of ... [noise]\nWell it it affects that a lot because uh it basically changes are blocking assignments because instead of having that the end right over you know you've got to a DNA then you're outside and then outside linebacker up on the ball and you're outside so uh it affects things of that and I think that's the thing that we're starting to see\nA you know ... we're talking about it last night you know when when he came to the when he came to us or you know four years ago\nOr most of the teams in the league or just on you know for down front and a lot of coverage for and\nUh now I think just the the multiplicity of the defenses that we're seeing as well um you know we're we're more and more teams are multiple on defense doing a lot of different things are so it's definitely a you know kind of their strategy I guess to catch up to the office with Arpaio's and everything else that often says they're doing now\nBut it's definitely you know making it a a little more work for us as coaches and players are just to make sure that we can go out and execute against multiple different looks\nIt's become so much at that point counterpoint where there are a few teams you know what they're going to do but so much of it is you have to prep for a ton of things 'cause you just don't know what she'll get on a given Saturday beat a defensive coach or now has an offensive coaches la [noise] yeah I mean I think\nAh you know especially the Missouri Valley is just so competitive and teams understand that you know when you have a great quarterback like parent Christian you can't sit back and give them the same looks over and over um you know we found you know last year when we were getting ready to play New Hampshire that\nThey were a great defense but they were very you know on first down they did in first and second down I did this and then on third down they did this are predictable\nAnd they were predictable and even though they had a really good defense or you know I think you saw that we're just able to pick them apart because we knew exactly how they're going to line up and how they would play certain places so\nUh definitely you know defensive and and the Missouri Valley that they do a great job of of switching the looks and again they know with a guy like parents you know we see new things each week you know teams trying to come up with things to slow down\nIt's fascinating to watch the chess game aloof thanks for joining us good luck on Saturday thank you start with us when we come back to head cultural rejoined us the jobs took a liar radio show

he's got a line up again get that out of his mind and\nMake the next block make the next catch whatever that's playing the present you miss a tackle you got to get back in the line and the and and and make the play the winds that game so after the game and we lose we have to play in the present we need to get it to get get\nGet it over with watch the film learn from it and move on and then we preach in life you're going to have some great things in life you're going to have some averse in life get through it learned from it and then live with the president had our guys do a phenomenal job of that\nOr just a curiosity I've gotten the privilege to see the so often over the years 'cause I I travel with you to many games that uh when it comes to a game like that you get on the bus you got a five hour drive back so uh as coaches you jump into the film right away when you get on the bus\nYeah yeah or our coach is a\nHe had had at least a half downloaded on the right path so that great at it on the bus\nAnd then a because our phones wouldn't use their phones you can also watch the whole game because it's the Internet a little hard to great film but you can watch watch the game I download the next opponent and so I was watching uh Illinois state film because I Want to let let it just get get get over it and get home and do it early in the morning Sunday Morning\nAnd then and staff meets when\nWe made to meet with a trainer at two o'clock and me with a special teams of two forty defense after that often so that after\nThat we talked to the game you talk to the words we talk through what we do different we talk through what we did well I'm you know you you know we we hold each other accountable\nUh yeah we grow from it the shame on us if we don't and then we're we're there already into a state or the next opponent and then continue that those guys have worked fall late last night that in early this morning and then tonight will introduce Illinois state or the next opponent as normal week that tonight at about seven thirty\nAnd always taught to bottom before every year we go through this but how valuable members of your staff are and getting all that video from the next opponent into the system it's all labeled and categorized and so anything you need when you're scouting you already have that all ready for you by early Sunday Morning if not before that\nYeah everything but probably the last game that Saturday game and again you're talking about quality control and student coach yelled at\nWork or tires Leslie are getting all this information and getting it matched up with the film and a and a little farther you go down the more games you have to enter a week and then put the the most recent game and it's a it's a it's an unbelievable job\nIt's a thankless job they do a tremendous job with it and again the part of your success has all that stuff or another part of your successes doing these special situations which you highlight each week on the shell thanks to our new segment that you have so literate to lean created known as\nSpecial situations that square that square thank you sorry I didn't get that we could talk about to kick off all the things we practice and kick off\nOne of them were you know you're going to ask me about\nThe surprise on side right so we have two different surprise on side they're not going to talk about both of those we have a check the normal kick off we have kick off after safety kick off after apparently different strategies we have ... lab that's that's what you want to have you on a second seven seconds left on the clock five seven seconds left a\nChase is going to take a field goal approach seasonal end up like he's kicking a field goal we're going to be right at the Y. and he's going to kick a lab and ideally they catch it at the thirty yard line with us standing around them so they get so what's what's left seven seconds to go to the link to the field\nWe have a game when square which happened to North Dakota state a couple of years ago there's two seconds left on the clock so we square about Fifteen Years they pick it up we're right there again they either die down it or try to start or we call hurricane or so\nSo we square about fifty yards they pick it up we're right there again they either don't it or try to start what we call hurricane so those are the two game wins and\nAnd then we have hurricane which means that a rabble ... type of thing a kickoff it's at the end of the game of the ... the return team's going to throw it all over they have to start buying them\nWe do a different we we we practice hurricane defense so we kick off and they start hurricane situations we have one of our guys go behind the ball so it's impossible to throw it back nobody else does that nobody I watched it will still do that so that if it was all over their number five on our left side is going to the balls and the right\nNumber five on the left is going to go behind the ball so you can't throw it back across the field so jokes over spending we do a great job with a again leaving nothing to chance\nThen again I I met some of the other day at a different sector she when we took the penalty on the on the other part she said that was a special situation so this is permeating are a fan\nBase is doing something\nThat's for sure All right we've got more to come if
