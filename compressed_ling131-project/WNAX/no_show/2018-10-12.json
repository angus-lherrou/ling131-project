I Want to mention and ask you for your thoughts and your prayers for our friends and fellow Americans in the state of Florida and the states around it a six people have died as a result of hurricane or the hurricane that hit and a one million people at this hour still without power curfews and in fact hundreds\nOf roads impassable and literally there are some beach front communities that are simply knocked flat by the storm that hit and so you want to you want to think about those people and the way is that this country can help them out or many of them said they didn't leave because they said well this is all I've got I have to stay and protected\nBut when it gets to the end of the day I Would much prefer to see people evacuate save those lives\nAnd yet for such a devastating storm and the amount of damage if you've seen the over flights by drones of these areas\nCommunities just wiped out\nAnd I say that every single human life that was lost his significant all six of them but that is a tremendously better result in this might have been if the same kind of storm it had some other part of the world because you know do you routinely hear about storms like this that take many many lives\nStill and all it would be nice to see more people evacuate leaves a things behind we can replace things we can't replace you but Washington state Supreme Court has decided the capital punishment is racist and arbitrary and therefore today it issued a\nA decision that at least in Washington state under the state constitution which means you can appeal this one to the U.S Supreme Court the capital punishment is unconstitutional that means that the eight people on death row\nOr have now seen their sentences or will be converted from a death sentence to life sentence and I've I've made the point to you before\nThe death penalty deters murder and if you say how do you know that Lars that's just an idea no it's actually backed up by some of the best studies out there and studies done recently and frankly studies that come out of liberal universities\nWhose authors I Would imagine probably would have preferred that the data show something else later many of these college professors would have rather had a study that said oh no the death penalty is completely worthless but the bottom line and if anybody ever wants to get those studies I\nHave a whole list of them and these are from major universities they'd been done relatively recently\nThat there are people um cast son ... who used to work for Obama and who is quite a solid left wing liberal wrote a

be with you on what I like to call conspiracy theory Thursday\nGlad to get your calls to eight six six eight large\nThat's eight six six four three nine five to seven seven emails go to talk of Lars Larson dot com and I always promised to tell you if I have a dog in the fight so I have a dog in this fight because I occasionally by things on Amazon and I find that kind of convenient but his Amazon getting so big that it could literally threaten our economy\nWell Michael Doherty joins me now CEO of the cyber education foundation and founder of the justice society he's\nAlso the author of the devil inside the beltway which we've talked about before Michael welcome back to the program\nTo get it back with you sir I'm doing very well so [noise]\nI like Amazon I Do business with them but I still do business with bricks and mortar stores a lot of other companies why do we know\nIt literally threatens our economy\n[noise] because the little baby tigers are cute and when they get around that kill ya okay that [laughter] I'd rather for tests and and conspiracy theory Thursday step either I'm really by and [laughter] and so I you know look\nIsn't that interesting how he started calling an\nAmazon from the beginning he pulls you and he does what we call loss leaders okay so we get so much money he loses money to undercut everybody else gains market control than you know\nPosed in close enough to slap in the face and now he owns the Washington Post [laughter] so he can control messaging you can trust me it there's\nNo doubt that all bad I mean obviously they have done\nPositive destruction they have challenging but this market dominance and this monopolistic behavior and and how\nBrutal they are a too small business it is it's tough it's [noise] you know uh so it becomes an anti trust level I mean by a large I Love the efficiency that he built in and I I have time also and I like to challenge it's just you know ...\n... businesses will oh opposite says it all up the monopoly that'd be great\nOh yeah well actually I wouldn't because you know Michael I've told I told my audience mild metaphor is not as good as your baby tiger metaphor but I've told them you know if you said what I like to be the only talk show host in America no because having competition sharpens my game and I'm afraid I'd get lazy if I was the only game in town\n[noise] right and in your ear exactly right so why is the founding fathers decentralized power to unify towers bad\nWith human beings that just governments so we have Amazon who now has the ... you know these machines that listen to the last state can understand what's going on and it has data that is now wants to be the only clout for services provider for the military for a decade\nAnd the amount of a market steak corner\nAnd that that state connect between those markets is terrifying\nWhen it's in the military and personal information and and and you know a newspaper in the media it's you know it's not about them it's turning into a true anti trust to play and that's where it's going to go\nWhat has the FCC had the securities and Exchange Commission had anything to say about this because they certainly regulate my industry heavily they tell radio companies you can only own so many radio stations and every marketing we're not going to allow you to become dominant or is it do not big enough yet to to trigger that I ...\nWell of course you know when all anyone cares about the media today as Russia Russia Russia and I can't believe about from President this price we pay because you know\nListen to these big companies you know how fast these guys got huge it's like the movie alien where it's almost a cute in the beginning and then like ten minutes in the movie is ... feet tall so you know and he felt like wait a minute what happened ... park I take companies also learned from Microsoft and the government\nJumped on micro Microsoft so they're they were in Seattle having a nice life and hear Tom's Europe and the U.S now everyone learns that and all\nThem you know Amazon ... lobbying and they've got these beautiful beautiful offices in DC and so it is so this Google and soda states took and they're all break and bread and getting everybody I mean they're not down there protecting their turf and their shareholders so [noise]\nYou know it's um it's a tough situation and we have our problems in our addictions with our Facebook dinner Amazon Prime\nI guess what I worry about it is is this and this is the other worry I have Michael that even if we say well they're too big\nI've got two responses one is you mentioned Sears and Roebuck well ... no longer and they're about to go out of business would seemed\nBut back when Sears first came on the scene they had to be one of the first uh entities that enter the market boys and said\nYou don't have to buy your dung agrees with the local general store you can just drop you know dropping out in the mail and they'll show up you know back to you and I imagine at the time it was probably viewed as pretty darn amazing do say\nUh you know I could be me I can order pots and pans and sheets and blankets and pillows and all that stuff and it'll just magically appear and I've got a lot more choice and you know and maybe a better price and everything else\nSo Sears was kind of revolutionary back in the day I understand that Amazon is is that on steroids\nBut we were you know we're we're concerned at the time I'm sure there were probably concerns of the time that we're going to wipe out the local general store will be didn't\nYou know we have lots of these big retailers in America now and they didn't wipe out the local general store but I'm I guarantee you they had an effect\nThe second concern I have is this um that as we're in a world market place now if we say Amazon we got a break you up into pieces to make sure you don't get too big wheeled China and other countries have the same constraints because remember when it's a worldwide service me a worldwide Internet\nIf you say Amazon can't give big but China can have a you know uh you know can have companies that are that big are we going to see the day where we've knocked down our own Goliath our own Amazon and we've all out all the other countries that don't have the same kind of restraint to do it and now Americans will be buying from them and said\nI can I can buy a small business part because although I saw what they did to\nPublishing [noise] government part\nI I'm a little bit less less empathetic on because you know apple\nApple Amazon and the the rights and the constitution of belief and the human rights\nThings that they just look the other way when they do business than those territories or lead me to believe that if we put our foot down they're not going to go out running we're not going to give our power away and a while they want to practice and do business there they don't necessarily want to be there so [noise]\nUm it it just and this is the topic for discussion and there's no right or wrong answer because they have done a lot of really good innovation and that's good but\nThere's also a lot of crushing going on and when it depends on the swings to find the other direction which I don't think we're totally there yet in most areas\nAh then we've got a problem at but\nYou know these people get so much money they do more profit margins Martin economies that most country yep\nSo we're very careful about this and their interaction with our regulatory 'cause regulatory and the Senate and the country is is pretty lousy how we all all care about them for some of the United states not education and the regulars and his lawyers with a lawsuit to ...\nThey're they're a joke and they want jobs that those companies later so it's it's tough holding them accountable that's why I think the ... the only place to go and I'm Wondering what the the the judicial system or not they'll handle it off\nI just worry that some day we'll have the Chinese equivalent of Amazon selling to us and it'll all come in and big shipping containers and say remember when we used to be able to buy from an American company called Amazon and now we're going from you know a big company in China unless we could figure out a way to say you can't sell\nTo our marketplace which so far we have not done Michael Doherty is the author of the devil inside the beltway the shocking expose a of the U.S government surveillance and overreach into cyber security medicine in small business Michael it's a pleasure to have you on the program\nIt off he took no for an answer who cares if he whipped it out to an underlying as governor of the state so maybe we can at least get Gloria Steinem under oath to explain why\nUm it has disqualifying for a drunken college freshmen and do that something I don't think anyone believes Brett Kavanaugh ever did and there's certainly no corroboration evidence witnesses or contemporaneous statements to back it up a book but in theory what the accusation was something that it's\nJust qualifying for college freshmen to do but hey okay for a governor a of a state in the United states to do and\nI'm the first accuser the one who's um testimony was\nWhat was supposed to be believable because people watched her and wow she sure look credible to me\nUm but hadn't mentioned it to anyone for Thirty years\nAnd what do you do when no one backed it up at me and what about that front door she claims you had a front door because two front doors because the trauma everyone looked at at the house\nThis is a very expensive neighborhood she lives in\nUm ... said that she rent they rent out in an apartment in Google employees or interns as she called them I think those interns are paying a pretty penny for that that isn't a front door to her house it seems perfectly clear that is a door to a rental apartment\nThat's a lie under oath or fear of flying um that certainly seems to be to be false and as much as ... jets all over the globe to go surfing\nWho paid for the for the polygraph all I guess she corrected that one about whether she'd ever coached anyone on a polygraph or live in six here ex boyfriend\nSays that he was present when she was coaching one of her friends on how to take a polygraph something she was asked about under oath denied um you know the next\nThe next hearing 'em the next Supreme Court justice to go and and be replaced and I have a few guesses about who that might be um it's it's going to be it's going to be an absolute disable make Kavanaugh look like a day at the beach\nAnd what the thinking I mean I'm just to some extent using prosecutors and during the more local cases are afraid to do this for fear of being accused by the meat to crowd you're attacking women know you're attacking a liar you're attacking a bright dreamer so so what will it take\nTo get those people to get a backbone and say we will go after every truly guilty sex offender in America but if you lie and try to fulfill your ... somebody you too will face consequences\nNow in fact I think they should face the consequences of what they were accusing the other person of um false accusations of rape have sense have sent innocent men to prison I'm while I'm there's gotta be some some repercussions for that\nWell and and but where do you see the venue for being able to do I mean I'd like to do it but how do we do it I mean do you put pressure on the local prosecutor who's got the call it's not often as often going to be a federal cases a local craze so how do we get this to change to where we we said this is part of taking users way\nThat we take your ... your true accusation so seriously that when we find a full one where I drew equally hard\nHow do we get that dynamic to shift because right now I think most prosecutors would rather do anything in the war in and go after a folder user\nYes and as you indicate it's out or mad idea oh we don't want to discourage false accusers from coming forward no actually we do want to discourage that we don't want people's lives being real and\nUm but you're right there's this feeling that you're going against actual rape victims um if you go after false accusers of rape um there's a there's a movie out now about Brian Banks at an eight day\nI'm really bright had a bright future when he was falsely accused of rape in highschool served five years in prison\nUm God out in his accuser called and I apologize to them and said she made it up I guess he got it on tape he got the conviction or race they made a movie about it but unfortunately it came out in the middle of the Kavanaugh hearings\nSo it's gotten a zero press that's this guy Brian Banks I tweeted a review of the movie on yesterday I'm but I'm dying to see it I've just I've just read the review um think of it this guy's life ...\nI mean it's a horrible horrible thing that's being done and there should be consequences for it\nWell I'm going to do this and the next time I talked to any politician either side there I'll I'm undecided them would you like to see us go after the faults accusers justice as ... as tough as we go after those who are making a legitimate one her latest book\nIs called resistance is futile how the Trump painting left lost its collective mind and thank you so much for the time the largest but I talk to

one of those ... things for me is the extent to which the Democratic party seems to have fallen to pieces they've lost\nAnd a good game about how the midterms are going to be there whether they're going to win in the midterms\nAnd then they pull off a stunt like the false accusations against Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh and that is starting to work against them so now they've decided to go rogue embracing violence of lawless behavior saying when they go high or when we when they go low will kick 'em\nA road runner McDaniel joins us now is chair of the Republican National committee it's good to have you back on the program\nIt's great to be here thanks for having me\nI Am thrilled to have you on the program I just want to know what is the best way for Republicans to respond to this when some of the top figures in the Democratic party are actually out openly inciting violence there doing it on camera there doing it quoted in major media\nThan so apparently they're not afraid to say when we don't get the result we want we're we're going to go out and engage in violence and we're going to incite other people's to commit violence and all of this not too terribly long after Congress in Steve's college very nearly lost his life\nBecause the left he decided to try and slaughter a group of Republicans on a baseball field do they know what they're doing and and do they understand how the American people are probably going to respond to this\nSchool it's a very dangerous path that the Democrat leadership\nUh is putting their party on and it's a dangerous for our country when you hear Eric Holder said when they go low kick 'em\nCory Booker saying get in their face Maxine Waters saying get crowds around people something's gonna happen we already had ... got shot we've already seen crowds on around Ted Cruz and chairs standards and other cabinet members\nBut this is not what we want for our country and I think Americans are living it doesn't say it that\nDemocrats not just regular average people this is the leaders of their party advocating for that and I think Hillary Clinton what she said it's so remarkable it's a seismic shift in our democracy for her to say we will not be civil\nUnless we're in power threatening thing to say it is not simple unless we're in power\nThrown at you know what it reminded me of it reminded me of standing in the grocery store watching some poor mom deal the four year old and the serial Iowa who's decided usually it's a little boy who started stamping his feet and screaming at the top of his lungs and he's not going to be civil till the captain crunch goes into the grocery basket and and it's the behavior you\nKind of expect from some kids who are poorly raised is not the kind of behavior you expect from top members of the Democratic party saying we're going to continue to be ... in civil I'm not sure which one is probably an civil or until you give us power back and we're going to scream and yell and and probably\nSome people do they understand that the next time God Forbid but we did it almost seems inevitable that someone does get hurt or somebody does carry on a real active of violence\nThat they're going to catch the blame on this\n[noise] I think so and I I think they're they're playing their cars in a way that they're hoping will engage their faith and turn them out and felt angry division I mean with the Democrats have run occupation for a long time\nBut this is a new low for their party and it's frightening for our country we've already seen some instances that\nAre frightening with these college we've seen our senator having have security details this is not something we want long term for our country and the Democrats need to be called out and I'm saying is that chair when the Republican Party I don't want you to go get Democrat faces I don't like it they'll interrupt their family dinners or ... miles around them what you should do is go out\nGo get involved and make a difference ... stand up for that and ... and but we can do it in a civil way and that is the greatness of our\nCountry and Democrat leaders need to be called out and I hope that the voters are looking at this because the only way we show the Democrats that they lose that this message is by them living in these terms the only way we bring back stability to Washington is if we were jak\nPlaybook that they've been riding on his temper tantrum that they've got drunk for two years now\nRock can I I Want to suggest something do I do this every time you're on I'd put a bug in Europe and I ... I don't know if it's you know if you if it's worth what it costs you love to put it that way\nBut I Would love to see since I Know the mainstream media will not do the thing they should do which is go to democratic leaders leaders and say will you condemn these calls for violence now\nI compared the other night I was in Seattle for a vote for him but you know a panel with a bunch of other tacos from one of my ... and somebody said you know should we go out and let's go out and have some big protests I said it's never been the style of Republicans or conservatives especially to do that you have\nNice family friendly gatherings like the Tea Party that leaves the landscape cleaner than when they arrived we just don't do things that way they do and that's not just one of these where I'm trying to say on our side doesn't we don't\nYou know I as you can name any number of instances of left wing violence you don't see it from the right\nBut because the media won't call them out and I'm Talking about individual reporters\nCan we get Republican officeholders and Republican office seekers to start demanding I mean the president is is you know understands that when you push the buttons of media\nIf we saw some Republican stand up in front of a crowd of reporters whenever they're holding a an event of some kind words covered and say why aren't you folks asking for condemnation of this because I Will condemn it tonight\nAnd if it if the Republican men and women are in office and seeking office would start demanding that\nI think the media can only be ignoring so long and then they'll have to acknowledge well maybe we do need to go to Larry Clinton and say you just you just try to incentivize violence why are you not condemning violence because ordinarily\nThat sort of the you know to go to for the Democrats in this case they should be uh I I think we should hold their feet to the fire\n[noise] I agree and and we just put together a video that was released today shelling some of these ... that have been created a along with the words of the Democrat leader as we are definitely trying to hold Democrats accountable and you're right immediate needs to do it and we need to help\nPush the media to act in a way that they don't always do because we know if it were a Republican who is that these things they'd be all over us so\nWe're going to continue to set an example of stability we're going to continue to run out of the issues the results that have happened to the medication that has made life better for millions of Americans\nStraight quite set up ... percent unemployment for a million jobs wait is that so many great things are happening across this country and legal contrast that with the resistance\nAnd the division and the destructive nature the the Democrat Party and hopefully a November sex the voters will reject this terrible terrible a message that Democrats continue to\nBecause you remember back to the beginning of the campaign when President Trump then candidate Trump would go to various venues and he was in generating gigantic crowds and I can't remember who was Cleveland or another city where they literally had to shut the event down because of the folks who came in as interlopers intending only to cause trouble\nAnd and when the president responded I think there were a couple of times what does a candidate he said throw that guy out or ... you know things like that and they were at the media was all over oh my God are you in are you inciting violence or you endorsing violence\nThey they they will do that as you say if it's a Republican who does it a conservative who says something if I took to the air and said let's go out the streets and burns and things like antifa does which I Would never do\nA you know the ... that would be condemned quickly\nSo if the media won't if individual reporters won't do it on their own\nI think we should get our candidates to search shaming them into it why aren't you asking the other side to ask you folks who are seeking reelection governor Kate Brown and the state where I broadcast\nAsk her are you willing to condemn these kinds of tactics and the statements of Eric Holder when they go low let's kick up will you condemn that and if you want why not I think it might be affected Ronan\nAt to this place and would be eating breakfast cereal in the room with the people were doing these procedures I mean this was an extraordinary thing the bodies were piled up by the way in the basement you know and the body for piled up in the refrigerator same place where people have to peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and that wasn't newsworthy that wasn't newsworthy in America you know you know ...\n... talk ... who's written a book about gods now the two specific things and I think to conservatives these issues are familiar that kept the media way one it involved abortion although\nNot abortion the way it is done legally and rights but done Mars or a slaughterhouse and I don't think I'm over reaching out to\n... now is black yeah\nIt's funny actually funny somebody just wrote to me and said to me are you worried about being called racist I was working on this story from St nearly two years before I realized with black\nYou just knew the name I just you know I met him I mean I met him I Know I never noticed he was black and I ... that might sound weird to people what it's like the least interesting thing about him like I literally didn't taking notes of of the color of skin because it's like\nHere's the Seventy two year old doctor who delivered baby alive and then cut the next what scissors and it's like somebody said to me you know he's black and I went oh God yeah he is actually but I ... we had never thought of\nI mean and I'm telling you the God's honest with my husband and I neither of us knew what to say that black no so me about this\nThe most interesting thing I think about your participation ... you got a chance to sit for three hours and talk to this man in person for you in the same room where you through glass\nNo I was in the same room and I mean I was wondering I'm like yeah well not good because I expected to have the glass I thought we were going to have the protection of the Plexiglas in fact actually we're in this kind of coffee lounges\nWhere he had you know very free reign he was allowed to even move his chair and what he did was he came in I was backed up against the door against ah against the wall and he pushed his share opened his legs and kind of you know trapped me between his legs if you know what I mean I had my legs crossed\nAnd then continuously touched my my my knee as he would make points on sorry once I'm terribly sorry\nAnd he was like you know kind of electric kind of character he has this unless Lewis voice the soft voice\nHe smiles all the time kind of laugh you know and here he is he's serving three life sentences talks about you know it was an awful shame he didn't get into the poetry class\nAnd and that he's reading the Koran in two different versions two different translations 'cause he's just thoroughly like this\nAnd you know he's getting to play a lot of music which is great you know when he listens to a lot of music and he really likes reading and hasn't been able to read because he thinks so busy all these years but you get in to read true crime which he really enjoys I mean you're sitting there and he by the way he sang to me twice in the middle of the CIA because he was sort of talking about music and then he said you know all you know when I\nStarted listening to jak browse you know ... and every now and again during the three hours he would do the brain free thing where he'd say what's the name what's the name\nAnd I love ... by the way the ... crew in her who died you I bet a lot of your listeners will know having a big smoker and I think he just basically smoked himself to death\nBut I had this incredible voice I'm an ... looking at me saying what's the name what's the what's the name of that song doubling the famous one and I'm sitting there thinking do I tell them do I tell them and then ... and then of course I say you know kind of through clenched teeth Nikki ... and then he leans right and I mean 'cause\nI mean the key to it and start singing the song basically don't ever leave me you know it's like are you serious is this what's happening right now yeah so that it has\nNo sense of what he's done or or the reaction that most people would have if you just generically told the story I mean even left out the door but just said he murdered a couple of ... and does anyone know for certain how many babies were put to death by by having their spines pursue\nAccording to the grand jury you know which I think you know if you think of how long they stop what this hard evidence they said ... that and that is why exactly as you said in your introduction it is very safe to say he's America's biggest serial killer and you know John Wayne gave the Ted Bundy facility I cannot all of them combined come nowhere near that this guy and you know\nThe reason he's not on the list of the most prolific serial killers in America and the only reason\nIs because you'd have to acknowledge the humanity of those children and that is something that we want to do we want to make sure he got stopped title because these were human beings I've seen the photographs of them I can tell you these are these are children who made the world will never now no and we need to acknowledge them and be a you know be

to you [noise]\n[noise] hello and thanks for having me again always a pleasure to be back here and\nThe situation with with regard to the tunnel you spoke about yes there was another time oh this was

meters inside Israel and violating Israeli territory very clear what her mother was trying to do to deliver\nVery inside Israel and to try to evade our defenses but them\nAs we have done fourteen times in the past in the last eight months we were able to detect it and destroy it this time we destroyed the from the ground\nAnd the important parts was perhaps but we saw the fifth time Hamas tried to use different feeding techniques and a few other things\nPerhaps in order to try to evade our counter tunnel efforts but that wasn't successful for them and we are how could they say that yet another attempt\nTo find Hamas and quite a lot of money spent by Hamas by the way in and\nIt was it was for the civilians around Gaza Strip or said\nWhat are you in Iraq Today Jonathan yeah\nToday a according to all the ... months will be what we would call a regular day of the violent riots\nThere will be a participation in a thousand perhaps between a ten Fifteen thousand of opinion will come in to six regular locations they will throw IDs written aids stones\nAt five bombs and the ... role burning tires tools and so they will try with ever what ever they have in order to infiltrate into Israel\nRuin secure at the infrastructure and terrorize Israeli civilians ... we've been dealing with every Friday now it's friday number twenty six\nAnd ... and counting and uh so that's what's in store and the idea is ready and prepared than we are not going to let anyone in this time either and we are defending our communities which are just a few hundreds of meters away from the fence for us it's very clear what what's we have to do their\nFather protesters dissing each friday and are they compensated by the by the Hamas and others for for their thing you've shown how this is an organized effort putting ... billion to ... trying to draw a fire on to them trying to penetrate the budget is at the same people\nUse it to is it is it because people are are compensated and and forced to come out\nHere to there say management and I'm I've been astray shouldn't here say Hamas government says\nThere's a daily schedule and daily locations uh of of riots we've for instance that on Mondays those always a naval riot or naval attempts to penetrate into his role in the same location every Monday and every Friday\nThere all the five permanent locations where they come we definitely see they even just now established Hummer established a website which fought this comes in the riots claim that they're a so called benefits\nAnd it's been report that even in a British media\nImagine that that the uh on the fence are paid for participation\nAnd a double price if there was a few hundred dollars and if they are killed during the riots which come out actively seeks to happen if there are killed and their family is given the around a thousand five hundred dollars\nViewers are launches the response of the IDF changed over time as well [noise]\nWell the rules of engagement have not changed we the basics of the situation is that they're trying to get into Israel and to threat than the Israeli civilians and communities and we are not going to let them\nOr we of course have adapted we have tried different or less lethal means\nIn order to stop people without killing them\nAnd some of them have been successful some of them have been lifted says full so there was an evolution there as well but the basics of the situation but they they unfortunately remain the same ... is sending forward\nWhat appears to be civilians award are made to look like Soviet the ... you know the three and portray into Israel and we are stopping them and protecting ourselves\nOn the way we go quickly yeah the other border too many borders the little times John would say um could you comment on

attack momentarily are they building up to a crisis we just have thirty seconds [noise] I think\nDifferently they're trying to maintain a crisis I said not necessarily building up to that they know that as long as they don't fire rockets\nThe international media will sing their praise and promote their cause we've seen them fodder and huh but that didn't go very well and we understand what

Perry hard warns against our cultures devaluation of life urges us to see ourselves and others as precious people created by God redeem by Christ this week on\nIt's hard to put yourself and to put our listeners in the framework of what was going on then versus what's going on now but what was going on then if you recall is\nThe Trump Administration was trying still to get up and running it was trying to get its own appointees in place which is in large measure are still has not happened at the Justice Department but I I Want to underscore at a time when it was very difficult\nFor Trump's nominees to get confirmed and get to work in the various agencies that the executive branch because it was so much resistance in opposition to Trump Rod Rosenstein was ... and from by a vote of Ninety four to six with overwhelming democratic support\nAnd when he wrote the call me ma'am oh he was bitterly criticized by Democrats and I believe it was the first time in his life anything like that had happened and a lot of what happened in those eight days as a reaction of destroyed reaction to that criticism\nThe puzzle here and is this could all be cleared up with ... contemporary notes that we're told exists the memos banker and page and McCain are all professionals and when they have a meeting with the department of justice especially a man who's putative lay in charge of the department\nOf justice because the attorney general is recused himself from many of these matters [noise]\nThat they would keep notes afterwards those notes are being taught by Congress Rosen staying at at the reporting in that rose insane is not passing them to Congress nor is frozen St appearing\nI call upon your understanding of the department of justice defying a the capital in this ... this is something that justice can I can to itself explain indefinitely [noise]\nThink there's one person who can decide that John and that's the president\nAnd and let me explain why I think that so um you're quite right that if all that information were put out that is all this this written work product that whatever was a done contemporaneously to memorialize these conversations that would clear up\nThe mystery that we're discussing the problem of course is that not everybody has a motive to see that cleared up publicly there may be a number of people who do but I think there's a number of people don't and I fear\nMr Rosenstein may be one of them and the reason that that is significant is that if he's left to his own devices\nAre in terms of whether this ever gets disclosed or not what I assumed he would be saying is that because these are discussions between him himself that is the deputy attorney general\nAnd the chief counsel to the FBI and someone like Lisa Page was also an ... an attorney for the FBI the\nOnly person that can break that log log jam or is the president because these these ah executive privileges belong to him or to the extent as any attorney client privilege here\nAh I I I doubt there is but to the extent there is it belongs to the president if there's any executive privilege it belongs in President if there's any deliberative process privilege which is also a a component of executive privilege it belongs to the president\nSo I think until the president decides to waive all that and say put the information out I Would think that Rosenstein would it be taking the position that these are things that can be withheld and don't need to be disclosed to Congress\nThaddeus [laughter] Andy mirror question whether these accusations about him are true or not and you're right out of ground requirement may be controlled and scarred why are they coming out now [noise]\nI think that he is because Baker agreed to give a interview to the committee I Am [laughter] you know in the Trump in the Trump or news cycle\nEverything so jumps together that I Can't remember now at this point if that was two weeks ago or one week ago but I Believe\nIt's probably a function of the fact that as we heard and we haven't seen transcripts or anything but as we've heard\nLisa Page testified some weeks back and according to people from the committee who talk and I should say we should underscore here they didn't leak her testimony but they did make an observation that she was very she seemed to be forthcoming in cooperative we have\nAnswered all the questions since the quote Andy answered all the class I\nWrite I'm ... now sometimes of course John answering all the questions doesn't necessarily mean that somebody's being cooperative but my understanding of the way that was described as of this pages testimony or is that that was the case that she answered all the questions\nIn a good faith way that where she was trying to see if we ever get to see the interview notes the transcript and then Baker who I should underscore here\nUm that has a very fine reputation in terms of ah ah his his um integrity and in sports right now is um you can disagree with judgment calls but uh uh you know in terms of calling a spade a spade my understanding is that Baker has always been pretty\nUpright or he gave\nThey uh he gave an interview to the committee a

weather\nAnd a continued wet weather in fact a northwest Iowa and seen a lot of moisture as well north central I Will probably seen the most but quite a bit of northwest Iowa according to Iowa State university extension field the ground them as Joel the young\nI think we're a little bit by normal if you want to compare this year to lots of other years as far as what our progress has been at this stage of the game I think the soybean crop as a definitely liking what we would consider to be normal right now\nUm but you know we if we can just straighten this weather out and get some opportunities that we could still be done harvesting in a fairly timely basis but we've got some real challenge just\nA you know there's lots of areas where they're still stay in the water and and other things and and getting that dried out so we can get in the fields were pretty critical for us as we move forward\nIs going to take at least a couple of days a good drying to be able to have that happen you think or what what's your best guess\nWell it depends on the drainage of the soil I think some of these fields a couple of days might be a realistic number so that we can get it dry enough to be out there working we've got others that maybe report drainage it might take significantly longer so\nUm you know it's it's a field by field basis or we're always concerned about when we've got that much water and how much compassion and we're going to cause a which creates a long term problems but yet we still have a crop you want to get out of the field and it's not getting any better sitting there in the white conditions in the field so we'd like to get it out\nAnd absolutely what uh now I'm Guy ... you know obviously you know delays are not good for anybody how does it compared to past here's you say we're a little bit binder\n[laughter] yeah I think if you actually look at the crop report progress it's got us just a little behind um a few days behind normal um compared to what our expectations were the first of September a you know our crops getting pretty mature kind of earlier than normal ah we were thinking by now we'd have a lot of the crop harvested and we've\nProbably well under twenty percent of the crop harvested if you look at all northwest Iowa so\nI'm are shorter term expectations were much higher or the long term multiyear expectation and we're just a little behind what we've done ... years so it so um but it's that short term remember and and your hopes was to have it done by now in many cases\nSure now well how long can these guys are forward to to wait on this thing I mean obviously there right at the mercy of the weather but how long before it becomes a real problem when we started talking about the ... and for us and in in in that type of stuff\nWhile you know I think perhaps if we froze up they might give us some advantage do you know kind of get some for a missile that ground and and we could maybe be out there are a little quicker if we had it froze and then we can keep it frozen but\nOf course it brings drawbacks to those that want to inject some Menorah and do some other things so it's always a mixed bag\nA but you know we have a lot of these fields were seeing stock quality of cornfields started deteriorate I'm I'm a little concerned about whether these being pilots are gonna start popping open more frequently as we start drying out before we get the being harvested so\nUm you know we want those stocks and roasted or break down by the next spring but we don't have an off switch in that process started already so or the ability to hold it off the ground is is getting a little worse all the time too\nAnd we want to be cautious whenever we do get out there in into the harvest because sometimes

use the freelance so absolutely free by state generator gets herself anyway enough of a commercial uh it was only about a hundred and twenty miles away\nAnd so they made the trip to see if uh their youngest son Christian he was a baby when his grandpa Virgil died a but he got to drive that tractor oh maybe old four thousand now [noise]\nUm that's pretty cool the owner he was not willing to sell it to the sweats okay so I maybe I you know he bought it he he bought it from a guy who uh a guy at church had had purchased it and it was kind of a let's see here or a guy at church he said his dad had purchased it\nOn sale near Utica\nA so so that's kind of how they saw they figured it out in the serial numbers math so there you go\nThey they have pictures of it in the now the least they know where it is right and who knows maybe I'll sell it to themselves you know a visitation rights if nothing else and I think I guess [laughter] so that's kind of a cool story that's going to need that a

phones\nOr ... got to have a little uh elbow room right to get on either side\nYeah well we can get you know you can get six if there is there a march a shoulder to shoulder you know and then a lot of it depends on you know you go to a parade anywhere and you'll have a street that's twenty feet wide you'll have one that's you know twelve feet wide so you really\nAre a lot of bands are kind of used to adjusting and they'll fill the whole thing up they'll find the middle and they'll spread out you know coming across it will be a little tight but it'll be an experience I don't think anybody has really done or we've got a parade that's spanning two states that kind of sounds cool\nDisney yeah now you have a lower the lower portion or the upper portion\nWe're doing the lower part bass drum players really wouldn't appreciate going over the top\nHell yeah [laughter] for those who haven't been a part of the culture and me being a band geek as a whole lifestyle when do you think about yeah and parents and band families and for those who who don't who haven't been around it what\nIs the attraction of of marching band and being part of this whole culture that is the band geek [laughter]\nWell you know you're talking to a serious ban geek so we have to you have to kind of go back to the beginning you know everybody loves music and I've I've only run across a few people that really don't have a connection to music believe it or not and then it's been mind boggling but if you go back far enough\nTo you know you love music and everybody's got to a different style that they like\nSo you start you know your your path like in fourth grade or fifth grade either orchestra or banned a choir even earlier than that you you have a love for music and then something happens and it depends on whether you're a ... in order to serve band but somewhere along the line it turns into work\nAnd that that's a big deal and a lot of us when you get into the depths of what it takes\nTo even be moderately proficient at your instrument by the time you have\nThe time and effort and expense put into it you really have made a connection to it and that's kind of when the band geek is born like this thing has\nHas been something that's a part of me part of a honestly part of my soul and so I'm going to dive into it and then that's where you you start the jargon you know they um they're all the music terms and when you get big you know if you have a guitar you have an accent and just start to [noise] to\nDevelop this whole culture like you said\nAnd as time goes on you know you find out that there are actually other people that enjoy it like you do you know and and communicating back and forth until finally year end ensemble of some kind whether it be the marching band contraband rock band folk band\nYou find that there are people that are just like you and there's there's the connection that that makes it hard work really really pay off it's like yeah\nThis is this is something that the part of me and these people are the same and marching band you know when you put all the elements together you know you've got music you've got a lot of physical activity and then you've got art that you put into it there's so many elements\nThat even Alan ... dance when you think about it yes\nAbsolutely dance color you know you start and stop it's there's a lot to look at there's a lot to like to see a lot to do\nAnd then we ended Haitian that goes into it I mean 'cause 'cause your kids start marching what like at the beginning of August and the hottest of hot weather and um and with the dedication that really can only be matched by probably the athletes that are playing on Friday nights\nI truly believe that I really really do we actually we actually started in June but I don't know if we want to remind them of\nThat and the planning for the marching show actually starts a day after the indoor show we we get together a little groups and say All right what are we going to do now you know because it it takes a while to put it together right\nWell there's things kind of like game day 'cause I was uh I play the bass drum and I just remember the precision too is is a point of pride I think for a marching band so really you know how strict can you get your Rosen and and and just\nYou know while the crowd because it's kinda fun marching past a block after block but I remember I used to tape up man I take my fingers 'cause I did I played the bass drum and and you know a bloody ... at the end of a of a parade but there was a it was a blast\nYou know what your precision it's almost like the last big hurdle you can get the music you can get the marching but the position is always the the last thing the comments the biggest stretch for everybody\nAll right so a great Saturday a when is the the so the parade is free and it's a one time tomorrow to\nThe parade starts at nine it's going to take a little while to get there because we've got to get across the bridge but earlier the parade route itself comes up across the bridge and across the\nUh the plaza there the fountain plaza we take a right to on\nSecond street and we're going to pick up a bunch of classic cars there we talked to Julie Fisher of bragging rights and we're going to grab a bunch of a classic cars and show cars to put it between the bans for a little bit of spacing because when they get to the judges you know you got to have a little bit of space and we got to have something in there to\nTo look at and to enjoy so then we go over to Douglas take a left kind of is exact and finally when we get on third street we take a right and that's where all the action happens ... going to be there\nSomewhere and we're going to stop it and get the bans a reset and then they had end of the judges area where they get a ... and and performance for ratings\nAnd then the crane young words you can ah that's ah you need to pay was it five bucks and that goes to ban boosters which is a you know it's pretty cool\nYeah five dollars to get in and there's a program that for five dollars also [noise] and yeah it did go to the van boosters which helps fund music scholarships a senior scholarships for cars going on and music and also helps to do a lot of funding for the marching band like get some staff as well\nAll right all happening I'm All right here in ... thanks for taking time out of your day how did your did go there a up at the high school\nMarvelous everybody's in a good mood today 'cause they're really high to got pep band tonight we got our our festival tomorrow and then we had to orange city tomorrow night so everybody's just diving in head first\n[laughter] so I have a question really by by the time you were in high school in band I just remember my middle school band teacher all he did the mist poor Mr your day we thought he was going to have a heart attack and read it because all they did was yeah 'cause you know we're middle school kids and we have things that make noise and it's like he'd be screaming at us to get going I mean are they a little more discipline than high school\nYou know we can do what we have our days that way everybody has their days\nHave a great weekend have a good time to borrow\nThank you so much for the uh\nAll right so that's happening tomorrow is for you want something to do on a Saturday come on and the yanks and\nAnd uh check out the ... we don't you don't often have that many bands in a parade I mean the riverboat days parade is great but it's in the you know it's an August and in the ... they're not they're not brutal practicing ... they're not in school so uh that's so that's going on tomorrow\nOr anything to hide I Know Todd Todd's a public good guy yeah he uh and he loves it he has a good time so there you go\nAnd the kids to get their reward to we we used to do a show the last game of the year last home games\nAnd they would do the halftime show the regular halftime show and then we would spend the entire second half of the football game or putting stringing lights on the band members\nAll kinds of ah you know flashing lights and battery operated staff and gloves and then you name it\nAnd then after the game was over they would turn off all the stadium lights and they do the same halftime show in the dark all those kind of fun and then they yeah hey it was a blast we always had a good and you could see they actually used it as as a a assessment tool because\nThey would video and you could see the precision or non precision in the band just by the lights yeah\nKobe that me and that the kids and and they work really really hard but they do have a lot of fun and that's why the kids keep doing band\nSo there you go for twenty seven and five Seventy ...

people are very uh there are some people that are very they I've seen I've seen the story that yeah a ... that there is so low a opposed and so about a two to Donald Trump in ... and there are those rebel and their lives you know\nI Will say I've been married to my current wife through presidents of both parties and medical landscape has never affected our relationship here\nFor now thanks for

like I like it do for your problems or [laughter] now I have a great thanks for calling in to your right\nOut of a here on South Dakota and that's great and and uh yeah no I've seen that I've seen that story I mean some people are more delicate than others and and just have and I'm not\nAnd I think I mean I think in in some respects it it is a it's\nThat's the case I mean some people can be affected by all sorts of things and and people deal with stress in different ways and I know I don't doubt that some people I mean I really that are passionate about\nWell you know whatever not liking a President Trump or not liking or what's going on and so it's affecting\nThough I Will admit this and that is there was a time in my life where I may be was a little more passionate about it mhm\nYour line is that whatever happens in Washington\nDoesn't really affect my life here in any significant way you know there may be some small thing maybe my paychecks a little bigger a little smaller because of tax policy or whatever but for the most part it has zero impact on my life and zero impact absolutely on my happiness\n[noise] and so even though I can part yeah yeah but the\nSecond part especially absolutely zero impact on my happiness and my happiness with my family and and so\nYou know I don't think you should be more concerned either way a politically as much as you used to be\nI Know that I'm not I'd still vote no I yeah I still care enough to be informed but it doesn't it doesn't affect me in any emotional way the way it did at one time\nOr do you believe that I mean what are the things they were talking about what we were talking about a a a climate change or the the morning show was talking about climate change today and that eh it's not really going to affect us\nOr possibly our children are and so nobody nobody's going to worry about it until something catastrophic happens then it's like oh whoops I guess we should have been doing this or doing that I get\nThat but but if if you look back in your history books to Seventeen hundred somewhere in the many ice age and and the the media at that time was talking about the year without a summer in New England you know around the time of revolution\nI'm climate the only thing constant about climate as it is changing and so I don't know how much of that we have anything to do with\nI saw an article about a decade ago and the farmers' almanac and I know the farmers' almanac isn't real science\nBut well but there are some real science in it um and they said that actually in a general term if we don't you know if it doesn't go if the change doesn't go overboard a warmer planet in general is a healthier planet\n... because you have more people die from freezing conditions and die from a heat wave ...\nDo and so on an ice age are in on it but it\nBut also not just climate the not just a type but any don't financially ... as long as we're just ... moving along nicely enough where nobody's rock the boat too much it is people tend to maybe not\nBecome a gauge didn't something unless it really affects you personally\nYou know unless I'm a day trader the fact that the stock market tumbled two days in a row [noise]\nNot that big a deal but at some point the it'll trickle down effect you perhaps I you know perhaps some effect you know but you and I we don't make enough money

did advanced but some policy\nOut of the house obviously the Senate has not taken that up yet but it speaks to the larger issue of how how can we get Americans to feel more empowered to plan for their financial future and a growing economy right now is a great launch pad\nSmith says giving more flexibility and retirement plans would encourage taxpayers to save more since they would be able to

with him go to Mike them are\nOn the victory in Philly\nYou guys started fast food into despite the ... go the other one passed balance early was good that was that the plan yeah we we we\nNeeded to try to run the boss I'm against them you know there there were one of the uh they were the best in the league and in stopping the run but uh you know you still have to continue to\nTo make them I'm not one dimensional or were you you know they can just he often and commit to quarterback week so I thought we did a good job there we went down the field they're scored a we've got to screen out on defense um you know no ... this week so that was that was a good thing\nIf you are you you said Monday you know regarding Dan Bailey you never talk to kick her during games when do you talk to them ever yeah I talked\nTo him or during practice a you know come up yet but it's it's not you know I'm not an expert on kicking obviously but ah you know they're\nThey're good people and their ... you know they come out here and they work real hard and you know Dan Dan honestly you know I watch them in practice he's he's calm and collected and ah you know when he missed a you know I didn't think about it very much you know it you know like you always say you know let's put this one kid or something like\nThat it wasn't like no oh no not again no\nNot really um you know we've we've had our fair share those and but I I I really believe one hundred percent this guy\nKicking is so mental what now not necessarily with the kicker the punter but what do you have an approach with special teams coaches as to the way they handle ...\nNo not really going to let them do their thing let them do their thing yeah Mike Zimmer writes his nose in the Vikings radio network you you guys are throwing Seventy five percent of the time not just through five games do you think that can sustain because the passing games obviously very good\nYeah the past and gave him an excellent um but we ... we need to you know get a little bit more balance um you know hopefully we can get some runs going this\nWell help some of the some of the things that we can do um 'cause I I did notice that this week with the ... passes because we had a few runs in their ... action passes a were more effective yeah and uh you know that's part of it and say if you look at the league now the\nThe way the league is right now everybody's playing an extra guy in a box or playing single high you know they're trying to get the runs stopped in the more that you can run the ball into that and you can play action passed it is very difficult for linebacker ... second\nYou know passing percentages for teams are up all over the NFL was Seventy five year but should the um you know you you have three specifically or having phenomenal seasons two receivers on a quarterback so pros approving unstoppable why change\nBut I just think it gives the opportunity free you know the the offensive line need to have ... says the county where they're not going backwards all the time too so that part of it um you know you can get them on their heels a little bit you know you get some good runs in there and physicality\nAnd hit the end of the day this is still a physical football you know physical game and I'm the more that we can\nUse that to a\nBand are will you know versus the opponents I think that's a good thing\nYou know I I Know it got a little dicey waiting there was an onsite jak but in my opinion it was a professional ... and it was kept professionally by the fact that you didn't run it at the end of the clock the way you want to ... is that an eleven and I think he had a key five and they're too\nYeah and um you know we did that a Green Bay where we're getting down there to kick the field goal when for a ... actually the tiny game but um [noise] you know the same thing and you know all that stuff looks good but at the end of the game or to put the game where you got a room and\nFootball and not to not trying to be coffee with Theo an index here but you know and watching some things back are are are they so good right well period but off the wind and running the route that you're able to eight men protect put you out in in the patterns and get done what you want\nSo that helps and some of it uh\nYou know again a lot of people playing single high so they're not really working on\nA plane in the shell coverage is where\nI'm you know there's there's extra guys on guys are and some and when they do that opens up the running game but yeah they're very good at and and the other part about the play action is when you're blocking seven and eight guys you know it's it's good for your protection as well so those are all combinations of\nTrying to incorporate some of the run some of the play action to help the office of lying to help help them in the running game what's her physicality\nThem off the way the rams game developer your defense symbol last of the bills did did you sense last week into that eagles game that you just had some guys who were just fed up with things are hearing reading or watching back ... average or whatever performances in those games\nUm you know I don't I don't know I didn't ask any of them if they read anything or heard anything neither one of a you know we talked a lot about things that we had to correct during the week um you know we talked about um you know before before I came here um [noise]\nYou know the defense wasn't very good and what we had to do to get back to be in good hands so you know it was a little bit of go back into the gym and and uh\nYou know get back to basics and do things that were allowed us to be a pretty good defense of came over the years\nWith uh with Kirk Cousins ... do you think this is as good right now she's ever applied\nHe's playing really well uh you know I don't know I only saw on the games were getting ready to play them and and things like that when we go on but he's playing outstanding are making some outstanding throws under pressure\nDelivering the ball early trusting receivers I'm making some great deep ball throws 'em you know he's been very accurate um you know I really can't say enough about him some of the things he's done has been a you know exactly what we hoped\nFor when he starts a game with a David Morgan reception or the the the defense knows he'll hit anybody anytime that's important right yeah and\nAnd ah her her you know obviously he loves a Rudolph and digs and and the England but uh you know he has no problem checking the ball down to the back or are thrown at one of the other tied in ... or ... or anybody you know it's just you know which there he's going to try to take\nA look on getting out of boy for fighting for their first down\nYeah he didn't nice job uh sometimes you know you go out there and you say okay well we thought shorter steaks well sometimes you guys have to you know gets run after catching that was a big when they're with\nOur shot to heal and Brian O'Neill rich shot left tackle Brian writes aquifer when we went down to the fact they practiced in those spots up to the rams game ... did that help them in the eagles game\nThat we practice that every week there's always times when Russia had goes over the left and Ryan goes to write a ... every single week just because of uh the opportunity that you know something might happen in the game\nArizona this weekend is is Patrick Peterson the best corner you play the season\n[noise] oh that'd be [noise] you know I have to think about that one um you know the guys on the rams are pretty good I'm Patrick Peterson has been great for a long time he's an unbelievable athlete a great hands great acceleration um you know I'm sure uh\nHe's ... he's looking forward to the match up of of probably being on ... on one of the two and a soda it should be fun contest they're\nRunning back David Johnson what makes them a handful well\nHe's he's got great vision of like most great back to uh he's big physical guy catches the ball excellent all the backfield line them up as a receiver some but uh he he's got the power to extend plays and uh and drives and so you know we will have to wrap him up\nHigh on my red Larry Fitzgerald junior has been nursing the hamstring in the early part of the season age thirty five Fifteen here in the NFL I Know you respect him da da da da\nDi ... up in all different places um these tough you block he runs a great routes unbelievable hands great option runner great\nI'm coming out of the cuts uh we're gonna have to pay close attention to him what about rookie quarterback Josh Rose and what do you say he's got a big arm um you know good side throws the ball very well\nUm moves in the pocket he's very very bright a you know so uh I think that helps with some of the protection things he handles the protections um so uh\nThey they took that into practice and we took that into the game and I think that they they all play really at a high level and and the game gets Philadelphia\nSo whether it's your dad my core George Edwards or you how does the Anthony ticked off our coach and\nI think he he takes it takes a while because he he just knows that we're in it than that for him to be the best he can be I don't think he's he's going to take anything personally I'm a nose when we get on and we need to get on them and\nHe he's he's one of those guys that just wants to to to do right and then that's what that's what he's done most of his career is just do what we ask them to do and when when we're on him he knows that he needs to do\nBetter when Anthony is punishing players like Jay jai or punishing players I think that that that's the operative word to use he was punishing players in the eagles game that's when he's at his best right oh\nYeah I ... when he planned fast implant physical and\nAnd not so much uh thinking about stuff and just going I think he's he's as good as any linebacker misleading you know he's he's got as much talent as any linebacker mostly for sure and I you know I call them during the game after the first couple of series I so you're playing hard and your plant fast and they'll just keep it up because this is your type of game taught about Eric ... what kind of season has he has\nI think it's going well um you know it's kind of up and down at the beginning of the year but he's really settled into his role um [noise]\nYou know air air to one guy that wants to make every play on the field and sometimes we got a random back and say hey you you can make every play on the field or you just gotta do what do the plays that come to you and [noise]\nUm he's really done a nice job not only with his job but he's doing a good job to help them set up the front and helping set up our pressures [noise] um he is really matured and that way you know along with Anthony helping him I'm ... and again I think he when he plays fascinate plays active and he chases the ball um he's he's one of the top tier\nFend off the first thing you said that that the the rambunctious era Kendrick so that's kind of ... then all of his career I mean by like how do you rein that in so at some discipline the way you needed to be right\nBut what I tell him he can get your spot do your job first and then once you say that said go get it you know they can cause that's what that's what makes him so good is because once they react to something is they're fast they can make the play\n'em and you don't want you want to take all that away from 'em you won't you want them but you want him to do it within the scheme of the defense and not opening up something behind them because he jumped jumping something in front of a [noise] what what has improved with Eric over the years\nI think 'cause everything's improved I think that communication has improved I think his understanding of general football knowledge about Raul concepts run concepts Ron ... I think he's improved immensely in about every year you can\n[noise] not sure how many plays been getting him played against Philadelphia but viewing it from afar I I think he had a really good game is that accurate\nYeah but then as a good game every time he plays um you know ... and he might get [laughter]\nTen plays the game but he does his job and he does a good job every time he gets in there in ... there was one in Philadelphia that we'd practiced during the week that they had a big gain on a in the super bowl against to England\nLike fake block and they try and throws a tight and well then covered it so good that the quarterback has thrown out of bounds so that that's the type of player Ben is on he's always going to do his job and\nYou know they might not be the sexy one that the the everybody looks at the age he's steady Eddie and he's a huge part of our ... cents and he's huge part of what we do\nA Philly off into play from the super bowl when do you guys sleep I mean you're you're having to uncover every single capital just in case\nThey less less why that's why we get we have jobs we got to prepare these guys to do the best they can and you know very rarely at the same play come up against the same play a practice down at the same call your practice but every once in a while does and more and more we'd better stop that that\nHave been part of Adam's Zimmer linebackers coach Vikings on ... minutes to go here and then there's the part of them doing stuff and then trying to do it like to the other side of the field out of the same look to trick you guys do so I mean there's the deception part of it why why I bring that up is because\nI think in Green Bay on the two point conversion for the Vikings they ran a play with the digs in motion ... gets the Jew born conversion who've been in the eagles game deep political runs exactly the same motion but the plate went to the other side to feeling and mills sniffed it out so I'm thinking to myself\nWow not only did the deep end snow you know kind of what was happening but they also knew the next level where they could be trying to fool is here I mean that's everything you deal with right\nYeah I mean you can't practice everything you see on tape and you can't you can't predict what they're going to do because you know they have the pin down in the meeting room at midnight [laughter] but\nWhen you when you can do is you can prepare your players will be in the right position you know we have coverage rules of this is what I'm going to do if I get this way I'm going to get this instance stay disciplined and and what that is and that's what really worked on a lot in the long were you\nThirty seconds what makes David Johnson handball\n[noise] I'm just about everything is is a hard runner he's good out of that field I'm passes or you know he's he's good in protection um it it's just complete back and [noise] um [noise] you know he he's he's a handful and we're gonna have to do our our best tack on him and keep it on our eyes on him\nWhat about Josh Rosen with that big arm out on the line backers factor and\nYeah he does have a big army he's in ways mobile they're starting to move them around in the pocket a little bit um and and they they've scored more points each each game\nAnd then they're so they're getting better on off and you know so we're gonna have to do a good job of matching the routes and making them throwing a tight window ...\nJob thanks for the job he got Adam Sandler linebackers coach for the Minnesota Vikings we invite you to try the new crown royal Rico apple moves to the core police drink responsibly\nWe thank everybody who was the student with ... the nose that would include Zachary Halvorson and there are Norquist along with ... likewise for my ... from the Vikings entertainment networks and\nFor all of us with the Minnesota Vikings I'm ball allowing Vikings and cardinals Sunday at noon on the Minnesota Vikings radio network [noise]\n\nLand in science and we're going to every game land and values bravery and the\nTruth is the ...\nWe are all feeding human progress\nAnd making a positive spin\nIf I have I can find the fan and throwing host was packed with half a fan of parents and more [noise]\nEntertaining today and they certainly dot com\nI purchased necessary to enter or wet must be at least Eighteen years old boy were prohibited the official ... century link dot com slash biking\nFor eight years now we've said why it makes it better neat grew we asked his Vikings fan to sample a delicious wired hotdog new then blow the Vikings gal or who are we asking me to write gangs\n[noise] ...\n... ...\n... ... the official hot dog and the Minnesota Vikings really does make it better available at the game added ...\n...

on take a breath and I'm going to respond and I'll put you on hold if I have to [noise] here's my answer directly to that point which you interrupted\nThere are a lot of people I Know who communicate has kind of a stream of consciousness\nAnd one of them who I've met and I admire greatly as Donald Trump if you listen to his speeches he will often start on one tack he'll\nGo to something else that may seem unrelated then they'll go to something else then I'd go to something else it can be difficult to follow up but\nI think that's a style and and it's something that people do and I don't honestly think they have a lot of control over it I can do the same thing sometimes I find myself down the rabbit hole because all start on tax policy\nI'll go to drug policy I'll go to talking about the wall and then and and if you're planning it well\nThen you may end up all the way wrapped around to something else like defense policy\nIt happens there are other times where I think at a very linear manner and I go from eight to beat to see and if I keep going all end up but see that's what you're saying is that somebody is crazy if they don't communicate in an entirely linear way in all instances\nI Will tell you something having sat in that same office not with President Trump although I Hope to one of these days but if you've never been in the oval office you don't know how totally intimidating it can be and I would imagine even for a guy who's used to performing like county I was does\nThat would be an intimidating experience you're in the oval office with the president you're surrounded by what looks like about six does been urged cameras and everything else and then you say\nGosh he didn't seem to be speaking from a set of notes or under strict outline and he started at eight and ... but L. and then went back to see and went off dizzy and came back to ... him and opened the you know that if the fact that he wasn't going in a straight line shows he's crazy\nThen unfortunately an awful lot of us are probably crazy as well there are people and I know them some people I Know who are very smart\nWho don't always talk in a linear fashion one of them is one of my best friends over forty years he's a prosecutor he's very smart\nBut he will sometimes start with one thing and they'll end up going down a rabbit hole and I will confess to having done it as well so given that and don't decide that he's crazy if you sit down and do what I Would encourage people to do and I've said this a few times today\nListen to what he said to where he talked about the\nLack of father figures in families and that's something that's not a black or white issue is an issue for all families if you don't have a father figure in that family and they're very many households is is not disparaging single mothers raising kids it's a tough job to do\nBut without a male figure there those kids miss out on something important and often times end up going off the path he went from that to welfare and its influence\nI think an awful lot of what he said was actually very very conservative and that's why the media is going nuts on it let's go to Douglas Douglas welcome to First
