apparently murdered at the Saudi embassy in Istanbul, Turkey and the question is will\nAnd now apparently dead was apparently murdered the Saudi embassy in ... turkey and the question is well why did that happen and what happened to him and why did he end up dead now a matter of age you're glue joins Reno's research analyst at the foundation for defense of democracies\nAnd most of her go do a thing to ah to hear all do I should say I'm trying to pronounce it correctly murder you I appreciate your time thank you very much time I\nThink he actually put out the court to oh\nWell I'm I'm working at it in any case what is Iowa was meant to my audience by a dog in the fight on any particular subject weather in financial or family or otherwise\nYou'd seems to me that turkey has a vested interest in the outcome of the United states reaction to the murder or Jamal Jamal ... can you give us the the the pictures you see it from your point of view\nYes absolutely and I think you're exactly right um we have to look at the other geopolitical concerned as much as the days of human rights concerns a turkey has all the information carried out quite blood ridge over um Saudi and if you look at\nThe Turkish Saudi relationship especially since the Arab Spring of two thousand and an eleven and twelve when I started seeing the ascendency of Islam skates limited ... coming into power or\nThe Muslim Brotherhood was on the ascendancy came to power in Egypt before the coup there my truck soaks\nIt says when the b._b._c. the divergence between Saudi and and in a church key when it comes to the middle of the first beginning\nAnd a turkey has been very much aligned with a Muslim Brotherhood faction within the middle east side\nAnd those type of a child of a deep and they're very much enduring ties when we have in Saudi Arabia now especially in the last um she hears from all the power that it was crowned pit at crown\nPrince a NBS as we call them behind that much they've been trained in the mother and father as a hostile a talk show and especially as a as a terrorist organization\nSo we see at major diverge a chair I Would say that because of the mother and brother issue a turkey and the and the child either activity in a Cold War in the middle east\nSituation when you say has showed gee that the journalists a murder that he turkey gave his\nOwn car I learn the leverage over at the ads and I think what we're saying is that I don't as trying to put pressure on the U.S administration to distance himself from everybody at the ... leadership on this particular issue\nIn this case did Saudi Arabia have anything to gain by murdering ... ...\n... you tend to also of course it sounds like we live in a democracy here in the west I mean such a such an actually solving fame had magical event I don't know why the Saudis would even take his new\nBut it looks like a this particular journalist was highly critical of the Saudi monarchy and\nIt looking into his tiny little turkey over the last few years it seems like he was getting closer to the Turkish leadership that's also I'm supposed to I don't want to take\nAnd I don't want to get too much credit that he was affecting you can do a thing and the whole thing or the Muslim Brotherhood and the and the eight ball fast who\nWith all the problems they they do have a democratically governs nice just to make that but it's also a whole not look because we also understand it the Democratic potential\nIs on it but it needs some monarchy birthdays popularly elected Islamic governments view\nCushing, Oklahoma that turkey side a lot of the fight I mean of course they're going to war and the Saudis picking up a kind of action like at the ... street in the journal is\nA free press a point of view it looks like they wanted to eliminate that especially ... and ... that are important for that he saw industrialized he lived up to remind our audience a columnist for the Washington Post\nWhich is pretty influential if you think about it and I think they want it to me this and leave all the way\nAnd yes has done really against internal enemies are inside Saudi Arabia as well so I think that the line with his action but at the end the crown prince take leadership style if he um he had to get enough credit\nBut does that mean that they would have done this thinking we can do this without anyone finding out because they had to know that there would be some blowback if they murdered journalist who was tied to the Washington Post the United states would be called upon to respond as I understand in Turkey locks of journalists all the time\nUh and and I would imagine that there are probably people locked up in Saudi Arabia\nFor a for going past the rules in that country as well and yet those don't cause international incidents but most of them don't involve people or or green card residents of the United states\nYes exactly and um and we also know that the journalists had a good connection with us ah\nAh I don't think that you should be on that just the Washington Post I think it's fair to say that he he really more than a journalist productivity and an activist I Love looking out for us the insurance and I think it helps\nA you know a hype the problem but also turkey has a lot of beef here and the fact that it has this leverage\nIdaho and has a place his hands quite to out here and the child by by hiking up the issue so in the last\nFew weeks turkey has been steadily me candidates information day by day and thereby ensuring that issue keeps dominate the headlines globally\nAnd memory bought one of the things I understand the paper that had originally claimed in Turkey that they had the audio recording of ... death now says well maybe we don't have the recording\nSo some of the information that was pushed out early to try to get a lot of attention to this that you had this murder happened inside the Saudi embassy that there was audio tape of it\nYou know it sounded horrific and then we find out the certain bits and pieces that were pushed out early to get everybody amped up above the story don't exist\nMain outing ... yeah well the problem is nobody really hurt this\nTape tried that and that's what President Trump has been has all that she wants to see the evidence that the Turks are claiming they have that particular need it for that you mention really glad you didn't mention it ... it is a very much owned by the Turkish government that affected the idol on topic out on the show\nAnd I would even though as far as to say that that in the states are a lot of the largest source of the nation from turkey I'm\nGetting at only carry the messages that are pushed by the Turkish government so it's a highly problematic at\nTheir own sources of information that we have on that particular monitor and the higher ordeal surrounding it it just come out from the trucks\nOnly ... nation that we have on the ... not at all he traveled he just come from the Turkish side I didn't look at\nThe they pay for the first couple of Turkish government credible court ruled out as the show called for me to have some chest pain so I Would like to see all those ... ... or ... you can't really\nMove to ... I got thirty seconds what's the right thing for the United states to do because one of our best asset to in that region is Saudi and there aren't any good replacement what should the United states do at this point\nHere like they think are important right now but yeah ... ... that are about to come again I'll let you long state cooperation with audio ... yeah we heard secretary of state Mike Pompeo today say that all Saudi officials to like it\nA lot of this problem that's being shoved onto the United states is demonstrably dangerous for the kids who are who are who are the victims of this although I notice that most of the video that it's being shot at this group seems to be largely you know twenty something male\nCapable and I've seen some interviews with these people saying oh yeah we're workers will come and work hard well that's not the point if you're trying to escape persecution that would justify refugee or asylum status that's not just people saying I'd like a better job of a better rate of pay that's not going to justify status on the border is it\nSo that's exactly right so and this is this comes back to the issue of the core issue here and that is right now we've got a problem in our asylum\nProcess are sound system and we've got loopholes in our laws as you point out especially with children that's making it really difficult for us to enforce our laws um right now we've seen a spike in families at the border since the end of the zero tolerance policy I think it's been like a Seventy five percent increase that's like a couple of months\nAnd so now everyone knows\nIf you want to get into the United states bring a child as you point out it doesn't even have to be your child just\nGrandchild through and as long as you can hold that Keith together for a little while he that shirt together for a little while you get three right now and an hour and our immigration courts are ... to scenes and because of this loophole we simply cannot remove them fast enough I'm into something that Congress needs to change\nWell is there a way to stop this group before they hit American soil because I Know that a lot of people don't appreciate this but if you get your feet on American soil then you're entitled to full constitutional rights if you're stopped short of the border\nThen you don't have any constitutional rights whatsoever so but is there a way to do that the president is threatened to use the military to stop this but it does the military set up two feet south of the Mexican border or three feet north of the Mexican border\nSee I see and that's the problem I think the reality is that if you try to use the military first of all there's limitations on what you can even use the military for we have certain laws that prohibit the military from engaging in certain law enforcement actions because we don't want the military can only use being used for law enforcement\nGuarding a border and he is the job of the United states military isn't it\nI I agree the problem is is that when you get asylum law and to the issue of these people are\nSupposedly coming across to claim asylum then that's a law that's being broken and so that's a law enforcement issue and that's really where this route comes in and even if you get put it that the military at the border you Dan would have to say okay what you'd have to do they have to cover every stretch of the of the\nOf the border and if they got ... as you point out one foot across the border\nThen what do you do they couldn't asylum and all of a sudden the military has to bring a nice anyone I think people are going to come in two thousand or one what have I mean how many thousands of miles that is to get here they're just gonna keep on trying until they get a cry\nNow David I Know this is all of a situation where neither one of us has full details but [noise]\nThe president early on said to Guatemala and Honduras stop this group or you're going to lose your foreign aid which is something that is within his control I Believe you know the Congress can allocate the money and they have appropriate the money for foreign foreign aid but the president controls how's that ...\nAh the president is also said to Mexico you stop this group which they don't appear to be doing right now and if you don't stop them you may just lose that us MCA trade deal and it's and and it and it appeared I thought at the beginning when the president made that threat by tweet\nA that Mexico was going to take that seriously is that an effective way to get Mexico to intercede and say we've offered a bunch of these people work permits\nWe eat a that Mexico was going to take that seriously is that an effective way to get Mexico to intercede and say we've offered a bunch of these people work permits but we will stop them in our country or is it to Mexico's benefit\nTo a ... some it snows at at President Trump and say we're gonna let them keep on going you figure out what to do with him on that once they get north or your border\n[noise] yeah I mean I think this is just a little bit complicated by the fact that right now you are looking at a incoming New Mexico ... so even if we had a\nPartner in Mexico they exactly what we wanted them to do that's not necessarily the case and you know a couple of months the new incoming Mexican administration has indicated Neal less willingness to cooperate with the United states now David ... that was that was the campaign so we don't know but still that's not a good sign\nDavid I very much appreciate church but she's a David in

got Alan [noise]\nI don't even act\nOn these large large come back to the Lars Larson Joe so many things are at stake depending on who ends up controlling the house and the Senate after the\nNovember midterms two weeks from today and I've decided to bring Grover Norquist on who is president of Americans for tax reform we've had you on so many times before Grover to talk purely tax consequences but what's at stake if the Democrats take control of even the house of representatives let alone the sun it [noise]\n[noise] well they have some other things now just sit and do a bunch of ah getting best occasions or as you saw what they tried to do to cap and um they could do that to everybody who works for the federal government are as high you up and\nHave somebody that accusation about you from ... number of years ago and go on and on and I I mean there's there's no end\nTo what they can do if somebody is having reasonable regulations that the EPA\nPollen and fund X Y and Z who knows they could subpoena records tax records and the lake them uh and I don't just stand the presidents I mean they they say they want to do that of course if there was something well I think\nThose ... it's a long time ago they've done it to other conservative or and other conservative groups I think they would not hesitate to do it to the president you know they believe that there were some interesting thing there um but they could do it anyway uh so\nOne is the abuse of their subpoena power and show on a you know the Fourth Amendment doesn't mean much if they can subpoena something and then throw it out to the press or they're certainly going to go for gun control\nOr they will push for massive new spending member when we wanted to begin to rebuild the military after Obama years they said oh yeah\nBut only if we get a dollar for dollar\nFor welfare spending any dollar you want to put into national defence when it another dollar to go into welfare and that was the deal they drove and McCain agreed to that McCain was the one that was pushing the defense spending and he doubled the cost of defense spending by paying the bride or extortion\nOr that he thought was necessary to get the national defense spending but that will happen again and again so more spending but it's a death the tax cuts no Democrat and the house or the Senate is voted for tax cut they voted against every tax cuts voted for\nEvery tax increase including the silly ... trillion trillion trillion dollars are taxes than Obamacare only some of which has been to appeal not all of it not even most of the tax increases in Obamacare\nTo all those things are going to happen which makes it doubly important than Republicans turn out in November\nI have to always think could Grover 'cause I happen to live in a state Washington state that has vote by mail to the ballots are already on people's hands and in some cases are actually marking the motive for most of the country\nIt's the six of November or that they have to focus on because that is the day you actually go to the polls boy do I wish we still went to the polls but I was thinking about you and your group the other day when I was hearing a long discussion on a liberal talk show about Donald Trump and his father and the way that his father figure it out to leave money for his kids\nAnd I remember thinking the Democrats seem to think that it's evil that any parent would try to leave as much of what they can leave after the government's done with them or to their kids\nSan I look at it I heard it and I thought well I was really admiring the way that to his father\nFigured out ways to make sure that has kids five of them were well ... you know well provided for men that they had a good START I would think that any American parents would say I wouldn't leave my kids whatever I can leave them apparently the Democrats are the liberals don't share that point of view\n[noise] their view is the government will tell organized the government to scale money for that gets a ... to ... I think one of the best things that we know about the United states is that the death tax it fewer than five percent of people depending on how you want to\nMeasure directly direct but it's not anybody people by destroying the jobs are cutting their businesses and farms in out in terms of you know\nYou pay you act you pay the tax and made it like a farm that gets cut in half the business it gets cut now everybody who worked for it may be in trouble but if I had to shut Seventy percent of Americans have consistently set a\nBit they want the death tax Chappelle show Seventy percent so\nAt least fifty five percent of Americans said I don't get it up to act like that that that fact but I think it's wrong to attack somebody again and again and again uh on him that they've already paid taxes on at least once and and maybe more than once a depending on how they they are in the dollar a\nThat's a healthy country that is not a country\nThat Obama thought he was president have written by a and they remember Obama's comment when somebody said well you know why don't you cut the capital gains tax you know whenever we've cut the capital gains tax revenue goes up when we increased capital gets actually gotten it actually\nGets less money do you really want to raise the capital gains tax even if it\nCosts the government said yes yes it's still the right thing to do so this was not about\nAdding more money to build a bridge or do something constructive this was I Would rather have a tax on success for people to punish that meant to hurt them even though I Know it will hurt\nPeople who depend on government spending court did on people worked for the army or a ... D legitimate functions of the government or even though it hurt them he still liked the idea of attacks on capital gains show and they was more important than\nIt hurt them they'll like the idea\nOf attacks on Capitol gets show and they were more important\nThan helping whatever they got much less to do to help the poor people that the military\nUm all those things that the government says that it does with our lovely lady a ... or not wear a bottle wise which has consumed by and they and ... other people's stuff and it is one of the seven deadly sins and the Democrats act like it's a political progress\nAs you pointed out that sixty five Seventy percent of Americans don't like this soon as you say these are people who could very easily say I'll never be as rich\nOr I Would not be so rich or to be able to have to pay the death tax but I don't want anybody else debate either so you're right sixty percent of it maybe sixty five percent of Americans don't have that kind of envy\nAnd Obama's attitude toward money do you remember when he said\nSome point you made enough money\nWell he is at this point the current estimates are that he's worried about forty million dollars it was worth about three million dollars when he came in and into the presidency and here we are two years out of his presidency worth forty and the asteroids are\nHe'll have made a quarter billion dollars about Fifteen Years in do you suppose anybody is going to remind him of what he said and say so President Obama when you've got to a hundred million was that enough\nHow about a hundred and a quarter you know how 'bout how 'bout to when you got to two hundred million and you knew that the interest alone in that two hundred million would be about ten million dollars or in earnings on it would be about ten million dollars a year that you would earn for the rest of your life\nWithout giving another speech or anything else is that what you meant by enough money and if it isn't enough how much is enough\nTo say I get I guess that's clearly not enough [laughter] [noise] ah\nThere is a tremendous sat hypocrisy I'm On the left or the day\nAnd the other people's money and the other people's success [noise] uh and it's very sad it's a ... but we can avoid that being the leadership of the country and as you are say everybody needs to remember this vote\nPlease if it's if it's nailed by those take your ah\nYour mail thing to deliver it to the polls mail it to the polls do not leave without people or do you not throw it away people got stopped dumpster diving and that that\nThey sell those to the local democratic committee chairman now to science ... zero as possible and ah but of course the unionized post office delivers law or should I couldn't ever\nIn every state we're going to have some individual peculiarities like building in Hawaii versus building in Alaska\nBut we should all have an agreement that there are certain things that are always going to build a certain way if we build an education system that way is not inherently bad but as I said it became political and it became full of fads and as you said a lot of parents would look at math and say in particular and say I have no idea what you're talking about\nI don't know how to help you with their homework\nYeah you're exactly right and it especially making the problem we're talking second first and second grade ... parents are are are having trouble with it's not even the high school math which is where I like that that is high school math and and\nHow to get rid of that well\nLike you said it it it's tall attack and how they come from the bureaucracy spend the top because comedy comes from the top and then they inherit issue Tommy or at the top down at such that the education that's why it takes power out of the hands of the expert\nSays is called ... or the teacher and it makes sure that some powerful beer at the top level many of them never have stepped foot into foster homes are the ones that are dictating well why\nShouldn't start learning how they are learning it and when they are learning it\nSo I I I take an Adam Smith approach to to education um I Believe that competition and how\nOld are going to get better competition for better teachers that boy to increase learning and and and numbers and let's turn going to ah bring more tax dollars into a school district that high schools um\nStandard nationalizing education at first like he's dead\nOn glance sounds like a good thing um you know living from West Virginia I think that if you want to believe that your child will fit in\nYeah I like glance sounds like a good thing um you know you're living from West Virginia but Connecticut you want to believe that your child will fit into the grade that the state says the child should be it yeah but that is just not what is happening unfortunately and ah so important because\nNow education has become a political issue and when we have to vote the people in the office that are going to make sure I should have the best education and set it on our teachers what will I politician\nYou know why we got the time tonight city in Sandy Adams is the director of education for the foundation for liberty in American greatness which has flag um why are we teaching kids about the constitution and I I Know that for some people they can go ... or how does that apply to my kids daily life for the fact is\nThe way you interact with your employees some day when you're an employer or as an employee interact with your employer when you're first out of school the way you interact with the police the local government a lot of that\nYou have to know the constitutional rights that are guaranteed in that document and what the government's allowed to do and what is not allowed to do I think to make you know is sensible daily choices and even choices at the ballot box like we're all going to do in a couple of weeks\nFlyers you're exactly right and an easy answer to that is that Common Core on measures by English language arts and by now and so the constitution or it can be used as an English language arts resource but it was second area they\nAnd set up that's fine Mary historical document that kids should know before they graduate high school and\nWhat does that about this since they were saying you know my generation which I I end up part us and my generation\nIncreasingly but not like the country that they ... that there was killed and and they're constantly it's become a sad to talk about why you don't like this country\nI Believe that it was impossible to have that opinion of as a matter of fact he know that type of all you know why the founding fathers are set up the constitution the way they did to guarantee that you and I were able to keep our rights as opposed\nTo the government giving us our rights and I just think ... ... instead of students and teachers and parents um dictating how how bad their education is whether\nIt's their their education and educational right they're coming from the the high level that love your office and um and so on such a fight that common for is that\nSay that the education you can decrease and as a result the satisfaction of our country is a crazy thing I saw it with my students\nA had a kid that tell me that you know you said that they're not all that they are gone I\nI I

since then there's been nothing but escalation in Europe so we started in Ukraine we spread to Syria than we spread to Eastern Europe and now Steve because of the exercise that Russia just ran with China\nIn the in the far east of Siberia we have a true global ... global conflict with Russia and China on one side and the United states and NATO and the other in these five years\nYes and it's amazing to me John not amazing but it's striking that as I finished the book how many of the subjects we discuss four or five years ago\nHe would say it's history and it is history\nBut it's still a front page news today a in Ukraine for example it's still sad was set off the fall of the government there and brought pro American government\nThe power in a country that's part of Russia is common Ukrainian civilization right on the border of Russia or one of those famous snipers remember that John in February Twenty one\nOn solved fame and\nSaid well actually not I mean newspapers still say

edge but his very right wing even neo Nazi enemies who are the snipers now the reason that's important is that those people\nWho sent the snipers neo Nazis have grown into a major force in Ukraine Today and yet we back or government of Ukraine so this is another theme of the book I mean are we comfortable we Americans backing a government that has a bad did\nA really the largest fascist movement in Europe today and our that our battalion ... with thirty thousand\nFighters well see if we just rent a NATO exercised in western Ukraine with the ads off battalion now part of the Ukraine military so yeah of clear we're comfortable we're networking\n[noise] you know I I just want to get myself one further piece of a promo promotion the late rider Gore Vidal's all\nUh many years ago when I was writing a column about Russia for the nation magazine said that I was a part of an early journalistic alert system\nThat is I call attention to things that people weren't paying attention to I think that that's one\nThat's been one important for me are doing this broadcast with you weekly is that we would I have been able to talk about things were working behind the news that are very important that are going to shape history and when I read what we discuss their what I've written up now in the book\nI'm pleased and a kind of negative way 'cause I Wish a lot of these things have happened the way what we began to trace in late to Thirteen\nWhen the Ukrainian crisis rocketed all the way through almost last week has been the right things to focus\nStop their professor ... from

destroyed\nAnd that ... ... madness could lead to this or an accident ... either side from protecting itself retaliatory strike so when Bush left it can't open the door to a\nProfound revision is and then eventually undermine this intermediate range tree\nAnd the Russians began when I saw was going on to develop a counter or they began violating the treaty I whether they deploy these missiles are not open to question whether they certainly develop them and they tested or they haven't deployed them so the United states by doing that now\nRemember something else happened when the United states violated another agreement the one it made with Gorbachev that it would not move NATO eastward toward Russia when NATO began to expand to Russia's borders and today John we all know we're right on Russia's borders NATO is [noise]\nMissile defense installations which we are now being implemented because Bush had left the treaty prohibiting then became a NATO project where NATO went missile defense with some of the results of this\nAnd I'll get to the end of this point but I think it's very important the result is today as we talk Russia is reigned by American NATO missile defense installations [laughter] do you say so ... how do I have to relate to what Trump\nAnd it's because the Russians of climbing\nAnd America nuclear scientists who are independent such as professor Theodore postal at MIT have agreed that these missile defense installations can fire\nIntermediate range missiles that is there not only defensive installations they are often ... so we've been building their capacity to fire cruise missiles as they were called which have been banned\nFor almost a decade now and the Russians have complained bitterly and we have not responded so we have a

the IMF band land base missiles\nThe ages is complicated a lot of them are on ships but they are in fact the land based develop missiles put on ships said it's more the distinction between seeing land

taking a stab at addressing college affordability on their own\nMarketwatch reporter Jillian Berman says the result is a patchwork of experiments across the country working out the kinks ... the ideal in real time it was both soaring praise and intense criticism Jillian what's happening\nOver the past two you know ten or so years um\nLocal communities state and others across the country have been experimenting with providing students with tuition free college and the idea kind of got a boost job with the presidential elections that we saw Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton talk a lot about different ways that they could potentially may call it about college free\nArts so give an example or to a pool is trying to watch\n[noise] yeah so the um like Tennessee are you know arguing programs where they make community college free to you know to students and their state\nUm and the idea behind it was kind of level of programs is you know it's a little bit more about workforce development so in Tennessee they were like we need to attract more companies here to attract more companies here we need college educated workers how are we going to get them we're going to make college easier to pay for 'em\nAnd then when you know local communities that have these programs so the most famous example is in Kalamazoo, Michigan\nWhere a group of anonymous donors I said and two thousand five\nYou know everybody who graduates basically from public high school and Kalamazoo or going to pay for them to go to college in Michigan and the idea behind those programs in that if you give that community free college kind of as an incentive then other organizations\nThat to make it to that students can take advantage of it to the public high school to get better nonprofit ... you know you can do more to offer her school tutoring and you know the sort of the community rallies together to prepare these students um preschool and that's better for the community and now\nThey're also individual schools that are you know sort of making some kind of tuition free promise for certain students I'm so they'll say if you come from a family making less than ... you can come here for free\nFor speaking with marketwatch personal finance reporter Julian bourbon she's written a piece inside old here's what it would take to make college tuition break\nUp on at least a couple of these programs are maybe most of them it does seem like the organizers are having to hit up a lot of donors are kind of getting some of the bigger companies around the area of the ship in\nIt that you know that's kind of one of the reasons why the advocates of these things like the idea\nOf the federal government is doing it and because then they can [noise] you know that the funding is a little less precarious but yeah it's actually um a lot of community college systems are starting to offer these programs and at that level you know community colleges and all that sort of the huge fundraising arms of other\nColleges so it's really you know they're really like capping donors repeatedly and you know they're trying to get corporations that kind of be sustaining donors but for these programs that it can be hard and if you you know promised students that you're going to do that she started ... deliver on it\nOr yeah it's a stable funding I mean is that the phrase you're going forward in terms of most tabs for these programs to continue and thrive\nAnd I think finally as somebody pointed out to me in the column the price of opposing Trump within the party was higher than some people thought they\nSome of the people who spoke out against him at the beginning just got hammered out at the base of the party\nAnd um that became too painful and so they've kind of backed off and in some cases as my as my source a they've just shut up so I think it's a combination of things\nBut if Democrats win the house and the Senate in the fall [noise]\nWell I think this gets to a point that should be remembered which is you know everything is fickle and politics and if people are you adding by Trump\nWhile the going as good if it's not I don't think there's a lot of loyalty to him that's wrong term and people could shift fairly rapidly and if they lose control the house and the Senate then people will start to ask themselves well as the downside of supporting Donald Trump better parties\nSpokesman and image to
