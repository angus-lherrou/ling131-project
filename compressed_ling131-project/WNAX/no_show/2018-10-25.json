conduct is abhorrent to everything we hold dear and sacred as Americans we're extremely angry upset\nAbout what can we went to this this morning and we will get to the bottom of that\nIs right that well in fact I wouldn't be willing to bet that some of the authorities are already closing in welcome back to the Lars Larson Joe Donald Trump in that soundbite from just a few hours ago was talking about the pipe bombs that were delivered\nIn New York and in Maryland New York state of course both in New York City and it ... in a bed for New York or George Soros lives and in sunshine Florida and uh yeah there were a lot of different locations including Washington DC the Clintons the Obamas and CNN\nAnd of course I think this is being made to look like something that is aimed at the left from the right\nLet me tell you I think I don't use the term very often in fact one of my colleagues who does a different kind of talk radio show Clyde Lewis said you didn't actually use the term false flag did you and I said yeah I sure did and here's why\nOrdinarily I've heard people have false flag theories about all kinds of incidents that actually happened this one sounds like an attempt to try to bring sympathy on the Democratic party the Democratic party and the last week or so it was already began to signal that they don't think they're going to get the big blue wave in November on the sex\nThey don't even think they're going to get a small blue wave they in may in fact be completely humiliated on election day so what would bring some sympathy to them\nAnything that made it look as though they were under attack from the right\nI think we're going to find out that these pipe bombs that were delivered were fakes that is the FBI says that they contain real explosives inside of real metal pipes but let me point out a couple of things and some of you have noticed number one\nThey're delivered by the u._s. mail and delivering anything by the u._s. mail is going to leave all kinds of trails behind it because you have to put it in a box and more you have to do a postal office somewhere it may have post marks on you may have noticed that some of the stamps did not have cancellations on them and that's a clue\nThe packages were all taped up and this is one of the things I notice the bombs appeared to have lots and lots of electrical tape and the packages had lots of tape if you've talked to people in the police are among the place to take a look at the evidence that you can find on this one you used tape\nWins will continue to breathe the out of the south\nThan

[noise] son will tell you what so why\nYou check in with him so I guess we were going to talk to him by Skype we usually talk to Bryan buys guide but in this\nOr at all ... tell you what so why don't you check in with him so I we were going to talk to him by Skype we usually talk to Brian ... guide but in this case it looks like his computer died on him\nOr so but that's what happens when you buy the hyper expensive apple products instead of going for something that actually works\nAnyway welcome back to the Lars Larson Joe pleasure to be with you and since Brian's not there I'm going to go to and they said we always putting ... to the head of the line follows on the line and Pennsylvania St Paul welcome to the program what's on your mind tonight\n[noise] thank you for being as responsible and not as derogatory\nAs some other people are so I think you'd do a really good job and your logic is a fantastic thank you and so there's all that good stuff and I mean it you're a pleasure to listen to I don't always agree with you know my point is simply this [noise] and I could give me ... and I hope I have a chance to do that\nAre quite a few on the extreme right\nFor an example and back in two thousand and one of the recall is being done in Florida\nHad a customer my store that said oh those Democrats they keep making and and you know that that stuff and I said yeah I watch television last night and the door to the county room was bashed in and can't people that were screaming yelling and waving their arms and anger\nAnd stop the boats stop the vote and I said oh they were Republicans weren't day and he said no and my point was not that\nThe left us better or the light is better the extremists that woman that held up the ... or ... separate head of the president I miss disgusted about her as probably any conservative would be and disgusted about the neo Nazis in Virginia that that\nThat you know did the the uh the landing and waving and there were the ... the ... of evil man drove California to incite rioting and a woman that was basically walking along\nSolitaire ... you're trying to run out the clock on me I think unfortunately\nThe if if you if you want to go back twenty or Thirty years we could actually go back a hundred and fifty years and say have most of the assassinations and attempted assassinations bend the work of liberals and the answer would be yes and I could give you chapter and verse on that if you want to go more recently what we could say is well let's see [noise]\nHas Hillary Clinton said you will not get a return to civility until you give us power back as antifa marched in the streets and they benefit the left have we seen black lives matter\nCommit acts of violence and trying to burn hold towns down guns have been fired people have been heard and that is the length and then you've got to occupy and they have been you know both gross and disgusting and violence as well over the years all of those things are coming from the left\nAnd all I Would like it and you know Steve ... very nearly died because\nOf a left wing Bernie Sanders supporter who was a lefty who was angry and decided to shoot a bunch of Republicans\nSand you've seen like Eric Holder encourage violence Maxine Waters encourage violence Hillary as I said he encourages violence\nSo you know when you tell me oh there's a little bit on both sides I hear that kind of moral equivalency from reporters who don't have the guts to say one side has identified itself with violent protest\nFar more than the other side\n... in fact when Republicans call me or conservatives called me and they say\nHey let's go on and have a protest unless yell and scream and carry signs and and and all that I say that's that's not the way conservatives act totally are conservative were left the left\nDoes that they'll go out and you know remember the day after the inauguration the big women's march where vehicles are set on fire people were assaulted bad things happen to have you ever seen\nConservatives in America do that\nNow I'm not going to say there aren't any individual conservatives will throw upon or maybe try and push down a door but I'm saying for the most part the big protest some conservatives like Tea Party protests are peaceful there well ordered and they usually leave the place cleaner than it was when they arrived\nWhereas when the left shows up you can usually count on broken windows people assaulted\nSend you saw all the assaults on Donald Trump supporters through the entire campaign when people would show up in an event that was not their event they would they were there not to listen and maybe pick apart what the candidate was saying I think that's legitimate I go to a liberal or you know speeches on occasion so that I can hear what they're saying\nBut I don't see the kind of behavior by conservatives that I see that comes from the left\n[noise] do you see any examples of that like what is that the president who am I ... and I'm looking at the ... he he said several things during the campaign police don't be so so kind to the president of their heads and you put them in a said\nOil ... exactly but Paul at some point the words are turned into actions or they're not you you and then I Know that that's true in both sides there are people who say that makes me so mad I Want to kill him have you ever heard all of a friend of yours say that\nSome day and have they ever killed anyone your friends fail\nSo there are so here's the difference there is a wide difference usually between what people say and what people actually do but when people actually do those things when they show up at political rallies\nAnd say this isn't even my rally it's not my candidate I'm going to show up and I'm gonna disrupted so that nobody can speak and by the way\nWhen you see hearings on Capitol Hill and the left doesn't like what's going on in the hearing they show up and tried to disrupt the event you see conservatives doing that\n[noise] um I I think if you are if if we're going to do it get to Southern Poverty\nLaw ads that bond that bungee is morally bankrupt and they don't tell the truth they might have been one\nAudience what evidence out of\nWell because I've seen and I know some of the groups I've covered some of the groups that they have labeled as hate groups they've labeled as hate groups any group that doesn't agree with them politically which is very it's\nIt's a kind of political bigotry it's the kind of thing that if you're at work and there's a guy at work you don't like and he said he has the best idea you've ever heard or your bonds ever hurting his life and you say that guy's fat\nOr that guy staying where he doesn't take a shower or you know or you know his ... you know he smells like arm pet all the ... you say well what about his idea oh it doesn't matter he's fat\n... it's the political bigotry where you say none of the the ideas coming from that person or any good\nI'm telling you that one I've seen hearings on Capitol Hill I have yet to see one where conservatives show up and they say oh we don't we don't like the content of this hearing so we're going to disrupt it that is almost exclusively an activity of the left\nAnd the protests the mass protest from the women's march to the Occupy to black lives matter to antifa are all from the left there usually all potentially violent some kind some cases actually violent people get hurt\nAre all from the left there usually all potentially violent and some guy in some cases actually violent people get hurt you get burned down things get broken you can't point to conservative incidents of the same gun Kenya\nWell the neo Nazis identify with the light and the skin\nNeal listen you've got to remember you don't want a Nazi is that's the national socialist party it was invented by Adolf Hitler you know and and yeah but it wasn't supposed\nTo ... yeah yes it was if you took a look at Germany's economy it was very much social as they said the states controls everything and you will produce for the state and you will be subsumed by the state if the state tells you that if it is socialism is\nThe ownership that socialism is the ownership of the means of production\nThat's out of a of a college textbook real socialism can only be done to the point of a gun if you go to somebody and say hey by the way you made a lot of money this month but this guy over here didn't make much\nYou know Americans that every American citizen depending and don't you know regardless of their income for al ... for help expand the short story\nYou know major health problems that they might have I think most Americans believe that but at and say well you have a system to provide the benefits to them but Americans don't want to give up their own health insurance you know Ninety percent of us health insurance we all want to you know and I don't know plants\nYou know so that the temper central don't have healthcare that it just getting to the health care voucher and let him go out and shop for health care yeah that's the way I feel a lot of interests you know you mentioned the veterans plant\nI experienced the same thing some of the veterans say to me you know I get good health coverage from the VA hospital away at Walter Reed right down the street from where I live that's one of the finest hospitals in the world\nBut I but other veterans say I I you know get lousy care so why not give every veteran a an opportunity if they don't want to go to the VA hospital they voted another hospital well I'm a choice guy but the Democrats don't believe in choice\nThey believe that ... into the health care that they want to give you\nYou know what I'd like to do I want to make a proposal I Want to I Want the government is far out of health care as we can possibly do whilst now here's what I Do in place Steve to pieces\nFirst of all let's deal with the pre existing condition crowd which is about somewhere between two hundred thousand and maybe a high end up four hundred thousand people because we know those numbers because of the people who signed up for Obamacare preexisting conditions when they wiped out all the risk bowls\nSo those two hundred thousand people could be covered as I understand the numbers for maybe ten Fifteen billion dollars out of a downward thousand\nBillion dollar federal budget like saying four thousand billion well it'll be like saying if you made four thousand bucks a month could you afford Fifteen bucks for this but people would say or for the you know forty thousand bucks a year could you afford a hundred and fifty dollars for this just to make demands easy\nThen they go sure so that's part one just cover everybody with a preexisting condition who has\nA let's say wealth blow up a million bucks for half a million bucks and ... below ... a hundred thousand dollars if you're over a hundred thousand you got to take care of yourself second\nWhat I'd like to do is have the government say we will defend define what a good catastrophic plan is because this is the second group is all of us you have to realize I get hit by a truck\nAnd or you know I get hit by heart attack and I need a hundred and fifty thousand dollar operation if I don't have health care and I do um then I Need to have that bypass covered or the trans fat governor whatever your kid needs a new kidney okay we'll take care of it\nBut we'll take care of it by saying we will offer a catastrophic plan for those people who want to go ... actively bear they're not going to have any insurance except catastrophic\nAnd they say it's like you know the having having a a collusion insurance\nOn our homeowner's insurance homeowner's insurance in case it out and burns down I don't want to see\nEven on homeowners I bumped my deductible from a thousand five thousand because they said why my wife said well why it well for house burned down\nThen we have to cover the first five thousand not not a big deal if your house burned down you know five thousand bucks\nBut the the chance of that is very low end the savings by going to that gives you a really low premium so you do those two things but you don't have the government provided you say to the insurance industry develop this product and if you meet the criteria so we can tell people it has the good housekeeping the Donald Trump seal of approval on and\nThen pick from one of the news and the and all of these companies will compete with each other saying we have a better one and it's only forty dollars a month and literally we could get\nAnd the and all of these companies will compete with each other saying we have a better one and it's only forty dollars a month and literally ... could get to premiums like that couldn't wait\nLet's think of it this way but at least you know McDonalds will divest dressed up in the you know fast food restaurant so we don't need all these other\nBastard right that's right you know the Burger King would I advise everybody can just go to ... do well first of all what do you think would happen to the quality of food and all that they should get the right match the logic on healthcare it should definitely you know they let a cure I don't have to remind you this but some of your listeners may need to be reminded\nMedicare is now facing something like\nThirty trillion dollars of unfunded liabilities so we're really get up every ... which is like putting every American under the ... right I mean ...

government edict clearly President Obama talked I could just declare that cars will get fifty miles to the gallon and ordered the scientists to come up with something like a Darth Vader saying\nYou will develop this you will if they'd been around what Edison it was around he wouldn't have had to go through ten thousand different ah filament to figure out what would a light bulb go he just needed a president or a or an emperor someone just to to order him to do it\nBut actually come about because of freedom does sorry drug\nThat I Love what you say is not true with it to the Democrats that they still believe in at\nAll this fantasy that the Internet exist because the government invented it in fact the government and misused massive amounts of resources to create something that was totally out of work for the private sector only for private actors\nTo to actually make it work out in the private sector and it just raises the question it government weren't spending billions and hundreds of billions and trillions of dollars a year for all this time\nImagined how much quicker we would have gotten to the Internet and no government can never innovate and one reason that cat is because failure does not for and what it does\nTo your point about Edison Edison had to fail thousands of times to get to a light bulb government can't do that from\nAnne in those cases are away for America to get back to the kind of freedom there is always made I I'd I'd say always maybe I'm being brought their\nHas for a long time made America a center of innovation not just technologically but I think I even in terms of the way we live our lives with their freedoms that we enjoy were were an innovative country compared to the rest of the world so\nWe we are and and more innovative let's stressed that were innovative because we're free\nUm think about it if if Steve Jobs his father had left Syria does anyone that apple would would now be the most valuable company in the world that it'd be a a\nHeadquartered in Damascus and the reality is that the U.S is where counted people are able to achieve great things because they're free the mistake\nAnd this has made I think by people on both sides they say the U.S has an innovation and innovative adds a technological edge them and in the U.S has no such thing\nFree individuals in the United states have a tendency to be very innovative ... this is not an American thing as an individual things that don't think the government can can can foster more of this this is about ... individuals to be great\nAnd that's what I'm Talking about I'm I'm saying if there was a way I've always thought the government should be like so I don't I don't ride horses a lot but I like riding horses when I can\nAnd I've always thought somebody was really good at it could sit on a horse hold the reins in his hand and not pull a whole lot if you're the kind of guy or gal who has to take those range and yank them around to get the horse to do what you wanted to do\nThen you're pretty bad at it if you're really good at it you just kind of give a little direction here and there and you're mostly stay out of the way you know laissez faire approach to this\nOf course he just like the people left alone\nLeft to their own devices allowed to prosper have a tendency to prosper and and and what's important here is is that we want this to happen in global why is the U.S so great\nInterest as an innovative power yes our people are free but think about what our innovations have meant for the rest of the world that was the world impoverished by the fact that Microsoft was\nHeadquartered in Seattle that Amazon's Seattle that Apple's basically Cupertino, California can I throw in Nike is based in Portland, Oregon none in the world has been made better off by genius and say you look at this in a broad sense the beauty and happy having markets open\nIsn't it means that the innovation it's as though it happened right next door even though I've never lived in Portland I wearing Nike shoes all the time and I'm Better for it even though I've never lived in Cupertino\nI and in in much better more productive person thanks to apple and so what we want is not American innovation we won global innovation we want that Steve Jobs around the world to be achieved a great things like how much better living standards will be counted people from around the world are free to be great\nThrive in fact I've never seen Nike written up this way maybe somebody has but I'm not aware of it but they're right in my backyard and I have great admiration for the company although I think their choice will call and cabinet goes could rather sad\nBut as a spokesman but have you noticed a you'll correct me on this but I think they first made their first shoes in Japan\nAnd then they moved out of there and I believe they went to Taiwan and then they went to China and I think they went from China to Vietnam they might have had to stop in Korea South Korea at some point but what happened was every time they went into a place\nWhile Americans can sneer at making five dollars a day sewing soccer balls or whatever it is\nThey have to accept that all the third world countries that were I was born a third world country I was born in Taiwan and it was definitely a third world country when I was born there and fifty nine\nToday it's one of the biggest producers electronics on the planet I think it's half the laptops or Ninety percent of the desktops are made now in that one tiny little country why well there was a time when sewing shoes are blooming Jews was was a good job and and as as their economy rose because of that activity\nThey said oh we don't need to make shoes anymore and I said and we don't need to pay these prices anymore they moved on but it was almost like Nike has it moved from place to place was like an economic lawnmower you know you what you left behind was a you know in a society that had the opportunity to make laptop computers that they might never have had\nA couple of decades American tennis shoes\nOh absolutely I mean he he put it very well yes Nike started the first place country which their shoes or manufacture well it wasn't that Japan Japan was destroyed by World War two and so they started making shoes for people like Nike\nAnd then as you say they move to different countries I I Love the story about Vietnam simply because the people who worked in their factories these alleged sweat sweat shops first began by walking to work then they bike to work then they wrote scooters\nThe people who worked in their factories these alleged sweat sweat shops first began by walking to work on a bike to work then they wrote scooters to work by the end they're driving cars to work I think about it and you look at China Today is as you well know platinum and born in Taiwan and China was once it\nDesperately poor country Nike that is I think it according to shoot dog which I Know you've read\nPhil Knight set in there that that's where they manufacture more peril and issues than anywhere in the world I think about what a transformative impact Nike is hat and so I'm really saying OK we've got all these innovators and the United states dead or in the world\nI Want innovators flow around the world to do great things because the better the United states per se it doesn't matter where some things made if our markets are open will benefit as does ... next door I wear Nikes all the time is not never let me call\nJohn it's a pleasure to have you on and thanks for the work to do it freedomworks\nThanks for having me\nFlora and glad to have you on this John Tammany with us by the way I Want to tell you about a product that I fell in love with more than Twenty years ago in fact in about a week Keenan I'm Mark one full Twenty years\nOf sleeping on sleep number bed every night how does a great night sleep improve your performance\nHow 'bout more energy less brain far better mood and more productivity I can speak to that personally the news sleep number three sixty smart bed I sleep on one so does Tina\nHelps everyone from parents to pro athletes to talk show host improve their daily performance ... great quality sleep my sleep number setting is sixty five Fifteen is is a forty five\nBut that's the beauty of the bed it adjusts on both sides so couples are all happy sleep number beds led to choose your ideal firmness and the new beds are so smart they send your every move and they automatically adjust to that keeps you sleep in great all through the night\nSo it's just as I say just I'm not trying to minimize it but if it's attention seeking behavior\nAre we likely to see more of this kind of thing because you know this is this does terrorize people\nSee I I think we might see more and then you might see also the the dreaded copy cats and they were supposed to last all that is fair and free\nFor all the old school here there are three states future behavior you know the color of their says\nI'm going to say well I'm not surprised or they're going to have a history of either mental illness\nAre committing thoughts of colds or the oldest of their means motive up again and\nI'm you know those little be there's going to be talked about stuff on it or do something like this before or is it that where you know I always go back to the Unabomber uh the way the Unabomber ... years and nobody can figure out what he was\nHe couldn't they put it in his manifesto and as soon as his brother read it they knew he knew exactly what was it was his brother\nYeah because you recognize a lot of the uh what did you go ride that that line of crazy that that that's my brother he talks like that he writes like that and and he was he did a tremendous service and I guess I Wonder I Wonder did the time out loud\nWould you have the courage to say my brother is doing something really terrible that's taking people's lives\nI'm going to turn him in and I know the result of my turning a man is going to send him to prison I I don't have any doubt in my mind I Would do that if a family member was doing such as that but I Wonder if there are other people who would say no I just don't want to know about it and I and I don't want to be responsible for sending my my brother to prison for the rest of his life see\nWhen you look at the circumstances don't forget how many people remained in injured\nOn ... ... when they realize too was that was on his brother's mind his brother talked about that fit ... ... you know he felt so guilty but it took so long to figure out who it was but as soon as he saw the manifesto he took tournament\nWell and here's here's the other question I Know that let's say we find out I I put up a few possibilities on our Twitter pulled tonight is uh the left as the ride is it because of the election is it a garden variety nut case or is it a foreign factor it is beginning to sound like a garden variety nut cases based on the way they are because see\nGary for what little we know about Iran I'm Talking to Gary Byrne who's the author of secrets of the secret service in crisis of character 'em up a piece of pie in manila envelope that doesn't even you know conceal it weighed or a size or in shape seems almost designed to be identified easily\nAnd now that we're finding out the um\nThe CNN device was not even a real explosive device all those\nI'd easily and now that we're finding out the or\nThe CNN device was not even a real explosive device although some of these were they at least had the components to go off but none of them did go off\nSo desserts you if if this was a garden variety nut case he said I'm going to make something that looks enough like a bomb it'll scare people have to death but I don't want it to go off I don't want it to maim or kill people and I wanted to be fairly quickly and readily identified\nAnd the amount of tape you used on those bombs in the packages I'm willing to bet the FBI is going to find fingerprints DNA and all kinds of things is is somebody who's saying\nI Want to be caught and I want to be identified\nYeah there's also something else you just pointed out um you know he did he uses it gets us that's a sign of a mental condition um issue and it's almost like being compulsive would they put so much tape on it that's that's not a real bombed builder that somebody has got a lot of this year\nAnd a political leaders of the other angry\nThere detach and again when they figure out who this is you know there's certain things are going to be there and and there'll be there'll be somebody comes forward and says you know there's a the or the other record\nOr you know they'll have a record or history of anti government anti certain you know certain part of your politician and um so yes but all of that tape that's um that's the bomb building that's like craziness\nYeah and and I know people are going to say well those shows we need more mental health care we have hundreds of millions of dollars of mental health care the problem is you can't force it on people\nAnd so if the person won't ... ... yeah I really think we need to revisit the civil commitment laws because you know that I hear from families all the time who say we got a family member we know one of these days he's going to end up in one of these news stories but the cops tell us we can do nothing the lawyers tells we can do nothing\nIf we don't ... revisited the civil commitment laws I think it's not only unsafe for the general public but it's also unfair to the person who's mentally ill and we all say well we have to wait until you actually kill somebody or hurt yourself before you can do anything meaningful about Garry I appreciate the

T. A. D. that divides all economies into their consumption their investment consider China has been inflated the largest investment bubble ever created in history\nAnd then on top of which there's a lot of leverage nobody really knows how much that there is on the Chinese economy when you cut through it and the demand inside the country hasn't gotten to the place you work with support all this debt so I think there's only one painful way through this and that is that destruction Gordon\nCharles\nOr you know a number of countries are trying to manage their way out of crises tried to outgrow um problems in China certainly falls into that category and it seems as the article that John referred to in the beginning of the segment\nEssentially um you don't have very much upside potential for China really what it is is at best a straight line flat line gross found it just seems to me that it would have been much better for them to accept some medicine and have a crisis and then get over why aren't they doing that\nWell I I don't think that China really has the long a period of experimentation and history that we have in the west village is having lived through the many booms and busts so we could trace our modern economy that can be mid Eighteen hundreds we've had many painful depressions we've learned from some of the [noise]\nThere's just too much productive capacity in China assuming that they can sell their products and services\nDumped them around the world and places like the U.S where that's not going to happen anymore so there's a simple way through this you have to cut your capacity you have to encourage people consume more hundred countries and you've got to the to be forthcoming with how much debt truly have and if it's too much just go to the guy off the mark downs and\nThere has to be a redo the Chinese financial structure\nA garden are reading these charts I find I knew highlighted this to me China's retail sales don't look as bad as everything else does that make sense are they are they selling domestically [noise]\nI don't think they are John Doe their numbers tell you that they are so for instance they're saying the official national ... retail sales increased nine point two percent in September\nAnd the same month a sales of automobiles so Levin point six percent\nUm nickel sales were down the three months of all three months or a quarter and yet they're saying that a consumption has increased\nThat just doesn't make sense John especially when you start looking at the sales of other items which were also slapped or down\nSo I think that China has a real data problem in terms of what they're reporting to people but I think it got to do that in a sense because if people really knew the truth there wouldn't be panic if there'll be panic it would be the end of the economy so what they're doing is they're just trying to lie and basically get their way through a very difficult patch\nI don't think they can do at this time um and then we'll just have to say\nAll right they're buying the Brooklyn Bridge every thirty five minutes a child or what what is what's in it for us does this indication of failure I mean it's a it's a big two thousand eight here we're looking at this come our way we got defenses for how their equity collapse\nI well I think fortunately yes we do I mean one very good thing\nFences for how their equity collapse\nI well I think fortunately yes we do I mean one very good thing is the chairman Jay Powell the Federal Reserve has managed to get interest rates up above three percent of the ten year which means that in a China collapsed or China\nDowndraft we have room to lower interest rates and cushion the blow compared to other economies I think we're all in much better position than any other large economy it'll hurt is trying to go through this painful\nProcess economically I fear that a distraction might be suggested by the leadership there that some military adventure or whatever to distract the population of the semester poses an order\nIs certainly a very dangerous set of months here um but in the end I think the United states even if the Republicans do not maintain control that will survive the coming retrenchment far better than any other major\nCountry on guard and I'm checking with you because of that question before it's a Chinese Communist party capable of taking a recession because that cures this there they they they they've missed price their economy can they take a hit [noise] I\nThink that they believe that they can't and that's the reason why they have been playing the economy were too much cash\nYou know as you talked about just a few seconds ago China did not go through it's two thousand that everybody else did\nAnd eventually they've got to go through that and right now we're in a pretty good position because as Charles points out our interest rates have gone up we have moved to move them down again and we're very I think robust Korean so um you know whether China goes up or down you know we'll be able to get through this and we'll do very\nWell earlier today Charles that Gordon and I were corresponding and there was a report in the Financial Times that businesses have barred up to one hundred percent against their stock or that they they borrowed it they give it to the bank and they borrow against it but the stock market collapsed their assets have collapsed in the\nCentral government is looking to subsidize that collapsed as long as they can ... I Believe that that is not a sustainable model that's like Fannie Mae times a million correct that war that does not work\nIt certainly does not work and we really do unfortunately throughout China and the Asian and parts of Asia\nPeople do like the gambling liberated and do it with ... money is very dangerous [noise] um I Hope that our European banks which are also highly leveraged are not overly exposed to the China China best were there are American facts I think we're pretty good shape\nBut ana China collapse I think that like torture bank and other European\nBack to the blood

here in New York and in Israel and in Europe I hear they're different tax structure of DNA I hear that around the world you have to know what you're doing the ... are people attracted to the U.S version of a family office as opposed to a European have a good question I think Europe\nIn power on the case you know just so many different cultures which is also a problem is probably number one culture wise they don't always think the same that don't agree and taxation that they come from different countries are different rules it makes it very hard for the call invest go invest\nIf they

I felt that God just stopped me right in my tracks and just sit and watch this and I I watch the video and I said okay I'm going to prove this wrong right now I have for King James Bible\nOne is in my travel bag that's Twenty years old it goes everywhere that I go over the country and another one he's a hundred and fifty seven years old and it is in the top of my closet in my office and I pulled them all out late I'm On my desk\nAnd the first thing on the video said\nThat Isaiah eleven six have been changed now Isaiah eleven six is one of the most popular scriptures in the Bible it statues are made of it paintings uh songs Elvis sang about it I it is the scripture that says on the line and she'll lay down with the lamb you remember that\nGeorge guys do are classic\nFor anyone out there right now if you're listening in and if you think what I'm about to say is talk of a madman term or go on line the king James Bible dot com or Bible Gateway whatever it is and and punch up Isaiah eleven six and\nNow it says bill will\nGo ... no longer says the lion she'll lay down with the lamb it says the ...\n... ... it's in writing it says the wolf I've never heard of that\nOr at George when I saw that and I saw that in my Bible I nearly fell off of my chair I spent three years in Syria biblical studies\nI Know the scriptures and when I saw that I'm telling you right now I couldn't reconcile that I just couldn't believe what I was seeing and there it is\nAnd again don't take my word for it if if you're out there listening I get a hold of King James Bible or punch it up on line and you'll see it for yourself\nYou if you go and look at your Bible a hundred and fifty seven year old one yeah would you would say the walls\nAbsolutely and I've taken pictures of it and it's there that is ... ...\n... it is bizarre George it's I have no ax the only explanation and I still don't understand it and I have it in the in the new book\nThe only thing that I can take over this\nPerhaps this is linked to CERN which is the Large Hadron collider\nWhich was French a board out\nIn the work they're doing I Believe they're opening up portals she dimensional doorways\nMean I I remember as a kid the line\nThe board out in the work they're doing I Believe they're opening up portals she dimensional doorways\nI mean I I remember as a kid the lion lays down what's a lamb\nYeah then if you can get Tom on the air somebody to punch up for you and show you on screen what I'm saying and you'll see for yourself and you it's shocking it's really shocking to see it because anybody\nWho is heard that scripture you know it by heart it's one of the most popular scripture than the entire Bible and now it says ...\nCan you find it anywhere where it says the lion lays down with the lamb or is it just isn't the wolf all over the place\nIt is the wolf ate every Bible now however a friend of mine\nUh he has a YouTube channel ah his name is Chris and I thank you very much for finding this for me he actually found him and his YouTube channel is become one that getting see\nHe actually found something for me out like or encyclopedia biblical encyclopedia and he found the passage with the lion and that is the only place\nThat you will see it as something I had it will be in my new book stranger than fiction\n[noise] ... everything else George ... little ...\nI Wonder if it's going to change if he doesn't look at it every day for example if one day it's going to change to the wolf some\nOh it wouldn't surprise me one bit and furthermore the Lord's Prayer is now change what happens is that\nOkay the Lord's Prayer is our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name came from Cutler will be going on or if it's going to happen give us this their bread and forgive us for truck passes as we forgive those who trust pouch against us but leaders not into temptation delivered me will for\nThe money that came into power and the glory forever more right you've heard\nThat a million dollars of co pay it's changed now so now with our father which are and and I never heard it like that\nYep out you know and I came to come I Will be done in or\nIn or near where we live in earth you know you don't live in our ... is there some\nThing that changes these things\nYeah and I do believe without truly know the answer and even if I saw in front of my face I don't know I wouldn't know what I was looking at\nA but I Do believe that it is CERN and these the wave quantum computers that are working in concert and I think that it's earned it opens up the portal and see the way computers\nSomehow some way whether it is some way as crazy as all the sounds I assure you it's true that they have this ability to go back whether it's going back in time and changing that's I don't know but I can assure you of this for anyone out there who would say oh well that suggests\nThe Bible that are you going to make these changes coming off the printing presses and all that I'm Sorry I'm Talking about a hundred and fifty seven year old Bible that has changes in at a Bible that's been in my possession for years\nThat has changes in it now so that can't be resolved we meet in human understanding we can't resolve that and another thing that I find very interesting\nIs that the Lord's Prayer I have it on paper and a frame on my wall that was changed to what I just told you [laughter]\nAh but yeah I have Lord's Prayer that is carved in a stone in my home and that is not changed and it has not been changed so it's interesting to note\nThat what ever this technology is apparently it cannot make changes on something that is in stone or of some type of metallic substance or something like that another bizarre think George\nAh do you have any Roman numeral clocks in your home or do you have a watch with Roman numerals\nI think I Do I think I have a couple of watches what that\nOkay well I Want you to look at this a Roman numeral Nicole ... turned upside down so\nWhat is what has happened to them\nThis effect has now turned them opposite so they're upside down now so where you would see a in the five o'clock position you know that would look like a a V.\nThat's now turned upside down to where it looks like in a weird\nAnd again for anyone who thinks that this is crazy talk just look at your watches or your clocks and ... and another ... and I've taken photographs of this as well and people from all over the world are noticing this\nAnd they and other interesting thing I have some watches with Roman numerals that have been affected and changed yet I have a clock a Roman numeral clock\nOn my wall it my living room that have like metal pans for the a Roman numerals and that has not been changed to\nYou know we're going to have our ins to pull back on our website as we get some new software and I'll be able to pull people instantly bill\nAnd I would love to pull people on the lion leaves dealt with lamb and see how many people say that they agree that's what it was and then compare it to the statistics are yeah I've been in so overwhelming people would say that it that it was a little lion lays down with the lamb\nNo question about I mean the wolf is ridiculous it doesn't fit there's no way when you say that it just it makes no sense on\nGeorge when you look at it it just looks so odd it's not right now let me ask you this\nThat the e bay you're familiar with the da ... administration\nWell it's interesting that you say that\nBecause it was known as the drug enforcement agency that's why they were ... agents and now it is the

calls as well bill with this fall under the Mandela sect category of the actor jak collapse\nPeople thought he had died who he's dead now but during his day when he was very much alive everybody thought he was dead everybody you talk to his would that be part of the Mandela sacked\nI tell you that George I would venture to say yes I mean it's not just jak Polanski uh the Reverend Billy Graham ah Nelson Mandela habits you know what the name came from Jim Neighbors and various other\nUm stars like this or politicians or that or or you know people that are wherever and um [noise] it somehow we all had it wrong and thought these people had a guide ears are girl and you know a lot of those\nFolks that died in more recent years here and ah\nThere are people swear that they were a member of funerals for Billy Graham and televised specials and things of that nature and it's mind boggling\nAnd and really interesting that I could say is that\nThe devil is a master\nOf confusion and division so we're there is confusion there is division because if I say to you well George I think it used to say this or whatever and you're going to no no no it's always said that now we have confusion and division is going to come in and I really believe that\nThe source of this is demonic in nature and this is the ... I Can't take it in my opinion is part of the strong delusion and the great perception that has come on the earth I've had debate\nWith Bible scholars on other shows about this topic and they swear that none of the scriptures have been changed it all in fact the wolves fan all these other things that I'm an agent for the devil for saying this and\nIt it's mind boggling George and anybody that knows me and you know me well enough\nGot its first in my life\nI Am an agent for God I go all over this country helping people to be free from demonic garbage but yet there were people die in debates against me on things like this that just said no way you know you're twisting the scriptures around and nothing could be further from the truth\nWhat do they say the devils greatest trick is Rob making people convinced that he doesn't exist yeah\nYou know like [noise] and it's\nSo I'll tell you this is where we really have to [noise] and and I am poor people out there here what I'm saying there are now is the time to really get closer to God and ask us for discernment to know what is right and what is wrong with his true it is not who is true who is not\nBecause we are in an age of deception and it is only by the power of God and the guy so God and the protection of God that we're going to get through the things that are here and the things that are coming\nIt's actually kind of scary that so many people the great majority believes in the one thing and then there it is clearly in black and white something else and we swear up and down that they can't be\nYeah it's incredible it's mind boggling it truly is and\nPeople are free to believe what they want\nIt's not my job to try and put somebody's arm into believing something but it is my job by the power of God as a matter of God to speak truth and when something like this comes along I Can't remain silent on it because I feel I have an obligation to people\nThat tell the truth and as disturbing as they say is I'm Sorry it's the truth that people need to get ready and prepare for this\nLet's start with a ... year old truck driving in Indiana\nThat's the thing is I'm Sorry it's the truth and people need to get ready and prepare for this\nLet's start with the bones drove truck driving in Indiana they're going to start an age oh go ahead\nGeorge good thank you\nThis stuff\nIs very it is free you know the\nGuy I remembered as the land myself to fall in my mind on that but that's part of an effect because I think that's a fact of the actual like material will just follow not dislike the quotes there's a famous movie line some change from Denver\nSome song lines and like scripture and stuff like that but like there's a there's a tree over close to my house there the other like the family or any of the people that live there for ... and all of a sudden there's this fact kidding\n[laughter] that's funny\nOh this time of the things are there so I just wanted a pop up there so\nFar I think it would that be part of a Mandela Effect where everybody doesn't even recognize the tree and it's their\nGeorge there are people that are reporting stuff like that that they're seeing a you know things that were never there before or they're they are seeing I'll give you another example for breeze you know that that to air freshener for breeze\nYes how'd you spell that\nI'm a I'm just guessing but it's I Would have said F. E. B. R. E. Z. E.\nYeah that's how it was and that's not how it is now they've dropped it needs to be are easy for breads now [laughter] and ah you know barren Bernstein bears\nIs now parents staying there are

this neighborhood\nThat's weird my mother has a Bible that has got to be a hundred plus years old maybe even more I mean it is huge\nAnd the ... the covers leather and all it's one of those things you see in an old movie it could be two hundred years old for all I Know yeah but if that plays the lion and the lamb has changed to the walls all freak out\nI'm going to have ...\nYou have to let me know and I guarantee you that it's changed so I'll guarantee you on the air right now in front of all these millions of listeners that you will find when your mom open Bible she is going to find that it has changed\nNow is it physically change if we all agree that it was the lion in the lamb and it was there in Prince and black and white audited physically change\nThere is some type of this is coming down to quantum physics in my opinion and this is way out of my league it's it's way above my understanding and taking\n... as we said in the navy\nNow way above but I I really truly feel\nThat it it must be a combination of this CERN device which opens the portals up\nAnd they used the way of quantum computers that work in concert with that and somehow now again this is quantum physics thing ... that says hey I had all these different things that are so far beyond my understanding\nBut that is the only thing you would have to be something that really is on the border of supernatural that kid

his wedding gift and this I Know we know this because they took the opportunity to send that vaccine let her over to the Boston Globe who got published I mean there are masters of PR yeah now what do you think president Cleveland it\nWell I Would guess chip to board\n[laughter] well listen as we said the letter comes to him and it says honored sir we take the liberty city by express today an

you sent me as a wedding present I accepted as an evidence of kind ceiling and friendship and Kim ... fourth ingenuity but hardly think that I shall neatly testers powers to disclose the path and forecast the future\nWhat he did take it or knew he was he gets he took it I Would leave censored back\nWell there's no there's no history of that now we don't know where that board it but let's just tell you what happened fast forward a few years for four years\nThey are now Eighteen Ninety and a group of businessmen and one businesswoman dot together and came up with their own board version of it and they got it named and talk about this woman here her name is miss Helen Peters not for the\nAnd they consider her a gift tax psychic and she sat at the board and the message came through and it said they asked what should we call you wish we call this tool this for this device it's spelled out we job\nThey they decided let's go we do so\nAll you wish we call this tool before this device\nSpelled out we Jeff [noise] they they decided let's go ... so ... so they needed to get it patented so in Eighteen Ninety they went to the U.S patent and trademark office allies your bon the attorney for this group went along with miss Helen Peters they sat down at the board because they had to prove\nTo the Patton officers that this tool works everybody kept saying no I'm not going to do that no I'm not going to register is not this this is ridiculous finally the head guy came out and said okay you don't know me I don't know you if that thing there could spell out my name\nIs George what he thinks that it's all the others and sure enough and the ... came alive\nNow didn't spell out his name was somebody on the planet ... where he probably would have accused him of doing something or did it work by itself\nYou know you have a plan to have to let\nYeah you ... so it started out they didn't know him and it was that you know that's how the story goes so\nThis woman miss Helen Peters not for the uh it's really critical of crucial to the naming of the board and also to get it patented and a lot of people didn't know about it until about six years ago when Robert merge the chairman of the board of the talking about ... dug up an old archives\nStories and letters about her and so it's just we were honoring her just last month in uh Denver, Colorado and gave her a beautiful gravestone with everybody everybody's and that was hard at her and buried in her plot their names are on it\nUm she was just on her she was just lost to history but we resurrected her and her family was so grateful and thankful and\nAnd now she's going to be well no and she's going to go on the heritage a group of people who do tours in his grave yard is called the Fairmont cemetery in Denver, Colorado and she's going to be remembered and recognized for her contribution to this device forever\nHow do you explain to somebody called on the show a couple of years ago and talked about how to get rid of all read you board the proper way he felt and it was to burn it\nAnd he said as he was burning it she could see little sparks offered and screams she heard screams coming on the board you believe up\nWell okay so I have the stories right and again I'm gonna I'm gonna references again we all have our stories based on our perceptions belief\nOn how the world her own fears our own desires and so I mind is a powerful thing it can create many things that we can't even truly measure and understand and we don't fully understand awareness or consciousness and how we might even affect our worlds to create in our manifest yet I'm going to say that the story but\nWhat I Will comment on some board don't work very well because it might be made I made the night and the worst thing to do is really burn a board I mean you can sell that on ... could have sent it to us at the talking where it's dark all society will take 'em and we'll refurbishing and sell them they've given to a loving home they really wants to protect us the history and heritage of these devices\nSharing what's the oldest board you recover crush\nWell for me and my oldest boy the circuit Eighteen Ninety to Ninety three board so I got 'em raft they've started to start being made in Nineteen Ninety One and production minds one year after that story\nHow do you explain this back in St Louis when I'm doing my night talk show must be Nineteen Ninety seven through Nineteen Ninety eight\nSomebody gets me a Wi Fi board I've got it in my studio now I'm going to do a little bit with them and I've got a producers there\nAnd this ... board is in the studio with me\nThat I never had any technical issues with in the studio all of a sudden everything is going wrong what commercials I couldn't play him because the computer board went though the board that monitors middle my voice levels that was all screwed up the lights were going out I didn't know what was on what was off\nIt was weird and I finally told my producer Howard into Thomas in our word gifted thing on the year he took it out and within two minutes everything pop back up worked in the computer the board everything and I want this is weird anyways what I didn't know at the time was Howard\n... widow news guy named Daryl than how word game Darryl\nLuigi board he said and done George authors you try to get the story touch it as a gift I didn't know that\nAnd I'm not sure if that works and I was fine uh about two days later Darryl is no longer employed at the radio station which was kind of strange what he's gone\nAnd I won't bore that is weird or\nAgain not knowing that he had the ... board\nI I run into him about a week and a half later\nIs at a restaurant and I went Darryl ... surgery or heard you're not one of those anymore and they weren't George nothing has gone right with me ever since our gave me that we'd you board I got fired I lost my relationship\nOr can't get a job I got rid of the thing and hopefully things will get better how do you explain that\nWell it's always all too easy to point the finger at something out there then to look at yourself you know maybe the filing down any way on a path of not doing very well working there or maybe he wanted\nWell what about the studio thing with me in the beginning well I you know\nWe want to blame the law by something that you want to make a mysterious you don't want to look at something logically first it was ironic that it it's\nVery I think I Would I have to give you that George but I gotta say we we we ... the ... the Ford because it's so controversial\nAnd it just causes all kinds of meetings and and visceral reactions in people we've really got to look at um what's really going on inside herself and what's really going on in the world around us and not just quickly jumped to say to Ford did it but that happens too often because it's almost easier like end is to blame for that external\nAnd to think that's the reason that now hold on is another way to think about this too\nWe create a lot of things we could just had the thought in our mind that ... is scary dangerous bad and then we can draw those things to us just for the power of our mind but some power of unconscious mind and then send her on and go I told you the it's like self fulfilling prophecy\n[noise] I don't know I don't know you know all these years I've known you Karen you haven't been able to convince me yet to use the ... board\nAh I Know it that happens sometimes\nI mean would you be wrong\nCould you be wrong and there's something very wrong about what aspect of it\nThat it can conjure up evil spirits let's say\nThat you can ... anything evil in your mind and I think evil exist in the heart of humanity I hate to say that evil than people they're evil all over the world look around it's people cause evil [laughter]\nWhat I say is evil is not a force outside yet we can draw these energies to withdraw other evil people too if we can have evil things happens and they are real bad evil things\nBut then the the mean just because you get a piece of wood out or cardboard or there's numbers on a piece of paper or letters that that's going

and reach into the unseen dimensions if from when they came and where we go again I definitely believe in an afterlife with it for life and in between five\nAnd so I came into this world as a very young child things they're having imaginary playmate having positive experiences with them as well and I knew there was something so much more and for me that we became kind of my lifeline to have a connection that contain throughout my whole life [laughter]\nUm so it becomes just that permission allow me become my allowance become my a gateway or becomes just a channel I used to do and I actually can do I mean I did this as a child\nThat they put that stuff away to get older and grow up and were told not to do that not to talk to being that aren't there are imaginary playmate and go to school and I was told those things\nI found myself putting in a way that this is the one tool that worked really well for me to be able to have a communications and in this day I'm I have communications that I used to have the child but and I could do it on the board in off the board and I know it's not the board that let me do this\nIt's my self with my ... my beliefs about the ... my allowance of the buildings to come through and this again just become that kind of a door that threshold that left me moving around and interact with them\nHow often do you use the board\n[laughter] not as much as I used to I did a lot of work George direct channeling uh with my voice or writing off the board more often than I mean the board that I use the board would say that one every two weeks

questions about it\nWhen you travel with the ... board does anybody free go\nWell yes [laughter] yes they do it\nYeah you know you can always hide them um and I do to help my boards I always have a traveling more with me and if I don't have one mistake forgot one which has happened all you gotta do is get a piece of paper right the letters down put the numbers down yes and no in a way you go with the coin\nOf the rest of the several hours gonna fly by so let's get some calls in before you Karen Angie in Ohio welcome to the program I N G\nI think you taking my call that we\nSee borders going straight back when I was a teenager I had a boyfriend that he could do out of body experiences and his family has really religious and they didn't like the thing to to practice and they put him at home for a while while and me if I had a week ...\nAnd I had been I actually I Do\nHe said well if you talk to me I can leave my body and I can come visit you so one night me and my girl her baby my partner and stir\nAnd after they went to that we decided to try it and it was a really calm and quiet night it was warm and the windows open the front door of phone you know it was early eighties we really nothing to be afraid of ...\nAnd we're trying to talk to him next thing we know we heard a weird noise and the front door the screen door open\nAnd there was no way can open so we jumped up and when he planned the doors are locked and just started shutting all the windows because we're like oh my gosh somebody tried to come in the next day he called me because for good behavior he was allowed to make calls so he called me and he says why just shut the door on me\nSo what are you talking about he gives you tried to talk to me last night I came down and shut and we're on me at that that that I get rid of the week do\nYou ever look at things in a grudge\nYou Angie [laughter] that's a I I Love when she shared it and what I've learned about the border over the years is that you don't you can talk to people's higher so\nYou can talk to people that are still alive you can talk to him animals that are alive or to these so it's an it's what it is it's really too you're communicating with their consciousness you communicate with that part of themselves that exist\nLike the higher self that exist beyond their corporate ... existence or experience and so you start having these other dimensions of a person so I don't one bit doubt that you can do that as I have done that myself\nAnd that one didn't have a real bad in doing you know and I think\nShe just put yourself because it is kind of weird at first we start doing this and you go wow I thought that person is still alive isn't\nAboard the use of the deceased person will no I learned that this board can

able to board the board shoulders man these people and no one really there was more judging being going through that board\nThey ever go up there and you know were warned not to have\nCommunication

gut feelings your heart feeling we'll talk about ... and you're got or he has he has sneaking suspicion something was right or wrong\nThat the abilities and how that turns out and humans life we often have will have dreams of prophecy will have 'em sock of like something just doesn't feel right here or gosh I've known the person for years\nIt's those things I'm Talking about when I was born people use the word on this level of using the Ford you're able to bring out your own six sensibilities\nSo these people using the tools were able to tap into that weather is there any a motor using a subconscious mind which includes\nThese abilities of psychic abilities or medium ship for um even just tapping into just your your knowing this\nOr that can cause a spirit now I'll ... I'll dressed the second part of that he talked about you were told\nNot to do this often told not to do things that will\nKeep us in control and keep us down\nAnd so what I found as we are told you have to have an intermediary to talk to spirits you have to meet in a merry intermediary to talk\nTo God and I find that I have a direct connection to all these beans which has been nothing but loving and beautiful so with all due respect you and I disagree with you but I think we both can have an opinion because you're gonna find George\nThat's the extreme and on the other extreme you'll find people in the middle to and that's OK\nGerges schools down halls firehouses police stations any where people can gather commemorating the end of\nThis is a nationwide effort designed to honor all Americans\nWho served our country hundred years\nListen for some of the world war one history on UD's a journal program aired on five Seventy W on a daily and re thirty PM\nBeginning October twenty nine of them so that was sponsored by march ... ... s K C I insurance Larson carbon ... funeral home during the cold or by\nSomebody who\nGranted when Katie beside here costs to own a car truck and as you be America's Best selling brand it's four o'clock\nIn the news on the hour sponsored by their works relief I beat her king hours ...\nPolitical violence has no place in this country President Trump has taken that message to a campaign rally in ...

the big challenge it because it's out of fight it's out of mind for a lot of people and there's people need to be consistently reminded\nAbout the importance of the inland waterways system so it's great that we're back into this every year cycle that we've we've passed this legislation and I really think it it hopefully sets the stage for when\nCongress convenes after the midterm elections well

bombing attempt if we can call it that none of the bombs went off but they were devices sent to a total of ten different addresses now and uh and use this as you wrote today an example of why no one trusts the media in America\n[noise] well I think a large that the abandoned which which the media\nGot out in front of what we know about\nSensitive which so far is not a whole lot um it was really staggering to me I mean to to the trench Eric determination to try to make this about Trump and even kind of vaguely or not so vaguely suggests that Trump\nSort of inside it this boy that his rhetoric is so unique and uniquely bad for the country that it might have driven somebody to do this is just really\nMind boggling all the peace coming out on a town coming out on National Review about his\nNight but you don't just when you when you move out of the world owes political uh talking points and narrative and soap opera like we deal with and you get into the real world of prosecutions on

matter how obnoxious or odious it may be and it really trivializes this kind of terrorists behavior to suggested it\nNoxious so odious it may be and it really trivializes just kind of terrorist behavior to suggest that it's driven by um something along those lines it's just foolish\nWell I guess it is it is a pretty easy jumped to make to say you have all of the bombs were sent to people who were you know in one way or another politically oriented toward the left for George Soros to Maxine Waters to the Clintons the Obamas and to CNN\nI guess it's not a far jumped to say well maybe it is

political motivation here yeah um but we will be able to say that whether Donald Trump was president or not and whether he had ever had a single rally or not my my piece\nIs not that you draw a conclusion that something's politically motivated when it obviously is my complaint is that you suggested the president's guilty if incitement Yup I happen to be one of the few people in America was actually a convicted people or at least one person I've been ...\nThe court and I can tell you that it's a very difficult in the courtroom as it should be\nBecause we have a strong tradition in this country of of free speech particularly political speech um but you know court will proof aside it's just it's it's simply common sense nobody goes to a political rally ... guard loss of how skilled stood demagogue\nBush or you know some other skilled speaker\nAt a rally may be and even if that person gets to the the crowd riled up\nAnd they say yeah I'm I'm really angry about what those people are doing to us is doing to our country nobody leaks from that just say and because of that I'm going to go now to commit mass murder attack well maybe they'll decide to go where you should doorbell or something but they're not going to go out and shoot up some or you know a\nBomb people into a into oblivion well\nThere there might even be people who say I\nWent out and punch somebody in the face because I'm so far to go to a political rally but then when you try to turn around and say and it's not my fault I didn't actually cause the person who riled up cause\nThat CNN buying into a a kind of

and resistance case where a ... a inspired people to go out and and the demand adept with baseball bats because he was black\nOr I I Would buy that you you might be able to do that but as you said it's a very specific case where you say you had to say I'm going to tell these people to go and commit these acts because of their angry over somebody's skin color and and they did prove it in that case I Believe and I don't I think that a pill that held up on appeal\nBut was CNN as you say all these other news sources saying all of this stuff is Donald Trump's called\nTwo days after the New

basically held was that if I say something insulting and insightful to you and your presence\nAnd you know turn around and uh and and clocked me on account of it um you know I had a minimal expectation of First Amendment protection because I insulted you and I kind of went looking for now again as I say\nI'm the doctor and has been cut back on a lot in recent decades but it's never been the case that that extended to you know you attend a political rally and then you are you know you go away from the rally and you have some distance in terms of time and space\nTo think about it and then you go out and commit an atrocious act and we say it's still it's the fault of the person who's rally you went to the simply it's essentially says that you have no agency for your own behavior
