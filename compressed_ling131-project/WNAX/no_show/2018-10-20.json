A. O. recounts that say if the postal service doesn't pay for pensions American taxpayers will so every dime they lose\nWhile they're under charging a customer is a dime a or a dollar or a billion dollars that American taxpayers are going to have to pay is there an argument to be made that were charging a fair rate to China and they shouldn't be paying more\n[noise] um\nThat's interesting question I mean I hadn't really thought about it in those terms I Will say that uh you know the post ...\nThere's nothing there's nothing that prevents the postal service for simply or the administration physically I'm In charge and kind of a larger rates which is what they may in fact eventually be doing as a consequence of this administration's a decision on this um this ... single the scent of wanting to China or that that that it may do that and that's\nBasically what they're ... attempt to do so if if the question is can we get more money coming into the U.S postal service that's actually a viable question and something that they may actually be looking to do was later on down the line\nBut this also has implications for well I guess for the way that trying to compete for the United states because as I understand it\nThe UP you this is the United nations agency a says we're going to allow a flat rate for packages up to four point four pounds so if somebody goes on Amazon and buy something from China\nAnd you know buy something and whether they know it's coming from China or not it shipped from China the packages for point four pounds that's two kilos or less uh then they get charged a flat rate\nAnd that that allows foreign companies to undercut us competitors who have to pay market rate well at least if they're sending things by FedEx or UPS or the other carriers in this country they pay market rate\nUm shouldn't shouldn't we did this does having an implication for people buying things because if you find all of a sudden\nThat you're going to have to pay more to ship things if they're coming from China that might actually make American goods are goods from other places competitive or they're not today and the only difference could be the shipping cost right\nThat's exactly that's exactly it and I believe that sort of the angle of the administration is looking at him in a lot of business organizations in the U.S have been making the Alps I see that argument that you know it's just simply unfairly trying to be able to do it this way and we need to do something differently and a lot of them are very pleased with the maturation is picking up the ah Fotouh\nOn this for like ... I guess\nI'm interested to and the implications for the postal service I mean I don't know how many packages are coming from China but given the volume that Amazon is selling I've a feeling it's probably a lot and if you you know if every one of them cause another dollar dollar and a half to show\nA that would not only have implications for U.S companies that are trying to sell to American consumers but it would it have an in an ... an implication for the postal service to have all of a sudden the rates went up to something that's more like a market rate and they were a bit higher on a few tens of millions of packages that could make a big difference\n\nIs that now you're exactly right on that point it could it could make a substantial difference I mean it was part of the thing well what's interesting about the Trump Administration is that they are\nBasically sort of turning over all these rocks hum of\nIssues that people have looked at her thought about a long time and forcing people to uh to to deal with them and ... is again is another one of those sort of interesting cases where they're doing that with their forcing because this has been something that's been going on in the sort of process for decades and then the first one to say hey wait a minute why are we doing it this way maybe we should do a different way and that's one of the interesting things about the restoration\nWell especially because and this has gone on from sixty nine to president we've essentially had no no difference in the rates that are being charged flat rates that are being charged for shipping packages is that they use that the case or has there been some kind of inflation escalator and that over the over the last forty or fifty years\n[noise] I don't know if it's been I don't know if it's been adjusted for inflation or not I mean there's a ... I Believe the rate has remained the same whether whether that's a you know works I I don't actually know the exact mechanism whether it works as a percentage or not I'm not sure but the rate has remained consistent whether or not it it's a percentage of\nSean you you sound like you're a bit younger than me but\nWould you like to be paying a for gasoline let's say what you were paying in Nineteen sixty that if you were buying gasoline and I I was mowing lawns so I was buying gasoline in Nineteen sixty nine and I know what it costs then and I know what it costs now I'd love to have Nineteen sixty nine gasoline rage or rent\nI remember my parents used to be a hundred dollars a month for a very nice house\nFor rent and and I'd love to be paying a hundred dollars a month to rent an apartment all but a lot of other Americans would do\nWhy is it that until we get a real business man in office like Donald Trump nobody any of these administrations as a you know Bush or Clinton or or or a bomb or anyone else has said hey maybe we should bring that raid forward why are we still charging the Nineteen sixty nine right\nIt's I mean it it's and that's a good question and the answers that as with so many things it's just so much easier to say a fine whatever let's\nLet's just let it let it be and move on to something else if someone more pressing um and just not deal with it I mean there's there's so many sort of things that just haven't been looked at are dressed or talked about in a long time um and this is another one of the sort of issues and it was a lot of things that they brought up and when they were talking about it\nYou have a tree you know the NAFTA deal and other things that people haven't talked about are dressed in a while and it\nDoes it in yeah I mean it's the answer your question is\nPeople should have people should have been looking and asking these fundamental questions and there's just that sort of mindset of the standard sort of Washington but never really bother to do it and what things about Trump is that he\nDoesn't subscribe to that mindset of many sometimes he goes a little bit of a off the edge and on some areas but other times you know take somebody who thinks that way to sort of a look at these issues and say\nUh off the edge on some areas but other times you know pick somebody who thinks that way to sort of a look at these issues and say\nYou know do we really need to do it this way I mean you know the skills to NAFTA negotiations for a good example I mean it's a long time people they're all saying well it's going it's working fine we need to address the scrutiny trucks about Trump's it you know I'm going to see what happens yeah that's exactly what you're doing that again with this issue\nBut it just kind of stunned me because I have a feeling there isn't a company out there in the private sector who doesn't say what are we charging for this is that what our competitors are charging is that what the market will bear and maybe back in Nineteen sixty nine I don't know how much stuff was getting shipped from China I mean before\nUh before Nixon even sort of opened opened us up an open China so we had better relations with them I'm not sure how much stuff was getting shipped anyway probably not nearly the volume today but\n[noise] yeah I mean other than that almost twelve million dollars I'm just under half of that is for historic assets alone so you know do that as you mentioned the lodges that cabins places that we use and the memories that we have of these parks um culture landscapes the battlefield cemeteries all of that I'm\nI'm all of that as a part of that that um that maintenance backlog now\nLet me ask you this because I'm always want to run the numbers my wife and I buy an annual pass over here and I think it's Seventy five or eighty bucks and it was a very good deal if you're just going to go to one of the ... one time on one day every year I think you pay thirty bucks what did you buy Seventy five or eighty dollar proud and maybe a little bit more now\nThat they would uh you know that that let you go to any national park you want all year long and it's a it's a pretty good deal\nAnd I feel that part of this bill should be paid by everybody in America because they're available to everybody but those of us who want to use the bar to pay a little bit more and I don't think that's necessarily wrong I don't think the visitors should pay the entire job nor do I think the taxpayer should pay the whole town\nIs there a way and I keep wanting twelve billion ... billion a year on top of whatever we're spending now in the poor maintenance we're doing right now we we would catch up and about a decade which wouldn't be a bad gold shoot for denies do it in five years instead of ten where you could do that\nSo many people visit all of the national parks in a way that would cause them to pay an entry for your show their past you know\nThat's a great question I Know that millions of people go to the parks here and I think what this restore our parks um legislation does which has bipartisan support is that it it doesn't\nYou know job or a ... additional burden on the taxpayer and in fact\nThe six point five billion dollars which the legislation proposes um towards is almost twelve billion dollar deficit over five years comes from federal middle revenues so this is on showing offshore oil and gas I'm so these are things that we um those funds that are already there but they're not\nEarmark right now for national park to allocate it to other programs but I'm ...\nI'm not a federal budget expert either Monica but if they if money wasn't going to the park to would go to the general treasury and it'd be available for all the other stuff the federal government bars right\nYeah well the way it is fun to I mean what we are proposing is to to reallocate these funds to to the park so it's not necessarily um you know pulling drawing down our adamant increasing burden on the taxpayer\nAnd what it does is it is to identifying a pot of money that we haven't thought about that could benefit the national parks and and I think\nYou know what that does of course is with this um six point six and a half billion dollar ... sons I think on the back and and you know you're talking finding um it's always return on investment right so investing this as a country or what are we going to get back for it\nAnd you know to that I went to me will will have the you know the statue of liberty I Will be preserved and that has\nA a backlog that maintenance Vaclav right now Ellis Island and we know how important um you know that was a stopping point in our American story um we know that places like the Little Rock Central High school um in in in Arkansas yeah that's a historic site and brown v board of education at that ...\nYou know these are the historic places that tell our story and so we have a ... we have places we can go to talk about um who we are as a country and to get to the numbers of things I mean um we had an analysis done by the\nCat and his group and they found that if the if this legislation passed\nIt would create a hundred and ten thousand infrastructure related jobs and so that directly impacts local and caught enemies national parks are part of and so I Would say you know\nBy redirecting these funds it's a it's an immediate return on investment for with these local communities can get and the job they create um by just restoring\nYou didn't return on investment um so what these local communities can get and the job they create um by just restoring places that we already know hum are important to to who we are as a country\nSo Monica who's opposing it\nYou know a right now there is a bipartisan support so it's all on both sides I think right now where you were trying to get through and we're hoping\nTo get this legislation passed in the next month or two after the election um to to really get boots on the ground and get to work around around that were were you\nKnow kind of caught into I'm ... now and let's face it down and shut committee that's coming out of that still but we you know need Congress to act right now a ticket to address\nSo ... is it something that they've already got bipartisan support it should be a done deal done is anybody playing politics with those same World War not doing that until you do something else\n[noise] you know I'm ... I'm Out let's say I'm I'm sure that that is the case [laughter] but I you know I Would also argue that yeah I I I'm a big huge preservation jak yeah of course that we're to the national trust\n'em you know but you know preservation is a is a bipartisan I'm a you know it's it's good for Republicans and Democrats like it's good that\nWe all care about our heritage I just hope that I think it would be hard for somebody to oppose it on a true\nBut I I just figure on Capitol Hill they don't even agree to go to lunch I'll go to launch my farm bill while I'm not going to lunch with you unless you vote for my damn bill a\nKind of Monica it's a pleasure thanks very much and keep up a good work owners see those parts kept in good shape that is Monica roads\nAssociate director of the crew the national trust her to shore preservation tell you what have you been told the only way for your kids to succeed just go to college you're going to want to hear this next interview on the Lars Larson show [noise]\n\nI'm Jay foreigner CEO of Quicken Loans America's premier home purchase lender\nWe've created a new way to protect you from unpredictable interest rates are exclusive rate shield approval first we lock your interest rate for up to Ninety Days then if rates go up your rate stays locked but you've rates go down your rate drops either way you win callers today at eight hundred quicken or go to rocket mortgage dot com\nRacial upheaval only about two and three year fixed rate loan solver cost information and conditions people having liquor license and all the states and I'm like thirty thirty initial conditions or exclusion may apply\nIf you had frequent heartburn take control of it with ... that go deep sea birds stashing in accidents everywhere like in your junk drawer buried under all batteries and hotel man or your parents' dining in one pocket you won't jak you even had in Africa and you're not then which are very hard to see in the dark\nYou stop basking in Athens and started taking pilots that go to the one pill a day twenty four hours zero heartburn\nBumbling trying to think a key thing is the director for fourteen day not for me I mean\nHere's the story of Laura ... who only wants to play the love of the game\nPro scouts came to a bunch of games where Lawrence was playing\nBut he also learn how to get them a lot of money on car\nSo he didn't say\nWhat's your story has a happy ending after all\nThe backyard looking great Rob thanks man I was planning on adding a deck to no one could contractors why don't you just have a comment by\nHome advisor dot com you just tell them about your project and they match you with local pros that can do the job\nHow much does a con home advisors totally free to use plus you can read customer reviews Chuck pricing and look appointments for free what's the website again home advisor dot com or just download to bring home advisor having\nFind somebody to you and I asked why there\nAre lots of sunshine still expected for most of the week this week from Saturday through Tuesday but then heading into Wednesday it looks like any changes in our forecast has will expect some cloudy skies and even a chance for some scattered rain showers as far as temperatures go\nOur average time for this time of years around sixty three and we should be reaching that as we head into Sunday but for most of the week we will be below average but now let's focus on our forecast\nFor tonight Los dropping down to the low forties under mainly clear skies then on Saturday warming up to the upper fifties as well as the lots of sunshine throughout the day and dropping back down into the low thirties overnight\nAs we head into Sunday through Tuesday lots of sunshine with temperatures ranging from the upper sixties to mid to upper fifties I meteorologist Jeff nerdy and on radio five Seventy seven you any acts right now it's fifty four [noise]\nTurnover crushes productivity turnover lowers morale turnover\nCruises profitability\nIf your company would like to cut turtle race by twenty five percent or more use radio\nRadio allows you to talk with better qualified candidates radio allows you to recognize your employees and increase team building turn over your turnover problems to radio for more information to contact leakers here that WMD ex radio\n\nYou read a PET scan weeks and weeks just out of the week with a three can double you'll be ... from ... to ...

when he ran a\nYour females in a moment at eight six six four three nine five to seven Seventy males go to talk Lars Larson\nDot com if you think about it Americans are fighters\nI mean we had to fight to win our freedom from Great Britain we had to fight to keep the country together in the civil war we've had to fight off enemies of all kinds and in fact\nAmerica's fought at least a couple of times in the first and Second World War Z to be able to keep the country and the world safe\nAnd of course during the Cold War you know the war with no uh no shooting thank goodness we had to fight a quietly to be able to prevail over an enemy that had vowed our destruction\nSo the book why we fight by Dr Sebastian Gorka defeating America's enemies with no apologies is very very important as far as I'm concerned Dr ... it's a pleasure to have you back on the program\nFor having me love you begin by saying the apology tour is finally over before we get to what Donald Trump he's doing for America tell us what you think was done in the previous presidents tenure oil\nOr the Obama administration made a conscious decision very early on the big problems in the world\nAre are America's fault whether it's global warming whether it's terrorism we are really to blame about why the first\nThings but for low bottle it did was to go on the global apology to all all that that ended um side or the ... ... did the previous eight is seen\nAmerica withdraw from the world and the bad guys take the front seat whether it's Russia invading the Ukraine whether it's ... by the weather is three minutes a rising China whether it's the the the mullahs in Iran getting\nStrengthened by Obama's Iran deal that has been replaced with in America for strategy I'm not good for all Americans and it's very good for a ... of our lives as well\nI'm anxious to talk about what you think that the Donald Trump is doing I Know I have my own impression but you had the chance to work with him as a as a former assistant to the president but do you have any inkling as to why Americans didn't respond more forcefully\nWhen our previous president a bronco Obama decided that he would simply take America to second or third position and we would no longer take the kind of preeminent role that we've taken for much of the last hundred years why didn't Americans react more\n[noise] I think if the cause we we allow the left\nTo take control of the political culture for the last forty years so you know as you think about the ... the ... the dean do on a ...\nA became tenure professors in Chicago after being leaders of the weather but on the ground terrorist organized station when you think of the political correct lift that left controls Hollywood\nThat made there in general academe the press I I think there was a lot of brainwashing out there I mean just look at the polls that the victims of communism foundation recently polled millennials and forty two percent of millennials said they'd like to live in a social the United\nStates so if you Andrew Breitbart was so right if you if you've seen the the cultural\nTerrain then politics will follow\nAnd by the way bernadine during and bill airs it's worth noting that Morocco Obama launched his campaign from where the fund raiser and a get together at the home of ... who is as you point out a terrorist and and and for some reason connections to other kinds of groups are frequently used\nUh to to a dam or to slur or a political candidate in that case\nOr his connection to bill layers which continued and he had quite a connection it wasn't just getting together and his home but he had he had quite a few connections to build layers in running out one of the ... education foundations that bronco bomb was involved in before he became a U.S senator\nAnd Americans I guess shrug dirt or didn't know or didn't care [noise]\nWell I you know I don't know if they shrugged buildings load and ... the media covered it up I mean Obama alive he said oh I don't I didn't really know bill as\nHe's just live close by that's the law is as you stated they were on the board of the same five oh one C. three foundation so when when when you have almost\nAll the media in your back pocket that you can get away with all kinds of stuff I mean the the sick the funds in the ... of the media under the Obama years we've never seen\nAnything alive in America before\nI'm Talking to doctors ... former deputy to the president of the United states Donald Trump his latest book why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies so let's talk about this ... the left has has painted Donald Trump as a candidate and now still is trying to paint Donald Trump as president as\nA man who's going to take us into another war well your answer that criticism blaze\n... uh open your eyes every body look around and uh\nWe we have North Korea before the president came in to the oval office continue to build nuclear capabilities legally launching ballistic missiles over the sea of Japan now off the\nSixty five years things that Donald Trump we are on the tough that's potentially of ending the Korean War not just with an armistice but with a peace treaty and I'm just seeing the potential\nDenuclearize they shouldn't\nTalk the whole peninsula look at look at Russia\nWith a peace treaty and just seeing the potential to denuclearize they should both the whole peninsula look at look at Russia Russia is back in a box they will try to stabilize various regions around the world\nWe have a president who says enough is enough we've even killed three hundred ... raised in Syria to send a very strong message to Moscow but we will not allow you to destabilize important parts of the world\nAnd in fact today we're seeing a story breaking about possible assassinations by the Russians are by others are on the news in this world let me ask you a straight out question Dr ... got you study this for a long time\nIs it fair to say that probably every one of the countries on this planet of any size does engage in assassination from time to time not necessarily a political figures but\nPeople are killed you need to be killed to protect our national security do you think as much as we might hate to admitted that that that probably does happen and that is not just Russia and China and other countries but that we do it as well\nI wouldn't say there's a widespread trends but\nIf there are no other options if your cattle extradite him for last law actually permits if somebody\nHas committed a terrorists to trust the theories about two and they're all the ... the territory of another ... country refuses to a ... extra died though but you are you permitted by international law to use deadly force against that individual that's one of the principles we use certainly with the bin Laden in Afghanistan\nOr it'll Tobar of two thousand Milwaukee\nSo yeah so I mean if if your national security is in jeopardy you're not going to hold a press conference or or have happened to go she Asians with with a rogue regime it it's the survival of the nation may be at stake\nSo tell me that is what do we need to do to really make this country safe and fight back the way you write about\nSoil look I I Am and why we fight I go through the country by country threat by threat whether it's trying to whether it's ... whether it's Russia\nFirst things first we have to rebuild them at a tree we have to ... yeah the ... we have to load that their slabs doing many cases you can do what they wish to do to America and then ... you know part of the book is why we fight them why was the stories of for American heroes that as\nDr ... let me ask you about this this is a divided country and it's not just divided because the media says it's divided we see really serious a disagreement between people we've seen friendships and and and and perhaps even marriages dissolve\nOver the disagreements over President Trump's occupy you know his position in the White House\nA can a country is divided as that may be still be effective in meeting these challenges against our enemies around the world\nWe we have been more divided into a member of the biggest war we ever for laws law\nWorld War two was even the law of the greatest number of casualties more than half a million Americans killed one of our own civil war during Vietnam I Believe we were more divided so the idea that we've we've we've never been more divided I don't buy it but of course it and make\nThings difficult but I think more and more Americans are waking up to who Donald Trump is and how he wants to protect this nation from all threats and how to get on the opera star you so you know I Am an American now proud American\nAs a result I'm an optimist and I think so the the sleeping giant is awakening\nYou know it's funny ... you say that because I I see people coming together in ways that I think even the mainstream media wouldn't have expected I went back last week and looked up\nThe percentage of the black vote that Donald Trump got in twenty sixteen not quite two years ago and it was eight percent by the middle of last year twenty Seventeen he was at twenty three percent almost three times the number that he got ... votes in the election and this year he's already at thirty six percent\nThat kind of grows would make almost anybody in any field very happy and yet the mainstream media and that's on one of the most divisive\nIt's thirty six percent so that kind of grows would make almost anybody in any field very happy and yet the mainstream media and that's on one of the most divisive issues that America's faced and that of race and whether or not a black American citizens feel they're being treated appropriately and equitably [noise]\nIt seems that an awful lot of black Americans are a huge percentage in percentage terms has decided this is the president we like\nTo I think what did we see in twenty sixteen an incredible\nSilent majority do the mainstream media that Hillary has a more than ... percent salt the wedding left and posted something like minded so ... says ... percent salt water how good she lost ... ... ... I think in the last two years that\nAll of silence up to ... vote just only have increased about why I remain very very tall for the\n... the other side and especially the media player and the media is a big player in this seems willing to do almost anything even entertain a lies to win a fight like the fight that occurred over the appointment of justice Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court\nYeah I mean in in in my book why we fight I talk about with the ... trained as what it could chambers was was justice capital before doctors capital was even born so you know in Nineteen forty eight a man who had been a former communist agents stood up and Congress and the first of all\nTelevised the live demoted I'm told the world who the secret agents were communists inside job ... including al ... is the ... tried to destroy it used to it being a homosexual Alaska Hawley or you know everything you can imagine and it was all live so\nThat the Democrats have made a bargain with the devil\nThe ends justify the means if you were shocked at what they did the cabinet law than you need to open a history book because they did it because they did it to do the jobs as a fuel or are they did it to a with the changes in nine team for the eight\nI'm Talking to doctors Sebastian Gorka who's the author most recently of why we fight 'em before we wrap up this segment because I Want to talk to you about Islam and the next segment um you you you mentioned the the kind of tactics that are willing to use\nAnd it strikes me that there are also willing to Tampa very deep double standard just last week\nThere were folks who were I guess for lack of a better term gay shaming a Lindsey Graham ah by suggesting that ah that because he said you know that that somehow he's he's homosexual and and that kind of treatment of people ordinarily get you shouted down these days in America if you decide to out somebody or cast\nA slur by suggesting that they're gay and yet the Democrats on the left seem willing to do it and the media seems willing to amplify does well\nBlog that doesn't get you shouted down it destroys joke Korea if a conservative did to\nLindsey Graham or the left or if they can so ... called gay west for the left I mean think about it but left on on cable TV called Kanye West ... a clearance negro anybody on the right path that Korea is would\nBe over the racism homophobia\nLog fire and the book is why we find a job for his doctors Sebastian Gorka former deputy assistant to president will be back in just a moment you go to Mars\n\n\nThat can go rape cry when did it become OK for men to be lazier softer fatter\nWe need to bring them into this country back to grade this and it's easier than ever we age lists male Macs a patent pending formula within a greeting if that helps boost your total testosterone promoting greater increases muscles size and twice the reduction of body fat percentage that exercise alone\nPlus an amazing sixty four percent increase in nitric oxide which can be handy in the gym and in the bedroom\nTake your manhood to the max by trying your first dirty diaper bottle free shipping and handling not ten days not Fifteen days for the full thirty days supply free when you text the word fast to Seventy nine Seventy nine Seventy nine\nFinally a formula that boost total testosterone if you'll results with age will smell Macs are too intense please decrease use for your free bottle tax fast to Seventy nine Seventy nine Seventy not text F.

off as everything the blue elite are but I saw a commercial where a democratic hopeful\nHe's campaigning on the idea that she will restore\nThe tax deduction for New Jersey homeowners we we know that it's chiefly I matter of the elites because the New Jersey and New York taxes are so high\nThat when you get to the duck them it's a painless way of New Jersey and new and New York the blue kingdoms maintaining their power making the federal budget path fine that was eliminated by the rascals Republicans in the last in this Congress said they're voting against\nIt struck me that the Democrats are training here not to go forward Michael not really a vision of a new thing\nThey're looking to say we had a good why did you messed it up that's how I heard that commercial\n[laughter] well the problem the Democrats face is one of going through a difficult adjustment a Republican or a\nRead a elites are no smarter and they're Democrat Al I rye emphasize\nThat there that the the leadership is feeling its way here is it the device on the outside of the Javits Center in what we're doing\nI I Would suggest humbly that it was a gift but the ... election live twenty ten and they show up Obama in that it tended to set in train\nOr a tumultuous process a consideration and the Tea Party or in in the larger cultural sense really did the Republicans a big favor because what it did is bring front and center\nAnd the demands of people to be represented by their leaders and to get out of the Washington thing and you know the leadership did not do that and the one person did which Trump and that's why he swept away\nAll of the contenders she faced and the nomination process and twenty sixteen and in fact\nThe uh red\nPolitically that is has stolen the march on blue because it has had the advantage of of being awake and to this\nEarlier be the southern planter aristocracy before the civil war now I'm not comparing the two obviously in terms of their belief system but I Am comparing them to the difficulty of making adjustments to a changing reality in effect a change in society\nThey're not as adaptable they play an aristocracy would rather go to civil war\nAnd come up with an alternative solution\nAnd this it seems to me is the challenge faced by blue elites and it's it's a bad it by the fact that they are so increasingly out of touch\nWith regular people and what we're saying for example in California which is hemorrhaging Emma grace [laughter] you know who are fleeing places like California the Pacific northwest and the only people coming into California these days\nAre yeah peace the rich and that bodes ill\nWe've got thirty seconds that party I I I Do not believe in your article you find any more sustainability for the ... they're being used right now but they're not their future is bright unless they change also we have got thirty second\nBest right and a red elite such as they are have been scrambling but they've got a long way to go and in fact\nThe the larger outcome of of the civil war but I Believe is is sweeping American society will inevitably create a different set of elites eventually that of course is the reason you have civil wars or is that\nYou can't achieve\nChange and readjustment any other way and that's perhaps unfortunate because of the violence that without leashes but that is\nEach one of those gashes in his wet suit\nYou call it ...\nTurkey in a in each one of those gashes in his once you\nDo you call it eat DNA and uh this strikes me is the like CSI white shark here\nAre you a cut is it kind of is you can you can scoop water out of the beach area in San Diego county and determine whether white shark has been there within hours within days because ... they use this area of common place I learn from you know that's\nThe part we don't know we don't know how long that DNA can last in the water and how recently that sharks been there so in the case of sampling water when we're measuring what we called by our mental DNA that's where the ... in the DNA comes from\nUm we don't know how long that DNA will last before it completely breaks down and we can no longer measure it so that's that's something that we're planning on doing next summer\nIs to try to measure how long the white tricks DNA to remain\nIn a particular before it's completely gone but in the case of the wet suit that was different because the sharks DNA had become trapped in the ... show in many ways that as a standard forensic techniques that you it's been used in forensic labs all over the world for for decades now\nI'm a marine biologist or kind of late to the party so we're just now starting to adapt some of these techniques for use in kind of figuring out who might have been involved in a shark bite\nThe I read from the reporting that the U.S has more unprovoked shark attacks than any other nation that was true in twenty Seventeen\nOr that nationwide we have ... more than fifty in Florida has a lot of attacks is there a pattern here that's emerging Chris or is this is this just better data and or something like the shark lab um know accumulating the data\nThere is a number of factors involved in this so one factor is now I get so much media attention that when these incidents occurred they always get reported fifty sixty eight years ago you know it was sometimes never reported or sometimes that people never made it back to the beach to know that\nAn incident occurred and the other thing is we actually don't refer to these two shark attacks anymore because we don't know the motivation of the shark so we simply refer to them a shark bite so until we figure out you know whether the sharks intent\nWas to deliberately attacked some thing [laughter] um it could be just simply mistaken identity the shark didn't know what it was a thought it was a a food item it bit into it and then decided we just don't taste good\nSo that really isn't that that's a a sampling if you will but nonetheless a little bite from a big shark can do a lot of damage and what's remarkable and what we've seen in more recent years\nIs the severity of some of these little bites so to speak and how many people survive those and that's really attributed to first responder\nUm responses and and and saving these people\nSo we're getting more data because we have more survivors and we move quicker and our communication system allows us to know when something's going on in Cape Cod and two weeks later going on in San Diego county that's why\nWell that's one of the reasons the other reason is there are more people using the ocean recreation than ever before in history and in the U.S we have locations in our country where people can use the water year round and they do\nShow when you think about how people use the ocean now for recreation and how much time different user groups spending the ocean like surfers swimmers borders waiter standup paddle borders when you look at the amount of time they actually spending the ocean now is\nExponentially greater than it was twenty thirty fifty years ago [noise] so that's the other thing that we have to put into context they're more simply more people in the ocean than ever before\nWe've looked at it from the human point of view that does homo sapiens and why we're now going to turn when we come back from the shock point of view what how does the

for having me get to be back with you I think this uh armada of Iranian oil I think has been termed a is one very powerful way in the run up to sanctions that the Iranians are looking to offset some

I wanted to smack him upside the head and I kind of agree you know so they should have no question because they get where they had to go they had and they had a ... or their families a lot of them\nAnd it was therefore jerks I mean I just have interviewed a lot of astronauts they admitted but a lot of 'em really tried to make up for it and a lot of ways this film didn't give that impression it just showed on strong as a\nJerk and and why would anyone want to see a film about this you know there's a great epic tale here and if you just focus on a person's floors in this epic tale you lose it and I think that's what's happened with this film\nJob Bob the detail about Armstrong I give a speech once said one of my at my brothers graduation he he he became an inspirational speaker\nAnd um the the the event I remember I recall vividly was because\nOf the Nineteen eighty election right before the election this spring election when there was great anxiety about the United states and its strength in the world and he ... he made an inspirational speech and the crowd was thrilled\nYeah and so he was translating was a war hero to I mean he fought in Korea he was translating a view of America that really isn't something Hollywood similar with these days I'm trying to be generous here I Know you are\nBut I I'm I'm really not to be generous I think my original ... correct that\nThis is Hollywood and the modern intellectual communities refusal and\nDisdain almost of of of the America that makes it possible\nThe free America's next impossible to have their opinions and they just don't want to do it you know Neil Armstrong landed on the moon ... he was on the first words from landing tranquility base here ego has landed and I heard him say you can listen to the tapes and hear him say it\nHe said that with joy and enthusiasm because he knew he had just accomplish something grand for this country\nNeeds country which is what the equal represented well I'm Ryan Gosling when he says those words he says the eagle as land it almost as an afterthought almost for luck that only eat like he's uncomfortable saying it\nHas a Canadian life I think it's as an actor and then intellectual community is want to be a PR out unabashed American which there's no question Neal Armstrong was\nWell for heaven sakes pop that was a day of days I mean I'm not going to see that movie maybe I'll have glimpses of it you know when it's on Amazon Prime and two years something like that but for heaven's sakes those those last moments Bob before he settled down and they do do do do they do those adequately I mean that was that was that you know\nWhat they don't do it as well as they could they because they make the landing they they they insert you're looking at the lunar surface with this giant deadly looking crater which was there and then they show the surface flying by super fast which wasn't true he was he was descending almost vertically\nRight any word on raw eggs exaggerate the reality instead of really good they they tried to show how he's running out of fuel and he's really but they didn't do it as well as they could if they only did he see was searching\nFor a landing site and they didn't really shown that and that's\nUnfortunate he flew down by himself that was the pan plan\nThey they do say I'm going to go to Manuel here and you do have the quote from up all ... ah this is a Boulder field um but\nOnce again what happened is he went to a manual and he's hoping ... over the surface looking for a place to land and instead they show it as he's it's like a plane coming into a bowl to feel like a plane literally the ground shooting passed and he's suddenly he brings it down and that's it just wasn't correct\nThat I Know I wasn't going to make a big deal about the the minor trivial errors in the film because as general they try very hard to get the facts right but there are so focused on the facts that\n... letting go to the U.S at the NASA Bob which is ... and ... and blue origin and all the other armored those aren't the answer\nBut there are so focused on the facts that completely ... let's go to the I guess at the NASA Bob which is to pay tax and ... and blue origin and all the other armored those aren't the answer I must emphasize by now with the ... the ... yeah\nI mean I really I don't agree with you there was an up until now has been seated zero by NASA and safe sex in most of its biggest accomplishment I'm\nBill to themselves and that's a cave them support later in the game so I don't agree with\nYou Bob there with the money from NASA can we just leave it alone all rise commercials they have to talk about what I wanted well now that the star and ... has a Falcon Heavy contracts from home\nAnd they got it from a Swedish commercial company that wants to build the geosynchronous communication satellite this is one of now looks like six different contracts on the Falcon Heavy um\nThey're building up a manifest for this rocket right now this launch is going to be twenty twenty four goals well\nWhat's really significant about this is that they they have they have almost as many books flights now as the proton has and they have more commercial flights\nMaybe than the apple is fine with the Falcon Heavy this is a big deal because they're proving that this rocket is beginning to develop a customer

a non ... we just won't do it\nAnd that is a major um bone of contention then of course there are others even though we've tried to maintain good relations with the Turks\nAnd up until now you know subsequent to the Nineteen thirties when editor tried to secular rise that nation a air to one is doing just the opposite trying to radicalize it with his Islam ec viewpoint and trying to return to the granddaughter of the Ottoman Empire [noise]\nAh so NATO no I I don't think that they should be a member of NATO you know NATO such a complex thing for us today as we mentioned in the last hour because you know anyone could you know call for an article five say you know the Russians are picking on me please come to my rescue\nOr do we want to be tethered in the future war world to that well\nYou know we have that alliance him but keep in mind I have no doubt that the Russians and the Chinese\nAre just you know very tight now out of necessity\nThey don't want to be contained by us and I don't know that we can contain them but they want to form their own little alliance and to a certain degree of his belt and road strategy of president Xi around the world and collaboration with the Russians in military exercises this is all painting a picture\nWhere you can see a divided world emerging\nSo to abandon NATO even though it has all sorts of you know warts and problems with it at this point might not be well advised but certainly allowing to turkey into our secrets into our\nSystems with a Russian made here defense system is not a good idea either\nNow far for me to to um stand up for the house of Saud by\nA given that so much of the narrative of the ... murder has come from the Turks and also cutter or another sort of sworn enemy of Saudi Arabia possible do you think there's anything to the the idea that that cutter turkey are trying to\nDrive a wedge between the United states and uh there's there are their allies the Saudis\nCourse you know that's a sort of thing that you know\nKind of the poker and the Internet geo political world that takes place all the time behind the scenes\nYou know who were the people that were in the [noise]\nYou know the Saudi embassy

it would appear to be by a man that were under the\nLeadership of saw him on don't know but that could be clearly we could cancel the arms deal but I mean we've been not only a hundred and ten billion it's far in excess of that\nAnd we have a lot of people on the ground working hand in glove with them but we risk a relationship\nWith the Saudis against Iran and of course the Saudis interestingly are aligned with Pakistan Pakistan has nuclear weapons\nUm ten packs of course distance from us now aligned with the Chinese so you you've got to look at second and third order effects of any decision

best interest to\nNot have a an agreement that isn't for civil the problem is and the Russians notice that a Nineteen eighty seven I N F treaty was\nWas violated a with their own cruise missiles\nAnd uh you know they probably will admit that behind the scenes or do we do a lot of in the open so I I think that will will get something I Know that\nYou know they had was from Trump asked for you met with putting in Helsinki in July but yeah they did talk about that issue and potent surreal is you know yeah he he has grandiose ideas about the fact that he can meet with the world leader ah on the west Trump\nIn the eyes of the the Russian people means that they are great power again and of course you know ... meetings with President Xi on a frequent basis just solidifies that viewpoint so if I were both ... and ... you know I Know I've talked to John Bolton before and so I I\nI kind of have a sense that that's what he's going to do you know he's a real pragmatist he is a tough guy but he does have the president here and I think that that's a that's going to be the top of the agenda and of course uh he'll probably try to deal with\nThe issues in Syria and with Aaron won a course or the

and hopefully that'll come about by the Iranian people\nAre getting fed up with the situation with you and chasing the mullahs out of there if Iran were to become a secular non align nation or you know again leaning to the west as they did for many many decades\nHow would that change the situation because obviously what's going on in Syria is not about a civil war it's about a proxy war and it's about Iran Iran has regime change how does that change the equation [noise]\nWell if we don't have the ayatollah running you know the you know the military and their diplomacy or you have to\nPromote their their sheer world view a and B autocratic world view of of the ... and I think that you find that they're not involved with the tea so not involved with\nUs on a there are less involved with Russia accept because of economic interests and perhaps even to a certain degree with China um\n[noise] and it's the problem is the age old tension between the Sunni and Shia Riyad in Tehran is going to continue um but it ... if they're not involved in you know in fueling terrorism such as Hezbollah in\nSouthern Lebanon and you know encouraging Hamas and\nPalestine and so forth and\nWe'll have an easier way in that part of the world we can we can work with them a Iranians are wonderful people are very bright capable Persian people and they have a long history I Would hope

melt vitamin D three formula and documenting is what you're saying is that most of us are deficient in vitamin D\nAnd because of that deficiency it's causing health issues like pain muscle weakness immune problems and the most vitamin D supplements are not the best form and more importantly is not the right amount of vitamin D to really make an impact is that what you're saying\nExactly what I'm

controlling everything from diabetes to hormone production to\nMuscle strength heart beating correctly digestion immune system\nIt's a really long list and\nHonestly as surprise me because in medical

vitamin D I just didn't think it was necessary and then in the early to thousands\nOf the study started coming out and now there is over twenty three hundred studies\nThat show that vitamin D is absolutely necessary is not a good idea it's absolutely necessary and it's a hormone that should be in the body\nMonday is absolutely necessary is not a good idea it's absolutely necessary and it's a

combat\nReason that people died in the navy was due to the melanoma so skin cancer so I'm\nReading this study you know I I kind of pot is right there and I went yeah makes sense you know people are

I promise we'll tackle a lot of those email messages this in this week's show because they haven't been pop piling up a little bit we want to make sure that you get the answers that you need right now we're going to Nebraska with Ron\nHas a little shower issue Ron welcome to the show and what can we help you with\nWhere I liked it a little more pressure than just about a much our\nAh I'll tell you you know um it seems like shower the let's say the shower experience as they'd like to say is getting less of an experience in some situations is is a a new shower old shower has it been a problem all along\nWe built this film or a sixteen years ago the ... circuit or people\nThey only allowed three quarter inch flying a plane into the house which are ordered to go to an age but they wouldn't do that ha ha so I have three quarter to the hot water heater but from the hot water heater to the Tories copper\nUh-huh uh-huh have forty five I'm departure or does it shouldn't be enough of pressure I just thought I'd take 'em to pieces of the shower and they're going to jail but that has a\nLot of times those slurry stricter as what you would never want to recommend that but certainly a lot of people will will um modify 'em the the the flurry stricter but if it's if it's sixteen years old um I Would think that there may be a little debris and there have you back\nI opened it out of there wasn't oh there was a little black pieces of sediment and things like that but not much\nI see okay [noise] um and uh so ... has the pressure steadily gotten lower I mean as as you\nKnow actually it'll increase than decrease where we're so sorry water tower but what about five blocks from my house so we should have really good and for some reason or other we just heard several neighbors say the same thing\nHa ha well ... you know one of the things that uh we we had one of our listeners Rick I'm ... mention too is that they did to solve this problem which I thought it was a unique idea but still a little risky is actually\nTaking a tank they just had a water tank that they were able to purchase it was a thirty gallon tank\nAnd they actually position that\nIn the attic next to their shower and so they did a little bit of rerouting and so that the tank would basically stay full because it was pressurized but when they called upon the shower for water they had that gravity push that really divided now\nThey they taught the course it was all cold water\nSo they you know adult little balance same thing that you know read learning exactly where the ... needed to be in order to get that I'm cold and hot water mixed bother us right but I mean that's a little bit of an extreme I'm\nYou know thing to do to do there but it whatever's restricting that may be very hard to find 'em sometimes it can be the shower valve itself which is not an easy thing to\nReplace ... have you ever try is it a single ... to to handle okay as a single or have you ever take have you ever taken that apart\nBut I have I have not the truth it's one of those that you are a full restrict or down into the tub so that goes to the shower right\nRight because you can take that um that single of course you will have to turn the water off to the house since you've probably heard of a you know cut off just for the shower but you take that hum cover off you take the handle off the cover off\nAnd then you're going to find a little cube in narrow little round whether it's a cube or whether it's a little round about control valve in there you normally it would have three different\nUm vow or three different little washers on it for so many times you can have a little debris in there because what what it basically is doing is cold water hot water going into that little mixer and then it makes me around\nAnd if there's any debris and they are at all it's funny to talk about debris and water lines but it's it's in all of our water lines\nAnd yeah and a lot of times that's all it is maybe it's a little calcium deposit maybe is just a little bit of debris\nFrom something that's causing that slight restriction which you would think with forty pounds or pressure it's going to blow it right out of there are so many times it'll get rooted in there pretty well I Believe that's what I Would try on on on this one in and see Ron if you're able to to free that up a little bit you might you know you might find that deposits in there but\nHere's what she needed to close the during so that doesn't look parts go down the drain as your opening up don't hesitate to take a few pictures with your phone so that you can see exactly how it's coming apart\nAnd then just take it real slow in easy and see if that is in um where it is I'll bet you'll find I'll tell you another thing I found a lot or those washers being dislodged\nJust slightly to where it's cramping it and maybe cutting that water pressure down by fifty percent might be surprised and taking that out replacing those washers putting it back in and you might end up with the kind of water pressure you need\nThat show wondering if you are right because ah coming out of this but it could end of the whole list\nOf water yeah yeah so at when you pick it up when you pick it up the other way then it's restricted also you know you want to make sure you take that showerhead off\nAnd turn the turn it on and just let it go for a while maybe even bumped the vow of a little bit and just let it really really slow I'm that way you know you you you might be dislodge him a little of that without having to do anything and then consider getting a new showerhead um you know because my wife\nWho weren't sort of those green is ... ... ...\n... yeah you're angry and I know it's it's yeah is that those aren't as nice as as you think I see those in hotels quite a bit and it just a\nQuiet a again that shower experience but but some of the new technology with some of the of pulsating type of showerheads and some of these other things are pretty interesting how much water they can get out of a shower and really appears to increase it a good bit but but give that a trial run I'm sure you'll find that you can definitely step it up a little bit\nI'm pretty sure that I hadn't even thought of that I felt like it was all in the shower it but I Know it's not there are things apart\nI appreciate that I hadn't even thought of that I felt like it was all in the shower is I Know it's not hurting bart haven't checked the velvet than it is funny\nI mean here we are getting water through the ... those are so good and I'm sure you don't solve the problem already\nGood good well I certainly hope so Ron and now we can help you any other way just let us know when I have a great weekend it's actual listening to the day is home on her\nRadio you know those are the kind of things that you face and you you know he's one of those things that every single day\nYou wish you could do something about it you know whether it's a um you know a toilet this the leaking or something else that you see around the house so many times if you just stop and focus on it just a little bit\nAnd then let us help you find the right answer to whatever that challenge you might be facing you might be surprised at how easy it is to repair it yourself or at least have the knowledge to know\nYou know what you would probably need to do first of all of them think about it might be a sure fire box and your gas far place there\nIs completely separate than everything else everything else is like paint is just decorative so all of that can be removed to wear all you're looking at on that wall is just the fire box and the wall which the fire box I'm sure is flush with the wall itself\nYeah yeah it is exactly so so all of that could be removed okay now I'm\nSensed it for truth a little bit there into the floors at a carpeted area\nYes it is and their child where the fire entered it might not have seats\nSo so whatever you put back in its place would need to\nTo to replicate that space in order to to do that um you know in order to make sure you don't have to get new carpet but then as basically just installing you can install that um any type of marble whether it's twelve ... twelve or whether each each right on the wall carry it all the way to the sea okay\nSo do you need to put any board before\nYou put the tile right on the law\nNot really the board will extended out many times we do recommend\nUsing a summit backer board or something along those lines but here you can attach it right to the wall go right to the ceiling and then you can um use a low profile um TV a male so she can get that TV up just a little bit away from the\nFarm fireplace itself and then put any type of mental that you want in there at that time but what you might need to think about is before you put the material on the wall she used to do any block team in the wall that's necessary to support the television as well as any mental ...\nDo you do do before you do not pay exactly what okay back in the mantle if there were like um I don't know ... or something and kicking out to command All right with you that before yeah I see so
