you know the the the snow's falling and you know plans are dying [noise]\nUm so it had this connection to ah to darkness\nBut it wasn't sinister by modern standards mean when we say we think we think of the darkness as being you know something sister but to them it was very it was not even an analyst point of view wasn't about death or evil it with the changing of the seasons\nAnd so that was so ... so to the people that were celebrating it so it was scary it was like yes there was a time to you know to a store grains and to you know give thanks to to to to the gods and and the the spirits and this man [noise]\nUm and it was believed that a bit on that day that the uh the the the the separation between the world's with a sexually thin and porous\nSo the rest of the year you know we we were in our happy little world and you know the the other creatures the other Ken [laughter] you know the the ferry folk or what have you there in the world and they leave us alone and we leave them alone but on this day\nBe the the er the barrier between them becomes more porous [noise] um and so this is why are they the began talking about how\nTo steer it toward the which come come forth on this day and people were much more likely to be able to uh see spirits and they were basically all around us and it wasn't just the um it wasn't just the the idea that the the world's are porous\nUm the the barrier between them but also\nUm in leader incarnations of Halloween it was also that a time as porous and so what you find is that uh the pole would later become Halloween I'm there would be a it would be basically a time when\nIt would be for a time for prophecy so it was this notion that uh you know there's ... there's other worlds but it's also the barrier between the president in our future\nAnd so ah for example in the Eighteen hundreds or there were different customs that would involve the Halloween which are basically abandoned today people don't really talk about them\nBut there were ideas for example that the that uh for example a woman born a Halloween would be able to tell the future [noise] um and there would be this a proxy and often times the prophecy\nWas um even dealing with like people who might die the following year or oftentimes it was about marriage so and for the you know oftentimes there's there's very superstitions about young women\nWho would on on Halloween Night or for example they would they would uh boy the candle in front of a mirror a and a and it was said that you that the the with a look look in the mirror at midnight and they would see their future husbands reflection [noise]\nUm and so all these sorts of another one example was a bombing for Apple's you know every now and you see apple bobbing and there was there was a particular Halloween tradition that if you cut a pie if you build an apple in one long continuous strip unbroken\nAny tossed it over one shoulder and it was intact when it when it landed it would spell out the initials of your future husband so there were so there's this really interesting blend of you know two worlds coming together and past and present coming together\nOh my weight and they're going to write those down and and and do this on Halloween Night [laughter] I Do it and yet at midnight right\nOn willfully night that's right will please [laughter] well what\nAre you may you may have your own little um I'll give you your own little outline of what to do but I Want to know about you know trick or treating and where that came in but I Want you to use your own timeline to get that and I want to you\nKnow I get there are people that say Halloween you know same same thing and and um you know I like I Know a lot of conservative people that are cool with it you know um but\nUm you know\nAlways see it is fun I see it and I I mean if you say Halloween I immediately think oh cool\nLantern that you get to make I think of all whether I think of orange and black colors I think a fake little cartoons that we would watch like which isn't the goblins and\nAnd they're very fun fun thing that's how I see it and it's terrible I think people get really deep into it and and all of a sudden they take the fun out of it and the traditions out of that and [noise] and uh I I don't know I just we wish we could just all get along so\nHang in there for a little bit okay we're gonna have to take a break here but what we have is a banner Radford with us he is an investigator\nAnd an end to all the things that were into a as coast the folks here that want to learn everything um but he also you know there's a lot of writing and he looked into the Oregon so it's Halloween and we're going to learn more from him about that and also\n\n\nWelcome back to coast to coast am county Willis here discussing the origins of Halloween on ... talking with Ben ran for Ben so as you tell us about the origins of Halloween\nIt really does have an interesting history very rich in history um it's silly it's scary and get said panicking gets kind of crazy I enjoy watching the\nAh television shows around the time of Halloween or that were the fun ones the little peanuts you know characters that's always fun with the ah great pumpkin and all that kind of stuff\nUm but I like the fun ones and and I like when people dress up you know like the vampires and the Frankenstein I like the really good scary stuff\nI don't like that sometimes it gets pretty lame and people just dress up like somebody else which to me they can you know they dress up like you know just a regular kind of normal like Superman or something like that they can do that anytime of the year\nDo you know the detainee creativity to go to target and put on you know a Batman mass can we make make I'm I'm Out of it you know yes\nAgreed and and and do you know make a Jack\nO lantern and put a real candle in there and let smell that smell of burning pumpkin so cool I Love it love at all [noise]\nAbsolutely you know I mean that's that's one of the ... that's really what's associate of course these days um although your Halloween was never really mainly a children's holiday and it really didn't become focused on kids until about Nineteen fifty\nBefore that it was I mean kids were involved but it wasn't really a kids' kid centered as it is today a it was more of a community thing again sort of you if you go back to\nGo back to win and the the theory a Celtic version of it which were very strict and and again sort of dealing with the changing of the season and darkness and snow and all that [noise]\nUm but you know so you you had that and then that sort of what happened was that um that that someone got mixed in along with all saints day which was November first which was you know ... probably through the next day which was a to honor that the church a church I'm responding to gone to heaven\nAnd then also got wrapped up to a whole day which is November second which bills are wrong for the phone purgatory [noise]\nAnd so there was this it was interesting transition from an early purely pagan um you know ritual which died out long before you know the the church was was even writing about ... anything like that\nAnd then you have the the influence of the Catholic Church with all things that you know a whole day\nAnd and again they were the ringing a bell and sometimes the do wrong to keep away a demons and scary things could loud noise were set to scare away the evil [noise] um and that sort of transform a little later on into the modern costumes because what what happened is\nI'm a you know we're talking about you what it costs you come from and one one part of it is that uh it believe that a drink so and the leaders would wear animal skins I'm there and sometimes the animal heads like anglers will not during the ceremonies\nAnd they weren't there they weren't doing it to fool anybody of course everybody knew they were but it was the ritual thing in terms of honoring the land and the animals that were given to them [noise]\nUm but then later on during the late Eighteen hundreds and England was customary for the wealthy remembers in town to offer a small payment or food\nUm to the poor during Halloween praying for the dead and this again the ties back into all day because the idea was that um that on that day or the full weren't working towards you know there were they're basically trapped between heaven and hell they need to be prayer prayed for a and so the\nThe wealthy members of the communities would basically\nA higher out there were ... they would subcontract prayers if you will to these numbers and so these these people would go from house to house asking for what were called ... which type of bread and in return for paying for praying for those purgatory so they would they would do dances and songs rituals\nAre going from house to house getting little tokens of of of food\nOr or coin hum and often times they would care with them how to turn up of course that would lead or translate into uh the the the the uh the token I'm\nBoth an added a candle a land from the candle in it and the candles light represented the soul the person they would pray for\nThe idea was that they would these members go as far as to how say you know yes will pray for if you have a member of your family who's a who's passed on um you know with the ... you know holding up this this turn up with a candle to think of this light as the the soles but don't you wants to pray for them they would say yes\nAnd then of course when that came over with the Irish immigrants to to America\nUm the turn of some sort of got lost by the wayside which is just as well if you ask me\nTo read when that's\nWhen the pumpkins came in because the pumpkin associate course they're they're bigger they're they're more fun to carve and our associate with the harvest and that's that's sort of how the the trick or treating after I came along\nOh I like that yeah I agree with you turn now move on red cells Munch on little olive oil some pepper I'm so worried about the candy I guess I guess it all turned into candy at one point in that like right after the ... like you were talking about\n[noise] yeah well I mean a ... it was interesting 'cause 'cause again ... ... it's sort of the same things sort of parsed out along gender lines for a while because what would happen is that if you think about it you know again that was the ... the mom and going on this and that\nAnd then uh the the ... during this time the the jitters had pretty strict social roles and so\nUm and as I mentioned earlier during Halloween by the time when when young girls would would would pining away and with ... think of you know who which which cute boy they would marry and the next town over who probably three or four teeth at the time who knows\n'cause that's what they did\nBut you know that that's what they were doing so so ... if you think about like during this time this is when people would go from house to house in the ... the mom and get sort of gone away but the tradition of going to people's houses to knock on the door and you know sort of trick or treat and give us give us a little token or something\nYou would be inappropriate for young women to do that they wouldn't really go out alone by themselves during during that era\nSo if that was typically sort of a young man ... you know ... him Mr this young man's project in the the girls and women would tend to be more indoors and that's where you get the apple bobbing and rituals in terms of you know the process of those sorts of things so [noise] so you know by the late Eighteen hundreds the tradition of playing pranks on Halloween was pretty well established\nAnd and that's when ah you know as the as the religious aspect sort of faded away right I mean they were [noise]\nPeople were no longer you know going from house to house asking for little bits of bread to to pray for you know sold in purgatory that for a little less a little a little bit of outlandish for for a little too much work for these days\nSo that's when this sort of came down to treats and even even today I mean I remember when I was a kid a not so long ago I like to say uh you know they were it was a member of every now I get to get a silver dollar or are you sometimes you get an apple you're like\nReally really only a couple okay and I like it was the one that I like it was like some relief tart apple was like you went out of your way to find a nasty apple did you I didn't say that I'm like Oh thank you but anyway [laughter]\nYou know well I you know I remember when we would go a long time ago it was great you remember the good how to get there were there were years where you get full tank candy bars and by the way if you came up to our house which was on a hill and it was scary and we would play that'll\nHaunted house record where you heard the green in which is right and it was very dark so you can rent if you were brave enough to go to our house you\nWould get full size bars you know marathon bar and you get a handful now you're\nThe only perimeter marathon learn that I Love the marathon bars but they were like growl and chocolate and they they were like a foot and a half long yeah and they were just great they're great those I I haven't heard anybody mentioned those in decades oh that's a ... you got a full on you got so long as you can't replace a wish I'd been there I\nCan't believe they don't make those any more of those are fantastic but but we were when we would go trick or treating ... and we had to go kind of horrible and you know this way money all the other way and you had just done that's when they had those nasty math that you couldn't breathe or anything but at the time\nWe would never want to get ahead homemade popcorn ball they were delicious it was the only time we ever had on there were awesome and you know back then you could trust the people\nAnd then of course you know you hear about razor blades in apples and things like that but then there was another person's house that they were a dentist and they only gave away toothbrushes like we don't want to go there you know thank you yeah trick or treat thank you [laughter]\nI I should mention that because of all three answers the the the more modern scares a and you know you mentioned the the the classic a poison ... and the reason they say yeah and\nThe fact is that that I mean that's that's there's there's almost no truth to that\nIt's it's widely talked about a friend of mine ... best wrote a book about that um and and you know so when you actually look at at the cases where somebody has actually painted the sorts of things [noise]\nMy God gave me this\nAlso give me the wisdom to know how to live and\nAdd ... to ...\nWhich he also gave me\nThe wells loose\nBecause nobody\nAny all of them I tell you become America's not selling brand seven o'clock [noise]\n\nThe content of this program does not represent the views or opinions of five Seventy W. N. A. X.\nAlone welcome to another edition of discoveries in hell I'm your host prison McCain I'm really glad you're with me today because they were going to be talking about an issue that of each and every one of us and that stress\nAnd believe it or not whether it's job stress financial stress family stress or even the little things that were told not to stress about\nAny form of stress takes a serious physical toll on your body\nBut don't worry because there is something you can do about your stress and joining me today on the phone is Dr Michael ... and Dr ... there's going to talk about stress and\nGive us some great information on things that we can do to reduce or even eliminate the negative effect the daily stress has on our bodies for those you that may not know Dr ... he is a nationally recognized authority on natural in alternative health he's\nWorked with top Hollywood celebrities professional and Olympic athletes and it continues to be involved in the latest research into today's top health concerns and Dr ... thanks so much for being with us today\nThanks Chris great to be with you\nSo let's get right into this whole stress issue you know stress is such a normal part of our daily routine these days but why should we all be concerned about it and more specifically what's going on in our bodies and one of the warning signs that we should be looking for\nA while you know there's two ways to look at stress on is what we call mental stress on the other the other is stress affects your body as a doctor I'm more interested in how it affects your body sure so the waste stress affects the body is this person is under stress the body transpose as the stress that tension\nAnd your mother end up contract and everyone feels that in there and the upper back in ... right by the doctor I'm more concerned about the muscles that you don't feel\nSuch as the muscles in the arteries that go up and the mother's heart is a giant myself over and the muscles in and around your digestive tract mhm because these are the things that are resulting in\nIn a heart disease digestive difficulties and I want to talk a little bit on your show today about nutrition because there are two nutrients\nThat completely handle the body in terms of stress okay now according to the research that I've been involved with it it's as simple as calcium and magnesium\nCalcium and magnesium right okay\nWhen you're deficient in calcium and magnesium a lot of things can happen\nCounting magnesium for example is needed in order to go to sleep at night and how many people you know they just don't sleep well you wake up tired your body hurt more\nPretty soon it starts to wear you down and pretty soon he gets sick and you have a condition of people are suffering for pain and osteoporosis and fibromyalgia and cramped in their legs and weird illnesses so there's something wrong with this picture and it has to do with not how much calcium someone taking in their diet or how many ...\nHow many in Athens you chew it has to do with simple absorption is that calcium getting absorbed into your body\nWith calcium being something to do with stress season calcium for building bones well\nYes and it does build your teeth but he's the one percent of the calcium actually circulates in your blood\nSo in that one percent starts to drop it could affect your heart your brain your kidneys your organs and your body shutdown actually died\nWow one percent of the calcium always has to be in your system and there's two sources of calcium one isn't the diet you know and to is from the bones themselves\n... absorb it back from the bones have been either\nThat's right and what you just discussed right now leads to one of the major causes of a condition that's affecting twenty five million Americans right now which is called osteoporosis right which is a weakening of a ball\nAnd that's due to the body deriving the calcium from the bones instead of from the nitrogen yep\nOkay and so we have to do is we have to find a way to put calcium back in the diet do you think that would be really easy\nFor sure just drink milk\nJust drink milk or you know eat a lot of green leafy vegetables and that sort of thing but first of all people don't do that right and second of all the the quality of the calcium that comes from our diet has been decreasing in the last fifty years really because things like pastures Asian\nIrradiated um the calcium as leach from the soil and\nPeople are taking medications that block it so\nThe actual calcium is that being absorbed in the body okay and then you see people taking toms and calcium supplements you know they buy the health food store drugs are right but these things don't absorb and the body for a couple of reasons\nOne uh when you take a let's say on antacid that had the ... like a Tom's first of all calcium does not absorb in the body unless it's an anesthetic environment\nBut to see what happens when you take a Tom is an antacid [laughter] oh oh okay so even if you're getting calcium in the in the antacid itself has that been absorbed\nBy sea because it has to be an Internet an environment for it to be absorbed\nExactly okay now we have a product called ... formula\nQuite combat formula is natural\nAnd the differences is that\nA powdered and what happens is you put it in hot water and you mix it up and you drink it don't do it in a liquid instead of a pill\nThat it absorbed into your system\nWow so that's a problem that\nWell yeah because when Cal the magnesium earn a liquid state it absorbs ten times better than in any other state\nWow that's great matter of fact yes I'm I'm reading the can right now says fans subs or being calcium and magnesium beverage powder\nWell it comes down to absorption one of the ways to tell if you're not observing calcium is take a look at what drugs they're taking\nAre you on high blood pressure medication\nDo you need something for your kidneys or you want pain medications you need sleeping with the calcium and especially the need is being absorbed ... you're not going to suffer from all these things my comment formula does absorb incredibly in the body the thing is is that what do you take my comments formula but not like well well I feel better\nI have thousands of people ready to the doctor pain 'cause I Can't believe it\nThirty minutes after I took the ...\nThe pain

make such a profound impact over the way that you feel\nOr say what's happened is that in the last fifty years the American diet has greatly changed\nAnd the nutrition has greatly changed and add to that the medication as many people are on blood pressure medications or anti anxiety drugs or heart medications\nAnd many of these things also blocked the absorption of calcium needs them in the

severely weakened even if they have insurance [noise] some people never do recover medical bills are the number one cause of bankruptcy according to a number of surveys and insurance may not help as much as you might think\nWe know that from surveys people say they are in deep financial trouble even if they have coverage so both of you read the insurance policy carefully and if you talk to people about what their experiences our insurance at this point doesn't offer real protection\nThat Dr David ... distinguished professor of public health center city University of New York at Hunter College\nIf you're actually sick most people are faced with such high copayments and the ... that they are in deep financial trouble even if I have coverage so many of us have policies that have a thousand or even two thousand dollars deductible before the insurance\nKicks in and even after that a lot of policies say you have to pay twenty percent of our cost if you're hospitalized or have a major procedure and hospitals steak can easily run up to a hundred thousand dollars so that could leave you with a bill of twenty thousand dollar even if you have insurance\nSo while millions more Americans have insurance now than did a few years ago as a result of Obamacare your share of the cost of any illness is going up\nMore than half of people who get their coverage from their employer now have at least a thousand dollar deductible Amish country and that was a tiny fraction back Fifteen Twenty years ago so deductibles\nAre rising and copayments arising as you say out of pocket caps are rising as well under the Obamacare policies which\nHave help people but it's still left from and deep trouble a lot of the policies have an out of pocket cap of six thousand dollars now for most families of six thousand dollar had\nSplit comes when you're sick and frankly in danger of losing income because you're out of work means that you're really not protected\nBut how common is it for families to get into financial trouble as a result of all that what's the average bill for example this left for someone to pay out of pocket when they go into the hospital a new study and the American economic reviews sought to find out\nAfter someone goes to a hospital we want to know what are the financial consequences of that\nAnd does it depend on whether people have health insurance or not at the time they go to the hospital\nThat's what led us to do to really time intensive effort of merging consumer credit reports\nJust like you and I would get from one of the credit reporting agencies we merged all of those credit report record with hospitalization records and that allowed us to see what happened to people before and after they were in the hospital\nThat's Dr mass you know do we do do associate professor of economics and strategy at Northwestern University He's also a co author of this study which search millions of hospital in financial records he\nSays there was a wide disparity between patients with insurance who had virtually no extra charges to pay and those who were caught by surprise but the average hospitalized patients with insurance fared pretty well\nDo see some unpaid medical bills even for people that are insured not incredibly large amounts of money but it's a few hundred dollars on average\nMan their interpretation which I'm going to rely on because they're the consumer finance experts is that in some cases people may either be struggling with the deductibles and co payments on their health insurance plans which could lead to these unpaid bills that we're seeing on their credit report\nBut another hypothesis that they had was that some individual just might not understand exactly what\nThis agreement about exactly what they need to pay and some of those disagreements might be resulting in unpaid bills or debt that's been sent to a collection agency\nHowever it's a little different for those without insurance and the average patient isn't in the hospital for five days or so according to the Centers for Disease Control and prevention and no till with Dick do says they're hit with higher unpaid bills as you'd expect he had it something else that hurts them the most financially\nAfter going to the hospital if you don't have insurance on average you you generate about five to six thousand dollars in unpaid medical bills and most of that almost all of it goes away if you are in short but whether you are in short or uninsured both group seem to be affected by a hospital admission in terms of their labor earnings\nTheir earnings declined by about twenty percent on average and that lasts for a number of years so it takes quite a while for people to go back to normal and for many people we also see some evidence that they ended up retiring early claiming Social Security earlier and in some cases even applying for disability insurance you\nKnow to what they do says that's the most ... finding of this study it's not medical bills that put the average family under financially when they're sick\nFor many people it seems difficult for them to return to work after they go to hospital and you know once we saw that it's not really that surprising I mean for some individuals when they go to the hospital to Syria\nEvent it might make working more difficult there might be short term or even long term disability maybe it's not so surprising but it's not something we were thinking about ahead of time which is just that after you go to the hospital and suffer\nSome kind of health shocked that so serious that you end up needing medical treatment\nPeople return to work slowly and they end up experiencing earnings losses reduction in income for them to actually for their entire household that persists for many years\nIn many ways he says the labor dislocation after major illness looks a lot like a town where the major industry has suddenly closed\nEveryone loses their job and then they have to go back and try to find a word in many of those case studies people take a long time to get back to where they were before and I think what was surprising to me it's just for how many people that look very similar they have a similar kind of experience just from a health event from going to the hospital\n... says that's a major reason that so that occur during a medical crisis or

big medical bills that's a time when your earnings are going down at the same time that the bills are coming in and of course\nThe stress of illness and the disaster of illness is coming up the same

testing a system that could be used by the president and the event of a national emergency here's correspondent in a war\nWhen we went off it wasn't immediately obvious in places like Santa Monica and at New York's Grand Central station couple said they knew it was coming we were warned\nAbout it it has been in the paper and everything so with no big shopping\n[laughter]\nA moment on TV\nOn Twitter where the hash tag presidential alert was trending and generated jokes and means with the Houston Zoo sending a cute baby elephant alert and the New York Mets saying this is not attached cake of big rom is the best pitcher in baseball it's similar to the local amber and weather alerts sent a mobile phones\nPlanning for the alert system began in two thousand six but some people said their phones didn't go off\nTwelve minutes after the alert we ask that Duncan's\nDid you get the alerts and no one wants to tell you on your mobile mobile\nOfficials say if you do you ever see a real presidential alert pay attention FEMA's Antwon Johnson\nTake those things very seriously when they come across a mobile device or that appears on radio and television or they're not the type of alerts on that should be ignored\nFamous epitaph except for the phone carrier and including T Mobile told us it may have taken up to thirty minutes for alerts to go through the mobile that it had no problems outside of that\nIf you were on an active phone call at the time he may not have gotten the alert but otherwise there's no way to opt out of the alert and aware of CBS News New York\nNew York times investigation is casting doubt on President Trump's claims she's a self made billionaire\nI got a very very small loan from my father many years ago I built into a massive empire as I said my father back that long\nList or Trump has said that loan was for one million dollars but according to a New York times investigation the president was given or an heritage the equivalent of at least four hundred Thirteen million dollars from his father's real estate empire\nMuch of his wealth came for most of the times calls\nWith tax scheme by the Trump family\nIncluding setting up a sham corporation to disguise gifts from their parents\nAnd creating a strategy to undervalue real estate holdings on tax returns the times estimates the Trump family avoided paying at least five hundred and fifty million dollars in gift in inheritance taxes\nBeing just over fifty million instead in between President Trump slam the times we're doing a quote very old boring and often told ... piece on me President Trump has previously boasted of taking advantage of tax laws without breaking them\nUse those laws tax investigators in New York state are now reviewing the allegations Kennedy Greg CBS News New York\nIt's not a good time to answer the phones on Capitol Hill Haley bird at the Weekly Standard knows why Hillary joins me on the line Haley has been an onslaught of calls to Congress what's going on and just so busy or the phone lines\nSo a lot of officers keep track of how many calls they get a per week usually depending on the topics that Congress has addressing so in the Senate right now predictably you have a lot of calls to key senators about a judge cabinet and uh it it just a lot of activism going on that\nIt it's questionable how effective that says but my colleague Tony ... and I recently wrote a story about\nA transfer calling and patch through college which is another form of advocacy that different groups use its it's widespread on Capitol Hill and so some of these are all coming through this week\nTo set a new tactic ... can you explain that so it's\nNot new it's been around for a few years but a few staffers told us\nA call in general have gone up since Trump was elected and had health care which was really a tense time on Capitol Hill with a lot of activism it's all a lot of these issues this sort of advocacy has become more widespread staffers take issue with it because they say that it doesn't represent\nConstituent fairly um because you know basically advocacy groups are recruiting constituents and then passing them through to the Congress men if they agree with them on a subject\nCan you give me a sense of how inundated Congress is right now with these calls and do you have a an idea of how well they're keeping up\nSo it's sort of tough to say because a lot of this data is a public I've heard from some staffers that it's very similar to health care which was just a very hectic time it's but putting a number on it it's really difficult\nAnd usually it's I I assume low level staffers are taking these these phone calls at first\nYeah so these are like twenty two to twenty four year olds most of them who take these phone calls I'm which can be stressful for them because you know you have\nHis in colleges office saying that a lot of their female staffers have been threatened with rape and things like that in in light of the Capitol hearing a lot of\nViolent threats do happen on these phone calls and the staffers or just have to keep up the professional demeanor um when when speaking to these constituents and it depends on what they are actually uh the colors are living in the state or not\nUm because senators don't really take into account if it's an out of state color because they want to cater to the people who actually live where they represent\nWhat you're seeing a more organized attempt at a uh these daily losers of phone calls\nSure and one thing that we noticed in reporting this story I thought it really happens for a lot of leash political issues\nLike I said net neutrality um appropriations bills\nWhere basically an organization like a hell of a telemarketer situation happened where they will call up the constituent and say hey how you feel about duck you think that these immigrants should stay here um what do you think and then the person on the other end of the line will say something easily they're confused\nI'm at which point the telemarketer ... passed them through the to their member of Congress\nAnd confusion I Would say is one of the key give away its for congressional staffers here because the constituent on the other end of the wind doesn't really know what's happening a lot of the time\nSomebody who\nAutomaker will tell you become America's Best

that look very similar they have a similar kind of experience just from a health event from going to the hospital\nHitler Stein says that's a major reason that so that occurred during a medical crisis or potentially much more damaging and lasting ... from things like credit cards every thing falls apart at once\nIt comes at a time when it's the worst time in your life so sheer gravely ill Enron thing up big medical bills that's a time when your earnings are going down at the same time with the bills are coming in and of course the stress of illness and the disaster of illness\nIs coming up the same time and for medical bills are coming in so that's different than buying a house or running up a\nBill on your credit card for other things and the other thing that's different about it is I mean we know that it's stopped people from getting a care that they need and that that can have\nMortal consequences so people who are afraid of their medical bills do\nLay going to the emergency room when they're having chest pain and that can often be a a fatal problem if you're having a heart attack it's really not just a financial problem but the financial stress creates medical problems that can be\nDisastrous\nQuite a lingering serious illness or injury means for a person's job explains another curiosity ... team found in credit reports\nWe had thought that one of the things people would do when they faced medical bills or maybe they would borrow to pay for those bills are really just spread out over time paying back those build that the great thing about consumer credits allows you to spread out payments over time so we thought we would go up and in fact we saw the opposite\nInstead researchers found the borrowing went down and credit limits did too for both the insured and uninsured\nOne of the way that we were able to I think makes sense of that result is when we viewed it along side what we saw in the labor market\nWhich is that individuals are working less they're earning less if they're earning less they're probably also consuming less we see declines in the share of the population that has an auto loan we see lower auto loan balances and maybe people are getting cheaper cars\nAnd so it really looks like people are just cutting back and if you think about it that way then it's not so surprising that the credit card balances are falling because even though you might want to borrow it is that the medical bills\nThose medical bills especially for the insured are pretty small relative to the lost income that we see on average it's really just people tightening their belts just as one would see following people losing their job as a result of their plant closing down for example\nHowever while some researchers have concluded that as many as half of all bankruptcies or as a result of medical bills noted with did go says his group founded happens much less often than that he speculates it's a result of the methodology\nWell we're trying to do is look at an actual shock that people receive\nLike an illness or an injury or something which caused them to go to the hospital and we want to see that in turn causes them to file for bankruptcy it's very different than taking people that have filed for bankruptcy and asking them why they filed for bankruptcy\nHowever ... says correlating hospital in financial databases limits the conclusions that can reasonably be made\nUnderlying the statistics with\nThe researchers assumed that only people who are hospitalized can possibly be bankrupted by an illness and not only that but the illness starts at the moment because you're hospitalized so any bill that comes in before the hospitalization doesn't count and we know\nFrom other sources of research that a lot of expensive care and a lot of medical problems start Welby for hospitalization and the other thing in that study is they assume that a trial that all that sort of spouses illness or parents illness\nCouldn't cause financial problems so were convinced that study grossly underestimated the number of medical bankruptcy somehow bigger problem this really is\nNo two ... says Medicare shows how important insurance he is he says some people in financial trouble before age sixty five as a result of hospitalization found relief that could be traced almost exactly to the day they turn sixty five\nHowever ... says Medicare pulls up short without supplemental coverage\nUnfortunately Medicare offers only very partial protection because Medicare unless you have supplemental insurance or medic said on top of Medicare\nLeaves people with big copayments ...

right now predictably you have\nA lot of calls to key senators about a judge cabinet and um it it's just a lot of activism going on that it it's questionable how effective this is my colleague Tony ... and I recently wrote a story about\nA transfer calling and patch through calls which is another form of advocacy that different groups use\nIts it's widespread on Capitol Hill and so some of these are all coming through this week\nIs that a new tactic to can you explain the\nSo it's not new it's been around for a few years but a few staffers told us\nA call in general have gone up since Trump was elected and had health care\nWhich was really a tense time on Capitol Hill with a lot of activism so a lot of these issues this so that sort of advocacy has become more widespread staffers take issue with it because they say that it doesn't represent constituent fairly\nUm because you know basically advocacy groups are recruiting constituents and then passing them through to the Congress men if they agree with him on a subject\nCan you give me a sense of how inundated Congress is right now with these calls and do you have a an idea of how well they're keeping up\nSo it's sort of tough to say because a lot of this data is a public I've heard from some staffers that it's very similar to health care which was just a very hectic time\nIt's but putting a number on it it's really difficult\nAnd usually it's I I assume low level staffers are taking these these phone calls at first\nYeah so these are like twenty two to twenty four year olds most of them who take these phone calls I'm which can be stressful for them because you know you have\nSusan Collins is office saying that a lot of their female staffers have been threatened with rape and things like that in in light of the Capitol hearing a lot of violent threats do happen on these phone calls and the staffers or just have to keep up the professional demeanor um when when speaking to these constituents and it depends on what they are actually\nUh the colors are living in the state or not\nUm because senators don't really take into account if it's an out of state color because they want to cater to the people who actually live where they are is that\nWhat you're seeing a more organized attempt at a uh these day losers of phone calls\nSure and one thing that we noticed and reporting this story is but it really happens for a lot of\nLeash political issues like I said net neutrality\nUm appropriations bills where basically an organization ... like I tell them telemarketer situation happened where they will call up the constituent and say hey how you feel about duck you think that these immigrants should stay here\nUm what do you think and then the person on the other end of the line will say something easily they're confused\nI'm at which point the telemarketer ... passed them through the to their member of Congress\nAnd confusion I Would say is one of the key give away its for congressional staffers here because the constituent on the other end of the wind doesn't really know what's happening a lot of the time\nAll they know that they were called\nThe the conversation oftentimes goes a little bit like hello\nAnd and the staff are on the other side is high you've reached the ... the congressman's office um do you need anything\nI'm Steve Dorsey CBS [noise]\nAny all

can sing camp songs\nTogether might hear crickets\nAnyhow I'm by the way I'm betting you that Microsoft thing as a compiler compiler hair yeah think about it what it basically it's I think is doing is just doing a ... a a a not an upgrade but you know how they have the advanced than the regular and one is wipe out all your stuff\nMaybe somebody pushed the wrong button near St ... click the wrong check mark\nIt that or you know if you've done enough or programming to know that sometimes the compiler decides to do something unplanned\n[noise] so what you would think I mean if that's the case wouldn't\nSome buddy have run it at least once before saying here habits everybody\nSomebody must have noticed that I Know I Know Microsoft has a lot of testing I guess I it's very hard to imagine what were the real problem Microsoft has is that unlike apple where you know there's a handful of ... of machines run apple or all of the run ... macro with all of a made by apple so they know\nThe testings fairly easy with Microsoft there's thousands of PC manufacturers\nEvery machine had some sort of different you know configuration of hardware and other programs running on it and you're installing a a challenging thing which is to install a big upgrade\nOn an on an in place operating system so it is not an easy thing to do and I think what's happened probably more likely is it worked it worked for me it worked for most people but some people had some sort of odd thing oddball thing running that are somehow interacted poorly with the installer I mean you're right the installer shouldn't have done that but\n... says there's so many millions of combinations said problem and and anybody is two hundred and whatever gig data loss is big news\nWell it is but yeah that's right ... when you have a billion users if even one one thousand to one percent of them have problems that's that thousands of people so\n[laughter] um okay so my question is is got an Android two fifty six gig um essay and I would like to just download all my email on it and be able to search it nicely the only problem is so far I've tried a couple of different email programs\nAnd about every twenty to thirty emails I gotta say download show more show\nMore show that's not the email program or you're using Gmail\n[noise] uh no this is actually go daddy\nDaddy it's not the email programs fall it's something go daddy's doing while email servers do this because they don't want you to hit the server real hard and say give me all fourteen gigabytes of my email now\nSo they ... and they say well you can have a certain number messages at a time so that I mean that's really all that's going on a ... so you can try you know Android email program so you're blue in the face\nAnd you still have the same problem because it's not the\nProgram itself it's it's go daddy and the males are pursuing it ah how do you get around it I don't know I mean I Would I generally will first of all I map which is probably the protocol you're using yes\nA isn't really designed for downloading the emails for cashing and what's on the server but the server is the definitive store and that's not on your phone or computer anything is on your premises it's on the uh the the ... ... email providers premises so\nThat is your ... you know I met president really designed for you to download anything just caches and\nSo if you really want to download and you should investigate with and I bet you this is the case the go daddy server will support pop three [noise] which is the old\nMember of post office protocol that allows you to download all the mail and find a a pop three or Android email program that will support pop three\nI don't know if canine will do it that's the most um [noise] that's the most powerful email or by no of on Android K dash night it's open source it probably support yes supports pop\nYou use the pop server for go daddy instead of the IMF server and then you download it may still uh say all you can only have twenty but tomorrow you get twenty more tomorrow after that after that over time you can gather all the mail basically\nThat's what pop three designed for pop three ... the older political was designed for you to log into your mail server clean it out and then uh and because that was because hard drive space is expensive and I speak didn't want to keep your mail\nNowadays because we have many devices the ice ... keeps your mail and the devices are just a window into the server that makes sense\nYeah real quick thing yeah if you don't have any more callers one quick thing about all I was a a dinner for my wife's work and we're like five couples and I said I Can't watch football it's two Thirteen minutes compressed into two and a half to three hours my wife my take I have time to ...\n... it's not merely engaging\nYou need an action movie if you want to avoid cuddling yeah\nThat's true it is it's eleven to Thirteen minutes of action spread out over a three hour period it's kind of amazing I Do fortunately have more calls thank goodness yeah so I appreciate it mark thank you so much by listening and uh you know it is true if you want to you could just\nLeave oh that football game [noise] watch the whole thing if they're\n\nLoyal to pour the tech guy wanted to call a\nDon't see the dumb guy or gal that work\nFor less than five Seventy
