N. A. X. [noise]\nThey say there's always goes to the head of the law ... says show\nThe top news stories seems to change a fairly frequent bases in the news these days and all over\nThe last week or so the biggest story has been a massive caravan of people I call it the invasion caravan that is headed toward America's southern border\nThey are still a little under two thousand miles away so they seem to be making pretty good speed at this point they've already busted through the wall of the barricades to get out of Guatemala to get into Mexico and now I'm actually goes apparently just ...\nThere's Bourne they've already busted through the wall of the barricades\nSo to get out of Guatemala to get into Mexico and now I'm actually goes apparently just law allowing this massive caravan to head north toward the United states a lot of talk about that with Maria as for knows who's the national director of the remembrance project Maria welcome back to the program\nKilo Lance thanks so much for having me on again\nSo ... the October surprise that the Democrats usually a plan for every every ... every major election America\n[laughter] right they orchestrated and then they try to place blame on President Trump's shoulders and trying to make him look like the uh an evil person and the Republican Party as the evil when we're trying to do is to protect our borders\nAnd in fact the president said if he needs to both the military on the border do you think that's what we're up against because this curve and started at one thousand is now supposed to be a seven thousand or greater ... their numbers that are greater than that not know by the time it hits the border if it keeps growing the way it has been\nThere could be over ten thousand people trying to get into the United states all of the same time I think\nThe military is the only way that we're going to stop this invasion and according to achieve many idea out of the Archie the sector the Rio Grande valley sector and\nAnd uh Texas they're mckell and he mentioned in the last two weeks there were fifty four hundred family units coming through and this is in advance of that care of and you know also Neal they captured gang members cartels and of course they were over\nSeven hundred pounds of marijuana and other drugs I think it's it's overwhelming for the I say for the border patrol agents um there has to be some help there and that's what he's asking for is for the enforcement\nWe might actually get some help from Mexico when President Trump last week said he said to Mexico if you don't help us stop this then we may end up with no trade deal whatsoever and I thought I knew Shirley Mexico was trying to help but now I guess not\nRight you know think of it this way and I think that that Mexico of course is helping the Democrat Party and should\nUm [noise] the Democrats win this mid term they would of course move again to impeach president Tom and they would implement their far left agenda so this is a win situation for Mexico and and you know a large that they have no intention in stopping this invasion\nNo and in fact I didn't get Trump out of the way and if they can take away one house of Congress and then they stop him from passing anything as a bill which pushes them back to the only other thing he has ... his executive orders and I've been very proud that this president\nDoes not used executive orders in place of legislation the way his predecessor did so frequently what\nElse can we do to get those things up\n[laughter] so I think that the makeup people need to speak up and they certainly need to be showing their support and making their voices heard calling the White House it to zero to four five six\nEleven eleven and telling President Trump that we support him and we support placing the military on the border in order to stop the invasion and protect America and American lives and also I think that we need to go ahead and Jim odyssey go vote and vote for those who will\nStand for securing our border and for an America First agenda that President Trump is\nPushing forward but he can't do it alone you know we can send them to use the military we can\nTake that trade deal off the table some you can you know we can also um implement some sort of um I Would say additional\nFees or assess fees wherever possible like their remittance fees you know Mexico has assessed fees for the money going into their country from the United states now let's take it back on that and really\nMake them feel the pain because every man's face\nBut that that gardeners into Mexico and the Mexico\nJust about two billion dollars a month on those remittances that is why the from the money wired into Mexico now\nThey have every intention again to continue that flow of money and to push their citizens um onto the American taxpayer while\nTrying to collect state U.S foreign aid and U.S foreign aid has to be taken off the table as well a\nMemory or would you remind reminding my audience about them remember and project and walked out is all about what led\nTo we started in two thousand nine as a voice for victims killed by illegal aliens and naturally large November fourth of this year we're going to recognize the national day of remembrance for Americans killed by illegal aliens\nThis is our seventh year to recognize his national day we want to make sure that this issue is not swept under the rug once again and you know President Trump have also asked him to officially a naturally proclaimed this\nDay of remembrance so that we can fix the problem you know these families are American families are permanently separated from their loved ones never to see them again till they reach heaven\nAll one hundred percent preventable and it's the lack of the spine and courage and doing the right thing that these\nPoliticians who are elected to do that and protect America and follow our constitution and that's the reason why there are ... are wonderful falling Americans who have lost their lives so\nYou know we we do ah we also Lars has a\nChaplain St group and a crisis intervention group where we help the family and get the help that they need um you know psychologically emotionally to sell you know we're doing a lot of things which is so very grateful that President Trump has city Exxon with on this issue and listen to a moms and dads\nBut you know we have to get off the top of our friends and family to help out and speak out\nYou know the only ideas like that do yours I liked the idea of taxing the remittances but I think there may be an easier way to do it uh you know that the virus has all kinds of rules even for American citizens have you go down to your bank for some reason and deposit around ten thousand dollars\nThe IRS good to notify because they know that they don't want to be hiding cash\nVibe or feeling a lot of the remittance money to send back\nHis money does earned is cash by illegal aliens who are working illegally in this country and when they send it out of the country by going down to a\nConvenience store a place where they can buy Western Union money order and send it to their families that effectively hide for tax purposes and I have a feeling a lot of it was was as they've not pay taxes on it so say\nIf you're a legal American citizen or a green card holder you of a Social Security number if you want to send money by Western Union say more than a hundred dollars a at a time you're going to have to show Social Security number if you don't you have to pay a fee and you could make the free produced up you could make it five or ten percent and say\nShow Social Security number if you don't you have to pay a fee and you could make the feet produced up you could make it five or ten percent and said this is a way of reminding folks ah that that you are not going to be able to dodge the tax man and that we understand that if you're saying that money's south\nOr we can stop you from spending the money but we could say you have to and Social Security number or it's a five or ten percent feet\nThe other thing I Would suggest to Americans as we're heading into the fall where it gets cold in most parts of America\nA lot of people decided to take vacation time and sometimes they be patient and Mexico both because you know there's a lot of sun and because it's inexpensive it might be a good idea I don't sponsor boycotts because I think my audience are smart enough to make their own decisions\nBut have a vacation in the United states and skip Mexico and ... send them a message that if they're willing to help people invade our country then we don't need to be spending tourist dollars which are also important to Mexico Maria what's the website ... for the remembrance\nBecause they couldn't afford coverage until Republicans were killed that tax of course Democrats would like to put it back in place but it's not good enough to get rid of the penalty to get rid of the individual mandate if you don't also have deregulation and there's nothing for people to choose their no non Obamacare options available\nEven if Obamacare's voluntary rather than mandatory unless you also have the deregulation a deregulatory steps that we've seen from the Trump Administration and Democrats are basically saying look if we can't mandate Obamacare let's ban all the other options that people have no other choice then they're stuck in it and I think that's you know if our guys were any\nGood at talking about health care on the stump they would be carrying Democrats up on that things are horrible though from them and they said we're protecting preexisting condition or a provision\nWhich makes no sense because this you know they basically voted to repeal a guaranteed renew ability and the short term market well you know if you get sick and develop a preexisting condition guaranteed renew ability to great protections you don't have to go into Obamacare and yet\nThat's exactly what they voted to repeal so if anything it was the opposite of what they kind of made their talking point on this vote in the media basically let them get away with it to the extent they paid attention at all\nYou know fell over the weekend I heard more people document a pre existing conditions do I I Want to I Want you to testify numbers on this and see if this works I Wish we could knock this issue out all together once and for all and here's how I Do it I've talked to a few different experts including balancing the coin you and others who know this issue well\nAnd they say you know for all the talking about pre existing conditions the total number of people who meet that description is about four hundred thousand and they base that on the number of people who signed up with Obamacare for pre existing conditions and the number of people who are in risk pools before Obamacare came along\nHis four hundred thousand people out of three hundred and thirty million people in this country\nAnd the total cost of covering those people it's a high premium it averages thirty two thousand dollars a year\nBut in terms of a national policy is twelve billion dollars it's a drop in the bucket in a federal budget that is four thousand billion dollars and you need twelve dollars twelve billion dollars to cover it\nIf we passed a law that said if you are you know judge to have a pre existing condition and it's not it's one that actually takes a lot of money to cover\nThen we're just going to cover you were just period unless you you know make more than five hundred thousand dollars years I mean you could set some income limits on and you knock that issue out altogether and say now let's solve the rest of the problem was let the private sector do most of it and the only other big issue I'm aware of\nIs the one where people say but if you're going along happy and healthy and some things strikes you down you need a above a triple quadruple bypass or you need a liver transplant or something like that say fine let's so catastrophic plans must not have the government do it let's have the private sector of the government were to say to the private sector insurance folks hey\nCan you come up with a product that's what they called the insurance industry my wife used to work ... like a long time ago um have a product that will cover you for catastrophes right it's a kind of coverage most people have if they paid off their cars just one policy that covers you only if things go completely terribly wrong\nAnd those can be sold very cheaply to now you've covered people for catastrophic loss you've covered all the people the four hundred thousand that are uh they have pre existing conditions now the rest of it for the most part is this stuff where people wanted Obamacare to pay for maintenance basically they wanted you to pay for everything from birth control pills fear\nAnnual checkup and everything else which I don't think should be the subject of insurance any more than I think my car insurance should cover the maintenance on my car\nNow my wrong on the numbers and I'm not getting this wrong [noise]\nI Would I Would disagree only with your last point at the end there because of Obamacare actually in practice has its\nWrong on the numbers that I'm getting this wrong\n[noise] I Would I Would disagree only with your last point at the end there because Obamacare actually in practice has extremely hard to do\nBut we are paying these very high premium so we're not getting any that routine stuff or even a more expensive stuff than that and so you know the the perverse effect here is that we've got a centrally high deductible plans but we're paying a fortune in premiums for them anyway and there there's no other there's no other choice available because of the regulatory structure I'm\nBetsy is number four hundred thousand might be right I think that it's probably a little on the high end because\nThe first four years after Obamacare passed before the exchanges launched there was something called\nThe preexisting condition insurance plan which massively subsidized people with preexisting condition so they could get coverage if they were uh you know uninsured because the exchanges that launch it and they the total enrollment and that was about a hundred twenty nine thousand\nNow might get a lot of money thrown out of money prematurely say maybe\nThey were twice or three times as many people that want to take what would have used that if it hadn't run out of money but I think if anything has a high estimate from that the\nShow so maybe it's a couple of hundred dollars and it's the kind of thing that a very affluent country a wealthy country like ours could easily say if you're one of those people with a ... a catastrophic metal medical condition her condition that goes on\nFor a long time and it's a pre existing condition caused a huge amount of money to cover we could cover it and we could say that's something we ought to do as a society unless you're already getting it through your work will be glad to cover it\nAnd that we take that one right off the table thank you very much we always appreciate your insides feel ... you can read his column she writes nationally he's the author of democracy denied and you're listening Lars Larson show [noise]\n[noise]\n\nYou'll see

Joe the question is what do we do with that giant caravan\nThat is heading toward America's border is full of people who have some have burned American flags waved to their own flags from the home countries there from kind of indicated they desire to come into the United states and not necessarily do it legally either they called themselves refugees\nBut you have to remember the refugee has a specific meaning in the law and I've asked John's mirror to join us senior editor at the stream and author of the new politically incorrect guide to immigration John good to have you back on\nBank you could be on although this is a very grim occasion it is and told me one this is an invasion by couldn't keep the doors let's just call it what it is\nThese people are no more refugees than Cortez and his soldiers were when they arrived in Mexico\nWould agree with you\nYeah they're not asking permission to come into our country because they're genuine refugee it's first of all refugees someone who is persecuted by his government the way the Jews were persecuted by Nazi Germany and they sell to the United states\nAnd tragically France Franklin Roosevelt trade them away those shoes on those boats\nThe people and like you know would end up like an Frank or not waving Nazi flags they will not screaming about how they're going to carry on\nNazi German traditions and culture in the United states\nOkay what when you see people claiming to recognize that and they're waving the flag of the country that allegedly persecute them maybe it's time to be suspicious\nAnd by the way they don't fit the asylum seeker label either do there\nNo no ... on either of those counts they should stay in the first safe country they reach ... of course they were perfectly safe and Honduras or wherever they came from but they're pretending they were at the moment they got to Mexico\nThey should apply for for asylum or refugee status and they're not doing it\nTo let a single one of these people not one into this country I don't care if we have to\nSet the Rio Grande on fire the way the Cuyahoga caught fire in the seventies this cannot happen\nI agree with you because John weren't going to get more of this and you know what probably set this off most recently and tell me if I'm wrong about does\nDrew Donald Trump adopted a zero tolerance policy and the Democrats treated like a hobby horse and said no you can't do that because you're separating parents from children many of the adults were not the parents of those children try any of them had no connection at all we know that\nBecause some of them some of the parents some of the adults I should say we're told you you can go home do you want to take your kids with you know I'm leaving I'm here\nWell that's because they weren't really connected they were probably assisting and trafficking those kids but the right\nTo child pornography or slave labor and the Obama administration or let ten thousand kids go with the people claim to be their parents and they found the working a slave labor as an egg factories and I in Idaho\nSo the bottom line is is is that these people will try to cross the border illegally and I've had people saying well you know they can't do this or to bigger group I think they're planning to overwhelm the border patrol knowing that\nYou know I mean we see this on a smaller scale do we have fifty illegals encounter a half a dozen border patrol agents those agents may be able to stop half a dozen people or four dozen people but many of them get right on by\nSo if you swarmed the border with seven thousand or who knows it maybe ten thousand because this thing has been growing like crazy over the last week or so it went from one thousand four thousand announced seven and may be headed for ten biggest to the border and their ten thousand strong\nHow in the world are you going to stop them short of using the option that President Trump says he will use the military\nSo absolutely we should use the military and we should we should have drones flying over them now dropping leaflets telling them that they're not welcome in as they approached the border we should have just maybe drone spraying with Cathy or something and these people need to be deterred they need to know that we will use what ever force is necessary\nIncluding deadly force if they if they attack our border guards and kill them if they trampled and\nThen the military will use silent sports this is an invasion of our country by foreign mop if we have on this the entire population of Latin America is going to walk across the land bridge into the United states and then the entire\nThat the large parts of the population of the Muslim world will get on boats the way they are doing in the Mediterranean they will sales in the United states ... ... ... we will be inundated it will be over ... an existential crisis for the United states of America\nAnd by the way it is usually won exist or not\nYou know John these are not all Hondurans are Guatemalans or Mexicans they're finding apparently there are people there from Bangladesh which is another uh apparently in the first the first nine ten months of this year we've seen six hundred Bangladeshis\nCross into the United states over those our southern border so they say\nThere's long been relating operational relationship between al ... who did the nine eleven attacks and Central American cartel like MS Thirteen\nSo that means that they've seen this is the way to get in don't try to sneak in through a regular port of entry fly into South America Central America come north on buses or whatever where you can find your way north get past the borders and then just to enter the United states surreptitiously across a wide open\nNorth on buses or whatever where you can find your way north\nGet past the borders and then just to enter the United states surreptitiously across a wide open borders maybe we should take some of the tens of millions that we're going to take away from Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador as punishment for them not helping us with this problem and spend it on building a wall\nWe absolutely have to build to build a wall electrified and set it on fire out who wages and it's being she ended up just in time to the elections and I think I Know why I mean there are activists walking around handy outlining organizing buses trucks down there\nThis is not a spontaneous movement there's no political ... got your sources\nGreasy fingerprints all over it but people say well why why would they do that so close to the election don't realize is going to help the Republicans they don't think it will\nThey think trample cave the way he caved are separating families and they think they can get across the border he won't cave and the Republican base will be so depressed discussion dispirited that they won't turn out to vote\nNo but but you know John over the weekend I tweeted out that one I saw the video of this crowd coming up to the gates leaving Guatemala and going across the bridge in New Mexico and they simply burst through the gates wrecked you know rip them down and went on true\nAnd then the crowded that bridge wall you know from edge to edge with with illegal aliens or future I mean they weren't crossing into Mexico legally so I think I could still called them illegal aliens because they weren't entering through any kind of process I said this is the best to add for Donald Trump's wall but I've seen in a long time\nBut you're right if the Democrats have calculated if we force the president to threaten to use the military and then he doesn't and they cross in\n... Republicans and conservatives will be a demoralized by that absolutely but if it yeah\nIf they break out our fences and march onto a breach like that we need to blow up the bridge before they get to it if they escalate we escalate well we can I mean I Would try to casually load up before they reach it can't be allowing new clarified that because I said no they get to it\nYeah because they're not foreign combatants but I Would say we use everything we can and what is the United states military I mean our military is great winning wars but they also know how to guard a perimeter and if you were burning amateur on his staff the perimeter is now the edge of our country to make sure nobody comes in I think\nWe were in the board in Afghanistan why can't we guard the borders of the United states I mean we really Donald Trump needs to open a military bases\nAll along our southern border use eminent domain if necessary and use use federal money to linked them by a by us at ... by a border fence if he can't\nWhen they're putting a a a variety of yelling and screaming match it so they can get closer to the Kennedy we know that John Hinckley junior was a very very close to president\nBefore he actually shot George Wallace was shot by an assassin who was yelling at people in the crowd that they were cheering loudly enough for George Wallace so\nWhat people don't understand when they sit there and say well why did you act\nThis why why did you move away or run away or not address these people who are approaching you're in public and screaming at you like it for good reason you have no idea what their motivations are and motivations of the ... people in the protests maybe\nHonorable if you can call them honorable may be disrespectful but they're they don't need any harm but the public officials had to be concerned about others who may be tagging along with with law enforcement what somebody approaches a vehicle the officer has no idea that person's going to ask\nDirections or if that person is trying to get close to them or for that purpose we've seen attacks on law enforcement where two or three people were saying hey why don't you get away from that guy is a ... you know given the past don't arrest them and then someone comes up ... based on the outs for being distracted and physically attacks of\nKnow I've seen that myself land so I told you I used to go on a lot of ride along and I'd I'd have officers who to watch if we're going on her arrested for shoplifting or at a convenience store and in particular neighborhoods we'd have a crowd of fifty people standing round is very quickly\nAnd you don't know which ones are just looking to lose and which ones are potentially dangerous to the officer but there was a lot of the shouting and then more recently we've seen attacks on General Mattis and others\nThere is to the officer but there was a lot of shouting\nAnd then more recently we've seen attacks on General Mattis and others you know attempts to take their lives or rice and\nIt's as though there's just a whole you know sort of spectrum of different ways that anybody in authority or or a political position is is being attacked a police officer is part of that he's where the rubber meets the road you know when it comes to government policy we have laws we have to have men and women in uniform who enforce them\nAnd now they're being viewed as as a potential target by people who have some kind of beef either against society or against the laws or against the enforcement of laws [noise]\nYeah you know we heard a there's a video out you can find and I I tend not to talk about these people that don't you know air anymore airplane but there's a video out as a woman is questioned about a kitten the ... shot a cop and she just looks at the carrots it's so big daily shot a cop\nYou know these are the officers that are going into communities that other people wouldn't go to a lot of pet with all of their doors locked their windows rolled up and you know they're going in there and trying to make a difference or they just responding to calls from hell for help\nFrom law abiding citizens that live there that you know are trying to have their kids on a school bus without somebody try selling drugs\nAnd and how do we get on top of that if the whole community is so distrustful of the cops\nThat they take that attitude that if a cop was shot so what I mean that that you know I Want the cops to go home alive every single night but I also want them to be able to go into a community and get real communication that might help them find\nThe person who's you know child trafficking or the person who's selling doping community and that kind of attitude from members of the community is just not helpful at all\n[noise] tell it's not in the way that you combative is he start telling the story of all the good things officers day every day so we see it all the time and and you have to yell louder\nPeople say well you know I talked about what happened you know you need to yell out or if there's an officer that does something in your community that benefit everybody put it on every social media on you could imagine called a news until they\nDo a story about it and there's they they're doing things everyday law enforcement officers do things every day that are not in their job description\nAnd just to protect people you know we had floods in Austin we had a terrible hurricane that came through\nGeorgia and Florida and you can find reports of officer is going to work when their houses didn't exist as a matter of fact there's a company called relentless to enter in Texas the great company they found out that officer some of them their uniforms just completely blew away so they started printing T shirts that said police officer\nSo they would have some way to patrol the communities you know while their families had been shipped out and evacuated they're still staying in the

your show up to vote to put a stop to them and that's the president's doing with this message ... you know the one counter here he is ... is Democrats are not playing ball they're not engaging hears a Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer issued a joint statement after that Trump tweet where he said Chuck and Nancy call me so we can\nTalk border security and they just turned it around to health care which is where they want they used to be a but but the other thing\nThat I get Democrats have going for them in this regard as President Trump\nIs in control of national security and he had that ... disposal the power\nTo stop migrants at the border\nAnd so it's not a situation I think this would be more potent\nLike national security wasn't twenty fourteen when Senate Republicans and in fact House Republicans were able to run against President Obama's handling of ISIS when he referred to the JV squad and diminished the danger that they posed the middle east and to American national security in general this is a case where\nA President Trump who's warning of this while I think it's a\nGood election year methods down the stretch alternately he's in charge of gene he can implement policy to stop this and that's if Democrats really getting to the mission they can say look\nYeah President Trump has the power to deal with is we're not standing in his way\nSaturdays but don't they have some type of obligation at least in terms of messaging on this I mean\nI don't know who's behind this march I just see a bunch of people coming to the United states for a long time for the midterm don't the Democrats at least have to say something on this wouldn't be the 'cause Jon talked about David what can they say about that David I\nI don't really think they have to say anything about this and in fact I think the same way I think it's smart for the president to push that sort of political standpoint I think the best thing Democrats could do is say nothing\nYou donate or your base by ... by by trying to outflank trap on the right and you don't play Trump's game by looking weak and looking as though you hope that everybody shows up and and and gets into the country\nSay nothing that most I Would say if I were a democratic candidate is it our I clearly for border security and this is President Trump's job and deal with this because he's the president and and that's what I think they should there\nJohn I think that's a good strategy accept that there's so many than the Democrats who earlier earlier said that it's time to abolish ice so if they remain silent\n'em and they don't ... their previous position or they tried to model that I think that just gives a turns to debate away from health care which is what the Democrats wanted it to be turns of immigration\nWhich is a mixed issue for Trump but not in the districts are Republicans after hold on that is a base turnout model\nCan we agree John that this is a this is about as hot as it gets as

I. D. S. these are court papers filed within the last days what did we learn from Mr hearty that restate talked curiosity about Russia to get good evening to check\nIn John a bed yeah thanks for having me\nYeah so that these documents were filed a late night friday a case involving a lawsuit for some of these Carter Page by the documents that have ... you know that we can change things for quite a while now and a kind of sucked into a hundred and fifty plus page report revelation\nNot entirely surprising but he'll still on a few of the ... what were the whole investigation that the FBI used multiple confidential human sources ball was compiling information on Carter Page and the Trump campaign and all these things so that the new revelation there is that we already know about us steel\nBritish spy who wrote the dossier that equate accused chomping the campaign of all these things I'm so this new document or refers to multiple a coral informants that were used\nAnd so you and I talk quite a bit about stuff on our the University of Cambridge professor who has been revealed to also be an informant who met with page and George Papadopoulos and every one and uh so now we have those two known informants\nLoss others and so the question that you and I and everyone else would like to find out who are these informants when did they crucially when did they start ah their work on behalf the FBI and how much were they paid and all of those close touch question\nThe quote from Mr hearty the FBI is protected information that would identify the identities of other confidential sources who provided information or intelligence to the FBI as well as quote information provided by those sources so we have a long list to investigate we know steal\nWe know how her or the FBI has never acknowledge how correct Chuck ... we've surmise and other reporters have confirmed the surmise that help or it's one of them but we don't know does this includes down or do we know Alexander down or he's ...\nFrom the surmise that help has one of them but we don't know does this includes down or do we know Alexander down or he certainly in the position to have cooperated with the FBI certainly had a large motive\nBecause after all he was identified with the Clinton campaign and we know now that the Clinton campaign one of its lawyers ... for ... coy was connecting with the FBI so do we believe down or his name is in this filing\nVery well could be a ... that's an interesting possibility a downer himself has given a just a you know one or two interviews ... says name surfaced last December\nBut it's connected to ... um and he's not saying a whole lot he's not a ... he ... he was obviously and the Australian government were funneling information back to the FBI\nAnd the question would be to the FBI consider him a confident that C. H. S. than their parlance confidential human source or was he merely you know just a offered this one off tip\n'em and so it's very possible that down or is considered one of their confidence of human sources um there are others that you know or who have been involved in the ... who make contact with Carter Page and George Papadopoulos and these guys I'm throughout the campaign who who very well could have sharing information with the FBI\nUm and and as I mentioned you know someone according to these documents someone was paid for their work and so that raises you know we we could assume that perhaps down her since she was an Australian Government official perhaps was not paid for that work\nSo they're all in addition to doubt or others out there um and so it'd be very interesting to find out what information they provide it but also with the whole Carter Page five to ... and and this newfound did not get into it\nBut you and I have also discussed how um Republicans on on the hill of referred to potentially exculpatory evidence contained in the fourth and final five so\nUh that that somehow a paint a different picture of the information regarding Carter Page and so I'm going to go back to Rod Rosenstein who's going to be speaking to Capitol Hill I'm On Wednesday I Believe\nI'm a sign this particular five\nSays so this is a question that you know hopefully they'll be asked to we we can expect tend to try to dodge the question um as far as what type of exculpatory information there might be but it's a bit next to piece that\nWould help put all together and it's also one of the aspects that the President Trump has been interested in declassify from these documents\nRight and it's been a rose in seeing who stopped that the classification President Trump wanted the foresight to war and\nHe wanted the FBI question and answer the thrill to sweat Bruce or who was in ... remains in the OJ principal and who was involved in communicating with Mr Steele to the FBI another he was a go between\nHis wife Nelly our work for Glenn Simpson of fusion GPS who has now taken the ...

we moved the story a little bit also in the White House request for release\nWas the word the text messages of many of these players including Rod Rosenstein himself so there's an enormous amount of information that we have not seen yet and the FBI is being coy\nAbout what will or will not release protecting confidential sources Papadopoulos is testifying this week to Congress is that accurate Chuck\nBut yet he does testifying on\nTo the to the task force or the\nSame task force\nThat his interview James Baker the FBI lawyer smelly or and ah Bruce or\nUm House Judiciary and House Oversight and Government Reform committee interviewing Papadopoulos and um\nIf you follow Papadopoulos on Twitter ... made quite a few comments recently about a lot of these what he says they're suspicious contacts\nThat he had while on the campaign and we've documented I've documented you and I talked about ... who is definitely a suspicious a contract he was an FBI informant or George Papadopoulos just said\nThat he had at least three or four more strange contacts people coming up to him and blind to meet with him while he was on the campaign um and he now believes since he's been through you know uh he he's a bit interaction with helper they now believe that perhaps\nOther informants are there are people working on behalf of western intelligence to were sent to approach him to perhaps clean information from it\nDoes he think mental ... does he think Masood was one of those ... uh one of those FBI informants\n... yeah yeah he does uh he he believes that he's not laid out I'll be honest he's not laid out a clear and articulate kind of\nA there is no evidence yet tying sued to down or to help or um no not one clear narrative here um but they these are three or four I'm\nVery interesting um approaches that he he you know he had um and so his theory seems to be that there's some sort of connection near um because you know as as he claims he and he he he pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI but he's not found you know he was not charged with anything beyond\nThe lowest one thousand one charge for lying um he's not been accused of conspiracy so um and what we've heard from several lawmakers as well is that soon after the investigation was open based upon information about Papadopoulos but down or information um there were some piece of\nEvidence that the government receive potentially exculpatory evidence\nWhich kind of undercooked initial narratives are that the government had\nTo to open an investigation based on Papadopoulos so um he he wants to talk to

campaign\nYou believe it's significant however that the sentencing for Michael Flynn has to come on December Eighteenth explain why that tells us that Mueller is going to be disappointing\nYeah let's let's I guess we should sort out two separate things John I think with respect to General Flynn\nWhen he pled guilty it was with the understanding that he was going to cooperate with the investigation and so far as we know he has made himself available for interviews questioning and all like um [noise] generally speaking\nProsecutors\nWhen they have an ability to influence when a sentencing is scheduled\nDo not allow cooperate or to be sentenced by the court until after their cooperation has concluded which usually means any testimony that they're\nGoing to give are expected to given the investigation of because you want the full breath of the person's cooperation to be before the sentence in court so I think the fact that General Flynn is now scheduled to be sentenced and apparently the sentencing is going to go forward on December right team\nIndicates that Mahler doesn't think he's going to require him for any in court\nTestimony that's not a sure sign of that but it's a pretty good sign or so that is another thing that leads me to think that the investigation is probably\nWinding down to a conclusion as far as the Woodward comparison is concerned my my point to in in mind discussion with rich and I appreciate your mention of the the McCarthy report podcast um [noise] the point of that discussion\nWas that Mahler works for the Justice Department as a prosecutor he is not a lawyer for a congressional impeachment committee and a prosecutor is only real job to report is whether to recommend bringing charges or not or declining charges\nA particular investigation and a particular set of facts that he's been authorized to investigate so to my mind it's not ... job to do a ... on\nThe fitness of the president to be president the question is whether there's enough evidence to to bring charges based on the things that he's been authorized to investigate\nThaddeus [laughter] and you mentioned in the past how this would be a surprise when as heroes and staying there signed can continue\nTo stress that this was all necessary but you also made the point and believe in the last article was well there are a lot of the stuff for the special counsel's during its been handed off to other departments existing department of justice and really are yet to show why this was mass hysteria or just to stream I totally agree with that\nI Do agree with that I think that you know we question Betty is whether this investigation was necessary because it was not\nAssigned in compliance with the regulations of the Justice Department which require both showing that there's a conflict of interest that makes it impossible for the Justice Department to investigate the matter in the normal course and that there's a factual basis for believing that some\nA criminal charge\nMay be appropriate because some crime has been committed um there was never any showing that there was this kind of conflict of interest and there was never any articulation of the factual basis for a criminal investigation and the fact I think that\nThe portions of the investigation like the to Russia indictments that Mahler return have been transition took components of the Justice Department is strongly indicative of the fact that there was never any\nConflict of interest in the first place I don't think those cases should have been brought because I think that the the charging instruments there are more in the nature of a publicity\nOr announcements then real charges nobody ever thought that the including Mahler I'm sure that ah Vladimir ... was going to allow his operatives to be brought to America for a trial\nSo brain indictment like that was was pointless in that sense but the fact that it's been transition to ... to go and they've been transitions two components of the Justice Department indicates that there's no reason the Justice Department couldn't have done this investigation and the first place\n[noise] we're speaking with Andrew McCarthy of

A.

overall which is gonna flip bugs are going to be Democrat or Republican\nBoiling this either it's either going to flip Democrat or it's going to be right down the middle very tight sad a way to look at ... straight now go one way or the other governorship probably Kristi Noem again Republican in South Dakota although believe will make it and he was staying in the\nPolls are are really close are starting to get closer\nShould be interesting what do you think Steve yeah pretty much the same I Would think the Democrats win the house and uh\nI think Republicans are probably hold on to the Senate may narrow usual\nIt's going to be interesting the way you know I think what carried Trump over the uh the finish line is independence whether they come out to vote and how they vote it will be battle I think that's going to determine the flow of everything well it's always who shows up and makes a difference\nSo somebody like bon if he shows up while he showed up so does it make a difference when I show up no no not really\nMy man better they la creme de Darren by car I'm going to be very better on on the deer creamed\nYour car came out of nowhere and Yelp pieces of him if there's anything alive ... new highway forty six to this morning bond you're going to be my punching bag throughout the morning I\nI'm All right but then I've got a lot of practice said okay oh boy you know talking about that vote I thought it interesting though one\nSurvey yesterday where they were saying that you know when you look at the polls they say okay so and so as you know fifty two to forty eight fifty five to forty or whatever the case is but then they break it down by age and there are several of them where\nThe if you go by over forty five and under forty five there's huge discrepancies because you know there are a lot of the young people being energized and everything and they like maybe different people then the over forty five voters\nAnd so like there were people there were it was one poll they showed where the overall poll on every what state this was in but the overall thought it was like a fifty to two forty eight\nFairly close race and yet the under forty five was like sixty five to thirty five and the over forty five was like a fifty two forty in favor of the forty eight person you know\nAnd so I mean a lot will come down to who goes out and votes as well as when we this call and make a to make a poll and say who do you like there's no guarantee they're actually going to get out and do that in a\nClass especially in the mid term that his who's more motivated I guess we'll find out who your ... weeks yeah so we do our big stories this morning at six twenty two\nThousand migrant caravan marching to the north to the U.S border from Central America evidently growing

they're unable to stop the migrants from leaving plus dollars\nMiddle Eastern terrorists MS Thirteen\nThere's a lot of liberal Democrats all mixed in\nThere so you know we got to have to stop this at some point the other funny thing I thought from yesterday was the same network who reported\nYesterday\nThat they were Fifteen hundred miles away from the U.S border\nOr their latest report was they're eleven hundred so they covered\nFor a day I'll actually threatened I we're trying to break that down what day that they're going to because we are amongst each other we're making predictions yeah when they were going to show up at the border\nAll right but then we broke down the distance versus how many miles a day you'd think that they would probably cover you know and uh it should be about sixty five or Seventy days saying they're\nUh they're talking about well there are struggling and then we were kids vomiting and all that and I'm thinking and they still made four hundred miles and one day they're really moving moments you know him it's pretty good pace a little better than I mean you know some of the reporting is a little suspect\nAs the president also tweeted yesterday that this was a national emergency\nYeah he didn't quite get emerged a Turkey's president promises to deliver the naked truth about the death of Saudi journalist Jamal show he he's been doing that this\nMorning already released it yeah that was say fallout a murder plot\nMy big question is what were they listening to on their headphones while they had the ... out there are up and the guy that

areas are gonna get rained on some more you know\nUh you can drop that second em mega millions should be mega billions there'll be far more appropriate for tonight's drawing one point six billion dollars that that has been moved over the last few days I still think it's going to be higher tonight well he'll be a surge as\nA result of twenty five a roll over so far the mega millions no one has matched the five numbers since uh the end of July and the one the Seventy or the numbers now uh-huh\nAnd the mega mall one to twenty five\nMan so ... who's ... tickets here\nUh I don't know I'm not

in her like three hundred billion or something like that uh yeah three hundred million three hundred and two\nNow is that what it is I like being the shift that anyway I got to winning are fairly small but yet somebody has to win it so\nSometimes when if you don't play although the odds are almost the same as if\nYou are a little better knowing even at the barn yesterday they were had an envelope signing in\nTo that I say it's best if you have something written after if somebody does that so that does make off of the ...\nThe group that goes well our group didn't win with the five hundred chances we had but I did win with the one I had yeah live separately and that's what I mean get it in writing now I think\nIn this one if you have to be a real jerk they're not fear it I mean that's it's almost way too much it's like you're ... you know if you win\nThis though yeah you're yeah Danny Sanford\nCertainly much so a U.S representative Kristi Noem significantly out raising and outspending of democratic challenger Billy Sutton in the south Dakota governor's race\nThere the campaign finance reports that were feel ah filed yesterday Noam raised more than two point two million through October seventeenth sudden brought in about one point four million uh\nShe wishes astounding for governor's race in self doubt overall yeah a lot of money spent\nAbout two point seven million compared to something as one point six\nAnd you remember she rolled over a little over a million from our congressional campaign when she announced almost two years ago\nSo a Weber loses what do they get to do with money have a big party or what\nNot always goes into a campaign fund that you can then decide I mean like former Senator Tim Johnson still have a thousand dollars in his campaign account when he retired but\nWhere does it go that well you ... what did you need to do what you wish whether it's your money after that bad yet have they go to help pay for my car\nThey could they could buy a record it and I'm pretty sure the campaign people aren't gonna let very highly ... yeah [noise] for example after you're out of politics I don't know that it really matters\nIn a prominent

Lawrence Lawrence when Joe pleasure to be with you on a Tuesday evening if you remember the Obama\nEra you'll remember president who talked about containing ISIS or limiting ISIS or controlling where they could go and sort of geographically a boxing them in a Donald Trump campaigned as a president who would wipe out ISIS destroyed them\nUh and and take them out of power obviously not every person who identified with ISIS is gone to this point\nBut ISIS is I guess more gun than we ever thought it would be under a bronco bomb a rich noises is senior editor for news busters\nRich why use the media keeping Donald Trump's defeat of ISIS in Syria Iraq like it's a deep dark secret that they need not need not tell the public about\nWell it's one of the one of the blade spots of this presidency I mean you know if you if you look at the evening news you get in on religion only negative story\nAbout this president mostly about the things he's tweets the things he says a sort of a soap opera aspects of all of this if you look at the record you know the economy\nIs very good job growth\nIs very strong unemployment is at a record low and and foreign policy you have ISIS which was headquartered in Iraq and Syria taken over key cities virtually extinguished in those areas the economy a Porsche this we did a study earlier in the month\nI think that was less than one tenth of one percent of its coverage over the last four months and this we looked at it for the whole presidency [noise] thirty three minutes of coverage of the president's leadership\nIn the war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria over ten thousand minutes an evening news coverage at a point three three percent it is a positive story but the media are choosing to focus on other things where they can be negative\nThere anybody you can sort of called them out on those because Richard when I was a big Ford become a talk show host I was a reporter and you always look to the to best to the competition that is that the competition told a story you at least told the same story and tried to get them\nAlways look to the best the competition that is the competition told a story you at least told the same story and tried to get them one be further down the road in a story and it and you always tried to find the story that nobody else was telling you is there anybody in the fake stream media that's willing to break from the pack\nAnd say you guys aren't telling the story but it's a great story and and then contrast it back to some of the comments of bomb I still remember when he sat down for an interview with somebody from ABC News and he was explaining very carefully why it was so hard to hit ISIS where they lived in rock\nBecause it was tough to get to the target and you know as you explained all the difficulties and about three days later the French for goodness sake went in and bomb the daylights out of rockets then remember running the soundbite able bomber explaining how hard it was to get to them and say\nYou know when the French military God Bless them can out do the United states or what the United States president things is capable it really doesn't say good things about your about your capabilities does it\nRight that that's exactly right and I would say one of the it's got extremely little grudging coverage but one of the big differences is President Trump chose a policy early on where he decentralized the authority to their commanders in the field you decide what to bomb we're not going to strangle it up and washing the way it was during the Obama administration\nAnd that has helped the or the generals in the field get the success that they have that was\nYou know there was there's been a couple of stories at the very end of twenty Seventeen a listing this is one of the bright spots Hans Nichols did a story for NBC\nBut it it really has been\nPushed out of the headlines you know the war is I mean that the Trump part of it is about thirty three minutes the entire war against Iraq against ISIS in Iraq and Syria including what the Iraqis are doing what other allies are doing the whole state of it a hundred and fifty seven minutes the b._b._c. news coverage in almost two years this is a\nThis is a very very small percentage of the news coverage they're acting as this thing\nIs it a big story if you were talking about twenty fourteen twenty Fifteen this was seen as a major problem for the Obama administration\nNow that it's not a problem uh thanks to impart President Trump and his leadership and his administration they don't want to talk about it I think you know if if they're going to be unfair to the guy and badger him over things they\nShould at least be fair that sometimes and and cover the things that are going up pretty well the the record is better than people generally know that it is\nWell and I guess let me make this comparison\nWhen Katrina happen and it was seen as a as a big you know food bar for the Bush administration or in in the media seem to love to go back and do follow up stories and say well I remember when Katrina was handled so badly will here's how they're doing now\nI understand that most news is about things that do happen and then it's harder to cover the house that didn't burn down or the bad thing that didn't happen so they could say well now that ISIS has been doing as much we're not covering things they're not doing but to some extent what they're not doing is the story\nBut if you wanted to do a story you could go to those regions and said this was a region that used to be dominated by ISIS with all the bad effects that would have on the local populations and everything else\nAnd this is what's going on there now because the Trump Administration has pulled off what Brock Obama had declared to be impossible just a couple of years before and that story is completely doable\nAnd it's actually a very good story and the and the media does love to do sort of the good news stories you know you set up a new program to make this happen and look it's happening and you do the happy story that that whatever it was you intend to the program and then you have the alternative\nPrograms that were set up to do some good and they didn't do any good but they spend a lot of money and you do that story as well they can do any of those stories right now\nBut I think they're making editorial choices not to because they don't want to make Trump look good\n[noise] yeah I think you're right I think I mean CBS has done is put a little more resources into this and the other two than NBC or ABC and I believe they had their correspondence walking\nIn the city of Raqqa in Syria which was the headquarters of ISIS ah they can go there now and walk around and talk to the people who live there and his regime I mean that is a very compelling story we got a little a little sliver of it uh\nBut you know given the importance of was to to the United states do you think we'll be hearing a lot more about it not a lot less\nI Would think so too are there other good examples you run into where the mainstream media is avoiding telling the goods store I just heard today that we're looking to maybe finish out the fourth quarter of this you're economically at four percent GDP and yet I have yet to see a mainstream news organization New York times or Washington Post\nThe New York times it pays the salary of Paul Krugman\nWho had declared that anything passed a two percent growth trade simply was not possible and now we may finish out this year with the for the fourth quarter in the four percent range\nAnd I would think that any reporter worth his or her sold would say this was declared impossible a couple of years ago and now it's now it's happening but again that would require the old grey lady the New York times to actually say Trump is bold off the impossible which I think they're getting tired of writing these days\nThere's been incredibly little coverage of that as well let me looking at\nYou know the tax cuts in particular are given a\nLot of coverage and negative courage when they were being debated\nWell right if they took effect you saw those companies giving a big bonuses to people you saw you've seen companies with higher growth that led to or not dot today or are they are in the last couple of days but big gains on Wall street uh and has led to that economic boom so has\nThe deregulation campaign does have gotten just a a few minutes of coverage in this vast sea of of negative news this year uh it's what's what are the unsung success stories that I think needs to be told take\nRich lands thirty seconds what's gonna happen when this caravan reaches the border which I think they'll do before election day how are they going to ... how are they going to cast this one depending on what happens when those those are you know illegal aliens is what they are getting to the border\nThere already you know you've got I think every network now has people embedded in this caravan paint painting it is a extremely sympathetically what they won't answer the question of what gives them the right to come in\nWe you know you are getting closer to putting us in a position where we're going to have to cut you off\nBut when you talk about freezing bank account who's bank account would you like to freeze and what would be your legal or what's the legal reason because you know you got a bank account I've got a bank account the government can't come in and freeze your bank account without some legal authority and I know a lot of a suspect\nThat there is money that is flowing to this group\nThrough a bunch of cut outs that are probably so thorough I told one of my producers he said well how could that happen I said well let's say George Soros who a lot of a suspect so he's got the tides foundation a private nonprofit foundation\nDetails somebody at the ... foundation has already sent money to say some do good or groups in Honduras Guatemala El Salvador and Mexico and what what do they do with it day by soccer balls for kids and they buy meals for poor people whatever they do with it they've got money that's already in Mexico\nAnd so one of those groups his gets the word go and take some of the money out and help fund this caravan\nHow do you stop that most of it is likely happening not inside our borders and not even banks that we have anything to do it so it's easy to say shut them down freeze the account\nBut what mechanism do you use to tell a private nonprofit non governmental organization an NGO in Mexico that has money to help the poor\nThat they can't take money out of their bank account and go down and buy meals for some of\nThe seven thousand\nFill it out there isn't any other\nOn your head or foreign would reasonably say what the heck does our plant making wiring harnesses for Ford escapes have to do or whatever it is they're making down there what does that have to do this care about\nIt is\nNo no no no no because what you're talking about is your lashing out and saying well let's just hurt some American companies and say you could stop the how was Ford Motor company supposed to stop\nThe caravan so\nThat the country but there are a lose lose or\nYou're just going to you're going to point a financial gun at anybody's had who's within sight for ... to America and you're going to say make this happen or else well the Mexican government can say Ford Motor company can't tell us what to do\nThe Mexican authorities have the power to do something about this caravan they could simply say we're not going to allow this big group of people\nTo do this but I don't see\nHow you start then the lashing out at every American Company saying you're down there so therefore you're part of the problem\nBut we are all over the last three days four days so finally woke up and realize that we're serious the all shut down three or four or five days\nI found I think the president's threat to Mexico is serious and I think he'll probably and put up ... through Twitter or through a pub public announcements before then but when you just say start attacking American companies do back in business in Mexico\nIt'd be like telling companies that do business you know some other foreign company like Germany Germany does something we don't like it used\nTo watch all of us are shooting at the line I Know I\nKnow I'll tell you what the US government and the military is very good at guarding borders we guard borders as we pointed out last night in Afghanistan we've guarded borders in Iraq\nWe've been and I think that the United states military is very good at guarding borders they're very good at concertina wire and as far as I'm concerned put a bunch of that on the border and beef up customs and border protection the border patrol\nAnd say to them look nobody's coming across this line and to to some extent we're in a good spot now because if they try to come across in one big massive group\nThere'll be a lot easier to deal with what I Wonder is as they get close to the border\nAre they going to start to spread out I mean if there is one big giant caravan you can probably stop that from coming across the border\nBut if they split up then they started heading for fifty different spots on the U.S border the parts that don't have wall\nAnd don't have a lot of patrols it's kind of become very difficult to do that a lot of them are I'm not disagreeing that we need to do something I'm just suggesting that those things like attacking American companies that do business in Mexico who can reasonably say we have nothing to do with this let's go to Stan Stan welcome to Lars Larson show\nA large thanks for having me back\nSo I think both of you guys are wanting to have the leverage against Mexico and it kind of forced to hand here that I think we do don't we we do but I don't think the trade agreement is the thing I think there's something else we can do a ... that might be more effective I think we should post\nObviously like your guest your other guest said\nWell the the ... the army should already be deployed along the border as a warning but [noise] I think we should host warships off us on terrorists in Ecuador and have them pressure Mexico\nTo returning the law not a bad idea but again then you're going to have the world and I think is what the Democrats\nBig huge United States superpower\nMilitary is going to pose to worship half\nPoor countries a threat\nA huge nodded said superpower\nMilitary is going to postage warships\nPoor
