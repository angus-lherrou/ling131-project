do a lot of research and I I Try not to confine myself to just a narrow range yours is perhaps the most optimistic but not optimistic you know based on just ... to look at the world but optimism\nYou know I I follow your Twitter feed and I think it's absolutely amazing what you've been able to do so do you my audience a taste of what happens when you actually look at the real numbers not just about the United states but about the rest of the world and how things are are getting and have been getting a lot better for a long time and they're on an upward trend\n[noise] well thanks for the opportunity to talk to your uh took to audience ah basically\nI'm a ... it's much easier to put together a list of things where the world is getting was then a list of things where the world is getting better because the world is improving along many different die mentions a most importantly obviously people leave much longer than they used to\nUm get a life expectancy for hundreds of thousands of years really\nWell it's about twenty five to seven years now it's ah I'm Seventy nine years and a eight innovate countries it's Seventy\nTwo years in developing world [noise] um we have more food than ever before ah for most of human history people worried about getting enough calories to see the next day\n[noise] um today people worry about obesity\nUm at least or the uh ... uh it's almost a universal um girls go to school was previously a day where and allows to\n'em there's even more peace around the world and very few people that are really for the first time in recorded history there are no international conflict by which I mean conflicts between two silver and nations so that there are a lot of ways in which I'm In which the world is getting better unfortunately\nUh the media but also the human brain and we can talk about the structure of the human brain a late to a focus is on the negative for rather than the positive and so instead of long term trends people are looking at um\nYou know individual instances all square or something bad happens and they assume that that somehow represent states abroad trends ...\nMurray on I I have to plead guilty but I've worked in the news business for a long time and I I hated it but people would say why is that you always tell bad news and I said well\nUh we have I happen to live in a city with a few hundred thousand homes and I said we always do the story about the one home that caught fire last night instead of the two hundred and Ninety nine thousand homes that didn't catch fire and that can lead you to a little bit of a pessimistic attitude but\nI'll tell you the number that impressed me the most because we realize that well money isn't everything\nThe ability to be out of the extreme poverty which has been you know it's been the norm as you say for an awful lot of the world for a long time\nBut you took numbers from the world bank and pointed out the people who live in extreme poverty in Nineteen Ninety that was thirty six percent of the world more than a third of the world lived in extreme poverty and lived on less than two dollars US dollars per day and that's adjusted for local prices\nThat number between Nineteen Ninety and today twenty five years dropped from a third of the world to about one tenth of the world now we'd like to get it to zero zero but you said even though world population increase by two billion people the number of those who were extremely poor you know this is\nJust screw scratching a living out of the dirt was was reduced by one point two billion\nAnd I just wish more of those numbers were put in income to put it in context and the other developments where we do have to say there's a famine here or a drought there [noise]\nYeah I'm as max Rosa from ... pointed out\nUm we could have a ... or the number ... ... the newspaper's could run the following headline every day one hundred and Seventy seven thousand people have escaped from a salute poverty today and they could have running for the last five\nYears and he will be true um but to your point about the news cycle the but the problem is that good things tend to happen on a different time scales from bad things bad things tend to happen immediately and that's\nThe way the news is what is good things are incremental they improve slowly over long periods of time and uh consequently\nUm they don't like the ... the headlines are the headlines usually are if it bleeds it leads nonetheless we live in a world with the least amount of absolute ... ever\nAnd for the first time of the Brookings Institution show last week or two weeks ago a law that half of the world is middle class who would've thought\nHalf of the world out of what are we ready to seven billion or a billion already\n... seven and a half billion people in the world and bookings you can do it is to divide the world into four groups are the first group is people who live in absolute policy\nThat's below two dollars per person per day adjusted for a um local prices are then the second group was between two dolls and eleven dollars\nThat the third group which is\nWhat a middle class begins was uh from eleven to a hundred and ten dollars and finally the full scope lost over a hundred and ten\nDollars per person per day and a roughly three point six billion people a fall into the category between eleven dollars and I'm I'm a hundred and ... and a over a hundred and ten dollars so um yeah for the first time in in ... middle class\nI'm Talking to Mario on to be who is the editor of human progress dot org I highly recommend the side and their Twitter feed and I've got no other dog in the fight I just look I I was talking to a reporter today and she said that your wife tells me that you're an optimist I said I Am an optimist I think\nMost problems can be solved and things are getting better\nI'm I'm a big fan of ... who wrote this have you know this guy has all environmentalist but you don't just focus on the numbers and on on dollars and cents you also focus on just the general improvement of the human condition can you give my audience a an example or two of how things are getting better you mentioned education\nWell I'm a first of all let me just say quickly that I don't think that you and I are going to be optimistic this is not about convincing people to be optimists certainly on blind optimists it's about people\nBeing a real it's real is about having a realistic view of the world and the ... the world is one way or things are improving now when it comes to education a that's a that's a perfect example you know I'm a as late as the beginning of the of the of the twentieth century\nIt was very rare for people to receive more than a\nTwo or three years of education even in the most ah developed countries I'm now a education the primary education and suddenly so at least to seven or eight years of primary education is completely stand at the\nEnd of one of the reasons for why that happened last technological progress uh you said you liked technological progress I Do like building a little bark and one of the greatest inventions will so close to tractor\nA and a a mechanization of agriculture because for the first time in history I'm a farm owners didn't have to rely\nWell just to the farm work by were able to keep their children at work while the ... the head of the family of the former\nFeels a tractor in order to produce a to to to to produce his harvest and um and that was very important because as late as Nineteen hundred forty percent of Americans would employ another culture\nTwelve Thirteen Years we're supposed to practically double fuel efficiency and what that does is as you said earlier they have to a vastly increased costs in order to\nImplement technology things like hybrid vehicles which are vastly more expensive than traditional vehicles or they have to wait wait and they're doing both and the problem is is that um there's very little benefit for this at thousands of dollars up to six thousand to seven thousand dollars per\nPrice of an average vehicle by most estimates and the this is right now because there's not an energy shortage a gas can be a little bit\nLower right now that'd be nice but it's not because it's because the demand not because of supply the oil and a crisis of the seventies is over America's an energy giant now we have more reserves than ever said the rationales entirely gone the only rationale is to fulfill\nPretty much of a green agenda of leftist politicians have aircraft\nAnd pushing people out of cars so Gerard ... is this going to happen could we see the Trump Administration say let's freeze the standards now when if you frozen standards\nWouldn't affect me if prices stopped going up on cars more people buying new cars more fuel efficient cars already because we know that a ten year old car is not going to get as good gas mileage as the one that's brand spanking new or you're too old if we could\nStop that and just say let's just freeze the standards or has come as close to a freezes possible on all the new standards were pushing the car companies to get there\nIf we could reduce the cost of to the American family uh buying an automobile\nMore of them would buy brand new ones that means more of them would have new were cars a year or two or three or five years old and we can reduce that Thirteen your average age back to something lower than that we'd get cleaner air we get more fuel efficiency\nAnd we wouldn't have to batter the consumer with these gigantic price increases\nAbsolutely not just the consumer but our auto makers their competitiveness our jobs are you know our economy it hits it hits all the way down in the ridiculous idea is that as you said earlier because you've got to\nGet that average you're going to sell cars the smaller cars which are not as profitable but you want a skill away from the\nUm cars that are the bigger cars that are more comfortable and a half more features that people want they'll actually increase the price of those\nTo push people into our cars so it really skews the market at squares profitability of it you know screws up all of the various ways that the economy should be running with consumer choice and the auto makers making vehicles that people actually want to drive and we're living in a gray days right now or technology is doing amazing things with\nA you know crash warnings and laying changing and break assessed and all and all that stuff that's making cars safer but with these crazy CAFE standards they're going to keep people out of these cars and they're going to hold onto their car much longer um which is not only less feel efficient but it's also less safe\nWhile and it and that's a big difference because they say when you get to smaller cars for every hundred pounds you trim off the car he said well that's more efficient and say it's also five percent more likely to kill you in a crash\nAnd and frankly I Know that they knew they couldn't go out and say we're going to make it illegal for you to buy a pickup truck or an SUV unless you can prove your family needs that they couldn't get away with that well they could do is say that new pickup truck or if she is going to cost you fifty sixty Seventy thousand dollars\nAnd they knew consumers would say oh well isn't that expensive all by the small car\nGerard keep up the good work at a consumer action for a stronger economy and we appreciate your coming on the show tonight\nOh

Fifteen a a a ten right so it's kind of basis where they knew we can say we covered that story was on page eight ten right there\nIn front of God and everybody in and nobody actually saw it but it's a better or roared stories sounds like a very interesting one we've talked about it in passing on this program but\nHe lied about a DUI arrest\nAh when when he was younger and and the fact is he tried to run away from the scene and you'd think that kind of scandal with dogs somebody in until and unless he actually makes a clean breast of it and says yeah it happened I did the wrong thing he can he can resolve this one pretty ... pretty quickly couldn't they\nCould you say you know uh I made a mistake when he was younger ah is that he chose to lie about about the inside a and and he insisted that he did not tried to flee from the same ah went in fact the liver Washington Post\nWho is actually fairly beta or they actually is a bad check a said that they do or the game for ... you know he knows that said that you know that he clearly lied about slaying or the arrest or this is this this is lie of the interest didn't make any of the major three network\nEvening all morning shows or even Sunday roundtable shows what's even worse is that a a seat at the warning toast you know he got he interviewed better oak on October fifth or an never brought up the fact that he had a ...\nWhere do you think that it's ... some hot material let's talk about Senator Claire McCaskill has been and what she did with this government program\nOkay so there's a civil biased this actually there is a tax credit\nProgram that's intended to help a\nA building how does a housing for the poor uh and uh it wouldn't kill Saddam shepherd who is clearly Senator McCaskill has been dead is he\nA lot of all these tax credits that again or post the that help build cheap housing for the poor he flipped him other developers in or near like you know billions of dollars a by doing that so he basically took advantage of of a program that was intended to help the poor\nYou know local Democrats both go by that but the porch of a slip them personally and\n... and in that case all he was was an intermediary you know he he didn't actually do anything he just buys the tax credits up and then flip them to other developers he was a marketing guy and he pulled a profit off that\nExactly now it's crazy a finely Keith Ellison I still don't understand why the major media is a dog in this one except for the fact that Keith ... Keith Ellison the person of color and he's a Muslim two strikes against it kind of like a ... guys now the abortion doctor\nIf you've got a couple of those characteristics the media is happy to stay ... miles away from your story\nYou know and this is what's really upset about this is this is we're supposed to be ... and the whole hashtags me too movement right there since it's been just a little over a year so the ... and and but when it comes to that look like a you know\nShe kept each so Chet Keith Ellison\nA his ex girlfriend has all these just atrocious charges about physical abuse that he did to her a a ... denies the story but look at the allegation the accusation I think that he deserves a especially in you know I you know and and look up the beach in a little bit\nAmy pushing now

much\nThat is a pleasure to have you on let's go to your calls now Kevin's on the line Kevin welcome to the Lars Larson sure what's on your mind on this Tuesday night [noise]\nHey thanks for taking my call 'em show it I got three major differences or for Iraq\nFor Obama's or a ... approach versus a Donald Trump ... couple of laughs and Iraq Obama's or should be a crime um so you know their approach was quantitative easing his entire term which is in a sense\nPrinting money and giving it to the largest banks which the banks turned around and bought a a U.S treasury she got three percent interest on um you know a ... a Elizabeth Warren and a\nBernie Sanders a you know you know they've switched their tune now but if you uh do the research on that and even in her own book she Elizabeth Warren's thought that the whole time calling out to a ... a Timothy Geithner a ...\nA ... and burn hacking on that and uh [noise] uh um the other thing is just that\nUh uh they took a a twenty three billion dollars or more I I guess you could be eighty eight if you really follow the mouse on its diluted\nThe ah US a\nShareholder or or worldwide shareholders in a General Motors and stepped in line and in a paid off the campaign deaths and um ah they were sued by a a teachers' unions police unions a civil action suits\nAre against that and I'm I'm a [noise] a but nobody nobody uh squawks about that and um ah they they executed\nWorst climbs on the American taxpayer effort in and uh a liberal so tell them around and they'll talk about a Reaganomics or or even a tax cut\nA but is there ... there are jammed political or Reaganomics given to the rich and it trickles down her any bigger exam is there any bigger example of of a given money\nTo a printing money now borrowing and not moving from one place to the other but printing money and giving it to banks and hoping they laid it which they did not\nI don't think there is a good example of that and that's the thing that's all king is what the goal Keynesian economics economics says the idea being\nThat if you prime the pump up the economy by injecting a bunch of free money that that will make the pump start turning and then when you do that or start producing a a result\nLaw and in fact look I feel for people who are stuck in one of these countries where the government doesn't seem to address the prime ... problems of crime and violence but that's an issue that needs to be resolved by each country\nOr if your government is persecuting you because you're gay or because you're a different religion or whatever I understand that but even then\nIf the standard was uh the economy stinks and there are a lot of ... there's a lot of criminal activity\nHow many of the seven billion people on planet earth might be able to credibly say you know those things are lousy back home I'd like to go somewhere else I Would imagine it'd be a very large number\nAnd and that's the key point that set that of course that's missing from the higher and higher level we talk about the care of the ...\nSame considered ... and there were a lot yeah about five million people I'm sure all of the come to the United states and we let them all in a way could I mean it would completely over on the United states if we allow that to happen\nSo we put the laws in place that we have to it or something [noise] um so so you know ... and you mentioned the seven billion people around the world about thirty to fifty percent of them was also a a cover the United states that the best solution is to always tell people back in their home countries try to help their\nEconomy and try to help the government debt and all of a criminal activity that happens to be take place there and that's what President Trump seems to me right now he he is apparently told the president of a door hey workout all federal funding if you guys don't stop\nThis caravan heading up to the states or the bath and a fat\nChris ... is deputy director of numbers usa which does great work on immigration issues because by that standard I Would imagine that if\nThe current victims of criminal gangs you know of all of them could get together and the Caribbean it'd probably be\nTens or even hundreds of thousands of people and they left I'm sure the criminal gangs don't go out of business they just turn to the next set of victims until one until you into the country so so it's really not a ... it's not a solution and I think\nI'd even make the case crews can you tell me what you think of this argument that if you take some of the pressure off for country by having some of the people in the worst situation leave\nKnowing that there's still nine million people that those criminal gangs can pick on and steal from because that's what they do for a you know for a living to get them get their money\nThat in some ways you may actually put the solution farther away because the folks who are most ... most willing to pick up and pack up and leave\nAnd go somewhere else or they aren't going to get rid of the the folks who are actually doing the bad acts but they will they may take the pressure off the government to try to fix the reforms and and make the change is necessary to get rid of the problem altogether\n[noise] right right I mean there are certainly people that are that are using the mouse Paul and we'll probably use the caravan of we've seen it asked care of and there are some folks that will jump in and and and try to take advantage of of the fact that you know this caravan of coming up they're going to get some\nAre going to get protection they're going to have the benefit of food and water that's going to ...\nMake to make a track through through Mexico to the U.S Mexico border but\nBut but but the vast majority of them are as you said they're good people there are people that are willing to work you know they're willing to help out a ... a prosperous country at ... ... that that's happening out there\nAnd and a lot of it is is the responsibility of the government the government down and have done it stops by to spite\nThe amount of usa at that town where\nHe got these folks leaving the country it's not going to benefit the country in the long\nNo one Chris thanks so much\nFor having me\nChris ... from numbers usa\nTo your calls down Dan's on the line and California Dan what's on your mind tonight\n[noise]\nI got hit and

K. careful careful careful out there All right five ways that autumn can kill you\nJim over I wouldn't want you to pay very close attention\nOn we're only in the fall for about three weeks and do well in some cases you're lucky that you're even here to talk about it anymore or is there a ladder involved um no there is no letter I was thinking about cleaning out the other is the\nNumber five okay alright burning candles there's always an up and all related fires starting in October alright the bedroom the living room the bathroom at the top three danger zones\nAnd fifth of all fatalities involves someone falling asleep at a candle burning down here in any thinking yourself well wait a minute I've got one of those candles this kind of self contained right yeah but what happens is when the candle gets down so far the gets high on the glass and the ... the glass breaks\nBreaks and then the fire spreads and then you got a problem so here's the thing just be very very very careful with candles which why sometimes when you rent apartments they they have this new land those you know no candles\nOr you know you can get those ... candles to go ahead ... ... ... those are pretty cool to the LA candles\nI go ahead to have a pet or whatever it is we know candles that's too dangerous alright number four is kind of like number five fireplaces right\nThere are about twenty three thousand house fires every year and most of these house fires happen in the fall right now and a lot of the lawyer place are related to fire places and furnaces to to be honest with you know it's very important to check your furnace well you got to make sure\nThat you're ready I mean because you haven't had a fire for awhile rent and make sure your your flu is open I and I don't I've never been I've never had a house with a fireplace so I don't know all the terminology but you got to make sure it's ready to accommodate the fire\nCorrect I've got to fire places on my farm okay a one in the basement one in the upstairs and now you've got to be careful with those fireplaces get a check it out and make sure it's all safe and operational alright number three deer\nGoing all the time of the year to be black and deer over a million and a half Americans hit deer every year with the cars\nAlmost half of those happened in October November and December all rights will be very careful I'd be very very very careful when you're out there traveling and here's the thing to All right\nUm but if you if you happen to be traveling and you see a combine heading your way or it it's out there harvesting the corn you know traveling towards the highway I Would slow down and you are traveling on the highway hopefully you're on the highway\nThere's a good chance there's deer that are going to run out of that feeling All right when that combine heading your way okay All right because it's moving the deer especially if it's in his last couple of rounds alright I had it happen over there by Homer, Nebraska rats on time right whacked three of them\nIn one shot with oh my gosh all three of them running I was in the evening I saw the combine or get out of the field and I just knew that it was likely there will be dear I slow down and we still got 'em\nAll three of them uh fortunately got all three of 'em right in the very very front bumper of my truck so I didn't put me out of commission but ah there was a little clean up on the highway a number to wet leaves on the ground a lot of leaves on the ground here and Yankees in ... in the area because there are a lot of green\nHighway a number to wet leaves on the ground a lot of leaves on the ground here in the Yankees in ... in the area because there are a lot of green leaves around that got snowed on and that took the leaves off the trees just be careful and number one a dangerous thing about autumn the number one thing that can kill you son glare\nOh as it's out of a hat angle as the days get shorter the sun is more likely to be right in your eyes during the peak commute time\nSo what's the what's up with a wet leaves by the way the dangerous they slippery all grants or go ah All right so then sometimes they hide hazards on the road like potholes [laughter] okay\nSo you might have a pile leaves on the road and you think it's just a pile leaves on the road but it's actually a giant leap possible\nAnd so uh you know a autumn can be a better is a dangerous time of the year and we want to remind you to be safe out there a harvest season underway and die all over my Facebook page today I see guys are knocking out soybeans and corn depending on what they're doing you know that they didn't know what what what they're able to go in self\nUm port by refining Hudson want you to be safe this harvest season or they want to thank all the area farmer's for their partnership and helping Americans have more choices the choice between home grown fuel\nAnd imported oil\nAnd now with the move to a Fifteen year round you know what there's going to be more grain that's needed for local farmers to produce those biofuels and that's a good thing for us local farmers\nAll right so potent Hudson just wants to remind you that uh you know what give them a call about selling some of your brain up to South Dakota and Hudson South Dakota talked to Ross Alison or Margot and hate just be safe out there right now is is it take your time\nI Would say the two most dangerous things on the highway because I drove truck for many many years now uh actually I'm going to go three three most dangerous thing the one thing clearly clearly above all the most dangerous thing on the highway\nA a silence truck All right now you guys know what I'm Talking about there are the old school ... great you break it out for about two weeks out of every year you don't know whether the we got to pump the brakes about three or four times before they were ain't\nGot any lights on the back of it or we don't need to fix and we only use it once or twice a year\nA most dangerous thing on the highway believe me it's island struck those things are really dangerous thought the next most dangerous thing on the highway a horse trainer\nBecause horse trailer sometimes more commonly do not have lights that work on the blasted things All right so have you got a horse trainer and you're pulling up and down the highway\nCan spend the money fix the blasted lights on it before somebody ends up in a very dangerous dangerous situation ... just fix the lights it's part of the cost of owning things\nFix it All right have the things working ... hours trailers very very dangerous if you're traveling up and down the road so if you follow on folks never never never never never to pass it on the left at an intersection you know yeah or where there's an approach a than the other most dangerous thing on the road\nThe wagons that you're pulling detractors All right because they're going twenty five thirty mile an hour twenty mile an hour whatever it may be All right some tractors that travel as fast as thirty mile an hour now which makes them a lot safer than a twenty mile per hour tractors of the old days but\nIf you don't slow down fast enough you're you're come upon them sooner than just seems to me\nUp on them in a big big big hurry all the time sometimes you don't recognize how quickly are coming up on them because of the sides of them are just very very dangerous and believe me a you run into a five hundred bushel wagon\nDo you just ran into something that's really really happy that wins and very very substantial and so just and here's the thing they kinda they don't trail all that great sometimes they kinda ... kinda warm around don't they Jim we're just be very very careful passing one of those you get behind on or ... some farm equipment\nWe just want you to be careful of time you know way selfishly Gemini I just want the listeners All right we want you to be safe so

miss a day of marketing information whether she'll\nJoin us every day at five Seventy five bucks\nA head a little and Lars Larson show yes we're going to talk about folk ... for a little bit to Senator Elizabeth Warren the senator from the great state of Massachusetts who I think made a colossal mistake\nBecause she decided to have her DNA tested and then she saw the results and she saw that she was as little as one one thousand Native American which is actually lower than the average person who lives on the north American continent\nAnd then she and her staff I assume she consulted with her staff said let's give this to the Boston Globe and let them put it on the front page and that will convince everybody that I Am in fact the Native American I claimed so I could get that sweet job at Harvard\nA L brought a joins me now who's managing editor of the stream el welcome back to the program and do do you think that Elizabeth Warren made a big mistake and there's a big enough to take her out of the presidential sweepstakes\nCompared to Custer filters that huge mistake but uh it would have dated a deadly lowered or stock I mean I'm I'm putting money on two thousand two thousand twenty democratic race she just\nShe just got a ... she blew it in a way 'cause\nShe it's it's not so much it that's what she did it it's one thing to take the test I'm I'm Glad you took the test that's cool\nAnd I'm Glad she's proud that there is some of that blood in there but to do to try to use it as a slam dunk against Trump's was\nIt was stupid and she looked silly and when you look silly ones that get some of the cultural line you're in trouble like Cory Cory bookers Spartacus that you're in trouble you know you're you're already you're going to take down Trump's\nBut that kind of thing I mean come on I really did\nShe really really did some damage to herself with this and it was self inflicted to an end to she could've done released the details in a way to put you put a lady issue that she didn't do it to the person that's fun to do that as a smart enough to be president\nThe other thing is is out at some level I think she knows that she's not Native American and I think she's known since twenty twelve when it was question and she came up with inadequate a proof of it and I think this would have\nShe's not Native American and I think she's known those since twenty twelve when it was questioned then she came up with inadequate a proof of it and I think this would have been an opportunity I could even see uh if if she had a staff willing to stand up for themselves and say to the Boston I Know it's tough says Abbas boss you're wrong\nHere's what you should do you should go out and say this has been an issue since twenty twelve who was brought up in that election campaign and I'm now doing a test I found out that I'm only at most three percent Native American so you know what I was wrong\nAnd if she had done that and and used it as just so she's still would have been able to say to the public I'm a maybe as much as three percent Native American but I was wrong to claim that a Native American status I didn't do it for any bad reason I think she did do it for a bad reason to advance or sell financially and professionally but she could do that\nI think America would have said oh okay and then it would have disappeared as an issue\nHere you go and she had the ... and she has the perfect um hook as he's ancestry\nDot com does ancestry dot com commercial where some guy saying it's all my life we thought we were German we went to the you know October fest we dressed up and then we found that were Seventy percent Irish\nOr whatever it was I've seen a commercial out there that that deals with this she does a spoof that commercial throw it I mean that's the way out there a little bit but still the I'd\nFlown in idea well you're on the ... you're on the right track ... imagine if she'd said hey you know that in just a commercial that the guy who thought he was Irish and they've found is these are tallying instead well guess what I found out I'm In the same boat and I think people would have laughed they would have said well OK\nAnd we'll let bygones be bygones I've seen politicians do it\nBut so few of the I Want your view on his so few politicians seem capable\nOf saying you know what I was wrong about that but I Apologize and a no hard feelings right and and then by twenty twenty if anybody like me tried to bring this thing back up again they say she dealt with that she said she was wrong why don't you let that one go\n[noise] yeah I heard you're exactly right hurt her tax would have been to like under play it on to play what ... ... play the relationship and they said a ... minute she made the mid ... admits she made a mistake people live on it because and again like you said if he made a little bit of light of it and [noise]\nShe she wouldn't look foolish there wouldn't be the names out there and said that there are gonna be just as devastating as Dukakis on that tank you know\nOh my God how boy when you say that the picture comes back to mind but the other thing or two years later Thirty years he still knows he looks like a fuel for and Everytime I go to an email from Howard Dean and I'm Still getting ... emails not personally but you know the solicitations I think about that scream\nOr whatever it was he said that night that in one moment one big scream ended his entire and he was the hot prospects but here's the other thing that bugs me about it now you tell me what you think\nWe hire presidents and senators and governors to make great decisions\nAnd we expect them to to be done in a way that serves all of us and sometimes they involve the life and death sending people to war spending huge amounts of money sinking the country into debt or getting us out\nSo when we hire people to make really great decisions and then we see someone like Elizabeth Warren make a colossal eat bad this is she's had six years to think about it she gets the new data in and rather than saying you know I probably have to admit I was just wrong and that this is my excuse to do it\nShe makes a colossally bad mistake and then says by the way would you like me making mistakes from the most powerful office in the world\nWhat you're saying is that you're talking I'm remembering what ... I guess as chief of staff Kelly said about a couple of weeks ago how he he was arrogant cynical she took that as well be strong to the president blah blah blah you know that's a general generals used to feel\nTough people you know it's a color arrogant and say that that's the key to this this thing it's the arrogance of thinking well that that the media behind me I'm going to do this I'm going to jump on Trump that's I think some of the key to key why she thought this would be a good idea and and doing it again it the way she did [noise]\nThere's all there's also I think comedy is in her ... you can't give yourself a nickname so if if Cory Booker wanted to beat Spartacus he needed to arrange for somebody else to call him Spartacus when you call yourself Spartacus doesn't quite work as well\nYeah yeah and that's and that's\nThe thing and they're all all these people are trying to solve these Democrats who are thinking about two dozen twenty are all trying to nudge their way to the front of the pack in her case I think he's trying to be the foil to Trump see I got him I got well you don't spike the ball when you're up you're losing sixty four to nothing\nYou know one sixty fourth Indian and it's like being down sixty four to nothing spiking the ball you look stupid [laughter] you know but you but that study that twenty twenty you're so focused on that you're not taking care of business and doing what you need to do to win\nSo tell me this goes back to the presidency now\nDo you think this takes her out of it or does she find a way to stay in it because I mean ... that'd be God's Gift to talk radio I'll admit but not not great for the country or to clear the path for for Joe Biden would say\nIt it makes it easy for the people who are running against or but again with the uh news\nCycle that so fast I mean Kanye West of the White House party seemed like years ago and there you go you know so\nIt made you know again but it weakens her and again she's gonna have to be fighting some people who who who want who really want the job too and they're not going to play nice so\nShe can maybe maybe you can but again once you're once you're in that once you're in that place where you're seeing is not serious\nWhich is what one thing she had going for is that she was seen as a serious thinker and now you look silly you've taken away you know some of your ... some of the thing that made you feel is a bit of war and [noise] and that's hard to hard to recover from\nYou know I got a rap during the second but I had one other thought you know who I feel sorry for them this is Democrats who are also Native Americans real Native Americans because\nIt puts them in an incredibly awkward spot do I stay loyal to my ... my a party that because I Believe in the Democratic party I Know there are people who do and do I then support Elizabeth Warren or do I turn around and say I don't care she's not a real Native American she's not one of us as the Cherokee Nation said\nScreener because you were talking about today but one in our own in terms of Elizabeth Laurie I'm just that [noise]\nJust write continues to call her Pocahontas that continue to\nMake a very big deal about it I guess I in my mind keeps going at first there um oh\nThe birther thing well yeah but we still haven't said what the\nTargets for years on the ... ... yeah oh for us but that was an awful\nChoice and why do you know that some of us still have serious questions about President Obama's um background we still don't know much about what he took her how he got into his undergrad\nHis graduate school or into Harvard there are many people who went to Harvard the same time he did including friends of mine when Elon routes one of them\nWho says I was there on campus I never saw the guy so and we don't know anything about and we knew when Gore ran against Bush\nOr for the presidency we knew what Gore's grades were and we knew what he took we knew what Bush's grades where we knew Bush got a better grade in science and Al Gore did\nWe didn't we don't know anything about him he was the editor of the Harvard law review but he never wrote an article for the Harvard law review so there are lots of questions about President Obama's background but you're right that's passed you know who brought this backup this week Elizabeth Warren did she decided\nThat second plane ahead go ahead go ahead and take the show and this is a great well it was dinner and Sebastian Gorka and ... and they were\nThey were talking about the compassionate that Donald Trump which I don't see it all day and then they were talking also about um what they have stayed in the fact that I see that and I said my doctor for it on at home and\nThey were saying that that\nDonald Trump can credit clarified down enough money in it that he did it and that that\nHappened I wouldn't have made it if it had not been for you know whether you were saying at the rally about publicity and our president actually two middle aged woman who said that the one thing she remembered what no laughing\nAnd if she didn't tractor and Sebastian and laugh at\nThat rally on the what the doctor\nSaid that he could get have enough ... and I say I don't see that that ... and he\nJoins me or you can join take a break and just let me ask you a couple of questions do you agree that the accusation that Dr Ford made was very thinly evidence she couldn't remember most of the details that would be\nThe details necessary to prove something happened and when she named witnesses none of the witnesses including her best friend could remember that it ever even happened in ... for best friends so she never even met Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd yet the doctor for a professor Ford or said that her best friend was there when this awful thing was supposed to happen [noise] the reason there is so much anger at a Christine Blasey Ford ... Ford\nIs that she made a career and frankly person destroying accusation and did it was nothing that she did it was nothing to back it up\nRight but I\nDon't hold hold on joy joy I've got to push back about her life was destroyed can I tell you what's already happened and what is likely to happen Dr ... professor Ford has received over a million dollars from or go fund me accounts she will get a book offering if she wants to take it she'll make more money\nFor having somebody goes to write a book for her she will be invited to speak before groups and be paid large sums of money five figures sums of money to speak justice Anita Hill has for the last twenty five years\nBut she wants to know if that's what she wants but all I'm saying is all of that is available would you say her life is short she got to tell her story she very nearly took down the Supreme Court justice she now has over a million bucks book offers and speaking offers if she wants them to life destroyed\n[noise] well I Know people who work with her I work at Stanford for years um in fact one of my friends at Stanford with added a candlelight it\nOr I'm going up on a ... to get to your point\nAnd and the Republican women was cleaning while things at my friends that she and I\nRemember I thought boy laughing at me like I remember\nDown and I\nA teenage boys and then maybe at that point you don't come out with a bad accusation with no\nTried to destroy some\nAnd then maybe at that point you don't come out with a bad accusation with no\nTried to destroy somebody\nI appreciate the call joy you're listening Lars Larson show\n[noise]\n\nHeading into the final chapter of the great American read on PBS Mimi as the anti to pick your number one book from a list of American hundred new novel on Tuesday October twenty thirty eight seven the central married into the air and then very special gas count down that path novel based on your boat and then it's the\nBig reveal America's favorite thought\nDon't meet the grand finale of the great American read that company twenty thirty eight seven ... only on your PBS station must think about ... percent it\nBy liberty mutual insurance\nLiberty mutual customize your auto insurance but you only pay for what you need so\nThings in life comes to mind why isn't a burger cheaper when you ask for no one\nShouldn't you to duck the price of the onion\nOtherwise I'm paying for the onion [laughter] but I'm not receiving any\nSort of liberty mutual dot com for cuts in my book and you can save\nSave it is I mean the coverage\nHas underwritten by liberty mutual insurance company in equal housing ...\nNow but I Know this month or two pack of night vision head lamps as a kind of dollars off because with ball comes longer nice then\nVisibility luckily our head lamps up superior elimination which helps reduce the chance of an accident see better Dr Saper for the ten dollars off to pack up all night vision had labs all the parts for people that know\nOffending photo store\nWhen the need for senior care right there's no planes back home in London one should never have to give up living at home\nSitting aims to provide home care for your mom or dad at home a twenty four hours per day including personal care meal and like how you get professional caregivers visiting him do look up and getting into dot com or ... eighty seven seven three seven ...\nSeven seven three seven four men franchises or an animal visiting angel America's Choice and senior home care\nFive Seventy W.
