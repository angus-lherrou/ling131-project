one of the most bruising political fights that we have ever seen in American history\nSo now I think it's going to be a great time to talk to Greg Miller who is the Pulitzer Prize winning national security correspondent for the Washington Post and the author most recently of The Apprentice Trump Russia and\nThe ... version of American democracy Mr Miller thanks very much for taking the time tonight\nAbsolutely thank you so at this point I Know the ... investigation is still going on but should Americans believe that there really is some they're they're in this or or is this just a political tool that's been used by one party or another to try to gain political advantage\nBut if you are asking whether there's any they're there to the lower investigation and we've seen we've seen indictment after indictment and I think it's clear that detail and many of these indictments to show that they Russia interfered\nIt was absolutely real despite what President Trump has has tried to say uh and I think we are um you know place to learn a great deal more about what Mueller has regarding Trump's than is financial organizations connections to Russia in the coming months\nBut are we going to find I only saw the essential question was and whether or not foreign governments try to mess with our elections I think most of us know that happens and I think they know that America messes in other countries elections just as\nThe Obama administration actually spent public money trying to change the outcome of the election in Israel but the central question was\nUse use there a connection that shows the Donald Trump colluded with the Russians nuts that seems to be the liberals favorite word a polluted with ah or conspired with the Russians to try to out to change the outcome of the election in his favor\n[noise] think it depends on how\nYou view this sandwich side ultimately I think though that this is still viewed very partisan lens in many ways right [noise] so do we know of a\nDefendant is smoking gun memo that threat or ... and Donald Trump both signed the grain to cooperate to get Donald Trump in the office in exchange for explicit favors [noise]\nNo but there was lots and lots of open a signaling between Trump and Clinton and Russia throughout the campaign there were efforts to hide from the American people negotiations that the Trump Administration was making before it took office I'm thinking if Michael Flynn telling the Russians sit tight\nWill take care of these sanctions for you [noise] uh and of course there is evidence that the Trump and ah um air circle was really receptive to assistance from Russia if not directly seeking at Trump Tower meeting is pretty compelling evidence for that\nBut the general Flynn conversations that not the kind of conversation you might've expected from an incoming\nPerson in his position to some foreign governments where you say ... I don't don't react yet we've got a new administration coming in\nThat you would have seen that whether there was cooperation between the Trump team and the Russians for the election you might have seen that just because well for the same reason that President Obama said on an on a hot Mike\nUh tell tell ... I'll have more flexibility after the election well they did have more flexibility Disney\nIt's interesting that if it were just sort of run of the mill ordinary signaling between a pending administration and a foreign government you know why would blighted Flynn go to such lengths to lie about it and he lied to the president had lied to Sean Spicer lied to the FBI have you figure that one of the\nBoard that is one of the puzzles of this if it's all above board why is there such effort across the Trump Administration to service suppressed aids fact tonight effects it's similarly to Trump's initial explanation of the Trump Tower meeting obviously has undergone so many revisions if there is nothing to hide why are they doing so much hiding\nI think that's a legitimate question but I I I I've been ... please confused and there's an obvious like Greg as the author of The Apprentice soon as a man who covers national security you're much more ... than in this than I Am I still don't understand why one Flint agreed to talk to the FBI and then when it became clear that they were asking\nAbout Congress agencies ad that you would think would be intercepted I mean as\nAs an essay wouldn't he have known that everything he said on the phone line to the Russian ambassadors people or to the Russian ambassador himself was going to be on a transcript somewhere and the the FBI was trying to say we want to see if you will tell us what we already know and what we already have\nSo it makes you wonder whether the FBI had deliberately set out to say we know every word he says let's see if we can get them to tell a different version then we've got 'em in a process crime\nThere's a lot of detail in the book that has not surfaced publicly because I've ... I was involved in breaking the faith ... story for the Washington Post and gone over that sweet to sequence of events in detail with dozens of additional interviews for the book\nIt's not only that Mike Flynn should have known having been director of the defense intelligence agency what\nSort of surveillance exists of a foreign adversaries here in the United states but in fact they were people inside the Trump transition torso alarmed about the Trump inner circle sort of teams\nInteractions with Russia signals about Russia that they tried to stage an intervention with planned after a meeting in which he talked about\nNeeding to have a conversation with the Russian ambassador there were people who are trying to get the CIA profile of the Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak in Mike Flynn's hands and telling and you've got to be careful what you're doing here and he ignored all of it\nListen graves level of determination terms of their actions here that's just astonishing\nI'm Talking to Greg Miller who's the author most recently The Apprentice let me ask you a question that has formed makes me and I I Do see it through a partisan lens but I I'm willing to say that of Republicans have broken the law you have ... or Republicans have done things that are not good for America than than they should be you know they should be appropriately punished for it\nBut here's the Russia collusion that I don't understand why it has become more of the public discussion and I have to think it's because of the mainstream media\nWe know that there are Russian officials who told Christopher Steele a whole big pack of stories most of which turns out seemed to be untrue unpredictable and almost ridiculous or in the Steele dossier he he is he puts together a document with information from Russian government officials\nFor Hillary Clinton and the DNC therapy has and paid for by them which is then used in what could only be a an attempt to change the outcome of the election one of their purpose would there be of trying to push this documented so many news people and it's so many officials if not to change the outcome of the election when that didn't happen\nThey used it to try to take apart the Trump presidency once the election was over\nWhy isn't that seen as a collusion between the other side with Russian government officials through paid intermediaries to create a different outcome for the election\nSo I think if you look at the you know what steel was hired to do and how\nHe was hired and how he was not told who the client was and how initially fusion GPS has hired in fact by Republican or a new collaborative to look at Trump and to sort of look into his background and then they turn and get funding from the Democrats only after\nAfter Trump is one of the primary and they think that they're on to such fascinating material they think somebody ought to be willing to pay for it and of course they do find\nThat the DNC is willing to pay for it [noise] um but still you know is a by all accounts a pretty straight up\nA former British Intelligence official a nobody accuses him I don't think of things sort of a political hitman hair and it's we don't know a whole lot yet about the sources of his material for the steel ... but I guess I Would argue\nThat you know although some of it is I'm proven it certainly seems plausible that Trump would be interacting it would be conducting themselves in in a Moscow and all the way he conducted himself in Lake Tahoe with Stormy Daniels I'm not sure why that would be so is\nThe ... that were to be true\nIf it were true do you think you know field a Shia is largely true are largely not\nI don't really have a firm opinion on it I think that the broad strokes it's it's actually held up pretty well I think you're right though that the ... like what I'm saying there is like from the very first mellow he was warning Russia is mounting an interference campaign and the night in a twenty sixteen election they're trying to help\nIt takes you were people to vote in a congressional representative because\nOf the large number of people who are just qualified from voting so that's something that hasn't really occurred to a lot of people as well and some of the lawsuits that are beginning to either be formulated or in the case of Alabama they are now suing because\nAlabama expects to lose it the after the two thousand twenty sentences and so it it\nTastes and and congressional areas are beginning to understand what kind of power and leverage this gifts to those areas that become magnets for immigrants who are here unlawfully and those numbers that they're padded\nUm give them an easier way to relative to other districts\nTo be able to pass some of the policies or elected congressional members\nPractically mean to be representation of some people in this country is being diluted by the president's will be illegal\nPulled out the entire debate our system is based on one person one vote and to the commentary as being written in these lawsuits are are now being created it's a matter of challenging that's the question of\nReally is it one person one vote when some districts have an easier way of passing things or electing representative because there are so many to qualify boaters and they're just ...\nHad a constitutional question singer constitutional eternity\nUm are people who are here in the country illegally are they in title to representation in Congress would say we're in the state legislature or even though they're here in the country illegally has there been a definitive answer to them\nYou know [noise] uh and people will say yes our has so what they're doing is looking at a law suits\nThat went to the Supreme Court where the Supreme Court looked at the issue of district day so that's a matter of how the lines are drawn and they said that the people count as far as\nThe drawing the line but the question has never been answered when it comes to apportion that and that means how we figure out or the four hundred and thirty five congressional districts and that's a fixed number so it's very much as there are some games\nAnd so when it comes to those districts and how many people count in those districts and whether they are citizens\nAnd eligible to vote that question is never been answered and it does all go back to kind of an arcane issue because the fact that\nWhen our country was founded it was a matter of the state looking at people who are eligible to vote in just different states we all have different policies back then as to what was\nWhat a ... created eligibility and and the wording habits end which carries with it a legal status was used to qualify that people who were here and eligible to vote\nSo now it's a matter of looking back at that language an original intents and and understanding\nThat person and in Tibet and when it came to the way that our founding fathers originally looked at this um inhabitant meant somebody who was here lawfully and who was qualified to\nHelp move will do that we now have another originalist thank God on the U.S Supreme Court to sing come this record\nVery well may help when it comes to exactly the kind of an issue which is what we are interpreting our constitution and the way\nThat it was meant to be interpreted in the spirit of the time and what the founders intended and that yet then we are looking for people that would be faithful to that original and to\nRome looking forward to that would have standing to bring peace in this I've only got about twenty seconds but how could somebody go ahead\nAlabama they're losing a safe and so there is a harm the demonstrable so states like Alabama where they're looking at the shift that has been happening and certainly a California picks up for other states do those seats come from somewhere\nIt said again so looked at what their accounts are ready hat on state would have ... or

China's dream is the new threat to the world order\nEven it sounds like you and I are both on the same side on here on this issue but how big is the threat that our country faces from China\n[noise] well the threat from China and plenty Eighteen is like the threat from the Soviet Union in Nineteen sixty or Nineteen Seventy at the height of the Cold War when we were afraid that the Soviet Union had more troops more missiles\nAnd a faster growing economy than we did fly it turned out that they did have more troops and more missiles but the economy was uh was largely exaggerated and when President Reagan\nTook power I was elected president or a man that I think the greatest president of the twentieth century um they have turned up the heat on the Soviet Union and it gradually collapse\nAh and I think we have a president now is turning up the heat on China and China is facing the same kind of a systemic collapse if\nWe can keep the pressure on if we can keep the Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi is from a grabbing the levers of power and the Trump be Trump I think we'll win this thing\nI like to remind people ski but then you back me up or or correct me if I'm wrong that while we have a large national dad\nThe national debt in terms of gross domestic product that China has makes ours look small by comparison and China at some point he was going to have to come to grips with the fact that they owe an awful lot of money that they have a a a huge amount of debt and and they're very dependent on the rest of the world because\nThat's where the goods are made in China are sold for the most part not to their own domestic populations\n[noise] yeah you couldn't be more correct because the only sector of the Chinese economy that actually runs a profit is the export sector and the export sector runs a profit because they have largely until recently\nHave had unfettered access to the largest consumer market in the world which is the United states the rest of the socialist planned economy of China is is a nightmare of wasted money wasted resources\nUm bridges to know where roads that no one uses and and so forth buildings that stand empty so if we can cut off\nTheir easy access to the American consumer market or their economy made a limp along for a while but you're right they've got debt or we don't know exactly how much that they have actually it's at least three hundred percent\nThree times the annual gross domestic product so they spent every any set they made for the next three years they might be able to pay off the debt they might not so they've got a huge huge debt to carry around and and that's one of their weaknesses\nWhereas in the United states by comparison we have a a gross domestic product or a ... trillion dollars and the national debt around twenty trillion ours is a hundred percent of GDP or GDP bears is three times the size proportionate\nBut [noise] yeah and our economy is now I think growing faster than China's now you wouldn't you wouldn't think that from looking at the official figures but look the official figures in China are nonsense every year or see gene thing the new red emperor comes out with a plan saying\nWe're going to get six point one percent economic growth this year and every ... every city in China reports six point one percent except a few very ambitious party officials report six point two or six point three or six forty four percent but the real growth is probably down at two or three percent\nFor growing out over four percent so the gap between the U.S and China is not narrowing is actually widening because we've turned on the great engine of American Capitalism and it's running at full speed\nI'm Talking to Stephen ... who's the author of bully of Asia wide trying his dream is the threat new threat to the world order\nAt some point do when the numbers they give out publicly and and it kind of reminds me is I think it did you know the old Soviet Union where they would announce that we're going to harvest fifty million bushels of wheat or whatever the number was and they would only harvest forty and for domestic consumption they just go back and change the numbers\nAnd say well we were planning to harvest thirty eight and we came in and forty you can run those kind of games\nOn your domestic population as long as you control information that comes into them but it's still possible to do that and have people actually believe what the government is telling them in an Internet age\n[noise] well you know the the Chinese have built all over the centuries\nThey now have built a a great firewall ... in an effort to keep information and news from the outside world\nFrom percolating into China and I think it's it's it's partly successful things get posted on the Internet are critical of the government they get taken down literally Lars within seconds within seconds and so you know they they've got banks and banks of computer terminals\nAnd and many in sitting in front of them making sure that\nThat know criticism of the party of the military of the government and above all of of the new red emperor seizing thing gets posted on the Internet now we try to do an end run around that back in the early nineties I was on the presidential commission that set up Radio Free Asia which is our radio broadcast service\nThat broadcast news and information about what's really happening in China\nBack into China to do an end run around the straight controlled media and I think that's been fairly fairly successful over the years\nAh yeah the information the information to lease and they don't have a an absolute monopoly on news the way they did and the Soviet Union back in the thirties when all my goodness style and killed\nFour million people in Ukraine and ended up having a a a ... a manipulated a deliberate famine to kill off the rich cousins and no one on the outside world knew about it the walls are drawn to the New York times saying that everyone is well fed and the Soviet Union there's no starvation millions of people were starving to death at that time so\nHow how long can they maintain this this pretends that they have all the success when all of the people generating the fake numbers are in on the secret and it's no longer a secret in other words if you're saying everybody should report six percent growth\nAnd ... you must have multiple people in each of those provinces saying make the numbers look the way the president wants them to look what everybody involved in creating those numbers knows they're ...\n[noise] yeah well they do it and and uh the the the the ... not the current one but the previous one\nAdmitted this a Premier Wen job about ten years ago he said I really don't pay any attention to the numbers\nBecause they were all fabricated he said I really look at the ah the number of containers are being shipped from Shanghai to the United states I really look at uh the electrical power that we're using I really look at the rail traffic he said that gives me a sense of how the economy is really doing the numbers he said don't matter so\nI thought that was a rare moment of ... on the part of Chinese officials\nAre I'd just even in the last minute what's the best way for the United states to react to this\nGo on the bully of Asia [noise]\nTo do exactly what President Trump is doing is he's just dealmaker he's going from\nFrom issue to issue getting the best deal he can and and getting as many concessions as again and then moving out of the uh the Chinese state from a strategic they're terrified of and he's pressuring China economically but also militarily an ideologically as well and and I think his goal and it should be\nTo to prevent China for placing the United states is the dominant power in the world or the world under the U.S as a safer or a more democratic place than it would be under China I think everybody would agree with that\nSteven it's always a pleasure thanks so much and congratulations on the success of bully of Asia why China's dream as the new threat to the world order we appreciate your time denied secularists you about Steven measure whether this now coming up in a moment\nDoesn't make up their mind and they noticed that they are right there and they they go in and vote early and some of the things they are discovering are quite an using which one is that millennials are are dropping off dramatically they don't\nParticipate so much in early voting because they're too many steps you have to often applied to get an application to get the ballot you have to fill it out you have to sometimes you know things like their Social Security number or have you put down your\nYour proper dress and then you have to find a stamp and an envelope at a box and these are steps that millennials just really can't do\nNo do you believe that and I'm Wondering what the result has been with millennials in states like especially Oregon I mean I happen to my broadcast studios there but one of the disturbing things I've seen is that they have automatic registration sewer often are you hearing from parents who say my sixteen year old daughter is registered to vote\nAnd I said yeah she can't go till she's Eighteen but they do it automatically when you get a driver's license\nWhen you make that easy where the ... government id or whether it's a driver's license or an ID card you're registered you get a ballot then once you turn Eighteen it comes in the mail whether you ask for it or not\nAnd all you have to do is pick it up open it up more could put it back in the envelope and send it back when they make that easy do millennials still drop off or do they vote in greater numbers\nThat I I'm not sure they have the data yet on things like that we really are in the beginning stages of a new experiment and uh but I think I was I don't know if you realize this but I was a county chair at one point and I and\nVery ... uh well versed on how you register voters and how you get people on the ballot and things like that but uh I think when you drop a a ID and I'm\nA registered in a in a location where you are permanent resident you get voter fraud you I mean you're going to have valid\nNailed the people who don't live there who at one point lived there and so there is no way to verify who that person is so it was right they break where you have voter id you go in on election day and they see your driver's license and they see your uh and they match it up on a\nSome kind of bolder role and that does the U.S [noise] uh provide us security level to ensure that the people who say\nThey say are voting or actually Bodie and uh I I Do think as we I\nAfter this election and we're still trying to figure out some of the cyber security issues to secure our voting system I Do think we are going to go again\nBack at this issue of us who is voting and a while we secure\nI saw the judge today the LA Times broke a story saying that the DMV in a department of motor vehicles in California 'cause it ... there were twenty three thousand registration mistakes including a Canadian citizen who got notified he's lived in California but he was notified he was newly registered to vote\nHe does have a California driver's license\nBut he's not a citizen of the United states citizen to Canada according to the LA Times they said I Know I'm not going to vote I'm not allowed to vote but that won't necessarily apply to everyone if you've been living in California for Thirty years in Europe for national and somebody sends you a notice ... says you can vote\nI imagine some people will simply took the opportunity even though I'm doing good is committing a crime they've apparently had tens of thousands of these kinds of mistakes just in the state of California where they do have automatic registration and where they are giving drivers' licenses to both legal and illegal aliens\nAnd so I Can't give you another example um in twenty Thirteen when a Mayor Mike Bloomberg was a complete in his third term he had two hundred people in the department and investigations go out in the uh twenty Thirteen there's race and vote as dead people and sixty\nIt's personal stuff and uh and so if he needed that is what happens he ... he said so people can walk in and there could carry hair sticking your church is what is on a what\nDoes the list and so without voter I eat that people know that you know people will argue whether there is a photo of thought and uh he he has a way to prove that there is that people could vote\nUnbelievable Adele it is a pleasure to have you on the program I really appreciate you taking the time stay on the story of a feeling that this election is going to produce some interesting results and it may not be all that comforting to those of us who consider voting a rite of citizens and when we find out that people who are non citizens are able to vote thank you\nSo much for having

[noise] well I agree with David the Democratic officials\nAnd consultants don't want to talk about impeachment but their Base Camp help itself\nSends a message that is going to get through a lot of the grassroots is\nWe have to impeach Trump and not just trumpet Kavanaugh and that's what this election is about so the the the overall thirty thousand foot message is responsible and prudent as David says but the message a lot of activists who sending an individual districts are\nUh we're going to get them and we're going to impeach them and that's one of our signal issue\nDavid I saw a news item and saying that some group and the Democratic party was not going to spend money or ... pulling money back from that that the Democratic race in in Tennessee did you see that was that stops endeavor just a quick reaction of wow\nLook I mean it's a major democratic group a part of me I got the one Democrat who feel that they might have done that it just throw bread is solid or because you know you could give them something to crow about I mean he ... you don't need any money so they are going to pick bread it then to to disown\nThem you know that's fine as far as Democrats are concerned but but it's true that the base has John Fund\nAnd so based on the left was all ginned up about this I don't know how much Senate Democrats wanted this is that\nJust like the Obamacare shut down in twenty Thirteen that the Republican base demanded or at least a portion of it than a credit sort of had to take this all the way and this is what happens when you don't have a leader of the party and the ...

single a office he's ever been in and nobody said\nOtherwise what they said was um\nWe Republicans would rather put our own person on the court and the best way to do this is to turn Justice Scalia's seat into\nA an issue in the campaign so that the public would get to decide you want Donald Trump to fill the seat or do you want Hillary Clinton to fill the seat but nobody drag Merrick Garland

spent a little time with her family and and UN ambassador is a tough job do you think do you think that's close to the mark [noise]\nI I think that's almost certainly a big factor whether that's the entirety of it I don't know but it was a letter is\nThere is something else that we're worlds and that is that I Believe she was governor of the state of South Carolina for six years before that said that his dad at at a time of being away and the stresses and so on so I I think that\nThese are factors for anybody um and whether that's the entirety of it I just don't know but we don't have any other public explanation at least at this point\nI Know that there were people who are raising questions about the way the president did it because he said I'm I'm holding an event it will be at the White House I have some big news to announce about my great friend Nikki Haley\nI thought it was a classy way to give us send off to a really valuable former employees which may be every Abbas in America should take a lesson from that uh and and I would imagine that I Hope the president can get somebody almost as good as her to replace her\nBut that may be tough these days with the uh the the

may not have an easy time in the Senate I don't know but um you know one of the things that many of us are the buyer hugely about uh the Kaylee of course has been a the\nAbsolutely forthright than tenacious and courageous championing of American interests in\nThe United nations specifically in the middle east and most especially with respect to Israel\nAnd unfortunately in my experience being a it'd be oh is not the Nikki Haley on any of those things and those are of course the president's policies so you'd expect her to ship them but [noise] um she has been ... and\nAgain my experience I'm very much susceptible to the uh the blender Smith shall we say of the Muslim Brotherhood and the United states she hails from Egypt originally and I think this will be a terrible mistake so I Hope that stop with the president's gonna wind up but uh they're right Lars or anybody\nIs going to face a the gauntlet unless there's going to come up presumably after uh the ... the election and perhaps the Democrats will be chase and let's hope so\nWell tell me this one the things I fail to understand Frank is when someone takes a job\nWorking for someone or some thing either an end to the business entity or ... political entity\nA and says I really don't subscribe to the beliefs of this entity the policies of the charter of this group\nOr I don't know I'm going to work for a person and I don't agree with him but I'll take the job and then I'll deliberately and we've seen this happen in the Trump Administration a bunch of times the last two years just say I'm going to take the job and then I'm going to do whatever the heck I Want to do with the job no matter what the boss things\nWhy do people do that and why did they get away with\nIt [noise] I\nThink they do it because um they also didn't have the hubris has to think that they know better than the president said appointed to that position they often a reason contemptuous\nOf the person who is a job and the question is as you say to get away with it\nUm and unfortunately in the first year of the Trump Administration there was altogether too much of that\nUh I think probably at least in part because of the president was\nYou know spending most of his but waking hours trying to contend with the various investigations and allegations and uh and other personnel challenges and occasional crisis or to end up as a result\nYou know folks who should have been called\nTo account warts and it only\nIncentivize them to do more of it and frankly it serves as an example for others to do the same so that's a problem and I think it's gotten considerably better my sense of it at least as a with my palm pilot state and John Bolton that the national Security Council here at least in those parts of the uh\nThe national security arena\nThe that's the thing I've wondered about because frankly honestly there are some groups in the ACLU called me up and said will pay a pile of money to come down and be our press spokesman for the ACLU I'd say thank you very much know\nImmediately no I don't fit I I Believe in civil liberties I don't believe in the way that they're doing it on the other hand there might be individuals that I Would say yes to quickly or no to quickly\nBut I Can't imagine going to work and promising to take a pay check\nTo do a job intending to not do the job because I think and and intending if anything to undercut\nThe you know the the beliefs in the philosophy of the person I'm going to work for unless I sat down with him and said yeah I'll go to work for you but I Believe the way you been doing things is wrong\nAnd you can do much better if you do it my way and if your employer your prospective employers is why you're probably right we'll let you change the way we're doing things then you might take the job but\nDeciding to deliberately torpedo your employers to satisfy some other goal I I just do not under the I Can't wrap my head around and Frank\nWell and this is why you know unfortunately we have a lot of slump creatures and very few Lars Larson so we could we could use a lot more of you here I can tell you that and again it it\nI called it the phenomenon at the end subordinate subordinates um during President Trump's first year in office\nOr H R McMaster as I mentioned Dina towels old boss was a prime example of this and and you know a wedding was talking about this before but just right off of\nThe day he joined the national Security Council\nCan't announced his staff that he did not approve of the use of the term radical Islamic terrorists\nWhich you may remember was something the president actually said repeatedly and ... pain for us as\nFun as a platform of what was going to be different about his administration from Obama's it it was just one early indication that he was a bad choice and a mistake and I'm so grateful that he's gone and so pretty soon that John Bolton was selected as his replacement had who has a lot harder\nI think ... the best and frankly\nFrank I'm Talking to Frank ... from the center for Gary policy\nI think it'd be the height of dishonesty to walk in\nAnd tell an employer I'm going to go to work for you and not say by the way ms ... you're entirely wrong about radical Islamic terrorism and I plan to say so\nWill not accept the rights of the people who live right next to them to exist and continue to exist it would be like having a neighbor who says on a regular basis Lars\nI'm planning that you're going to die soon uh it'd be tough to negotiate with somebody like that shouldn't we push back against that kind of thing and even be a little bit belligerent since all the you know warm fuzzy talk of the last Thirty years hasn't really brought the Palestinians anywhere even when Arafat was offered to of been Ninety eight percent of what he wanted he said no\nHe wants to Jews are dead and we did ... I think it's\nA little bit more like a if your neighbor if you were living in your neighbor's backyard that are going to give it back and then she's too despite being U.S foreign policy that you ought to uh so uh the Palestinians are far from perfect\nAnd I agree with you it Arafat that made a mistake in those negotiations but uh\nI think it's the Netanyahu government that is refusing to negotiate now are not Palestinians are it is that it is a real obstacle to peace there but I mean that you know that issue or is it a hardly the most important one roller value waiting Haley I think a or\nHer policies are her statement on North Korea Syria where she really seems to want us to try to overthrow aside a which I think would bring a a mass chaos who tried it\nAnd Iran are or where the biggest problems where\nYou know it's funny that you mentioned getting us into another war\nAs I recall bronco bomber ran as the anti war president and he ended up putting troops into Syria without telling the public for a long long time he ended up putting troops a number of places you didn't get that while he got them all the way out of Iraq and then ended up putting about six or eight thousand back into Iraq\nBecause pulling out a wild you know it it wasn't advised by a lot of the generals was what he did and then we ended up having to put troops ride back in there and and yet the constant drumbeat I heard before Trump was elected and after he was like does this guy is going to get us into a war\nIt seems to me that the previous president Barack Obama got us into more conflict or put people in harm's way and more conflicts than this president has an this president has actually figured out to get North Korea at least come to the table and he's and he's taking a hard line with the Iranians which one is the more pro war President Trump or Obama\nI I'm not sure I I certainly wasn't going to all the other the thoughts that Obama did I Wish\nObama had it's a continued a lot of the
