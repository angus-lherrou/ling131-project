abuse of of pharmaceutical drugs the kind that come from a legitimate companies and the other Ninety percent die because of street drugs\nLike heroin that comes across our borders and there is a real connection to the borders and I thought we'd get Derek ... who's a former special agent in charge us a sea\nOf the United States Department of justice drug Enforcement Administration in the special operations division and he's involved in a documentary called not in vain a dark welcome to the program\n[noise] hey how are you afraid to be on the program\nI'm doing great but I you know I don't happen to have a heroin addiction and frankly I haven't had anybody in my family at least that I'm aware of who's had that but I I Know of some\nYou know some folks on my queen did with who've lost kids they've lost family members because of addiction to heroin addiction to pharmaceutical drugs are I Want you to tell my audience you know before they go see not in vain this new documentary\nAbout this connection because for a long time I've emphasized that your former agency the DEA says it about Ninety percent of that heroine comes across the border from Mexico so part of the solution seems pretty self evident doesn't it\nYeah no exactly and so the public needs to know first of all we have not only a public health crisis but we have a national security emergency because these\nMexican cartels that it's dumping poison all over the country is what's killing people yes you're right there are so low percentage of pharmaceutical pills that are actually killing Americans right now the vast majority is being killed from the mix to solve this poll and sent in all the synthetic\nDrug coming right from China and the labs in China and then mixing it with everything and large the thing is is that it's not just\nSomebody that could take that on heroin it's a college kid that thinks taking an adult role pill is going to Cape um alert in ... in class and save focused but what they don't realize is the pills a mix with pencil and by the way\nFor the view is one kilogram of fencing all can kill about five hundred thousand adults because it only takes two grain to milligrams of ... and all the killing adult but we have a we have a much larger issue was because you know another thing is these terrorists groups like Hezbollah they're tapping into the criminal\nNetworks to their funding and their resources we had a case a couple of years ago well on June was moving to a hundred million dollars a month to support Hezbollah\nAnd he was moving the proceeds furlough set is a\nYou know cartel here so we have a very serious problem and the American public just doesn't understand it can impact anyone of us if you look at not in vain mavericks was Twenty years old she was a\nBeautiful young girl who had very much still loved her family passion polite typical kid you know playing sports to the capital of the golf team and lots of friends and then her brother finds a dead because\nShe got a ticket and then she went out\nOn it you know by some of this stuff and it's it's mixed with whatever was in the particular you know packages she she bought but the point is is they don't know what they're getting and that's the issue Mexican cartels do not have you know train cameras that are actually caring about quality control they care about making the money\nAnd growing their business enterprise and the scary part bars\nIs the fact that China is developing all these chemical compounds and dumping it on our country and China is a communist country so you know what better way to disrupt the Americans by then by killing their their their children and by you know destroying their communities and so we have multiple facets of this problem\nDarren ... I'm Talking to dirt mauled who's a former special agent in charge of the da da da\nDa da da da da da da da to try to interdict some of these drug operations inside their borders because that seemed like the logical place to stop and we can try to stop it from being smuggled in but as you pointed out a tiny quantity goes a long way\nOr the Chinese doing much of anything to try to go after these drug a drug criminals that are making it\nLet's put it this way\nIn China are a lot of these chemicals are not even illegal to export and these chemists that they hire their their very clever because they know what\nThey're controlled substances are so they know the molecular formulas and they change a little bit of the formula so it's not even like technically illegal and so the U.S government\nThat department of justice that DEA has had several meetings recently what China to try to get them to understand that this may not be illegal but it's destroying lives all over America so there has been some increased cooperation but lost honestly it's really not it's nothing to brag about I mean the pope the politics\nThe politicians will make like everything is you know moving down the right path\nBut it's a bunch of BS to be honest with you from my standpoint I mean they not aggressive enough with them it is China it's a very complex situation I don't claim to be a Chinese experts but you know and your listeners know that China is it really really big national security threat to our country and this is just another piece of it\nYou know their debt ... computers they're still on our identities\nThat going after our financial grades and I lecture grits\nSo they'll dumping poison in our country is just a side thing but one note I Want to tell you you know when we went after these Afghan heroin traffic is for a long time we actually had a few of them say\nSally heroin to the west is like a jihad against the west are making millions of dollars and we're killing Americans so this is the same concept in my opinion on that this is partially what's going on depending on\nWho in China is actually sending at all well\nMay be good about what they accomplish if they can manufacture drugs cheaply in the ... the Chinese government turned a blind eye to it and allows it to happen they not only damaged the United states they have is incur tremendous human costs as well as financial cause and all that cash from producing new stuff\nFlows back into trying a one way or the other which is good for trying to because ... and the soup financially so they they get tired and I get to hurt their biggest competitor the military as well as economic competitor and they get some of our cash at the same time it's a win win and\nI I call it a two for one special laws I mean they win every which way and and by the way the Mexican cartels are just\nIn it for the money and they're making billions of dollars that you know and they're right on our border and\nThere's so many illegal here in America right now involved with the cartels different aspects of the cartels distribution a you know whether it's the money collections that drug distribution stash houses you know building compartments these guys are all over our country\nA and honestly we've got to shut down at the border and\nI Want to really make a difference but stuck at the military about my ... my opinion\nMy opinion it sounds a little bit traumatic but if you look up on the website department of state has criteria for how you designate a foreign terrorist organization and in my opinion based on good all common sense look at what the Mexican cartels are doing and [noise]\nCarrie up how you get to a foreign terrorist organization and in my opinion based on good old commonsense look at what the Mexican cartels are doing and they meet the criteria to be designated a terrorist organization if that happens that will have different authorities to use military and others to kind of feel that order\nAnd knock it's nonsense off which is both the politics you know if you look at nine eleven the Iraq War the Afghanistan war you add up every one that died and then even a Vietnam War\nIt still is that how many people died last year from drugs so what is the American public and to realize the wake up stop listening at least phony politicians that are in it for their own personal pocketbook sitting at wallet and if you choose they're not really in it for the public safety a national security aspects\nThe story is told in not in vain it's a brand new documentary out Derek molds his very involved and Derek thank you for your work at the DEA that dangerous and tough job and things are working on not in vain we appreciate you taking the time to not\nIf the quote had been accurate that

friendship and circuits case I didn't see anybody defending it probably there are a nation of Islam people out there because he's got a lot of followers and there were a lot of people cheering him and that you begin to many audience but the reality is\nHe was attacked by the left he was attacked by the center is backed by the white white really is going after him for a long time\nA prominent journalist for criticizing him and he still there because you know in the world of the left if you are a representative of victims group well then you can't do bigoted stuff that's always been the argument\nThat's got to be what they're claiming here even though he directly violates the terms it gets hate speech directly\nSay I want to ask you about something um have you seen this piece of video of antifa man I'm just bashing and end up costing a woman who is the widow of one of the police officers who died in the nine eleven terrorist attacks in New York City\nAnd this guy this is running on Fox and I run a today earlier and I may play I play some it if you'd like\nTo but these are two people they're not confronting each other the woman is just standing at a street corner a I guess are both perhaps headed in the director of a protest the antifa guy for his side of the ... the widow of a police officer in the direction of the you know a ... a different protests to counter protest\nBut this man begins things a young man and the woman is not wouldn't say older but she's she's older than he is um and he just begins bashing or cursing or a wishing that her husband are you know rocks in his grave after she informs him the she's the widow of a police officer died in the terrorist attack\nAnd I don't see it running on a lot of other of the sort of mainstream media other than Fox on cable um or should they be have you\nOut I've ... I've seen is yes and it I lost two of my classmates on nine eleven which is nothing in comparison to losing a family member but I\nI you know for people who live in Washington I live in New York this was a little cool attack not just a national attack we all knew people and you know this is very personal and I watch it and I get so angry I Walk with a computer that's that's that's my reaction\nBut this is how the American news media fix everything\nWe always end up talking it up by a spy commission than the old fish comeback shut this or this come back and said that\nYou know this reporter lied or this state did this thing what the worst bias in news media is biased by omission they hide the things that are uncomfortable to their narrative if they went out there you go to Chris Chris Matthews pulls out there saying Republicans are hyping this ... it's all garbage it's all a lie\nAnd when in fact now let's see I'm Still true it is a problem and you've got\nYou know ... like this city but I mean it is absolute launched her to do this he must have seen had I think\nYou know ... like the city I mean it is absolute launched her to do that she must have seen I think\nHe I think he did because she was wearing an NYPD had and he started berating hurt oh your husband do do do this\nAnd she said I'm not married he said well then you're you're NYPD cop boyfriend and he brings up the ... assault that happened involving New York cops two decades ago ... ... you know I mean I remember 'cause I'm an old guy but I don't even know I didn't even know somebody has a duty even remember it\nBut but he's breathing this woman in the most ... terms and you'd think\nThis is somebody who's not under assault he's not in the face to face grilled to grill a kind of confrontation replay it just so the audience knows what I'm Talking about I believed out all the bombs you'll hear the beep sitting there\n\nWaiting for him [noise]\nGood my mind\nThing in their bully\nAnd the great rock and the grave\nAnd she's standing there waiting for a traffic light did change so she can walk across an intersection legally and he just starts into her\nAunt and his screaming and yelling at her in a way that I'm very sure Dan far surpasses the standard you after she had to be called you know the crime of intimidation somebody walks up to you on the street and starts\nTalking you and that kind of threatening manner they're committing a crime is it's no longer free speech you would think this would be getting a lot of play in the major media CNN MSNBC\nAnd with them having to but then they'd have to explain that a lot of these in chief of creeps this is their regular MO all they do is attack people even people who are doing nothing provocative\nSings it they say I mean I yeah I've got [noise] years and years of watching left to protest something to do\nThe things they call for single police officers on to a live broadcast to name a police officer ... police officers sell things they say the police officers do\nYou just said I Can't even read it\nThey just said this to this woman is just wears a left it doesn't end well there's so much pent up anger on their side that they want a concern that he wanted her she wanted to cause a scene that's what they tried to do they actually train them to do this they\nIn state governments all around the country that also includes two suicides\nAnd all on\nAccusations of sexual misconduct down there hasn't been a whole lot of investigation about this so uh you know people sometimes as I said don't collect connect the dots but\nThey have been weaponized saying this for a long time they've gone after Democrats and Republicans but they seem to go after Democrats who are telling them\nThe party line surprisingly yeah the ones who vote against sweeping gun bills like the one in Colorado a show something very sinister has been going on pretty much for the last year\nBut you would think that after a year of sort of cleaning house whether you're swept up some good people along with bad people and you had some false accusations that remove people you'd think they'd start running out of targets wouldn't think\nYou know they never run out of targets because when they do they just manufacture evidence or there's a case this case I mentioned Hugh in Colorado there were two very suspicious cases won in Colorado one in Arizona\nState led socked in Colorado done shooter in Arizona they didn't stay on these people fighting back what they wanted to do was forced them\nOut scare the heck out of them and asked him to resign they were targeted and it'll tell you in the Colorado case they had a um a day in which\nDemocrats and Republicans all got up to say why they were voting the way they were he was expelled by the way after\nA day in which Democrats\nAnd Republicans all got up to say why they were voting the way they were he was expelled by the way after a hundred and three years\nHe ever had been an expulsion in Colorado State house of representatives day a Democrat got up and said because my wife was molested when she was Seventeen\nI'm going to vote yes on ... and now this is the law makers who are\nPutting forth arguments it would be thrown out of court in a nanosecond so I that's what I became suspicious and I started doing a little research on this and I was I was truly appalled at what I found they had flown out due process a long time ago\nWell in fact the law got thrown out in all the title nine nonsense the letter guidance that went to the colleges where they said if you can't get a legitimate sort of charges against say student athletes who are thought to have committed some sexual assault\nThen put it into effectively a kangaroo court uh and and in those cases\nIt's interesting that some of those targets were I mean I think most people too young to to to categorize politically one way or another almost be a political college student athlete who may be officially a Democrat or virtually Republican but\nYou know they're not that involved in politics but they would run people through this ringer\nAnd with no evidence no nothing they would they would end up being kicked out of school the worst thing you could do to them at that point in their life because they haven't built a career like like a judge Kavanaugh had\nOr no justice capital had so I just want to hear the odd for that and thank God for that but you wonder how much are they going to go and the almost instantaneous reaction well if he's accused you must be guilty and let's move on to the next one that's a dangerous standard to adopt an a due process country like America\nWithout a doubt and among my many concerns about this is the notion that you can build some kind of um\nLet me go to well let me go back to what you said at the beginning sure these are people who've been trashing the culture all along and and in a heartbeat had made an about face and are now acting like Puritans\n... number one we cannot buy in to this idea the left is brilliant and building a culture that's what I wanted to say they build a culture around these these false notion this and that's how you get I was listening on line to your last interview and it was\nIt was stunning and relating to hear I saw that video and and you've got\nLawmakers who are actually leading the charge in lawless nuts\nAnd that is they're developing a sort of a hard core double standard where what an ... person does something that is a criminal assault in most communities merely by walked up to somebody on the street corner today and just started shouting at them screaming at them and I did it\nFor any length of time if there was a police officer within\nYou know within earshot he'd come over and say you're going to knock that off now you're going to jail because that's the crime of intimidation so we're excusing it for certain people\nBecause they oppose from and then we're saying but for everyone else there is a hard and fast you know kind of standard and we will we\nDestroy you if you cross\n... thank you so much and congratulations on your Facebook shows spouting\nThat's Karen Adeline and you're

department of ... played by a better in ...\nI think that they should focus a lot of cases that currently exists there already on the docket of Hezbollah members whether involved in trafficking money laundering counterfeiting or even ... like the one I'm involved with in Peru above Muhammad ... from dark\nAnd put all the way to department adjusted to prosecute these cases and get successful conviction can they can get a quick when there's a lot of things are already on the docket\nAnd different courts like American Pie or lie in Peru and ah in Panama and Colombia and as I think this is where the priority needs to be a right now\nI Know John Venezuela 'cause we just have a minute Joseph Venezuela increasingly under the boot of the Cuban security services does that enhanced Iran's president said Cuba is uh is the strength of the of the dictatorship does I Do have an in Tehran and work together get\nHumid part of the alliance you know just like the United states has defied by England in New Zealand in Australia and Canada they uh they have their own by by which is you know Iran Russia China North Korea and they communicate a quite a bit including with Cuba human intelligence is very much involved in that and that intelligence alliance\nBut yet they're very much so like you're talking about Venezuela to one of the there's an important case headed back to his bill as well in Colombia there's a gentleman named Alex\nWho is a front man for a president Nicolas Maduro the Lebanese Colombian\nWho works with had below ... all the kinds of cocaine could move multi shipment of cocaine and longer all this money and he went missing recently the big in Colombia that and and the press down there and that that connected Venezuelans human intelligence that they know what we've been talking about in your show John for several years\nOf humor is the executive director of secure freedoms society Malcolm whole line confidence presidents major American Jewish organizations I'm John ... [noise]\nAnd one in particular and I was hoping you could comment on something that is sort of baffling we've seen how president el Sisi was United States recently met and he very positive and yet his rhetoric\nAnd some of his speeches have become a more of a throwback to the anti Israel language of the same time that they are fully cooperating in in military and security cooperation\nYeah it's interesting and it comes around the same time as the annual addiction celebration of their quote unquote victory in the October Nineteen Seventy three war\nUm but I think that you know there is a limit for the Egyptians when it comes to cooperation with the Israelis and I think that\nAt least publicly I think that the military to military and security cooperation is extremely important to to both parties but I'm seeing is vulnerable politically he has been consolidated his power\nAnd one of the things that Egyptian leaders are you know they go to the well on\nIs a is Israel and painting Israel as an enemy and and and having to you know have kind of national unity uh in in a confrontation with a with the Israelis I think this is a lot of rhetoric for public consumption but behind the scenes\nOr it strikes me that uh the security of cooperation will continue if only because Egypt since really needed they've proven themselves to be benefits incompetent and trying to pacify their own territory in the Senate ... needed a significant amount of Israeli help\nOr the thing is he still taking phone calls from Moscow [noise] oh I think without a doubt that the Egyptians are interested in developing their relations\nWith and that intention to use support for the Russian fleet is that going forward\n[noise] I ... it's very controversial in Egypt to have foreign forces have an actual permanent basing or basing\nA arrangements in in Egypt but there is after you know thirty five almost forty years of relations with the United states there is a kind of was full romances I should have the Soviet period in Egypt and there is a natural place for the Egyptians to want to play the great powers off of each other to extract as much as possible\nFrom these great power so I'm I there is a there is a genuine interest in developing the relationship with the with the with the Russian Federation at the expense of the relationship with the United states we've\nSeen that the problem that many of our allies or so called allies in the middle east today face our economic problems you cited it did before seem in Saudi Arabia\nAnd imprisoned people taking their uh their goods their their assets um in Egypt where the economic problems are are chronic but also in Turkey and we saw hundreds of thousands of Turkish citizens\nHave sought residency in the United states just in twenty Seventeen to twenty Eighteen and many more in UK and elsewhere\nHow does or to one seat and what is the basis for the new turkey for the economic basis when he's losing and dismissing the academics when universities and many of the others are are leaving\nUndoubtedly there are the brain drain out of turkey this ongoing purge that has\nAffected the lives of almost a million people when you think about um you know family members ed included with those who have been purged or detained or a jail pending trial and we're talking about large numbers of people\nWhat this has done has been a chilling effect through the business community which has now I'm ... assets outside the country but also kept their heads down\nSo uh I think that everyone has has cowed and intimidated the business community to the extent\nThat they will told his line but protect their assets all the same time it's extremely difficult to imagine the kind of dynamism that you had in the Turkish economy and then the two thousands for example under a ... a under circumstances where\nEveryone is essentially leads a a an elected autocracy in ... and the kind of repression\nThat continues but the business community says it though will continue to soldier on but it's it's not it's not the same as it was when things were more open in in Turkey\nAnd the prophet said has not been in the news because of the Saudi Arabia matter there is a report that the Russians and the Turks are patrolling the border and does the DOD go along with the idea that it will be a just a permanent stain on his country or is he pushing for more action\n[noise] ah it's complicated but it seems that for now that agreement is going to hold but it really is going to do a lay a in operation in ... in it lived rather than permanently put it off\nUm the Russian military in particular\nFeels very strongly about cleaning up the lid pocket they called it a a festering sore a of terrorists to an extreme is\nSo um there are also reports out of it ... despite the joint uh operations between turkey and Russia um that ah various extremist groups that which by the end of the month have to give up their weapons are refusing to do so [noise]\nUh and that would trigger response from the Russians and the Syrian Government and the Russians have been supportive of the Syrian government's desire to reestablish Damascus has control over\nA over the country so I I I think it is not in the headlines but I think it's going to come back into the headlines sooner rather than later\nMalcolm a click click could you tell them what is the impact of what happened with Saudi Arabia and the other countries in the region the particular Iran and turkey are in the war in Yemen will this habit direct impact will will ah ah Saudi Arabia be reluctant to continue the bombing and the expense of aid\n[noise] I don't think so I think as long as king Solomon wants to have a crown prince Mohammed bin Salman as the crown prince uh this is going to be the policy of the government is Saudi Arabia I think certainly um\n... Mohammed bin Salman ... opponents within Saudi Arabia or embolden by this but you know\nWho were who how are they going to seek redress\nHe controls all of the [noise] the important levers of power in Saudi Arabia so they can be angry about what's happened they can be angry about him and they can be angry about what's happening is that little [noise]\nLevers of power in Saudi Arabia so they can be angry about what's happened they can be angry at him and they can be angry about what's happening in Istanbul could Jamal ...

a lot of security and they ride around in heavily armored General Motors\nSUVs and during the Obama years they were kind of touchy there were a very touchy because they were running missions into the Gaza Strip missions into the west bank no longer\nNow that is the site of well how does it work Malcolm is that the American embassy or does that serve as the embassy in Jerusalem how does that work\nUh what the location as you rightly describe is this sort of high walled enclave right in the center of Jerusalem western Jerusalem right near the hotels up the block from from some of the

to kind of create the narrative he was going ... putting dragged into an election uh but I think more importantly um [noise]\nCreate the narrative he wants going into an election as opposed to being dragged into an election uh but I think more importantly is legal issues I think we'll dictates a both purpose and the timing or he wants to preempt I Believe a trade general's decision\nOn his

people know that all of this is going on at they still a return to mandate to me um you know go ahead and and try to issue an indictment\nOut of the war in God's at the impact that an and more

said crossing a critical red line for the people and for uh the government and despite the fact that the opposition\nDoesn't appear to be able yet to come together to present a credible alternative what what does the ... who choose to do in view of the election in God's [noise]\nSo that's a great\nQuestion I think the one complicating factor affecting Yahoo right now I'm you're right is a possible Gaza escalation if not a war uh so I don't know if he'll necessarily want to put say pull the trigger on early election dissolves the government is\nIf the countries in the middle of a campaign um you know you don't quite know or you can get into a war but you don't quite know how how you're going to get out of a war um and the truth to that over the past week has really come to the

seeing how amongst response today to uh\nTo planned a friday Gaza border marches and that'll dictate really how how Israel ... solar to uh the government said that the rules of the game have have changed that they're going to respond a lot more forcefully tiny tiny violence coming out of Gaza where the rockets or\nOr border violence um so we have to wait and see whether Hamas actually a pushes it was a he and his ruling escalation\nThat North Korea is that ain't no longer a priority risk because of the negotiations between Netanyahu and poked in [noise]\nNo I wouldn't go that far uh it's always there uh Israel is monitoring what Iran and its proxies are are still doing in Syria\nBut but you're right and the sense that it's kind of falling off since the big altercation on the air between a between Israel and and the Russians a number of weeks ago and as mentioned earlier the uh the as three hundred are being deployed to Syria that also complicating factor\nUh but no Israel has has said and I believe it to be true that they'll\nThey'll act when they need to act or in Syria to stop Iran from\nFrom I'm basing itself there militarily but but it's been fairly quiet over the past few weeks um and that's one on the ground though it's interesting that the border crossing between Israel and Syria or in the Golan Heights is actually a reopened a few days ago\nSo that's also a a signal stability or the question though is how long it it can hold 'em and but it's always a priority or an Israeli might arguably more than ...\n... we see that the Jason Greenblatt and others are talking about new initiatives or one I think that ... economical United guys in the west bank they the massive talked about the economic incentives ... where is the plan now have you heard anything about\nAny possibility in timeline given the fact of what's happening in Gaza and obviously doesn't appear to be a an opportune moment to start talking about reconciliation [noise] ah\nRight I mean the Americans um you know led by green glass jar Christian or the bastard here Mr Friedman are are involved with\nA you know there are few moving parts so number one they're their teeth plan a I Believe that does exist or we should mention that does exist and they made a an effort I think in recent weeks to say that uh they do still plan on rolling it out\nOr I think they're going to wait till after the American mid term elections next month but I think more importantly I think they're going to wait until after any or early Israel Israeli election here in the spring\nSo I don't think that's imminent uh but ... but in the sense of ah you know Palestinian reconciliation a Hamas and Fatah a over Gaza that's also been in the works but in recent weeks that's kind of been in a dead horse a you know there is no real movement on that Abbas has\nStuck in a Hamas has shown on during Clinton should on ... and I'm trying to soften its missions\nSo it's kind of a dead end as well and then I think overall diplomatically and as you mentioned economically Palestinians have just refuse to to re engage with the Americans so that makes it a bit more difficult to kind of get anything moving\nThey cut off as money does did show anywhere now we have about twenty seconds [noise]\nUh it doesn't quite yet the Europeans are somewhat the Arabs have kind of stepped into the breach a but

they're the retailers that are standing on the sidelines waiting\nFor a signal that this is going to happen and then that this is real or you know by may or June it's it's a little late for them to

quickly uh you look at a you know any number of other rules that they published in the last few years\nAnd it would certainly be the exception to see a rule making a you know finalized in less than than five or six months such that would just be pretty unusual especially for a rule\nThat is might be considered somewhat controversial and we know there will be a lot of opposition to this from the

really need to sing to go forward don't they\nAbsolutely and and it you know waiting till February to even propose this rule affects farmers as well because you know obviously they they're making planning decisions\nAnd looking at different signals from the marketplace and and\nUh if you know there isn't some more certainty\nBy the time they're ready to to low there planners next season you know it it can have effects there as well so we were we really do think sooner than later would be a nice to see this proposal from from EPA we we're hopeful that would see something\nBefore the election uh again this is something we know EPA has been looking at it and thinking about in analyzing for for quite some time\nUh they did get the the kind of official directive and and command from

uh some of those other uh personalities are legendary radio a personnel if they are and so uh but uh now you've got a little project that you're working on so tell us just a little about it because\nIt won't be long well we're going to hear about\nThe bells of peace\nBells have peace I'm actually I'm going to give credit right off the bat to Nick focus would focus the garage and hurting than he is a member of our American Legion and crafting and he came to me and said do you think you can help me out with this well he took one look at it and why ... bags staff\nSo a a week later we are we have a lot of sponsors behind us already supporting this\nBut the balance of peace will be ringing in churches and fire stations in schools and you name it on a [noise] a November eleventh at eleven o'clock veterans' day I mean I Know it's a Sunday but\nThere's a lot of effort being made to get into schools and churches and bring those valves correct in remembrance of the end of World War one and that's what they did\nAt the end of World War one to let people know the war was over they did during school bells in church bells so here we are a hundred years later and uh unfortunately all those folks are gone right and I was part but\nAh the remembrance is going to be great so we're contacting a lot of\nCommunities and churches and if you hear about it on the radio and you haven't been contacted obviously it's obviously it's a little hard for us to get to everybody but we want it known that if there's a bell rang reading it\nAnd that's at eleven o'clock am on the eleventh on November eleventh two thousand a team that is in remembrance of the ending of World War one\nWhich lasted for years now this is being commissioned by the or a military museum and library in Washington DC the society of the honor guard of the tomb of the unknown soldier national cathedral the American legion and the veterans of foreign wars they have come together and\nHe and really you know promoted is now\nA sense I found this out a friend of mine from a meeting a brass ... who is a Warrant Officer down their tells me and I have proof of it also\nThat the Canadian Pacific Railroad is stopping in the tracks on at the same time on veterans' day they're going to stop for one minute of silence across all their tracks in Canada and the United states and then proceed one minute later with a long train huh\nCall that ... that is absolutely a humble evil to me what a great tribute right there ... eleven o'clock yeah am mhm on the eleventh of November the can or now which railroad is it to their Canadian Pacific the Canadian\nPacific Railroad to be the uh uh the money and the icy any rights are certainly a lot\nGoing on I was out there and going to stop all of their ... and uh and they are going to observe a ... a minute of silence and at the end of that minute of silence they take off for the long train I took off with a long train horn so hopefully\nOn veterans' day we're going to be from somewhere we're going to be hearing trains honking or bells ringing school bells fire bells anything that can ring\nWell I think that it's important for us to the you know there there's a there's a big percentage of the population that knows some history mhm All right and uh and it's okay if you don't know history deep down if you don't know all the details of everything\nBut it is very important that we have certain days of remembrance the hundredth anniversary is a big day to remember and I will\nBe story that on the Judy's journal program you know there was thirty nations\nThirty nations that declared war and that for your time from August first of Nineteen fourteen to November eleventh which is a veteran today right here I'm of Nineteen Eighteen so in those four years thirty countries\nDeclared war that imagine\nAnd and at the time there were probably not a tremendous number\nOf civilized countries in the world right a much lower than the railroad day so absolutely a World War I important that we remember it my mind I I'm going through a scenario in my mind Judy where uh I'm sitting in my home church okay in Aurora center South Dakota\nAnd I'm sitting there and our church starts at ten o'clock okay and are quite often ending somewhere near eleven o'clock okay I can imagine the pause in the surf the pause at least during the service and to hear that bell ringing at our church\nAnd I can imagine how touching that would be\nPause at least during the service and to hear that bell ringing at our church\nAnd I can imagine how touching that would be how much of an impact that will leave on the generations after us\n[noise] but I have remembrance of that and I think that that is important because that is one of the way that we can preserve\nThat memory for those generations that are just old enough now to start remembering to the generations that are my age and the generations that are your age I'm and I I think that is very important day for

six hey Lars that's eight six six four three nine five to seven seven emails go to talk at Lars Larson dot com\nAnd boy is in this situation involving the caravan from Honduras through Guatemala to the southern border of Mexico\nIsn't as teaching us some very important lessons and sending some really important messages and here's what I see in it\nBecause I've been watching all afternoon\nAs the caravan comes to the southern border as Mexico has been told by the United states you do not let those people come through your country to our country is the Mexico is always cared a lot about its southern border and they guarded fiercely but they don't care about is their northern border\nThey use that as kind of a pressure relief valve\nIf they have an uneducated workers\nThey go north in North America and they make a lot of money and spend that money back to Mexico that is annually eight thirty five to forty billion dollar plus\nFor the country of Mexico all that extra money remittances they call it coming back into Mexico it's easy money from Mexico\nAnd then all those green American dollars aid Mexico's economy it also gives some relief because Mexico doesn't have the kind of unemployment problem that would have you have all those illegal workers had stayed at home so that takes some pressure off it also takes the pressure of Mexico because then they might have to reform\nThey are a country that really in some ways has a lot going for it they have a lot of territory plot of land you need that they have a lot of workers people who are willing to do labor and they have\nMoney and they have\nOil you take all those things energy land capital and labor and you almost can't go wrong but then you inject one other factor and corruption\nLand capital and labor and you almost can't go wrong but then you inject one other factor in corruption where the top five percent of Mexico takes most of what the country producers and the other Ninety five percent gets what's leftover that doesn't work out so well\nOur average time for this time of years around sixty three and we should be reaching that as we head into Sunday but for most of the week we will be below average\nBut now let's focus on our forecast for tonight lows dropping down to the low forties under mainly clear skies then on Saturday warming up to the upper fifties as well see lots of sunshine throughout the day and driving back down into the low thirties overnight\nAs we head into Sunday through Tuesday lots of sunshine with temperatures ranging from the upper sixties to mid to

caravan was headed\nToward the Mexico Guatemala border and I told you this is an important issue but it's been an important issue for a couple of decades long before President Trump used it\nAs his signature issue launching his campaign in the summer of twenty Fifteen a Mike ... joins me out with the he's right for the hill Mike it's good to have you on the program thanks for the time to nine large\nThanks for having me appreciate it so there are folks who are saying that President Trump is ramping up on immigration is that even possible for Donald Trump to get tougher on immigration that he's been one\nThat's a great question you know the answer is no but it allows him to return an issue that has really been in the headlines recently\nAnd so whether or not is ramping it up I guess it ... it but it hasn't been in the headlines and now it is until the caravan it's kind of given him an opportunity to kind of low hanging fruit at the softball and uh and he thinks that he just kind of hit it get it out of the car\nRight ahead of these midterm elections so your your point is well made a ... yeah the ramp up really anything it's the same position that he had all along\nBut it doesn't allow him to ah to to re enter this into the news cycle at a very crucial\nWell maybe maybe if a name to blow the goods conspiratorial should good shape Donald Trump or range for the caravan to arrive at precisely the right moment before the mid term so that he could bring it back up do you think she can launch conspiracy theory like that guy that\nThey could probably drink something like that I thought you know right now you get a lot of finger pointing across the aisle Trump of course is blaming the Democrats for allowing the caravan to come up and the Democrats are pointing right back across it him and saying wait a minute we don't go control the government wants to do something about the conditions down there\nAh in in Central America so of course it's going to be a blame game that's immigration in Washington and uh and and the fingers are going to be pointing all around and and that has changed of course just a a headed these elections it's only going to get a more heated\nMichael let me ask you this and this may sound a little crazy but I'll I'll throw it out you anyway or is it possible since we now live in a world where anybody with a smartphone anywhere on the planet knows can know what's going on in another country\nIs it possible this caravan shows precisely this moment because it is around the midterms not because they wanted to help their friends with the Democratic party but because they thought it's time to get into your into the United states before we hit those mid term ... season changes [noise]\nYou know I think if if they were if they were thinking that you that politically I think that they would have I think they would have waited a you know with the house a kind of favorite to flip to the Democrats right now I think they would at the state so that was a better chance of getting across later in the year or next year or if the Democrats and below sea do take the gab all you know I think\nUh you you talked to at least she talked to the advocates and you talk to the diplomats\nYear or next year or if the Democrats and below sea do take the gavel I you know I think uh you you talked to at least she talked to the advocates and you talk to the diplomats down there\nAnd there is a lot of violence that there are people legitimately fleeing\nA very dire situation and and then of course they're going to be a lot of hangers on who are just trying to take advantage of that situation and get across the border when in fact they are probably not\nNow and then you get pretty but a ... you talked to at least so the advocates and those on the ground down there and they think that uh you know this wouldn't have nothing to do with politics that if it did\nThat they would certainly wait until next year a assuming that the that the house would clip\nWell the other thing about that is that do I understand correctly 'cause I I Do keep an eye on this topic is one of my favorites for the last Twenty years is one that we ought to resolve that ah\nThat the ... the if you say I'm coming from a country where I'm being persecuted by the government because of my race religion or national origin or any of the other protective categories that you have a good chance of being approved as a refugee on the other hand about eighty five percent of refugee claims are refused\nBecause people say my country has a stinky economy or my country has you know crime problems\nThat those under the law or not legitimate reasons to claim refugee status\nAnd certainly yes you're exactly right and it's and there are going to be do of course you know people are going to get to the border and\nAnd saw him again or probably in a very dire situation uh you know whether it's gang violence or domestic abuse or whatever the situation is they're legitimate claims and the people are by and large are or prove that they go through the process\nThen again you are going to have the hangers on who are just trying to take advantage of a of a of an opportunity here\nAnd uh you know to to claim that poverty is a reason to seek a silent status or refugee status of course that you know judge up here is going to accept that and those people will probably be refused and poured it I'm like you're certainly right you know the the\n... broader point that we do have a process in place that uh that once people do arrive at the border there's a process their detained a and they have to go before a judge before anything can happen and uh you know what the Trump Administration is trying to prevent that from happening at all\nBy having Mexico where some of the Central American government stop the caravan before it even gets to the border so that's kind of where we are right now the negotiation with the Mexican\nA law makers Mexican leaders Mexican authorities and uh there was some rumbling yesterday that a Mexican leaders had said that they would take care of it before they reached a quarter so this might fizzle out or before they even get to Texas or anywhere on the southern border but we'll have to wait and see how that plays out\nI'm Talking to Michael Lewis who writes for the old dog come down the other piece of this and I want to know if I'm overreaching because I Am a Trump fan but when the caravan started and it was maybe a thousand before grew to four thousand is it is now may be even bigger than that by now\nThe president said to Honduras poll that caravan back or you lose your foreign aid he told the same to Guatemala\nAnd then he told Mexico you let those folks across and you may find yourself without a trade deal now I was guessing that does seem to be some pretty powerful motivating of pushes from the president is that the reason the Mexico isn't just opening up the gate and loving them come into Mexico and then head up the road toward America\nMexico is doing is offering work visas to a lot of these people say you know all these countries have\nDifferent relationships and they have different laws and process sees that would a company you know people who wanted to to leave or enter a a a sovereign country um you know the Guatemalan government can't very well tell its citizens that they can't travel outside of the country so\nI don't know what legal authority they would have to do so and then in the year ... Mexico I'm sure it has some kind of visa\nAgreement with all of the Central American countries and is probably very lenient and there's probably this probably very easy to come and go so what we were hearing yesterday is that the Mexican government was going to offer some work visas and try to get\nA those people to stay in Mexico and not covered not reached the border as a kind of an appeasement strategy for Trump because he is threatening\nTo close the border he was threatening to put military force at the border and he was a threatening describe most importantly threatening to scrap the newly a negotiated NAFTA deal and of course Mexico a doesn't want any of those things to happen so I I think they're scrambling they're they're trying to figure out a way\nTo uh to peace President Trump and prevent this caravan for reaching the border\nHey Mike this is the first time I can remember any American president Republican or Democrat doing that kind of thing telling Mexico knock it off and help us out or you're gonna you're gonna suffer can you think of another example where president has done that\nI can now and you know and and you don't have to go back very hard to remember do you remember the search at the border we talked about under President Obama I'm ... and there were just you know thousands and thousands of people and and a lot of them unaccompanied minors that was when that\nStarted happening or as a result of a lot of the gang the escalation of gang violence down there with the purported reason and uh but I Know President Trump wasn't you know pressing those governments to stop that people before they arrived he was just scrambling to find ways to process them once they did\nAnd of course that's why you had all these detention centers uh you know President Obama long before President Trump had entered centers or\nWhat he didn't do a separate the families which I think that's why that issue blew up [noise] um but you know you hear about immigration judges and the at the lack of immigration judges and these people get up here in the months or even years sometimes waiting\nYou are given refugee status and eighty five percent of refugees do not get refugee status they're simply told your circumstances don't justify it\nYou are allowed to access all of America's social service programs so welfare food stamps tan of\nA section eight housing Medicaid all the rest of that so it's a sweet deal if you can get it as a refugee\nYou could work and make them far more money than you made back at home you can be reasonably save at least compared to back home your kids get to go to school you get medical care and you can access all those free goodies paid for by the American taxpayer and if anybody thinks that to write\nOr fair or just or legal\nI think you've got to take another look at the wall let's go to norm norm welcome to ... to the Lars Larson trout what's on your mind\n\nThat ... yeah yeah he ... you know he's an Arab like anybody else that country true\nAnymore and killed Bob well\nI ... I can tell you one if you want me to make the argument for why it should be a story\nIf somebody I went to the American consulate in Russia or Japan or France\nAnd they ended up murdered inside that consulate\nAnd it's a conflict that say from a friendly country a or a country added to leave sensibly an ally of the United states that would be an ... that would be a major story that's not just some foreign national who's gone home and and goes to an M ... and goes out and gets killed in a mugging or a of a crime of some kind\nThis is somebody who was allegedly killed in an embassy now I Believe that his murder maybe more the result of his ties to the Muslim Brotherhood\nThe fact that uh he was a friend of Osama bin Laden and that he identified with a you know the the ridiculous ... end of Islam\nAnd that had more to do with it and the fact that MBBS the guy who runs the crown prince who runs Saudi Arabia right now is trying to westernize their country and the Sheree of folks they're hardcore Islam is do not want that to happen I think that may be more to explain why he ended up dead\nThen the Saudi Government just simply saying we're going to silence a critic by murdering him but he wasn't just a journalist he was a political actor as well\nAnd for the most part I understand our media tell them tends to tilt to the left\nBut we say tell to the left\nImagine somebody who worked for a and T thought one of these sub Gish crowd did show up in American cities will also worked for a major newspaper or a major news organization like CNN\nAnd they played both roles the role of being a political activist as well as the role of being a journalist on television most television outfits even the folks at the chicken noodle news network would not tolerate having somebody on they'll do it for commentators\nBut they will not do it for somebody who's straight ahead news reporter which is what ... is being presented to Americans and all these stories as but he was a political actor I mean\nIf you said I have a job with the Democratic National Committee as one of their staffers but I'm also working as a journalist at CNN CNN would say no we're not going to let that happen unless you're on as a commentator but if you're just simply a news reporter so they're trying to portray this as is\nThis man was a journalist he wanted to tell the truth about Saudi Arabia and he was murdered for being a good journalist I have a feeling that when we finally find out the details\nThat we're going to find out that he was also a political actor and he was pushing a narrative that was anti Saudi Government right now because he wants to the Saudi Government go back to the other direction this the ... that country while they've not always been the best friend they have been an ally to the United states\nThen I think what the left would like to do are left would like to do is drive a wedge between Saudi Arabia and Washington DC\nAnd the fact is whether you like it or not if we are going to be an actor in that region and we do have to because that region could end up being a national security threat to our country we need some allies there we have one in uh in Israel\nWe could have had one in Iraq but we let everything fall apart when Obama pulled all the troops out and now we've got troops back in there but that could have been a a a freely elected duck a government with the constitution was written while we were still there\nWe haven't done that and we could have had one in Saudi Arabia and when is that region started to have a real you know government of the people instead of governments being run by either dictators for royal families than ... ... when you got one next door you say well why can't our country like Iran why can't we have one that's more responsive\nTo the public don't right now but they could and the minute you get one next door you're going to say well hey why can't we have a deal like that\nI think the Islamic hardliners\nThey don't want that to happen and they'll kill anybody in a way of stopping that you've got the Lars Larson\n[noise]\n\nClear heading into the final chapter of the great American read I'm
