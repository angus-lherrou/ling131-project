that's what the U.S is seeking to see again um at least in part\nA what we saw that in which that there are other ways to send messages and in fact ah without the underlying relationships between

necessarily going to respond to it so it's not the way in which ... it's just the way in which messages there that\nUm if you look at when the sanctions relief was put in place it another way to

uh the Iran deal and may if\nThat even though it's banks that decree engage most of them have had since withdrawn those relationships\nAre so it doesn't it doesn't necessarily matter it's not it's not a silver bullet um if the banks won't uh aren't willing to do that the business anyway and I think that that actually the announcement that this special purpose vehicle that Europeans have had said they're going to put in place um to try to maintain\nThink that that actually the announcement that this special purpose vehicle that the Europeans have have said they're going to put in place um to try to maintain a financial linkage with Iran when the sanctions that reimpose\nIs kind of an individual indication and acknowledgement um that the banks with or without twist aren't going to do it and they're trying to find an alternative even though it's a centrally a barter system that they're ...\nThey're not likely be very effective given their past record but I wanted to ask you a two things one we know that he run will look for ways to evade any kind of restrictions\nSo we see it now on the oil where they're they're trying to disabled the tracking system motive sweet so you don't see the destinations volumes and it wasn't swift also means for us to track\nThe money flowing unit of drawn so those who raised the concern that we're going to lose that information valuable information for tracking the Iranians ... is there an alternative means to do so\n[noise] so but first I think that that some of the the\nThe conversation around living access to to to tracking Iranian activity is a little bit of it a a charcoal and there's there's two things that are apples and oranges there's a program called the terror finance tracking um\nI'm Sorry to hear the terrified of tracking program that uh that the Treasury Department and ministers and has since uh shortly after nine eleven um through which they receive a information from sweater subpoena can be searched to look for terrorist financing activity\nUm and that's that's a separate kind of program ah\nThis this and that continued when a Iran was taken off of sweat previous land of the Caribbean around it and\nUm so I think that those are two issues that are getting max but but on the issue of rainy and ... of course the first of all there's other ways that they can pennies messages and that they did last time whether it's by facts or email or any way just to to signal that they want and the French who care to their\nBanks that are willing to take the sanctions risk of dealing with Iran um you know after November tests are probably going to do so regardless of whether or not ever on it's on the program so go ahead\nNo no I I I don't want us to run out of time and we did not ask about the efficacy of the sanctions so far ...\nBut she did address that in the in your opening about the first round I mean we we try to keep track of the companies that have pulled out we tried to report because people don't know would you judge the ... the first round of sanctions have successful and really impacting the target you saw it\nI think that's a really important question and we as we approach November because I've I think one of the things to remember is that there where east to Ninety Days and a hundred and eighty to wind down periods\nThat what that meant is that businesses had that period to to pick up any business that allow that they were doing and that a lot of of firms acted very quickly after the announcement and end with drill and so I'm In terms of of assessing the advocacy it but I Will keep already seen a lot of pressure\nUm that that's going to be brought to bear through the first year the sanctions that went back and place um August ... well before then just that you're going you know we've probably seen a lot of the impact\nUm that we're going to see a asset November ah because his activities should have a already stopped and in fact\nBecause this idea think she'll snap back within which was written into the Jaycee peel away perhaps not for them and that's the way up but most terms that that that would ... would have had plans on the shelf to put in

they moved to the exclusive limited time limited quantities north wind edition for them once it got a military grief movement um our body\nYou see so I mean one of the things that were in through the years is that things things shift and of course in the middle east\nThings changed pretty quickly but I think what what needs to never change is a is a strong bond between the the us and Israel and I and I will say that [noise] you know a President Obama my had differences with Iran as you point out\nBut where it came to ah to helping Israel with with with funding um he was right there and we've always had a uh for the past twenty or Thirty years we've always had to both presidents from both sides of the aisle bipartisan the\nThe the relationship and that's really what I Want I Want to see and that's what we did again the foreign affairs committee and it doesn't mean we never had a different differences of opinion but we did it respectfully and we were able to always compromise so we were able to come out I remember there was one sanctions bill during the December twenty Thirteen\nAnd we passed unanimously out of the foreign affairs committee or that people like Tea Party people from the from the right of all the way to uh extreme or a progressive uh on on the left\nAnd everybody voted for it and then we did it because we handed out and we we we we moved ahead\nAnd we talked a lot about Israel in the United states and I'm going to keep doing it I I Know there it's going to be some some difficulty but I'm I'm ready for the challenge and I have a lot to say I've been working this issue for a long time and I look forward to sitting down with all of my colleagues and trying to help convince them that Israel is the best friend we have in the\nMiddle a it is true that you are very very uh very likely to be the chairman of the house foreign affairs committee if your party is successful in the mid term but I'm not certain that that is doing anybody a favor you're going to inherit Syria\nWith Russia turkey and the Assad mercenaries bringing it lip problems and I'm told that that can turn extremely violent we also have American troops in Syria greatly at risk because the Iranians want that highway to Haiti's\nFrom Iran all the way to ... evidence\nYou're also going to inherit the quandary of\nAh the Palestinian failure of the Palestinian failure in ... and in the west bank you're going to be on the road a lot Eliot if your chairman of the house foreign affairs committee [noise]\nWell I'm I'm I'm hoping I'm ready for the task I Know I Am going to have my sleeves rolled up and look there are lots of problems you mentioned some of them Syria breaks my heart when you look and you see the human tragedy the\nHundreds of thousands of people a Syrian citizens who are just murders and killed by Assad and his henchmen with the backing of Iran with the backing of Russia [noise] um ... it's just something that just just has got to break your heart from a from a human a point of view and [noise]\nUm ... we're not done obviously they're still miss so many many difficulties with ah with Syria and many many difficulties that's why it's important that I think for the United states to continue to ah to talk to all sides and uh to to have a working relationships with our country\nIs one more detail ... one more detailed Eliot the American embassy is now in Jerusalem does that make it easier to deal with the Palestinians your measure\n[noise] well to tell you the truth John I don't think it ... makes it easy or or harder\nUm we we passed a law uh I Wish I voted for twenty three years ago a which is that the embassy be moved to Jerusalem and there was a waiver in it and every president since then use the waiver um and a\nPresident Trump and I have many disagreements with him but President Trump to his credit\nI'm signed it to a signed the move and then didn't use the waiver and I think when Congress shows ... and into intend to go in a certain direction I just don't think it should be disregarded and these were bipartisan it was it was for several years\nAnd um I I think that it's where it belongs now for Palestinians and the leadership really wants peace [noise]\nIt it shouldn't have any effect on it um [noise] you need to just sit down you can't have have an agreement if people won't even come to a to the negotiating table and whatever one thinks of\nA two state solution and I still favor a two state solution [noise]\nUm the fact of the matter is that doing all these negotiations since Oslo Israel was ready on two occasions\nTo sign a peace treaty with the Palestinians want on who the rock and went on to hold armor and both times you know first it was Arafat and then it was a boss who

China\nFirst a story that looks positive the vice president of China visiting Israel toward the end of this is\nA I think a very interesting story because it's kind of thing that gets very little attention but I think long term has great significance\nBecause for for a number of years there's been an organization to Israel China joint committee on commission on innovation\nAnd cooperation and that this is a body that meet annually and was under the guidance of a very high ranking Chinese official but the government of trying to clearly has upgraded this and designated a vice president who's I think number eight in the hierarchy\nTo come a ... a a ... and I think is his name [noise]\nClass and I said a very significant player very close to the present jeans and T came and visited and publicly appeared with the prime minister and that they opened a conference at the Paris center in Maine for the late president of Israel Shimon Peres\nWho appeared in a hologram engaged a spiritual will because it's you know he was always the one talking about nano technology and all sorts of at dictionary or have used for Israel and seeing Israel as technological ... in it strengthened even Jack Ma was there many others came\nA but the relationship with China to Israel despite the fact that on Iran and other things are tensions\nAnd the investment in the nineties it was fifty billion dollars Chinese investment in Israel in sixteen\nIn in in twenty sixteen it was a sixteen and a half billion dollars and so they trade it is growing a all the time the trade with the Arab world like a hundred and Seventy one billion but the difference\nDoesn't sell military technology\nBut health care and and to other things that that can be beneficial as sustainable development thinks that the that China really needs and they find the news where they bought a dairy from Israel because they found out that the cows give more milk and they they are now working cooperatively in many areas\nAnd it's the same time they still have a relationship with the Palestinians they vote in the un with them uh but no longer have the pressure of you know that the Arab states are demanding that says condition or or um ... in any way restrict the access to Israel\nSo this is a I think reflective of a bigger change that doesn't get noted there but I think long term you know a hundred and fifty thousand Chinese visited Israel this year you know when you were there we saw the deliberations every other\nUh if I read in the economist okay Hi Betsy my that's my we read the economists look at America from mother Britain right [noise]\nI read in the economists that there is fresh concern in Israel\nAbout Chinese espionage shifts about Chinese or interference in\nIntellectual property because they're real is startup nation\nThere's even a building that the Chinese workers are working on and Tel Aviv that is part of the national security apparatus and there's concern there as well Malcolm is not an idle concern the economists said that the prime minister is freshly moving on this so while there is an investment dollars\nAnd jak laws present\nOr was it is impossible to ignore the fact that if you were going to choose a country that gave you access to American technology you would choose Israel because of the relationship between the two countries [noise] I I think\nYou're right on all counts and and the concern is there it's it's actually universal true in most other countries because the Chinese have a record in that regard I Do think that there are those who are trying to counter it in established a different platform I met with\nChinese business people who who are very interested in coming are working with Israel building tourism to Israel and from Israel but there is a universal concern that that technology has also been stolen from an American companies as well and because that's what Israel has its main export yeah it is is it's\nAs if the knowledge economy knowledge base it correctly and the Chinese agents of the Communist Party are bad actors when it comes to my knowledge economy right\nSo so those restrictions and that is why they don't deal in the technology in the military technology areas and they have restrictions on it except things that could be used for\nAll right I'm not I'm not the prosecutor I'm repeating what I read in the economy is perhaps I misunderstood don't know if it's true let's go to China let's go to China because there was at a bank and China that is closed its doors I think they even caught the fingers of an Iranian agent trying to get into the door and then there's I think at the end\nThey slammed the door and it's had it what is this may laugh\nWell I think it's part of our own going effort to get people to understand how the sanctions are working in an even\nIn the countries that we are least likely to to adhere to it we see that the Chinese ships now are are at least a turning their trends ponders as well but some of them will not carry rainy an oil\nAnd the and other countries as well but now we see a key Chinese bank and ... it's the bank of ... but it's it's very important because it's controlled by the state ... energy group seeing PC\nAnd they they uh had stopped the euro denominated transactions with Iran a while ago but now they stop US Currency\nAh this is a a really important indication that the uh sanctions and what's coming up in different before that we discussed earlier this evening\nI'm at with cash from power and others\nIs really a even in advance of the application\nI'm already affecting so many companies and so many banks insurance shipping others who take this seriously and and the predictions that I saw from the ... the assistant secretary of

professionals they're tracking capital and tangible assets and the transfer ability a bill of ... of these assets to keeping track to make sure that the terrorists in Iran don't benefit\nFrom the sale and and profits from these things and this move by a Chinese banking of others follow is increasingly turning the news on the options open to Iran to avoid the sanctions quickly we have less\nThan a minute for the last time you mentioned that there was a ... in a rupture and and a disruption between Jordan and Israel over a long standing peace deal\nRight the twenty twenty fifth anniversary is coming up next year so they had to Jordan has declared one year in advance which is what the deal required that there are two piece of land that were released Israel under and Jordan was given ... part of the deal it was expected be renewed it's used for agricultural purposes by Israeli farmers\nUm but now Jordan is demanding that they take full control\nThey said that it will not and they've gone to great lengths now in the last couple of days said so that could affect the peace treaty today Eighteen young people were killed one of the bus in a flash flood near the dead the Israel sent in

you know for so long uh we're in that\nVery low interest rate environment I think\nYou know it's just not in our psyche right now I'd be thinking about anything different than that and we need to\nMove those rights over two percent now over the last Eighteen twenty four months crime is now sitting at five and a quarter when once upon a time it was three and a quarter so it's it's certainly moved to LA and by all accounts projections are that\nThat that's not done the conventional wisdom is another move in December and potentially three quarter point next year and twenty Nineteen that's another ... percent on top of the five and a quarter so the day is an interest rate with us here in front of it are really behind\nAnd storage gonna increase so I think it's really important for producers to be thinking about that and what that means of their operation what can they do to manage that risk the best they can\nDo what can they get to manage that risk and what does every quarter point increase me\nYeah so I never a million dollars and operation might have every quarter point increases another twenty five hundred dollars of annual expense for their farmer ranch one percent which is protected for the next twelve to fourteen months\nNow that's ten thousand dollars no expense for every million dollars so some meaningful number it will become more meaningful as we move forward and the rising right environment and so\nYeah it really needs to be thought about in plugged into producers thoughts as they plan for their expanse controls as for what they can do your balance sheet look at the structure of your seat and do you have the opportunity to lock in some of those rates fix some of those range as crazy as a child and then this rising right

kitchen waste\nThere in ... president of the Nebraska pork producers association says they knew the was a concern\nAt one time a lot of people thought that it was okay to see different animal byproducts and or leftover kitchen waste in America that's pretty much weight on the way side or we found out that it's been a lot more efficient to just eat corn and soybeans and then try to stay away from any kind of a commercial coached up\nOver there in China it's a completely different story where a lot of the pigs are still raised in the very small small hurts like literally family owns a ... or ... won an animal and then a lot and the animals are literally kept right out the back door\nAnd so having that kind of pick population and a dense area or it become second nature but people look at any way they could be able to save money and obviously they don't have the the great a bunch of corn and soybeans supplies like we do so all of a sudden it become a an easy thing to just ...

they've acknowledge that there's been over forty outbreaks I Believe up to this point maybe they've only euthanized a couple hundred thousand pigs which\nSounds like a lot but yet and the scope of how many things China has on a you know and they're human tore it should be at the very small number\nOf the part that we're concerned about is we don't really know forgetting told the whole story and so

disease\nThose are all factors that they've got to come into play yet but I'm not on top of it were worried\nBefore they find out that they have it does he those are all factors that got to come into

defensive rookie year in twenty third game you know Sheldon add an eye opening experience like fourteen months ago he was tried it\nYou know and then and then and now he ends up with the Vikings I put the Seahawks after the jets so what's it like working with a veteran like Sheldon compared to some of these younger players\n[laughter] well I think with with Sheldon and I think one of the things that's really been cool in my experience with Sheldon is is when he came in Andrea said regardless of what you read for going to give him the opportunity approved to us who he is\nDon't don't make a you know don't don't already assumed he is something that somebody else said he has given the opportunity to show you years the Sheldon since day one has been awesome\nGreat work ethic he's smart\nHe cares a lot about winning ... because a lot about his teammates but the biggest thing when you get a guy like that show has been successful elsewhere he's obviously been a a big deal first round there he's gone to the pro bono cetera consult with Sheldon as much as it is teaching him what we know\nWhich is again a very small percentage of of the NFL and really the football world does what we do a\nAs not only in addition to that we have to break a lot of old habits that he has that he's been allowed to get away with him and stopped him from being\nAs good as she could be you know there's a lot of wasted motion in in what he's done in the past and it makes him yeah he gets up the field but he doesn't get to the quarter back to that makes sense and some of the things that we've done here to help him\nA really gets him downhill 'til the quarterback it builds on them and he has bought it completely but you see occasionally you know\nIt's really fight or flight response when it comes to play football right so he gets in those positions and sometimes those old habits you can hurt him in terms of what we want the shelling has been awesome so I think the biggest thing we're getting a guy like that is really\nBreaking the old habits and building up what it is we want from our\nGuys just Geneva hunter up and move because I Swear and practiced I've seen him do it but you never see it in games\nYeah no he does and he was a funny thing about spending will not everybody should use the spin move around like I could not everybody just because you can spend doesn't mean you could affect that we do it\nAt that whenever ... got comfortable with it is it the lethal yeah\nAnd it's funny my first year here in the pre season versus Tampa Bay the first time you really unleashed it then you got a second James Winston\nAnd I remember how excited he was the here and use it and they use it affected me but he had been playing with it and trying to the new has spin move that Neal is not in love with the spin we not comfortable with it and he's such a fluid guy and he's winning doing the things that he's doing he's got it there\nIn love with this been we not comfortable with it and he's such a fluid guy and he's winning doing he's doing he's got it there will come of actually when he's just like his daddy was not comfortable with it at first but when he fell in love with it when you when you ... I Believe that it's that move them each one of the best in the leaf\nSo well before practices more during practice or whatever and durable four games when when you when you put on those gloves and you do something that I Know is very important to you the punching drill ... what what is that and what are you looking to accomplish well\nMajority of the science of lamb that you see across the league or they teach them moves a but it's like being a boxer teaching you how to punch just for bags not moving but when you have hands in front of me that are trying to punch you\nKnow you have to be precise ... Ninety nine percent of the the ones that you're going to run into they teach moves really teach violence but they don't teach precision\nSo well we do is every single day we're training your either your hands to be not only violent but precise yeah so my hands are coming I I Try to I take pride I was told the guys you let me know on Sunday if their hands are faster than mine and then I mean they've got to speed my hands up but you develop this muscle memory of\nUh just deflected catching having your hands in the right position and being comfortable being in a combat position because that's how we when we're not afraid to come back we're combative Russia that Congress has it all the time\nWe take pride in being combative Russia's and they build the the muscle memory to\nDo it that's great thank you Robert Rodriguez said to us just in defense of wind coach for the Minnesota Vikings about Texas ... bay in Minnesota Vikings radio network [noise]\n\nShowing up to the party empty handed these were not an option either is compromising on chasing the Packers\nThe light here this\nWith only Ninety ... three points to call [noise]\nLite hold true here very fun to talk of censoring or blowing up while he is on average you know the twelve food ounces lesson ...\nSome die ... bless you do when it does the pressure and throw in a red Baron chosen teach a witch project that's not too thick and not too thin\nDelicious dawn one hundred percent ... elegy than premium toppings you've got a pizza your whole family will love story void mealtime Jay I'm going to enjoy game day or ... or ...

that conservatives have behaved so you're asking for something that goes way outside of our usual behavior I mean\nMost of the Tea Party a protest ones that I went to and ones that I saw in other cities and in D.C on television\nThey were incredibly civilized event whereas you look at the average a left wing event a good example in January of twenty Seventeen after Donald Trump's inauguration the crazy women's march ... you know the fact is\nThere's nothing wrong with women saying we want to be treated equally inequitable yeah okay it's already in the law does exactly would you like and we'd like to burn some limousines we'd like to stage a protest in which people have their safety threatened and that causes a lot of trouble and gets us on TV I think that's what's crazy\n[noise] although I said I Want to mention was Madonna telling telling us still is a book Trump and that's not black oh\nShe is often sized or dreamed of blowing up the White House that's when Madonna said and that is wacko as well and yet you know\nThat if a Republican had said this very same words in the very same tone of voice CNN would be running it in a video loop but if Madonna says it they say look what a strong powerful feminist she there's ... there's a really strong double standard\nAnd done I I Love journalism I'd been in it a long time and I love the craft I was in it as a reporter without my opinion uh being being shown in my stories and as a talk show host I give my opinions every day\nI'm proud of journalism but I'm not proud of what journalism has become because we have people who are supposed to be reporters and keep their opinions out who are inserting their opinions I worked my tail off\nAnd the proof that I think I kept my opinions out of my stories\nIs that when I went from being a reporter on both television or radio to being a talk show host there were folks who I'd run into both strangers and people I knew who say\nYou're a conservative and I said yeah I'm a conservative they is well I never knew that and I said what did you think I was wife you worked on television I thought you were a liberal I said well clearly I kept my opinion out of my reporting which is what reporters are supposed to do the other thing that's dangerous to the entire profession\nIs if you tell people when we cover stories were going to cover them in a double standard\nIn other words if one group of people says something or does something we're going to tell this kind of story but if somebody else from the other side does precisely the same thing or something so similar that is nearly identical we're going to treat the story entirely differently\nI mean constantly I look up at these two screens in my studio one with Fox on one with CNN on a big big screen TVs\nAnd I and I look at them and I see them saying with no proof Donald Trump says X or y or Z\nAnd I thought during the entire eight years of Obama I never once saw them say with no proof whatsoever Morocco Obama today claimed to blah blah blah and I thought the ... there were plenty of times I mean when when when one broad Obama was asked\nDo you know that the IRS has been going out and denying as conservative groups free speech rights by denying their applications for tax free status all he had no clue and he said oh the first I knew about it was one I saw it on the news and I thought\nThat at a bold faced lie you can't make us you can't tell us on one hand you're a Harvard educated lawyer and your ... according to your fans one of the smartest guys on the planet and then turn around and say no I was completely clueless\nAs ... and I made the point in time the president of the United states should be arguably one of the best in foreign people on the planet he has platoon of people around him from all these different agencies whose entire job is to gather every important piece of data in the world even stuff that that secret\nAnd then to boil it down to just what the president needs to know and say Mr President we are going to tell you what's going on in Turkey or what's going on in Iran and we're going to tell you what's going on in Iowa and they boil it all down and they feed it to him and say this is what you need to know how\nCould a guy who's so well informed claim to be so ignorant of what was going on in the only answer is he was lying and yet I never saw CNN or MSNBC or any of the rest of the joker or the New York times say\nThe president claimed without any sense of credibility\nThat he had no idea what was going on at the D. OJ during fast and furious or the IRS during a the the cheating on conservative groups he had no idea that the EPA was out taking actions that would lead to the release of toxic contaminants into the Animas River he had a in other words\nAccording to Morocco bomb a bronco bomber was arguably the single most clueless president in American history if you believed his denial of that\nThat's what's going on than any case at least the man is in custody he has been charged with crimes\nIf convicted will put him away Caesar say they'll put in a way for the rest of his natural life\nWe've got a lot of talk about on the first amendment friday night six six four three nine five to seven seven\nFor the rest of his natural life\nWe do lots of talk about on first remember friday night six six four three nine five to seven seven you are listening Lars Larson show\n[noise]\n\nI Wonder how the hardware\nBack up and say this fall at your neighbor ... when you're taking care of the everyday projects around your house races you're one stop shop to find exactly what you're looking for a great deal now through October twenty nine\nLike buy one get one free on the line Kelly the light bulbs buy one get one free on east basic housekeeping and by to get one free unease furnace filters pulled me into your local aid to help them offers out are participating stores exclusions and limits may apply in the ...\nLiberty mutual insurance knows you're focusing on the road right now so we'll just describe our new billboards to you the horizontal rectangles with the yellow background the headline reads liberty mutual customize your auto insurance so you only pay for what you need\nA while that might sound like a lot of words for billboard they all fit perfectly overall it's a pretty great advertisements go to liberty mutual dot com for a couple of my quote and you could save\nSaturday coverage has underwritten\nBy listening to all insurance company in the early ...\nWhen the need for seniors are right and there's no place like home or a loved one should never have to give up living at home visiting angel who provide home care for your mom or dad at home I'm twenty four hours per day including personal care meals and light housework selective professional caregiver visiting ... look at\nThe beginning either dot com or called eight seven seven three seven ...\nSeven seven three seven more land franchises or an animal hitting angel America's Choice and senior home care\nI'm going to tell you something personal I met him you know and it still amazing it makes me want to tell strangers on the radio not amused fill it made from selling um fibre and naturally sourced plant fiber that trap and removed the waste that wave you down I take it every day and sneak they'll lighter and ready to take on the world\nSo if you feel sluggish it might be your digestive system not working like it could help ... for yourself and then tell everyone you know we're not that any us all feel lighter feels like\nFive Seventy W.
