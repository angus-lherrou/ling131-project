came up to Seattle heading back home tonight back to our home studios how about a great bed next month November Keenan Hi Mark Twenty years in sleeping honestly\nHow does a great night sleep improve your performance how 'bout more energy less brain Fox better mood more productivity they do sleep number three sixty smart but the one I'm going home to tonight helps everyone from parents to pro athletes improve their daily performance through the proven quality sleep it delivers\nA big corporations I mean I I can talk to our career fairs and say that we ... we co host of roughly a hundred and fifty of those a year all over the country we do some online\nThese are big corporations are that are looking to recruit the highest level of talent you know from the veteran pool so they do recognize that they also recognize the value\nOf disabled veterans and what they also bring to the workforce so I think it's out there uh but we do struggle with the the fact that uh unemployed as unemployment goes down and and everybody's thrilled about where the rate is right now\nAnd that's great were behind that one hundred percent but the overwhelming majority of those that we deal with on a direct bases\nAre are not unemployed underemployed and in some cases over employed\nJeff here's the thing we hear about discrimination in the workplace all the time\nAnd yet this is one of the few places where an employer could correct me if I'm wrong literally discriminate in favor an employer while I think Wal Mart did this not long ago said we're going to hire ten thousand votes and if they were effectively saying everyone else yeah we're going to hire them first that the law allows them to do that\nTo say we're going to hire vets were going to give a preference to vets I Know there are a lot of government jobs that give preference to vets and then you take into account the fact that a veteran of the who's done service is likely in some cases more finished the job kind of person to begin with whether it's a man or woman\nAnd then if you factor in the Americans with Disabilities Act that says you legally have to accommodate people's disabilities you think that the veteran would be in the cat Byrd's seat for getting jobs that are available but they want to pursue the careers they want to do am I missing something or because you said that the surveys show that\nNot quite two thirds more certainly more than half of all veterans are worried that when they go out in the workplace they're disabled they're going to face discrimination\nI Would hope they see not only employers say we will follow the ADA comedy your disability but oh by the way you're a veteran we want to hire you even more than we want to hire the average applicant is that not happening [noise] uh I\nI think would you know with a statistic that would that comes from a survey that we are we you know that we had done and yeah we we were a little bit taken back by the fact that fifty seven percent of those surveyed younger veterans you know fear discrimination in other words um\nThey understand the position that they're in a ... but when they come back and they want to maybe they want to join a police force so they don't want to disclose a particular disability uh because I think a lot of it really comes from the stigma that\nYou know you don't do that over the years that was taboo to do that you kind of keep that thing to yourself um where\nIn fact I Believe where we are today in society is exactly as you put it\nCompanies are seeking those individuals with again because of the fact that they have no disability um you know one of the things that that we particularly when we started interacting with companies on a regular daily basis [noise] especially the multitude of them at career fairs is the fact\nThat there was so much\nAnd and still so much work to do on the education front of educating employers on what a disability is however to the point\nThe the companies are doing everything they can and creating a really really great opportunities for veterans and now we got to get the veterans to understand hey you need to disclose that went into proper to disclose it\nUh companies want to hire you because of it because their tax incentives for them financial incentives for them to hire you and it just trying to get both of them and bridge that gap that's where that you know our our ... guide to hiring and retaining veterans with\nA disability is is really that we've released this month as hopefully going to help on both sides of the table with that\nJeff pork and folks find these resources on line and and I would encourage people if you've got a veteran and your family or your circle of friends go out and say hey be looked at this thing ... especially if you know somebody who's already in his dream her ... his dream job or her dream job say have you looked at this this can help you get where you want to go [noise]\nSure ah so I'll divide that into a boat or the same resource and that's on our employment website at jobs dot D.

N. A. X. right now it's forty four [noise]\nAre you thinking about playing the lottery\nNumbers you start\nTwenty nine [noise]\nMakes those numbers special there the number of years people have been\nOn the radio this month Sharon Skinner celebrates two years three years for ... Thompson and I have been\nHere twenty nine years\nAbout double X radio\nDouble ... dot com\nLive\nSomebody in a\n[noise] honestly provocative\nGun welcome back\nTo Lars Larson show it's a pleasure to be with you and blind to take your phone\nAnd emails you know we talk a lot about civil rights on those programs but you know that I Love the naysayers and there is no nice hair that I Love more than my buddy ... Juan Williams we liked it\nConrad but you see them on Fox News you read his columns and now he's got a brand new book out that I just I looked at the title of this and I thought one I got to talk to you the title is get this what the hell do you have to lose Trump's war on civil rights one welcome to the program\nAlways a pleasure Laurie thanks for having me on to talk about the book\nIt is a pleasure to have you on to talk about this book so I Want you to start with what is the biggest thing that Donald Trump is done to try to adversely affect the civil rights of Americans\nSo I Would guess number one would be that voters depression a effort jail they said oh it was about voter fraud we're going to start a commission I think his his feelings were hurt that Hillary Clinton beat him in the popular vote by spring million so he said that that didn't happen fake nose\nOr actually it was voter fraud and so we got Chris Cole back from Kansas to come and they got to start a commission\nWell guess what they couldn't find anything but they allow state legislatures that go on in terms of closing polling places than minority areas uh increase requirements for voter id changing the time for voting I think I think he doesn't think that a minority is going to vote Republican I think that's the issue yet\nBut one I don't see that as voters would pressure and I want him to check and make sure that every ... every one of the cast a ballot\nIs an American citizen entitled to cast a ballot and in fact in the two years since the sixteen election you and I disagreed on a in those two years we've seen people actually prosecuted for voting in from voting without having any right to do it we've seen it and\nPennsylvania we've seen it in Texas and other places and I honestly don't think that election authorities many of whom are Democrats and liberal stage\nReally care whether people vote illegally are not\nTerrorists that reality there is no one there is no major I mean you might find one instance here one instance there\nAt one point they thought they had something up in New England in some states if they do college kids were voting here and they actually are from other areas even though they go to college with and they re oh no the state law allows college students\nTo vote so this is what happened and this is why they had this ban that commission because it was based on a big fat nothing\nBut you know I think your initial question large is very intriguing what actually has Trump done that were damaged civil rights in this country yeah I don't think we should ban this conversation much farther without saying here's rhetoric\nHit the way he talks has been absolutely divisive including the title of this book because it comes from his language what the hell do you have to look at him and he's talking to an all white audience at by a them and they all Michigan and he's as many people reported as if he was saying\nOh to the black community ear neighborhoods are so poor you don't have jobs\nLook at the poor quality of your school is why do you vote for Democrats why not vote for me that'll truck great question well and I think the first of all this he's not talking to the black community he was talking to the white community about the black community and I think he was saying\nThose people over there are so broken so dysfunctional filled with cash and violence and Donald Trump will stand in the breach like a hero in the snow like I'm gonna call 'em out and I'm going to keep 'em away they all muggy they won't take your dad's I thought my guest key is absolutely demonizing the black\nCommunity how did you I I'm just confused as to how you read black community into that I think what he was saying was\nYou voted for conventional Republicans before and you didn't get what you wanted you voted for conventional Democrats before and Brock Obama I think most of the black community has conceded that he didn't really deliver much for them what do you have to lose votes for me\nAnd they did it and by the way one I'll just pointed out\nDonald Trump is broad black unemployment to its lowest in recorded history and allow some laws and the number of new black businesses in the last two years almost two years of the Trump Administration because of the changes regulation because of the boosted economy\nThe percentage of new black businesses up by four hundred percent nationwide now those two things have a dramatic effect on the positive nature\nOf black employment and black entrepreneurship that's a good thing right\nWell if the numbers are right that's a very good thing because I think the primary accomplishment of the U.S civil rights movement you know going back to the Nineteen fifties like say if you start with fifty four and ground going forward to\nThe passage of a civil rights act and fix the core and by the way the book is structured on the basis of the provisions of the civil rights act looking at\nVoting rights housing education and the light employment law um but here's the reality Everytime President Trump calls a black woman a dog or says a black people have extraordinarily low intelligence I think that's what he said about Maxine Waters a democratic critical or\n... I Would agree Maxine Waters does have extraordinarily low intelligence community that I think that's very rarely is mainly ...\nJuan let me get spending our point here is going on about you know a LeBron James is so down me make than dilemma look smart and Don Lemon is done and\nOf course you know his divisive rhetoric was the start of his political profile because he was involved with saying Iraq Obama's not an American totally fraudulently and he continued even after he'd been proven wrong\nAnd then he comes up anytime anybody says that you have a problem with race Mr President says look at the low unemployment rate without saying oh\nThat low unemployment rate Ninety percent of it is a critical to spank you Obama it's only after one percent since he's been in office and the black unemployment rate remains twice the white unemployment rate with him doing nothing to try to correct\nYou want you want to correct result in this case I think that rising tide of the entire economy is going to lift all boats\nBut does that mean one that you're telling me that if I go on the air and criticized Chuck Schumer I'm not being a racist 'cause truck is about as wide as you can get\nBut he's also a Democrat but if I criticized Maxine Waters for Sheila Jackson Lee who just had a staff member arrested for you know some crimes that they committed involving the public's information that if I criticize Sheila Jackson Lee I'm a racist because Sheila Jackson Lee is black\nAnd might not allowed to print is the president not allowed to criticize black people for fear of being labeled a racist or should all Americans be subject to criticism especially when they serve in high office\nYou know you're talking to somebody who's at heart Lars and you know me well you're my friend but you know that I came up as a journalist I reporter like a\n... is a street ... thanks stained reporter so did on my whole spirit is about holding powerful people accountable and telling people what a powerful with the establishment is doing in this country\nAnd trying to get them to act right so that's me but you can criticize anybody of any color any gender any ethnicity nationality that you want\nBut to me when you do things like say good people find people are marching when they are Nazis white supremacists\nAnd one of them kills people and they're standing outside a synagogue with tiki torches and automatic weapons\nOr as I say you don't understand the history of humanity much less the history of the ...\nBut they don't want to I criticize those people I don't hesitate to criticize them but I also criticized the black Panthers who stood out in front of the\nUh ... Pennsylvania polling noise embattled you're seeing now you're being racist because you're criticizing the black Panthers no I'll criticize anyone who tries to keep Americans from voting but I don't think Donald is trying to keep people from voting I think he's saying there are reasons to suspect\nThat our voting system is flawed a theory that Democrats agree with you if you bring Russians into the picture and then as soon as you take Russians out of the picture and that seems to falling apart they say well now you can't criticize whether or not our voting system is subject to possible fraud\nBut I'm saying on the ground the bigger issue right now is making sure that Americans can exercise their constitutional rights of all we want more people participating in our election system we want more confidence at a time when the institutions in this country especially the institutions of government are such low\nAnd I'm a million a million people in California who are illegal aliens have driver's licenses and their automatic voter registration well they're not to\nDo and I both legally larger than being a legal you guys are making stuff up and saying\nYou can't shooting heroin legally either but it gets done a lot in the United states of America anyway\nLook I did the reason I met I brought up guns was that I Am someone who lives in big cities I'm not a hunter I Am a threat by\nPeople with God I have one yeah see that's your response but I look at all the murders look at all the mass murders look at what goes on in school when people get these guns that so willy nilly it is a mess and on we are not protecting ourselves or our show\nI Want to ask you a theoretical question this goes to a civil right and in his book is called what the hell do you have to lose Trump's war on civil rights\nIf you were to arm any of the people in the great city of Chicago who are law abiding citizens if you arm them with guns legally unlawfully the ones who want to be armed what do you suppose that happened to crime in the famous murder capital of America Chicago Illinois\n[noise] if there were more guys it'd be more death\nNo more guns in the hands of law abiding citizens\nYou want an arm everybody get the candidate Gardner is done\nIs they've never had that won all although if they can shoot well I plan to have my ... I plan to have my granddaughter shooting under adult supervision by kindergarten do you think that's a good goal you should do it for your kids\nYeah I don't want her killing her friends hurt and I don't\nWant to say like a large under adult supervision now other than voting where do you think that Donald Trump has gone to war on civil rights and let's talk about immigration to well we have time\nWhat do you want to talk about immigration asking a question but I was going to cause the earth or go ahead and we're doing we're out they will be gone there or on civil rights we talked about that divisive rhetoric we talked about distorting\nThe reality of the black community focuses on the twenty percent that live in poverty disproportionately young people it's a very difficult situation link I think a lot of the history of this country beginning slavery but coming over to\nThe legal segregation and continuing biased and bad schools that are so that is a problem but he ignores the forty percent of black America that aren't as between thirty five and a hundred thousand you ignore the additional twelve percent earns between a hundred and two hundred\nThe there are people who are get up everyday Lars and Lars Larson conservative traditions\nCode or work hard to try to get ahead in the face of continue racial bias in this country to be celebrated I Would think conservatives would say wow look at people who had some difficulties faced discrimination and yet still believe in the great American Dream and believe in capitalism is\nStill a huge gap in terms of well between black and white America but instead Donald Trump he doesn't need it happened to the idea of what made the accomplishments who sent it to all those people are scary and I\nDid he ever say call 'em out do not hold on what do you hold on to listen to tell you so I don't I don't think he's ignoring them at all in fact if anything he celebrates the success of black Americans and and what is emblematic of that\nIs the most recent public opinion polls you know these national polls that are done say that black voters support for Donald Trump has gone up it's actually higher now than what Mitt Romney had and Mitt Romney did not have a great number of black Americans supporting him neither did John McCain delayed John McCain\nBut Donald Trump has higher black voters support than either one of those two guys\nYou know if we want to look at polls I mean let's look at the reality of the boat and twenty sixteen I think he got it\nBut a poll that did not have a significant number of black people being polled participating but reality is right now two thirds of all American people of all colors think race relations in the country or worse\nIt's about the same number who say they don't approve of the way Donald Trump handled great probably one because it's just something I'm very\nVery well luck does even use is kind of language racist forty nine percent of Americans in a foxhole said Donald trumps of race\nSo to me largely if like ignoring\nThe elephant in the world and saying you know we don't want to talk about race we don't want to talk about the fact that this guy is so offensive on this issue so critical to our history and so we are because we are becoming more diverse country well race leader or\nTheir battle for and I don't know how we get around this as I said the polls are pretty clear it's you know that poll about racism eleven percent Republicans said he's a racist and that may be the biggest puzzle to me maybe I should ask you\nGet good people you know it's just the court he does have a little problem with race and so you know let\nLet's pay attention to that one I'll answer that when we come back I'm Talking to Juan Williams whose latest book is

administration and the Bush administration and the Clinton Administration it was not clear to those of us who watch national security that the U.S what's going to focus on ... threat\nWe're now focused let's start with Russia or your experience with Russia from your dad and mom is that no matter how they dress it up their aggressive\nAnd they're aggressive as sexually along the boundaries of the empire is it your opinion that the Trump Administration is addressing it adequately now after the failures of the Obama administration to see what Ukraine represented\nI think sending ... anti tank missiles to Kiev instead of socks and blankets is is a very a serious improvement probably Obama years [noise] so yes and uh the personalities while making the decision not to send the White House but ... for example the sound of the joint chiefs\nGeneral dumped fit fully appreciate that uh\nUh KGB Kindle is always a KGB colonel and the the important way to look at Russia is not as the Soviet Union of you'll\nBut what I like to call them and the status quo actor constantly looking to destabilize but we we tend as Americans I Love my fellow Americans we tend to posit good face on behalf of\nThe other right I'm okay you want to be oh yeah I I say something and I'm a maintenance and ... business that's the best yes\nThe Kremlin has never work like that whether it was run by a song whether it was run by Stalin or by KGB cut off so we now have\nThe requisite knowledge and understanding that these are bad actors ... not the Soviet Union this is a nation in the in demographic an economic collapse but a nation that will constantly endeavor to create Eddie's world will wins and we'll tools\nWhich will destabilize certain regions after which they can do was exploited to their own\nBetter and there's a there's a eight phases and we won't go through the details there in the book but right now I Would say all those eight phases are present in a number of geography is across the edges of the empire from Syria to uh the Baltic states including you crack\nSo the eight phases of Russian doctrine today a I credit the Latvian ministry of defense that defense the Institute that

the comprehensive this of their understanding of\nIrregular warfare that is the danger\nWhen you got to the national defense university ah as the son of a man who fought the Soviets did you perceive

this morning she's got to be at home city livestock down Wednesday the seventeenth from pentium to one PM and we'll send you have to carry it on friday in the nineteenth\nUp to the sound of their top there up their area where the way\nYou know I'm not really a smart enough to fully understand whether a climate change and global warming and all that stuff is real or oh\nDon't have the education and know how\nYou're not a scientist I Know what I'm saying I'm not a month to a ... year you know there's there's people on one side to say one thing and there's people on the other side of the say the polar opposites\nDo one thing that I Do know is that before we can prove it one way or another most all of us will be dead and so it's kind of a one of those arguments\nThat uh if if you're wrong about two and\nA you know you you basically are screwed your kids and grandkids over\nSorry to me uh I I don't know what to say you know\nWith regard to them I don't understand the ought to do it anyway because\nChain to me the only argument is whether it's caused by a man or not because\nYou can you can there's definitely a change yeah yeah but you can\nIn argue with each individual just by walking through the air makes little ripple effects that change cell that's what I Know what I'm Talking about is before humans was way different than what it is what the argument is is\nWhether humans cause the majority of it threatened or not yet I again I think that's what they really should be instead of arguing is their\nChange or not because obviously\nWe can look at the numbers and say there's it does make some sense though doesn't it to you know\nPick up after yourself and not throw a bunch of plastic and the ocean and pollution you know it seems like minimum yeah then yeah you know do that stuff but most people don't even care about us I mean\nMy personally I Believe there'd be change no matter what we did because I Believe this has happened\nTo be saying we're based upon because you know around ... guy gut feeling no it's because just like people talk about the ice age what did man due to cause the ice age ... yeah exactly yeah I I don't know where we're all the people that caused the ice age maybe it was the absence of people because it I said\nYou talked to a climatologist they said that we usually has cycles and this is part of the cycle so that's what I mean and having silence four billion and the people who argue\nThat it's not a cycle say well\nIt hasn't happened since we've been measuring love how long we've\nBeen ... you you can add more than a cycle cycle but perhaps it's possible that humans are going to push this next cycle past the point of us surviving Harry possibly fail you that's what I'm\nSaying because humans definitely have an effect on it it's just a matter of it they've they're making it worse than it but it was going to be bad anyway it's a matter of them may humans making you\nKnow what I'm saying is I don't know and people who say they know oh I Know as a hundred percent sure this way or somebody else says I'm a hundred percent sure that way I don't think they really know\nBut I don't know why people argue that I don't know anybody can argue that there's been no change because we can tell there's been change\nIn other words there can't be an argument is there is there Wyoming are isn't there we know there\nIs a ... a two two and tell we see a ... change and when that happens if it happens where there's catastrophic damage all of us will already be dead and so there is not right you know I mean just from old age or whatever that seems so it's an argument you really can't win and it seems like\nA wasted time of arguing it either way [noise]\nWell I I could I could lean toward you know cleaning up after yourself and and not\nGo yeah I think everybody I think being responsible Stewart I think Ninety nine percent of the people to agree to clean up after yourself\nYeah but there's a lot of things we do that you know tears things up that we don't necessarily need to do\nYeah um which makes it worse than what was already going to be a bad situation even worse\nI don't know I I Know scientists\nAll to save a buck vow I mean why one bunch you had your bed a little bit if you think that we're causing some things do a few things to perhaps clean up after yourself\nAnd I think a lot of people are doing

okay Fred that's polite that's what you have to do yeah I I don't always threatened you've never learned to be polite like that\nNot like that I don't like something don't even know Fred you eat it

with you on a Wednesday and I'm going to take your phone calls and your emails mark\nThiessen joins us now who's the fellow a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute on a great columnist for the Washington Post one of the few conservative people at that paper\nBrett [laughter] so I was going to call you bred Marty welcome to the program today with it I Want to tell you something before we get into Kavanaugh but it kind of relates to Kavanaugh for the me too movement start with Harvey Weinstein and in that case\nAnd I guess there's a big development in that case that one of the major accusers of Harvey Weinstein they've found a bunch of emails and things on a computer she left beyond that allows job\nAnd it turns out she had a friendly long term relationship with a guy although she apparently described it as she said I hate feeling like it's a ... call and I'm Wondering if that whole case is going to start blowing up in front of us and and since it's the\nSort of the the the bedrock of this whole me too movement had started everybody taking a a tough look at at the bad behavior of some people I'm Wondering what effect that might have I was I've been reading that and I got a little discombobulated so I'm On my\nFirst reaction is that one out of like what Seventy say\nExactly exactly\nAnd and to even if she did continue to have a relationship like a\nRoach come uh like talk you know I mean Monica Lewinsky was I'm a a wasn't a or unwilling participant it ... it was a power relationship that was unjust for the United states of the White House ... like you know it's not and and that's not even power situation so she could very well have been depending on Harvey Weinstein for career\nA and plus trying to keep it as good prices despite a sexual predator traditions so I don't think that that's necessarily positive and you know\nNot not necessarily story but apparently there's a bit of splitting the da's office about whether or not those charges should be dropped the looks talking about capping off because I'm sure ... yesterday earlier this week Hillary Clinton comes out ineffective voice not affect the way she says\nYou'll get incivility back in American society the you know all the anti ... and the you know the nonsense and the violence and the shouted threats and a visiting senators' offices are now their offices their homes in the middle of the night all of that will end when you give us power back\nAre are we going to be able to you know are we going to be able to have a civil society or other Democrats simply going to say will cause trouble 'til you give us the reins of power back\nAnd looked at that mean that I don't know how much lower you go then that gives them some of the participating in and organizing Gingrich [laughter] without any evidence whatsoever of but apparently they and according to Politico the Democrats think that they are the lessons from the capital experiences that need to be more ruthless\nJust rude blind boggling\nMore ruthless and they've been the case that we are are we are just\nWears the weirdest principled and the pursuit of power will do anything to get power and there are two principles into kind and too soft and so you know there there there that say they need to be tougher as what they're taking from all of this which is just you know I mean the fact of the matter is that what the left always does\nFirst of all they they they made their two reasons why Brett Kavanaugh was on the Supreme Court said they're both fault the Democrats number one\nThey filibustered Neil Gorsuch and as a result the Republicans went nuclear do you think for a second that Mitch McConnell would have been able to muster the votes last week to go first and if they're often get rec having on the court\nOf course not so the reality is that based\nThey screwed themselves by filibustering it perfectly qualified\nUniversally respected justice\nFor the Supreme Court and so that they had no power whatsoever to stop Kevin ... and then the second thing is they always overreach that Christine Blasey Ford you know her story started falling apart but at least there was some issue seem credible\nTo most most Americans just associate volunteer or something then they start coming up with a temper merit store ... piece in the New Yorker and then Michael out and then he comes out with this ridiculous you know these were diverted Gillis a David that you know he was standing in line to wait his turn with girls and you know all the rest of it and then gang rapes and just it it\nYou know they overreached and so the lesson is not\nTo to to do more of that the lessons they mean that literally helps concerned Brett Kavanaugh because there were ... or so ridiculous that Republicans that Israel the St Louis said look this is just absurd uh and I don't believe those charges and blow the trolley not not true either so they actually\nThey actually helped Kavanaugh's case by going overboard and by with air attacks on first on Gorsuch and then on Capitol so the lesson is be smarter shopping stupid\nAnd I guess I Hope you don't mean by and I think the Democrats may say being smarter means we have to have a better pack of lives that are less track of all you know and in a better set of stories and I hope they don't do that but frankly mark\nLook I Know I'm critical of the media and I mean the me I'm part of the media but I'm critical of the mainstream because I don't think they're doing their jobs and I'm Wondering I'm Wondering if you joined me in this because\nYou remember when when David Duke was supposed to have endorsed Donald Trump and and they said well it means Donald Trump has to decide claim that connection right away Well Mark I guarantee you there or at least a few people listen to my show who may be nasty\nIndividuals you know I think the vast majority are nice folks but I don't know everybody to listen to my show there are millions of people in the radio audience so\nYou know it was somebody says hey there's this full on ... from Alabama who just he loves your show and he hates everybody in the world because of their skin color race religion et cetera and I say my response would be I don't control would people think and the fact that he likes my show or endorses my candidate for mayor dog catcher whatever does not really mean much of anything\nUnless I embrace that endorsement well in this case I'm not seeing any ... any members of the mainstream media going to politicians right or left and saying and especially on the Web ... Barbara Boxer and Chuck Schumer and the rest and say we'll you condemn these tactics\nTactics where violence is done where you know about the protests are made and and your shopping centers house in the middle of the night and arouse his wife things like will you do that they will go to Donald Trump in believer him for a week\nTo say please come out of displaying David Duke star I think at the end of the day he did um but but they're not doing any of that in a case like this so they pick and choose when does say it's a major story this week good you know that the senator so and so will or won't a disclaimer this kind of behavior or by people who were advocating against Brett Kavanaugh\nDo is there any reasonable explanation for why reporters would say well\nYeah a biased I mean why does this I honestly there's so many older folks into Christine Blasey Ford story ... ... that's the best of journalists ought to be going out and saying was there so coordination here was this plant a ... you know the way it is\nStill talk to people enter high school and find out a little bit more about her she saw let's talk to find out or is there coordination between Senate Democrats in her lawyers\nOr how did the story leak why I mean we ... we still don't know how ... letter came out into the trash there there's a there's a lot of stuff that that is worthy of investigation and I don't think any of them but I Do it\nSo they have no curiosity to do because it doesn't mean they were to find out about all\nLost over so why why should they should they a waste of energy\nI mean they can spend all kinds of time on on other lesser things like you know whether or not to certain people in the Trump Administration at very low levels of campaign or you know allied with somebody else but in this case where it actually controlled whether or not a man would become the Supreme Court\nJustice that he is today or whether his he'd be ruined and his name be smart forever I'm no no ... there at all and and and I guess\nI just wonder if these reporters or have any self awareness of saying we're because they'll tell you that they're unbiased that their objective journalism they're just telling the news well then why not treat those stories equivalent it gives the Duke example was maybe a poor one but\nThere are lots of examples where the press will spend inordinate amounts of time and energy tracking down he is there a connection here or not and you had this one is like not not even interested in looking into it\n[noise] just to the press is really just you know the cloud itself and the whole philosophy for sale and just to shape the use of a ... charges like there were even credible to treat the Ramirez story like it was terrible I mean it's just that they see that was said they complain when Donald Trump talks about fake news\nBut then they steal the stakes news me\nWith their behavior against capital a so I think I think a lot of journalists really made fools of themselves and the whole process of current and to say though that ah they'll though the press just people just aren't paying attention to it where they're losing our because there was ...\nIf you think about the people who have committed political assassinations Lee Harvey Oswald not exactly a right wing conservative if you know what I mean and so the left uses these kinds of tactics the right does not\nWant in TV shows up in your town be sure to have the fire department in sublease an ambulances on hand when the Tea Party shows up on the Capitol mall in Washington DC they usually leave the place cleaner than it was when they arrived\nSo is there a reason to do that this isn't pointed out routine like I Know that most reporters working for TV channels they want to find a kind of a moral equivalence well both sides do it\nActually that's not true is not backed up by the facts has not backed up by history so when somebody like Hillary Clinton vows that civility we'll only returned when the left gets its power back\nIt reminds me of a four year old and the grocery store in the cereal aisle with mom who is screaming at the top of his lungs holding his breath well it'd be screaming you can't be holding his breath but he's screaming at the top of his lungs and stamping his feet\nAnd civility is only going to return on the captain crunch goes into mom shopping basket we understand it is not rational behavior but it is the kind of behavior you expect perhaps from juvenile children\nIt is not the kind of behavior that America ought to have to tolerate coming from adults simply because they identify with the left side of the trial let's go to Cindy Cindy welcome to the Lars Larson ... what's on your mind tonight\nHello life I was told that they want to thank\nYou very much they only say that so we can spend most of the time your point\n[noise] okay I thought that look at it and it kind of sexual finance Hillary Clinton\nAddict for torture sexual predator claim to have it out\nAnd you did you notice Hillary Clinton saying well the charges against my husband she actually said this week\nWe're different the accusations are different and I read that I thought yeah they were different because the charges against I mean Bill Clinton never contested said he had sexually harassed and molested Kathleen willy who came to the oval office asking\nWell he never contested that he had to elicit an illicit affair with Monica you know uh and and he never did no of course he would not admit that he raped Juanita Broderick but that story is so well founded and well evidence\nAnd Juanita Roderick who's been on this program not long ago just for a couple of weeks ago during the whole cabinet business\nUm she explained that she told somebody about the assault the rate that Bill Clinton put her through within thirty minutes of it happening and she remember the details she'd been told other people in her close circle of friends and she told them why she feared reporting it\nBecause the man who had raped her Bill Clinton was the attorney general and he controlled the industry in which she owned two nursing homes the attorney general of Arkansas that time maybe still\nA controls the nurses nurse nursing home business he had the power to put her out of business so\nYou know Bill Clinton was accused accurately sewing Hillary says they were different I'm sure that was on what she meant what is what my response would be your bed it was it was a different charges against Kavanaugh were unfounded on evidence to non proved\nAnd the charges against your husband as Ann Coulter calls him the horny hick from Arkansas were very well established by the way\nHow does a great night sleep improve your performance I Know what it does remind how about more
