I don't take it is full of some very strange questions and you're right there is some hidden ways to test whether somebody is telling the truth or not or just trying to gain the results\nBut you put forward the example of Pete Domenici first uh end of the idea that he came out and told the public look I've I've got this uh did degenerative disease\nOr at the wasting away the funneling temporal lobes and he was nice to be honest with the public about what was going on\nBut it tests like that might have really reassured people or perhaps suggested to the member of Congress or senator or did they ah they really don't have any business doing the job anymore\n[noise] yeah I think that's an excellent example and you know another very topical one is uh of course we we all know that\nA Senator McCain recently passed away from a brain cancer and a far too obliquely he really should have resigned a retired when I ... that was discovered and think about where we would have been today with the cats in a\nCar confirmation if he had been in the end is a ... bed in Arizona too ill to go to Washington to vote that's a practical example of stability patients uh that really arguably should have dictated resignation\nAnd by the way a doctor I through this idea out awhile ago because we did have that question of whether or not something will be approved could hang on when the vote is taken in whether somebody's in town or out of town that sort of thing\nI suggested that in this day and age when you can buy a house in signed the mortgage documents and you know signed them electronically or send them you know over wire scanned them and then send them back\nThat are members of Congress should have the ability of voting electronically funny enough in their own chambers they do vote electronically but you have to be physically present in the Senate or physically present in the house to push the button or would it make sense\nIf say you know that there's a senator from Montana or deans who is going to beat his daughter's wedding tomorrow so he has to vote before he goes or go to the wedding and then quickly fly back to D.C to cast a ballot\nShould we at some point consider maybe the idea of allowing the senators to vote remotely might allow him to spend a lot more time in their district or their constituents and a lot more time away from the lobbyists on Capitol Hill\nAbsolutely laws makes perfect sense and there are ways to definitively verify that it is that person\nVoting and you could do it even a ... something like Skype so that you that you see a a the counter could actually see that the person was casting as well yeah it was a little\nYou know it's funny doctor I don't know if you Henry now I've been friends for a long time but uh I Know that there was a case I Know about recently I'm I'm among some friends or acquaintances or somebody had to be on a regular a breathalyzer check\nAnd I said how do they make sure that it's actually this woman who's taking the breathalyzer and they said well they have a device attached to your smartphone\nAnd you have to actually look at the camera can be verified as being the person who's actually blowing into the tube showing your your blood alcohol content if they're doing multiple tests you know per week to assure that you've not gone back to the bottle\nAnd I thought well heck if you did that kind of thing with senators senator ... smartphone a show his retinas to the camera phone my ... my phone will do that it'll confirm who you are by right now it will confirm who you are by fingerprint\nYou can do two or three levels and say we know absolutely that's the person who press the button and cast a vote and then the senators could vote from anywhere and they wouldn't have to you know make sure they're on Capitol Hill to actually cast the votes we want them to be involved in\nThe absolute technology can do that though with a with the great fidelity these days you're absolutely right\nNow the other thing you brought up is you think there might be a reason that Nancy Pelosi needs a test\nYeah in the article a I had links to a couple of videos of her speaking and she's not she doesn't seem to the affected all the time\nBut there have been a few instances over the past year or so where she slurs or words can find a word and ah\nIs what I Would consider way outside the bounds of normal delivery to express herself so um\nWe're we're gonna have to watch that wouldn't surprise me if and when she's posed as a majority leader as a leader of the Thames in the house that she decides to retire I don't think she's well\nAnd yeah I don't I don't wish her ill but if somebody is not fully capable in politics no one wants to be removed from a spot no one is likely to want to remove themselves\nTheir own party is likely to want to remove them and the other party catches all kinds of hell if they say well we'll take the person out because they're too crazy\nOn they're going to drag out a bunch of lunatics they'll bring out and Julie sweating like again and ... ... yeah okay um they're evil and often do what they don't mind looking evil they do mind looking implausible\nBy the way you should do that in colder result sooner attorney in a very arming the lotteries record for important people are just as strong as you know let me ask you a legal question I don't do that very often but you see in the wall Street Journal reporter I imagine that says that ... the longtime friend of\nA Christian Ford says that she was leaned on by people she told the FBI that she was leaned on to train her story from I was embarrassed I don't know Brett Kavanaugh I don't know anything about it through apparently do a story that said\nShe was going to back up Christine foreigners which would be I think if it's possible more than one eighty from I don't know anything to I remember the incident\nIs not a criminal act to you know to to go out and try to inform somebody to lie to the FBI on him to Congress and uprisings like this where is that just something that just terribly wrong but doesn't actually break any laws\nOh I see I I haven't looked up to the federal\nBudget on that but it is certainly a crime to uh try to get someone to perjure themselves and quite closely related to the tune perjury well it was under a a a signed on a signed a statement absolutely the crime if it was just in talking to\nSenate Democrats that not saying it under oath um possibly could day\nI'm speaking to a government official the FBI agents but young that absolutely they should and they've got the prosecutor I'm so sick of Republicans and this is one of the wonderful things have gotten out of the trunk he's showing showing Republicans have fun it is to attack\nBack for once what Republicans always want to be the good in sports and oh okay we want in the end we got we got cabin on the court no no no no a statement has to be made this will never happen again you will not for me or someone like this and destroy his life like that\nI couldn't earn more who don't know what should we you said don't trot out somebody else\nBut let's say a ruby introduced Berg leaves the court in the next two years before the end of this term and I just read a second term because of everything that's going on ... what can we do proactively\nTo stream the Democrats I Know they have no shame but what can we do to remember say don't try this again because\nCute prosecute\nProsecute prosecute I Want to know who leaked the letter on that was given in confidence to two on the Senate that will find that ... they have to get to the bottom of that they know the name of the guy who was\nThe only producing beat the home addresses and phone numbers of Republican senators I'm so that liberals can ... them and that's what's known as doc thing on and and we do have\nSome perjury charges including for I Know they loved claim a judge Kavanaugh oh it's perjury perjury he he didn't say he say he drank excessively now I I I think he kind of didn't\nSay that I don't anymore\nI mean it's either falls or or selling us what they are claiming is is perjury while\nChristine ... for not to be confused with Dr for number one she was not a medical doctor number two and she's not even a psychologist she lied about four things she lied about her fear of flying um she lied about the polygraph test she lied about needing a from\nA to a second front door I'm as\nHe lied about being a psychologist statements under oh\nDo you think that the Republicans have the guts to prosecute her for that because I mean here's here's my room for that yeah I'm not on the non lawyer I think if if you lie under oath I think the technical\nYou know the the ... punishment is lying under oath is perjury in many cases they don't go after it because it's not ... it may be important but it's not consequential this was hugely consequential boost could have literally\nChanged American history for the next decade so with our consequential result\nLying under oath in this case should absolutely be be prosecuted to the phones degree\nAlso we have to send that shot across the Democrat bell I'm looking at

concessions and prizes that ... once was lost parish annual bizarre tape or South Dakota Sunday October seventh\nWhat do you drive with Fred von only slightly less irritating in Sioux City constructions [noise]\nHonestly for\nTo the lord sources\nWill come back to the Lars Larson show it's a pleasure to be with\nYou on a First Amendment friday and I'm Glad to get your phone calls and emails in a bed at eight six six four three nine five to seven seven emails go to talk at Lars Larson dot com my next guest is a martial arts expert Navy SEAL and pedophiles worst nightmare ... lawyer joins me to talk\nIn America Greg good to have you want to thank you so much for your service for America [laughter] well\nIt was a pleasure and I appreciate you having me on last\nNight was always my pleasure to have you here but so tell me about a veterans for child rescue [laughter]\nWell it's a nonprofit organization that I founded\nA with my my daughter essentially my daughter last year in March of two thousand Seventeen was abducted at night point then brutally sexually assaulted for hours and Tucson, Arizona and a month later in April we officially found at veterans for child rescued try to make sure\nThat that didn't happen to to others\nAnd I I was learning all ready that there was a there was a widespread problem with child trafficking in the United states in ... uh but I've got a lot of contacts and colleagues that that could really helped me be instrumental in fighting this problem but rather than ...\nAddressed that as a kinetic problem like law enforcement by it I thought uh I could be a better health\nAlerting the populace to it and the best tool to do that to shake the American people awake and and and\nLet everybody know hey this is what's happening to our kids are is a documentary so we began filming a documentary and uh\nWe've got Eighteen months of filming now coast to coast or Southeast Asia down on the U.S border and we've been running sting operations with federal and local law enforcement\nInterviewing different witnesses and surviving victims of family and uh\nAll aspects of the state of crisis really to just try to empower the American people with the knowledge of what's happening to their kids with child trafficking because it is\nEstimated that at one hundred and fifty billion dollar industry there's an estimated five million children being bought and sold\nAs merchandise right now on the sex trade and that's something that it's not okay with me so that's what's that for ... rescue this it's an ... piece to to alert the American populace to empower us against it so that culturally we can put that to bed and a stand up against it\nTogether Greg Gunn so horrific inspiration for what happened I have to ask how is your daughter doing\nWell she's tough she's she's a fighter it was a horrifically um impactful against her obviously she had just turned Eighteen at the time [noise] and uh I'll I'll share one little Smith\nBut I'm yeah I'm not as you know to go beyond you know I mean I I don't want to dig too much but I mean we want to know how your daughter's doing so\nYeah but on the positive uh she has served as a tutor ... agent with us on a on a very large and powerful joins sting operation and she's been instrumental in helping put away several pedophiles child predators and she has stood there and watch them get and cost him put away\nSo that was very empowering for her and she said you know pop up that was more healing than any amount of counseling or anything else could have ever been so she's a fighter she's going to be okay and I think she's going to be an inspiration there to help the others you know ... it's just kind of how she was wired\nI think that somebody we ought to find a way I have some acquaintances and co workers who've who've been sexually assaulted and everyone reacts differently I Know women who don't ever want it mentioned again I Know women who will tell you exactly what happened you know because they believe that I think it helps give them some catharsis so\nPeople should not assume that when when someone has been the victim of a sexual assault that they that everyone reacts and saying that they they don't want to talk about it in some cases they do a and and being\nYou know hearing the story and all that helps them out as you said it did for\nFor your daughter many women and girls might not have had the strength to do with your daughter did to to live through that to recover from it and then to go out and help catch the bad guys uh that's that's an incredible shows strength and and I can't say enough good things about a young lady willing to do that\nWell you're right we do all rely react to things differently and sometimes it's a timing issue sometimes ah somebody may hibernate a bit with that with the pain and want to be quiet about it and then later in life there like you know what I'm doing okay be toilet or else by time\nTo speak out so uh whenever whenever\nI I support anybody's methods of dealing with it I mean I wouldn't want I wouldn't wish on anybody and I think that's why I'm so passionate about fighting it and just and turning our culture against it you know back in the Nineteen fifties there is a man named Alfred can see that falsified about sexual studies to make it sound like a\nPedophilia and child rape was somehow okay and he softened our laws to it a softened are psychological system and saw them down your educational system to a failure and fast forward three generations later we've got an epidemic\nOf child rape and I don't want that to happen to anybody so I think what we have got to do now is turning the culture back against that which has proven to be so harmful to children whose lungs are not yet fully developed they cannot advocate\nFor themselves against a fully grown creditor and we've got to defend the defense let's we've got to rally around our children and and defend them against these these harmful adult predators\nI'm Talking to ... a former special operators sniper for Navy SEAL team one and a founder of veterans for child rescue [laughter]\nWhat do you hope to show in the documentary to to bring attention to some part of this from were not aware of because we know there was a child sex trafficking uh you know practice in this country and we'd like to shut it down and it seemed amazing that a country like this has had such a tough time getting a handle on this\n[laughter] well it's a global problem and and for some reason it seems like it's being sucked crashed in the mainstream news media they won't tell us what's going on with it it it is the fastest growing criminal enterprise on earth so why are we the citizens not aimed to old\nBuried deliberately and very specifically what's going on so to answer your question what I what I intend to share with the American people is that which they need to know\nTo fight this epidemic that's happening to our children that they're not otherwise be tall literally just to walk the American people through the truth or whatever that may be\nTo show that different aspects of what is really going on with the kids so that we as citizens can understand the nature of the threat and and effectively defend our children accordingly\nYou know Craig I I don't know whether you're ... like do you get your take on an icy an awful lot of so called homeless people on the street now some of them are there for mental problems her mother for drug problems but I get the feeling that when a young man or woman or a young child who's under Eighteen\nSays I'm leaving my parents' house sometimes are leaving because of bad things that have happened sometimes are leaving\n'cause they don't like mom and dad's rules and when they started living on the streets it seems like that is the prime opportunity for these traffickers to get a hold of them and and uh and get a hold on them and and and start to prostitute done and that that seems like\nIt's something we could take care of if we stop making the assumption that well if you don't want to live with mom and dad\nA ... ... you know then you can go out and live on the streets and a lot of cities like it or not aid and abet people and living on the streets and they get in a way of returning those children either to their original household or\nTo a foster family but not tolerate them simply living in probably the most vulnerable spot they can live in on the streets without adults around\nVery astute observation you're absolutely right there are predators waiting\nFor a young a lot of ways waiting for the boys and girls can't say that that your son or daughter can go one way in the middle of night and go to a place to catch a cab homeless people hang out and not have heard of this\nYeah I think that's right so there's ... there's there's three groups I think of people that we that we should think about one is people with a criminal record you know employers have often been worried to hire those areas you know tens of millions of us as Americans with federal records has a\nBunch of those I think have struggled to find work those are slowly I think\nBeing brought it back into the labor force than there are people who've been unemployed for a long period of time that still over a million people some people have been unemployed for more than half a year hopefully those boats out five job\nAnd then there's the last group but I think that's it the great where where associate family play more people having to look at it the labor force for\nA quite a while or that they know about a million people you know we can bring all this to go back and then I think they'll have a hard situation really is that it\nHas been in the last fifty years ah you know I think right now the late nineties still look pretty good you know that it had higher labor costs station so not only the unemployment rate low but basically everyone was trying to fight for what we can get back to that then I'll be totally satisfied\nYeah we'll stand the limited throwing idea ... I was down in Dallas texas couple of years ago to two new broadcast for one of our stations\nAnd I saw a company who was advertising its services construction company but I think they called themselves con structure and they had a clever name and and on the rest of the banner they had on the side of a building it made it clear they would hire ex cons they would hire people with criminal records and why\nWell because you know while there may be some additional steps you have to take to make sure that if you hire somebody with a criminal record that your tools aren't going to disappear but once you've\nUh you know I've talked to plenty of callers to my show those said by a Democrat a felony record and I tell all my employers when I first got to work for him or her when I first interview I have this record on beyond it I've I've I've corrupted my behavior\nAnd I'm going to be a great employee for you and instead we have government's trying to ban you know even asking about criminal record I almost wish we could encourage people if you're gonna go straight and you're gonna straighten out your behavior\nThen we're we're happy to have you tell us that sort of as an employer you can take advantage of the skills that come with that person who may be a very good worker he wants to get past that but I don't want the government doing and I want a private employer and maybe somebody who says I'm going to start a construction company\nAnd I'm going to hire these people and I'm going to put them to work and I'm going to expect performance and I'm an expected they don't go back to a criminal behavior but other than that I'll pay him a good wage because then you got access to a whole crowd of people who may not be be accessed right now by conventional employers who just scream you out of the beginning so that makes sense\nThat makes total sense we we've started to see a little bit of that to for example Wal Mart which of course as a you know the the largest employer\nOf them all we get a million and a half and believes in the U.S that they've started you know trying to target a court records a little more they're recruiting efforts and you know hopefully it'll work out [noise]\nSo where can we go from here how low can go before the wages just start rising because employers find they can't get anybody to work for them because they don't ... you know bumped the wages up\nAnd I think first of all we'll we'll see if we can absorb those additional maybe two three million people on that happens I I think you start to see wage growth as long as you know of course the economy I keep growing right so if we if we suddenly at a recession we wouldn't see it but you know given all the fish still stimulus we've had\nFrom the from the tax cuts and try to\nStay out of the increase in spending I think the next couple\nOf years we should we should really start to see some ... at least in the long run you know if wages only keep increasing and we you know we develop new technology that build factories and better equipment and things like that so you know ultimately that's where we're at a wage growth is that it's going to have to come from that\nA requires an innovation to continue and people want to do things like that\nWell we got a break at a sacrament stand on that note you mentioned the tax cuts is not just income taxes it's instant expensing or rapid expensing of equipment so it used to be if you bought a new big piece of equipment to expand your capabilities uh comedy new ah excavator anew bulldozer or a new machine at your factory\nYou had to take the tax savings on it over\nTen or Fifteen or Twenty years now you can take 'em right away so there's a tremendous incentive\nFor companies go out and expand their capabilities\nStand I appreciate what'd you do with the guy and we always appreciate having on the program thanks for the time did I give evidence that stand ... who's a resident scholar he's also a

campaign and the DNC meeting with the FBI feeding in smear\nAgainst Donald Trump and that the FBI\nKnew this and still went to the fight to court for surveillance document a surveillance Warren on Carter Page that allowed it to spy on the Trump campaign and continue to spy on the Trump transition and continue to spy\nOn the Trump Administration I I don't want to go down the trail because we don't have all of it yet but this Jess Michael that what's going on in Washington right now is a complete collapse complete collapse of leadership total collapse\nWe see that in the cabinet hearings we see that in these allegations against Trump and now we see it in the possibility that the collusion was between the Obama administration and the FBI\nAnd the Clinton campaign that was the collusion so Michael the whole ... set a horse clearly writes about what is that what did they do do Michael where do they get leadership where where do we go to wait for Ulysses Grant the failed farmer how how\nHow do we come up with leaders we can trust\nWe come up with leaders like Ulysses S crash in the midst of\nThe battle for civil war but that ... or something but I'm the U.S found over new\nIn

that expected to rule forever on both sides get Kavanaugh is extremely well educated to be on that court by the Republican leadership right fine so and that leaves the culture owns waiting I guess

soon that it's going to be replacing workers that do this stuff and\nI think the biggest lesson is that you would think that lawyers are highly trained lawyers or you know you know construction guys

with big vision statements that they're able to tie different aspects of\nThe country together and to meet the commercial sector that the government to beg you know has a primary influence over there's also the military et cetera so uh one of the things that he's suggesting bound and suggesting is that or maybe it's time for the United states to begin\nTo match from a government funding perspective some of this research and development that we see coming out of China and also maybe to develop some of its own\nBig vision statements its own Manhattan projects a\nTowards some of these

have their users out of that and when you signed up to meet those names you're going to have more success and a few other areas and he also it was it was actually sort of interesting uh even though\nYou know uh it's it's now the Trump there he actually a structure very on Trump in court and talking about how are the most recent round of tax cuts is probably not going to be in line with a

go forward and future budget so\nHe wants are in the money he wants to now he doesn't want it in the future he wants it right away to even though the defense department is now lose again because of the budgeting DIA ... things at once more and in addition the controversy over remark that he makes and I agree with him immigration how does it work for and what does he want [noise]\nRight and this is also a something that right now you see a big\nA sort of pitched battle happening within the executive\nBranch and and really across government where you have a\nYou know within the executive branch voices like Stephen Miller that are looking to curb a not not only to deport undocumented immigrants by the hundreds of thousands but also to curb the amount of legal immigration that can take place and browns point as a you know\nThis economy or works great and it it serves the national security purpose when it becomes a magnet for a smart scholars and students from around the world to

that only to come and study but also potentially to start to make money and to really tie into the system so ... the one the best things that he advocates that the country as a whole and against that actually geared entirely towards the defense department it's really a holistic look at\nYou know how to begin this competition\nOne of the things he suggests as making it easier for folks to come to study it and and to stay or if they're these you know folks were especially working in these in these technological fields so that they can ... you know tied into the system and contribute a solutions to this\nThat that the H ... visas that silicon valley's talked about for years he wants more stem anyone said from everywhere and he wants to make it possible for them once they go through our

some surprising places and you can you can see how that's that that debate is is also shifting or with Miller himself moving more towards a\nA broader advocacy of what they're describing his merit based\nFat Stephen Miller works at the White House club yeah but the president on immigration yes so brown doesn't feel the doors been shot on him on in his face he thinks that there is that ... that dialogue [noise] right\nBut you know at the same time it or if you watch that perception if you look at the optics if you look at that that the rhetoric or that sort of surrounds this debate\nOr he's very clear that a ... and he used the word liberal immigration policy especially when it comes to uh people in the STEM fields that's what's going to serve as in his mind uh you know us national

G. M. P. certified lab which means current good manufacturing practices and this is an FDA mandated set of rules that we follow as a matter of fact just recently the FDA came in and did an infection and they said hey guys keep up the good work\nNow you mentioned earlier that there's a strong connection between vitamin D and diabetes talk a little bit about how your ... will be three formula could help folks that are dealing with diabetes or even at risk of getting diabetes\nWhile diabetes is a huge problem and in type two diabetic what we find is that there's plenty of insulin and the bodies but the insulin is not recognized by the south and so on vitamin D three does it taste that problem and it seems to fix it now\nThey've studied the vitamin D three ... prove this insulin sure by sixty percent and the comparison the most popular diabetic Dr improve the Thirteen percent\nWow now let me ask you this doctor bank is how can you fast smelled these three formula help boost your immune system\nVitamin D is responsible for two hundred different chemicals that your immune cells produce the fight off bacteria and viruses that says here's something on that susceptible to having any type of called ...

... to thirtieth gone\nWild and maybe you can share again for those that may have just joined us some of the responses that you get from people that had been taking your formula and what kind of results to be seen\nLet me tell you my own story so over the summer I didn't take as much you might do tree I was actually traveling and I ran out of it so what happened to me is basically a pain free but all of a sudden I started having pain in my hand I Know what is this\nThis is weird but then I realized that I had run out of the strange formula and I went off of it for several weeks and the minute I started going on and\nIt took about seven maybe eight days the pain went away wow crazy isn't it\nThat's how you know something's working right if you stop and the health issues come back well there's your answer\nThat's the best test that anyone can listen to especially if you're on the fence you go I Wonder if this is really for me and what I Would do it the next time you give up the number to have people orders is go ahead and order it I Know you\nAnd they try yourself and stay on it for five six weeks and then you're still doubt it then go off of it and see if anything gets worse\nAnd again folks that want to take a moment here to let you listeners know that if you want to try Dr ... says vitamin D three formula there is a special toll free number for you to call it's

seven zero to nine eight and I give it to you again it's one eight hundred for six seven zero to nine eight [noise]\nSo what do you think folks are you one of the Seventy percent of people listening most likely taking the wrong type of vitamin D supplements joining us today is our good friend Dr Michael ... and we've been talking about his fast melt vitamin D three formula\nAnd Dr biggest what you're saying is that most of us are deficient in vitamin D\nAnd because of that deficiency it's causing health issues like pain muscle weakness immune problems and the most vitamin D supplements are not the best form and more importantly is not the right amount of vitamin D to really make an impact is that what you're saying\nThat I'm saying it's a multifaceted problem where one for not getting enough vitamin D three in our system\nVitamin D the trees are responsible for activating two thousand different genes in the body controlling everything from diabetes to hormone production to\nMuscle strength heart beating correctly digestion immune system\nIt's a really long list and honestly surprised me because in medical school\nWe learned that vitamin D was necessary for the bombs we get enough being outside and in our milk and end of story right down for the first twenty some years I practice I never prescribe vitamin D I just didn't think it was necessary and then in the early to thousands\nOf the study started coming out and now there is over twenty three hundred studies\nThat just show that vitamin D is absolutely necessary it's not just a good idea it's absolutely necessary and it's a hormone that should be in the body and it's not there\nAnd you share some of that research Dr ... and more importantly what's the conclusion of the research related to vitamin D\nWell one of the biggest studies ever on vitamin D for from the U.S navy okay so I think\nIt was like a hundred and forty five thousand men and women were studied and they found that the number one and a non combat reason that people died in the navy was due to melanoma so skin cancer\nSo I'm reading this study you know I I kind of plot is right there and I went yeah makes sense you know people are out on the deck so shifts in the equator and all over the world and they're getting the harmful you know you're young raise and and they're developing skin cancer\nBut then I read on and it said most of the victims were office workers like clerks and people getting hangers on inside and I went home it was a link going back to vitamin D deficiency in the body\nWhat about muscle and bone stream ... three formula help with that\nYeah it's critical like if you're someone that's over fifty especially\nHere seeing a progression of the core muscles in your body is starting to slow down for us it's kind of a call on the thing is that people kind of feel like they're getting clumsy physically and then it's a lack of flexibility say you start to stiffen up and you feel at night especially if you're in bed\nWe're all in from side to side he'll wake up with your knees hurt in your legs are restless your shoulders hurt that said this in a setting in that's associated with a lack of vitamin D three my formula so here's someone listening right now and you're having a lot of the joint pain ball and pain muscle paying\nFive or my job I Would say on my formula like immediately and start taking one or two of my ... three's a day for the first week or two to get your doses up quickly\nSo let me ask you about these gummy vitamins does that work can you put enough vitamin D into a little gummy bear and is that the best way to get it in your body\nOf course Chris you know they'll go to any type of lengths to try to market thing that theme good but you're taking a lot of sugar and gelatin in wax and my thing is it's not what you what your body absorb\nWhen I Want to talk more about what happens when people start taking your fast smell the three formula\nBoy that's a really good question because the first area that vitamin D seems to affect your energy\nYour sleep your outlook your mood and then after being on it for a while here core strengths will come back so for those who have slowed down you're going to feel more energy like physically so it's kind of like the only in a little bit younger Christ\nAnd who wouldn't want that right and maybe you can share again for those that may have just joined us some of the responses that you get from people that had been taking your formula and what kind of results are basing\nProtected speech for believing Fifteen mile an hour which

CBS News New York\nIt's not a good time to answer the phones on Capitol Hill Haley bird at the Weekly Standard knows why Haley joins me on the line Haley has been an onslaught of calls to Congress what's going on and just so busy or the phone lines\nSo a lot of officers keep track of how many calls they get a per week usually depending on the topics that Congress has addressing so in the Senate right now predictably you have\nA lot of calls to key senators about a judge cabinet and um it it's just a lot of activism going on that it it's questionable how effective it is\nBut my colleague Tony ... and I recently wrote a story about a transfer calling and patch through calls which is another form of advocacy that different groups use\nIts it's widespread on Capitol Hill and so some of these are all are coming through this week\nIs that a new tactic can you explain that\nSo it's not new it's been around for a few years but a few staffers told us on calls in general have gone up since Trump was elected and had health care\nWhich was really a tense time on Capitol Hill with a lot of activism so a lot of these issues this sort of advocacy has become more widespread staffers take\nIssue with it because they say that it doesn't represent constituent fairly um because you know basically advocacy groups are recruiting constituents and then passing them through to their congressmen if they agree with them on a subject\nCan you give me a sense of how inundated Congress is right now with these calls and do you have a an idea of how well they're keeping up\nSo it's sort of tough to say because a lot of this data isn't public I've heard from some staffers but it's very similar to health care which was just a very hectic time it's but putting a number on it it's really difficult\nAnd usually it's I I assume low level staffers are taking these these phone calls at first\nYeah so these are like twenty two to twenty four year olds most of them who take these phone calls\nI'm which can be stressful for them because you know you'd have Susan Collins is office saying that a lot of their female staffers have been threatened with rape and things like that in in light of the Capitol hearing a lot of violent threats do happen on these phone calls and the staffers\nOr just have to keep up the professional demeanor um when when speaking to the east constituents and it depends on what they're actually\nUh the colors are living in the state or not um because senators don't really take into account if it's an out of state color because they want to cater to the people who actually live where they are is that\nWhat you're seeing a more organized attempt at a uh these day losers of phone calls\nSure and one thing that we noticed in reporting this story I thought it really happens for a lot of leash political issues\nLike I said net neutrality um appropriations bills where basically an organization will like a hell of a telemarketer situation happened where they will call up the constituent and say hey how you feel about duck you think that these immigrants should stay here\nUm what do you think and then the person on the other end of the line will say something easily they're confused\nI'm at which point the tele marketer will pass them through the to their member of Congress and confusion I Would say is one of the key give away its per congressional staffers here because the constituent on the other end of the wind doesn't really know what's happening a lot of the time\nAll they know that they were called the\nThe conversation oftentimes goes a little bit like hello\nAnd and the staff are on the other side is high you've reached the ... the congressman's office um do you need anything and then the constituent says no you called me and so that sort of ... that sort of confusion really gives away his staffers that this is\nNot as authentic as it with like like the advocacy groups would like for them to think it is\nUm other times you know the constituents actually just outright say you know I was told to tell you that\nAnd I actually think that um one one staffer told me that they had gotten a call one of these pass through cause we're at a constituent had been told to tell them to oppose tax cuts back in the winter\nUp in the constituent said you know they told me to tell you I don't like tax cuts but I Do

last\nSaturday here we have a\nLittle background here we have a window unit at the Aspen back there I\nFeeling fat and all of a half [noise] and the back of the house like that does that route and we have one day our floors are starting to ...\nBy ...\nLooks out much like a wave\nLately I see the pictures here now I Know to the IRS that you're sandwiches are always very helpful in a great that that does seem quite know what I'm looking at us see as if it's the same there that there's a where you budgeted up to to another piece of plywood right\nOkay All right good last quarter and which I now my sense but it's what we like\nQuarter and hard work\nAnd when he got a very good brand of Collyer and saying get for a week they were accurately dry never wet damp down the picture I did and I noticed that pictures right at the same are happening in other parts of her image loud\nSound when you put the quarter inch plywood down you put it over another type of material um why would or some some other type of plywood that was your floor and you put this down basically as you're finished for correct\nOkay did you glue it down or just a nail it screw it how did you attach it nailed it\nOkay All right [noise] well I'll tell you it it it's it it appears for some reason that the veneer of that plywood is um is rippling I'm Joe I'm no water causes that but do you think it could possibly just happen over time\nYeah Sharon that's one of the question is I was going to ask can these photographs I couldn't quite tell or these ripples blisters or bubbles that are in the near the top or near the plywood or do you think they're just in the finish DePaul your thing finish because they do look like they're blisters\nThey're not just didn't have an ear I understand what you mean that would be much to flaky\nIs just highly here and\nHe would just be a if it was if it was it the if the veneer was blistering if the ... the would be laminated bull free from the core of the plywood they would blister up like I'd like air underneath it um\nBut these look like ripples almost I'm like in vertical lines but I wasn't sure if there was just in the ... if it's just been finished you know that would be an easy repair you could stand it you know very lightly and\nLooks like just a skinny white looked like just the skin of plywood this lifting up just a little bit and um if that's the case I'm assuming he probably still have a little bit of the stain laugh that you had before\nWe do that I'm gonna let me try this little monkey ranch on Iran I understand what you mean by that lifting up uh-huh I'm not the most tactical Carson I learned a lot doing this house that um when you walk across town mayor is feel almost like there's an air pocket\nUh-huh that's probably what it is certainly\nNow share and but one thing I probably would have recommended back priming the plywood what you meant painting or varnish and you're doing some of the underside prevent moisture for coming through 'cause that might be part of the problem\n[noise] ... and ... and of course of course glue helps a lot to you know in that same thing but as it is right now um I think the best thing for you to do is to be able to re nail in any of these areas that may feel like it has some pockets under it then scraping any of the loose material off\nThen maybe a little bit of Sandy narrow long there and then put you're saying you know re stain it and then you're able to polyurethane it back over just in that one small area and I should be in pretty good shape\nOkay monkey ranch and now I Will let you get the next caller is saying the air from the cold air conditioner factory floors\nAre probably not because your air conditioning actually is designed to\nPoll that air ... um the the humidity out of the house so that should really be helping but when you have window units a lot of times those units cycle on and off\nAnd really don't lower the humidity as much as possible and this would be you know you made it so you wouldn't generally calls an isolated issue like that that would be more of you know direct water getting on it but air conditioners your friend in this situation and pulled the humidity out\nThank you ...

I our our view doing fall we're doing we're\nDoing great thanks doing we're doing great to understand you've got the old humidity issue flaring up on you\nGuess are we just checked it it's a two different parts of the house I'm a sixty one percent and sixty percent seems high yeah that's why\nYeah well it is it is a little hot it's not as bad as it could be certainly but you you you love to drive it down below fifty percent probably forty percent is considered the what's um ideal but sometimes it's hard to maintain that but um [noise] um [noise] how 'bout the exhaust\nFans will get plenty of exhaust fans going on in those bathrooms were using those and that is pushing that air all the way to the outside\n[noise] um actually it's pushing it up to the addict we don't have a we don't have it out through the roof\nOkay everybody hates to put another hole in the roof found but boy is it important to get it out of their cars that humidity hanging in the attic um\nIf it doesn't have a really good way of moving that air out um is going to really affect your living area I mean it's not like is going to drift down through the ceiling but certainly can cause condensation and just contributing the humidity too too that um do you have air conditioning\nYes we have central air and we have a insulation up to its over forty four\n... good good\nOkay I'm going to tell you the truth is that seems strange but that actually could be contributing\nTo the um increase humidity in the house now that doesn't mean you need to take any insulation away that's good but just a lot of times when you have that blanket of insulation again which is the way to go it just may cause more of a need for air to be moved out of the living area\nAnd exhausted so you know using the bathroom fan and I would recommend going ahead and in routing it through in the most direct route you can ah through the roof\nAnd of course for me if you're not comfortable getting on the roof don't get on the roof get a roof or to drop by and take care of it for you\nAnd that will ensure that you're getting that you know surge of of humidity in moisture out of the house a same with the um the arranged

he's White Houses I bought houses\nWhere it says die if all the conditions been mad and you bailout you lose your deposit so like I I don't know how many deals your ah your your neighbor escrow your neighbor real estate agents being in ... but no yeah that that money has lost\nFor sure Hey Daniel here up we're going to do for you\n[laughter] um I had reached out to me and asked to give you my credit card or a hotel room it was overseeing the more I ate my friend the credit card number I contact me right about that hey I'd like to write the charge for anywhere opposite you know the dollars\nBut you can do a maximum of five hundred dollar and said I read it provides a credit card number two days later I when I log on my on my credit card account and noticed that there was eight ending for forty five hundred dollar by neatly contacted the credit card company that hey look\nYou know ... my hundred dollars and not getting charged for forty five hungry at that age they said look you know that that was on the Indian lie to bang however wanted to ask you won't be level and that's why when all the new one the most and it was for over a thousand dollars\nShe quickly what ... days later I logged back into my buy online account and there was another man in charge of the day motel her seven thousand dollar British out all the credit card company again and said hey look there are they any larger thousand dollars\nIs a being use right now I only all burned up my hundred dollar which there was already voted him out for over them and they said to me that you know there's nothing we can do with it and in charge then what did your bender is already charred heart was taken many times they want\nAnd at the end of the day there was over a thousand dollars\nAnd you're spent twelve thousand dollars at one hotel for a while but yeah there was a ... there was a friend of yours brilliant\nExactly my question to you is that when I reach out to the credit card company or get providing right around the credit card number and they gave me the or the or the twenty five hundred dollars are in charge and then later don't walk out or job do I have a record\nYeah you do and here's the problem you're going to have though and daddy is uh they're simply going to deny it oh we didn't see that or a policy doesn't let us to do that and I wish you and sent an email or to the credit card company but I don't know how many people would actually do that because you know your friend you didn't know your friend was the the\nUh you to come for their word and so I I'm not I'm not going to call you in any down this one because I think a lot of people would have done the same thing I I probably would have done the same thing\nSo you're in your age your tire issue is that the credit card company I told you that you're only liable to twenty five hundred dollars that's all they're gonna charge and then you started arguing the dispute everything right down the line now and I'm Sorry go ahead\nBy taking those dams and these are his and through their own accord investigation they come back and said you know what we're going to stand by those are good you are held liable\nWhen did they what did they say about the twenty five hundred dollar limit conversation\nWhen I when I got that way it was presented by quickly like several conversations with different wraps and quite a climate change in the company one of them said oh you know it's unfortunate that that is representative made a mistake when she died only up to twenty five hundred dollars but you know what it's mistake\nPlease come it's Harlem at stake and it doesn't matter they she works for a promise said come on give me a break on that one now or is there any record in your file that says twenty five hundred dollars all limits have you talked to anybody to look at the note\nThat they got to look at the no ... on this now I said look obviously all your all your phone conversation got record it and I you know I read one of the land her then she acknowledged that there were several conversation that she went back and let them know\nThat can tell that I had er here on the phone call as you can understand what nonetheless her paycheck also come from this comedy\nBombs are hearing all the recording thing that's all and so I received a letter from asked if I could have a copy of those recordings that obviously the\nRight but I received a letter in the mail saying that there were conversations only or different days and so we documented on their\nRyan seemed so what's going to happen is going to turn over the collections you're going to disputed\nAnd at that point unfortunately I'm you're going to win that you just tell them to sue me going out and assuming a and we'll talk about this I Will later on what you have to worry about is your um is your credit\n[laughter] hey\nWait a minute have you gone over the twenty five hundred dollars\n[noise] [noise] right right and then\nHere's here's the only advice you grow up as far as you can on the food chain\nI and die if you've done that and just keep on going over and over again find out who the vice president is in terms of stupid employees or that put a lot more on credit cards and they should there ... there are certainly a vice president does that somewhere in the system and at the same time I had the collection well once you uh\nWould cancel the card\nAnd and just get right into it and say hey because what's happening is you're paying interest on the entire amount\nAnd you're going you know place and that's just stupid to pay interest on twelve thousand dollars when I was twenty five hundred dollars so I you just I Would stop paying let him know you're stopping a payment based on this you're disputing I'm assuming you're turning over the collections I Will be fighting that\nAnd there will be legal action taken if you're being my credit and if you try to collect that simple and then I Would call and you may even want to go to a lawyer a collection lawyer a dead a political was uh yeah just collections lawyer and die and by an hour of time or just ask\nA is am I doing everything right and what we are I mean I don't know anywhere anywhere else\nTo go I mean you're fighting credit card companies and credit reporting agencies and it is such a drag\nIs handle on the law\nCyber

chip the size of a grain of rice\nThat was posing as a you know minor a support ship on mother boards but that in fact would phone home as soon as it got on the Internet and allow the Chinese spies I guess to modify the operating system on these systems\nThe mother boards were made according to Bloomberg uses all according to Bloomberg Businessweek by super Mike Rowe and used in servers by many companies including\nApple Amazon in fact we even had one of the supposedly hacks servers in our studio because the ... the\nWhat can you needed to see those areas and calories and you know in day out

I point this out is that one of the theories is if the government said well you must tonight is you have no choice this is classified information and you have to just say no you have to just lie now these are ...\nBy the way these are very detailed lights from both apple and Amazon they go on and on and on never return we didn't no no no\n[noise] um\nBecause but this is this in here in this part I don't because elemental appliances are not designed to be exposed to the public Internet our customers are protected against this roller Billy by default is actually true\nI'm going to stop on this one but it but it's it's uh you you chew on that Alex and see is there any way that that I guess it depends on the east coast but we put hours on the public in her that I hate to say\nWe don't control it on the public Internet we have a private dashboard to it but that doesn't mean a chip the whole point being that if you put a chip on the mother board in here that have been out on the public Internet and connected with Chinese servers to download software modify the operating system that could absolutely happened it's connected [noise]\nApple says we have never found malicious tips hardware manipulations vulnerabilities personal seed planted in any server\n... apple never had any contact with the FBI or any agency about such an incident we are not aware of any investigation by the FBI nor are contacts and law enforcement that's a pretty complete denial\nSo how did what happened Bloomberg really get it wrong eighty eight eighty eight ask clear with a mystery it's uh I like mysteries about particularly about getting hacked by the Chinese but I like mysteries Kim Schaffer hello morning\nI'm just one of the war and you you might have one of those super micro mother boards or somewhere in there because I think we've purchased a few of them are time I want to find one that's not service so we can\nLook I'm trying to get a part to keep your eye you know I guess we can take ourselves off line for a little bit\nThat would be pretty hard here [laughter] I wouldn't be unhappy [laughter]\nPlus I don't you know I mean who knows I don't know [laughter] so how do you want to start with your favorite favorite topics sure look\nTiming how I'm going to be locked out of his time wanting his two factor authentication and he's saying he never turn that on a now why he's locked out okay I'll tell them all about right\nThanks you Kim Schaffer hello Tom good to talk to you welcome\nTo talk to you listen to you every weekend really haven't had any call until now\nWell I'm Glad you called [laughter] so one week ago last friday\nYeah they get half\nA while they admitted to having been hacked\nBy a somebody who figured out a clever way to steal people's accounts and that they sold their accounts by ... by basically stealing this little cookie this token that Facebook's you know when you log in Facebook you only have to log in for one and then it stays logged in\nThe way that works is when you log into Facebook stores this little piece of information your hard drive it's unique to you\nThat said yeah that Tom let's go Tom from cars to California letter man than this hack or allow bad guys to grab that little piece of information and use it for themselves so what Facebook did when they found is is it the activated Ninety million users\nA week ago friday now is that about when you were unable to log in\nYes actually it's my wife's account I can still log in them\nSo she was one of the Ninety million you weren't\nYeah yeah yeah 'cause I Am very judicious about every thing\nWell I didn't have anything to do with how judicious you are that's what's scary about ... like this is you can be perfectly good and still ah have your Facebook account stone and this and we believe that uh actually one of my producers had as a cow stolen or some months ago and now we believe that's how it happened so [noise]\nAh the way Facebook fixes it is by the activating that cookie and by the way that would also log you out of anything you used Facebook to log into you know you can use face right log into a lot of other stuff so she probably noticed that as well\n[noise] well ... like me I'm each each thing like Instagram and that sort of thing yeah each one we don't log in from Facebook we use individual August\nThat smart yeah turns out that was a new are good that was a very smart thing to do because\nIf they got that token and you could use that token the log into other sites fray they'd be able to log in to you now\nThey do you have to re log in and now you're they're saying hey we we what your second factor normally would that would be as a text message sent to your cell phone or another Facebook instance that you could use the code from because there's a code generator in the Facebook app\nFlight we we've been down that path um [noise] of course we can get into her account she only logs in the face but from one thing yeah\nBut you know the truth is even if you have on the phone and they would have been logged out too so [laughter] right right code generate isn't gonna help you\nAnd I tried for line and generated a code\nAnd oh it's different yeah that I knew that but to try it yeah\nNo of course you you we must use every outlet so does it at some point in their say well I don't have access I Know it does can't do it that way what else can you do and then at some point you say well we have a phone number on record for you or does it not\nWell she didn't die but needless to say I have gone in and put one in mind just\nLike yeah by the way for yeah by the way we've also learned that Facebook once you put that phone number in their uses it to sell ads against just so thank you Facebook what a nightmare Facebook has turned out to be here but you have to use the word black male into this\nSo it sounds to me like she's going to have to contact Facebook and extend say look I Can't and a number of people have had to\nDo this and then they'll make you jump through hoops Facebook was the only one that\nGot ... here I mean literally and we're going to answer the question\nYeah she's your grandparents parents and you grew\nListening to the big friends of your big family five Seventy ... than I\nThought well the deer corny merges spring and what can you do to make next year's crop perform even better time

side of the screen it filled looks full color or so there's two laser I was really impressed with I thought it was it was much\nBetter it looks really good it does it uh so basically you you still you have this red laser that produces a red light blue laser still hits a yellow phosphorus from which green is extracted so you still get red green and blue\nAnd uh but you get better reds get certainly get better read right at risk for example the YouTube a logo or the Netflix logo which is red\nMan that red ... wow I noticed you turned the red down a little bit we did [laughter] down and read it because I was watching the calibrated version the strawberries just didn't pop quite so much and then I went to visit oh well\nIf it's setting yeah varies pop yeah ... but of course you know me I'm more into accuracy yeah than I Am into you know ultimate knock you over the head yeah you know I mean it's choice you get your choice exactly but the calibrated image looks quite good point about the color rendition was real yeah yeah yeah yeah it is now eat labels\nItself as a for K. high dynamic range ... which uh every set soul debate now be at and what my mom news the new t._v. set I bought her a D.C ... fifty five inches ... for ... for three and a twenty seven dollar yeah [laughter]\nIt's kind of wild what's going on and the prices are just falling ... this project or TV is not a budget item no ten ... ten\nThousand dollars exactly but when as we were mentioning earlier you take a look at a hundred in she if you could buy a hundred inch LCD or ... or something like that it will be way more than that yeah so you know you're getting you're getting a good deal there in that sense\nThis t._v. is best at bright images the one thing that deal pie is inherently not good at is black level and high contrast and so we watched\nSo ... that's what H.

can simply a great click the uh the uh ... application I kind of run as a minister just to see if it fixes it\nYou may have corrupted\nFiles you may have corrupted file system you may have a hard drive that has some issues and the software itself may be um\n... maybe a damaged so might be an interesting idea to re install or just to make sure it's not that so there's a there's a few things [laughter]\nA of a handful of things among the probably hundreds that could have gone wrong this is the problem we have these operating\nSystems we use today are so hideously complex that things can go wrong in so many different places it's not always easy to figure out what's happening with certain amount of I think there's a certain amount of intuition that goes into solving problems like this and that that intuition is built up over years of solving problems like this\nI mean Microsoft's own issues I mean it seems to me maybe I'm a maybe I'm asking too much seems to me that if you make an operating system and uh\nAnd you've tested for six months with millions of people\nUh you would you would not have a problem that it deletes hundreds of gigabytes of files when it gets updated\nBut that's that's a problem stuff's so complicated windows runs on so many different kinds of hardware\nI'm very curious to find out what it is that caused this book I don't know if we'll ever know sometimes Microsoft cagey about they don't like to talk about problems\nSo it may be that or maybe they mentioned but I'd like to know\nWhy would why would an installer upgrading an operating system just routinely go into your documents folder and delete stuff\nShouldn't happen [laughter] [laughter]\nThat should be should be able to write files in camp teachers should be able to write files or you know they have in the past what's really weird is\nThat you said that it doesn't work try again and it does or your ... and it does that's really weird\nI almost always and I should probably be so way but I almost always suspect the hard drive in cases like that and the reason I Do and the reason I mentioned in his heart tribes are usually the first thing they have problems on a system\nAh because in in you know a lot of the older system that's moving part those drives you know they're spinning\nThousands of revolutions of minute to get hot or cold is they've turned off and they get hot again which means expand and contract it's actually amazing that hard drives work at all\nSolid state drives people were very worried about the cell is straight flash memory base drives that they wouldn't be as robust as spinning hard drives which now as if you think about it seems laughable [laughter] 'cause they're much more robust we just we\nThey have any experience we're ... we're afraid they would wear out prematurely\nBut uh I don't think that's the case so\nAnother great fix for this kind of thing is to replace that spinning Dr fed older spinning drive with a new thoughts they drive used to be they were very very ... the prices have\nGone down there not quite as inexpensive it's spinning drives could spread all over the last\nFind you in a line from WBFO\n... and we will never fully understand what we've asked of our military service members of their families or their children are asking them to deploy\nI mean you're smart because that what you control it you can't you know you have no idea what these what these other social media giants are going to do is they're gonna uh don't\nLike them that's all I mean honestly it's easier for my friends 'cause they just haven't Instagram account and follow everybody they want to see\nAnd maybe they'll see my pictures maybe not but you know there's all the other stuff in there I understand why use Facebook or Instagram but I just don't like these companies I don't have a great tool for business especially when I'm In no you got to the ... you know you got it but um I can understand why people are worried
