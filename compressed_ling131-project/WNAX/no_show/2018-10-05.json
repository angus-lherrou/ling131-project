Center for legal and judicial studies would heritage during some good to have you back on the program thanks for having me to do the police need the ability to be able either shoot down or bring down drones if they end up being used not just by terrorists but by ordinary criminals as well\nBut the uh the answer that question is absolutely yes uh you know we are on the cusp of really I think a revolution and what Germans are going to be able to do in terms of productive and positive things for society we're talking about engaging in life saving activities that can bring a emergency medical equipment to the scene of an accident\nAnd minutes or helping to find someone who is lost in the community [noise] neither uses the drones are being at the two right now and I think we're going to see a lot of that but we also see that uh you know as\nWith any new technology there is also a potential for misuse and abuse and there have certainly been a fair number of cases in just the last few months where drones are being put to a to novel criminal or or even terrorists purposes and law enforcement uh unfortunately does not have\nPresently the ability to do much if anything to stop the season\nBefore we go to the ability to bring him down can you give us a couple of examples about crooks have been using them\nShore so really what we're seeing is that criminals are at least that innovative when it comes to to finding new uses for drugs as entrepreneurs and innovators of the commercial side uh we've we've looked at some of the instances at a at heritage what we were doing research on this and I was quite frankly\nFloored by by how drawn to be used we've seen cases where\nA a you know common burglars are using drones to uh to case houses before they break and we've seen instances where drones are being used essentially to serve as\nBy the will of criminal Airforce actually surveilling the law enforcement personnel who are attempting to a Surveillance Act\nAgainst organized crime\nOr and then of course it just last couple of months we've seen how drones can be used it in a terrorist attempt or when you look at the Venezuela instance a incident excuse me a where allegedly there was an assassination attempt on the president of Venezuela and it was too drones armed with explosives that we're going to be the instruments for that assassination attempt\nTo really it runs it runs the gamut but then there are also just cases where people are flying a nickel gently or recklessly and there are a number of instances where drones have been observed\nIn the flight line the airports and in fact you can go on YouTube and see a really impressive but clearly dangerous videos of drones just a few feet above a man jetliner coming in for a landing\nI'm trying to remember I thought I heard about it maybe it was just one somebody imagining what they could be used for but you know that getting contraband inside of prisons has been a big business has literally\nCan amount to millions of dollars whether it's drugs or weapons or those kinds of things and I'm Wondering whether people have tried to use that I Can't remember a specific example where that's been done but I Would love to give the authorities the ability to bring drones like that down if they see one flying over and dropping contraband inside the walls\n[laughter] the right that's a very real problem and in fact there there are some specific examples that come to mind or just a thing as has happened in a correctional facility in Ohio for example\nA a drone was used to smuggle contraband into the prison there apparently it was a accidently drop in the wrong location it wound up in the hands of the wrong a\nPrison gang within the prison walls and sparked a Seventy five and may ball or in another instance\nA prisoner was able to use tools that appear to have been smuggled in by drawn to escape in a maximum security prison and then at the southern border uh not not a prison context but we see what our would have been duck Marco drugs that are being used to ferry drugs from Mexico into the United states\nOver the head of a border patrol agents who are just unfortunately powerless to do much beyond tracking those drugs to actually interdict up\nTo and things like that we should we have ... if we don't already home from the military or the ability to electronically knock these things out of the year should we allow law enforcement latitude to shoot them out of the year of ...\n[laughter] yes what we're talking about now is how to empower law enforcement agencies to engage in what's known as countered drawn a operations and\nCounter drone operations there they they run the gamut from a merely using what's known as an unmanned traffic management system essentially air traffic control for drones\nTo restrict access to particular areas I'm so that drone cannot fly into the airspace above ... Super Bowl or near an airport all the way to kinetic devices like or even just a plain old firearm\nTo shoot down of drone there are a lot of open questions about exactly what the order of operations will be if you will in terms of identifying drones that are posing a threat to public safety\nWarning the operator and then what sort of tools or techniques will be able to properly engage those because as you might imagine if you're dealing with a\nA true terrorist and spent the last thing I think you would want to do is shoot down on drone which might be carrying an explosive device because then of course you create a hazard to the people on the ground but what we have right now is federal legislation that has just been sent to the White House the FAA reauthorization that will for the first time and power federal law enforcement\nTo engage in kind of drone activities which to date have been barred\nWell and he's one of the big problems with the fact that these things are largely made a plastic they're not made out of ... models which means that it's going to be tough to spot them unless you can spot them visually and since they're small they're not easy to spot visually from from any kind of distance\nThat's one of the problems are as actually being able to detect a drone at any reasonable distance because even though these fly at a considerably slower speed typically the manned aircraft are\nThey still fly pretty fast and so you have to be able to id them several miles away from a potential target so that you can have any reasonable amount of time to be able to do the threat assessment to identify the drone and then trigger any counter measures\nAnd so that is certainly one of the challenges that being said\nUh you know in the ... the the mother of invention and there are a fair number of private sector companies right now that are developing and bringing to market exactly these sorts of technology\nAnd we're we're looking at optical cameras were looking at a at radar and you know other people are looking actually at a a audio equipment they can actually detect the buzzing sound of drugs\nAnd then you have to be able to identify what kinds of droned trace the signals to the extent that it's not an automated drone so that you can identify the individual user\nThese are all challenges that will need to be a that would need to be dealt with and resolve in the near future\nYou know drinks in a few ... about Thirty years ago it was on board a coast guard airplane and we were just shooting a story for television\nAbout how they did search and rescue and I got a call up to trace the guy who thought was running drugs it turns out he was and he was in a twin engine aircraft which is a pretty good size aircraft\nAnd they gave chase and the guy knew they were chasing them and we were in a drought slower speed judgment of Journal of the same of falcon\nAnd this guy kept dropping down below us and then would try to turn the other direction and I asked the pilots afterwards I said at what point do you lose sight of this guy if he manages to go east when we're going west before we can turn around you\nFour miles out it's really hard to see him and that's a full sized aircraft\nOr take it down from full size to the size of a drone one big enough to carry say let's say a couple of pounds of explosive\nAnd all of a sudden your ear ability to see them at any distance may go from four miles to you know half a mile for tens of a mile because it it was amazing to me that we look and say I know the guys out there but try to spot him in the sky from another aircraft\nThat we've taken to calling regulatory dark matter that pours out it's not supposed to be binding however if you disobey it you may not get your permit you may not get your waiver so there's a lot of bureaucratic pressure that can come there\nWe recommended that the Trump do an executive order kind of like Reagan's executive order\nThat requires the cost benefit analysis that we have now for normal rules but the Trump address these guidance documents\n'cause he's pretty much pick the low hanging fruit as far as the two for one regulations right you would imagine that you know he's looked at\nYou know there's a congressional Review Act got rid of Obama's midnight role but then he's done some two for one of ... of all the uh the rules that are out there but you kind of you kind of run run to the end of that for the next thing you should do I think it was addressed guy that said there's been a lot of significant done at the bathroom and all those guide and\nI was gonna say I was going to bring them or not yeah Wayne ... like my audience manageable in fact that you know the rule that said the bathrooms in both colleges in public schools had to be open so that a\nA biological boy who now claims she's a girl can use the ladies' room and and that's that was deeply disturbing for a lot of people they said that any ride and yet he didn't come out of even a regulation and came out of a guy who got it\nWill just quickly the interesting thing on that law says he got rid of that but he didn't count it didn't credit himself into two for one also the department of labor got rid of a role in front of a guidance on franchising but Obama had\nDidn't count credit himself for that they got rid of rule on independent contracting that was going to cause additional regulatory burdens for up for independent contractors didn't count that in favor in his two for one cross to\nThere's other guy that you mentioned the as the state that you know there will be\nTremendous guidance coming out of net neutrality rules that's been rolled back now you also got it's to me is a sense they can sense the beer bureaucracy can regulate now without writing anything down I think it's important that Trump\nUse it to create an executive order with the same kind of legacy and sticky power that Reagan's executive order on cost benefit analysis\nHas for guidance documents and I think after the pen and phone era that's an important thing to do especially if we you know we're going to have new elections or going to have democratic presidents again we need to have something in place\nThat discloses makes transparent transparent and tries to make an effort to roll back the abuse of guidance documents or regular\nDog Wayne let me do a deep dive just a little bit I mean into the wee bit\nAnd here's what I Want to know I can understand why the the regular regulation process is deliberately slowed that is it takes a long time to adopt a rag but once again it takes a long time to get rid of it and I understand that because it because anyone rag\nMay have a big effect on industries on people on businesses and everything else you don't want to see um whipped sawed\nBut I guess I Wonder as we've gone from a much slower age to now an age where\nThings change dramatically and they change very very fast\nDoes government need to have the ability to come up to speed quickly so when you see a problem and say this problem is exacerbated by this rule we need to get rid of this quickly that there's that ability without putting people in a you know if you go out and say hey coal industry animal\nOut all these I don't drink and then to you know six months later you go no forget to take all that filtering back out or or any industry the banking industry you got to have everybody sign this form no forget about that don't do it I understand the ... factor\nBut is there a way to quickly respond when either the private sector or the government sees something that's a problem and they realized the only way to fix it does get rid of that rule oh I'm Sorry that's a very long involved process senator we won't be able to do that what can we do to balance those two names\nRight well as you know and as they say the constitution isn't perfect but it's better than what we have now the problem we have with this administrative state is that you do have these unelected agencies that are making those rules and the first place [laughter] what a lot of proposals are and there's legislation to do this and the house has passed that that\nI I guess I guess it's the talk that regulation ... you know the house has done its job at several regulatory reform bill the Senate in this environment you can't even begin to get anything for it but what you have to do is win or lose complicated but win or lose costly Congress needs to approve that rule\nIt's the only thing that is going to be able to give the certainty\nThat the businesses need you know they also said there's a lot of regulatory uncertainty but sometimes just certainty regulate it and we were having a heck of a time where we're decades neutrality rules so you got to have a law making is going to take place and especially in frontier sectors that are changing so fast\nLike Charles draw those cars and ... artificial intelligence at cyber security you've got to have Congress may clear rules we can't have ... an agent you believe\nThat no we can't Wayne thank you very much Wayne cruises\nThe vice president for policy at the Competitive Enterprise is the author of ten thousand commandments an

well\nI'm not sure we need to get rid of it altogether but I mean certainly should be reined in but is there a way that we can get by without a a bank of last resort in the form of the Federal Reserve because I'd love to get to a private sector solution to that\n[noise] oh yeah well without question or the fed exists as a lender of last resort as you just put it but what can't be stressed enough is that it's unheard of\nFor a solvent bank to ever go to the fed for a loan biggest to do so his mission of bankruptcy and what that means the federal leagues is to loan to insolvent banks which is not what it's supposed to do so we don't need it for that the feds also bank regulator\nBut if you're a bank regulator that usually means you couldn't get a job at a real bad\nAs we saw two thousand eight a sad sad had no clue about the problems within banks and so it can't do a good job there and then it aims to target the overnight rate which banks lend to one another\nYou know and interest rates are price like any other you don't need the sad for that so I think this notion that the fed served some useful in central purpose is easy to disapprove we could get rid of it and most wouldn't notice it at all\nIn fact I don't particularly like the fact that they regulate the interest rate that they're not that the federal government views them as a way to win the economy starts to heat up\nThat the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates artificially outside of market forces and say we need to cool down and in theory there the the folks that when the economy cools down and we don't want it to be too cold that they come in and say well we'll drop interest rates artificially\nTo try to pump it back up again I don't like that either even though I'm I'm well aware of the positive effects that has for some people I think it's a terrible I Would rather have the price be like the price of gasoline or the price of oil or the price of any other commodity because really at the end of the day money's just another commodity isn't it\nYeah yeah absolutely and and what ... what should be stressed there is the\nIs that the fed can't really alter the price of credit or why do we borrow money we borrow money because it can be exchanged for real resources like trucks tractors computers desk chairs\nBuildings or labor most specifically and so it's a reminder that we create the credit we create the resources that people are looking to borrow and they borrow money and so this idea that the fed can just decree the cost of credit cheap is as silly as\nThe mayor of Portland saying okay the top of mount that you can charge for a apartment rentals in Portland is a hundred dollars a month\nOkay well demand for for those rentals would be high but supply it would be non existent this said can't decree resources cheap so I think even there we give the fed way too much credit this idea that it can speed up the economy and slow it down I don't take very seriously\nSo is there an and I don't either because you know all the way through from away when the initial you know we fell off the edge of the ... of\nAll the way to June of oh nine when virtually the recession was over I like to remind people of that because they want to credit Obama with fixing be uh you know the the recession and I say really\nHe fixed it between January twenty up in the middle of June that's pretty amazing you didn't have time to do anything what did he do exactly and they say well you know you fix the economy well he didn't\nBut their idea was will drop the interest rates low enough to zero or or even below zero so that will pump the economy back up again clearly\nYou didn't do over eight years what Trump is management regulatory reform and tax reform over just a couple of years so I don't buy that one either one of the best way than to sort of back\nDown and start to dismantle this uh you know this role that the fed has if\nWe can get the political will to do that and speak to that too if you don't mind\n[noise] well you know let's let's hit on a couple of those things that are crucial for one the recession was the sign of the recovery\nSummer session it's clearly signals and economy cleansing itself the misuse of labor the bad habits develop a lousy companies the fatty vestments and so when you\nGet out of the way of the recession your setting the stage for the recovery and so that's the first thing I Would say a ... a president get the best thing president can do is just do nothing and then then you have your recovery\nUm in terms of dismantling the fed\nAgain I think you just decide you prove why we don't need it the fed can't make credit inexpensive it can't push the rate to zero and suddenly you think that that's way sources oh the friends that's going to say the resource ... does anyone think that the fed can make that so\nYou know no more no more than the fed could control the economy by saying well if things are bad let's drop the price of oil to ten bucks a barrel and then the economy will take off like a rocket because gas and diesel be cheap and that's what the economy runs on no they can do and\nAnd so you nail it you hit it on the head so the fed\nCan never say OK oil is going to be cheap now and oil and and make oil plentiful by saying that what the fed would do if it could\nJohn I lost you there for justice are going to use the way go ahead do you have dropped out for a second\nOh I'm Sorry the fed is at the fed is setting the price of oil attend what crazy at our oil scarce either just wouldn't be any oil to buy and sell implicit in and pushing the interest rate down to zero is that the fed can decree all resources\nNear costs less to access which we know logically it cannot do and so dismantle the fed\nYeah St Louis the obvious what could possibly do to stimulate or help the economy it quite simply cannot do what its critics and supporters alike bleep it can't\nSo ... who wants to keep it around John\n[noise] oh I I think you and I know exactly who wants to keep it around the fed has a convenient whipping boy for Congress ended up convenient whipping boy for the president any time we have a recession\nWhich is again a sign of an economy cleansing itself of of what's not working Congress want someone to point to and so it was a present oh the fed raise interest rates the fed tighten credit the fact that no more exciting credit then then again the fat kid can make it difficult to buy oil\nThese prices are set in the market and so we're always going to have the Federal Reserve around because Congress has a constituency in the banking system they want something to prop up what makes no sense during times of distress but they also want someone to blame and so\nYou know I say get rid of the fed it makes serves no purpose I think we all read his power one way or the other foreign never going to get rid of it is Congress want someone to point to lend their policies aren't working\nOut well I guess and you know you you kind of leave me with an answer John because I uh I'd ... I'd like to\nIt takes to ... in ... Congress or if it serves the function of belong them a whipping boy loved set them up or\nSomething that they can beat on every time the economy is doing what their constituents one but let's get rid of this thing that serves no purpose and frankly that's kind of a disturbing effect on the rest of us [noise] um\nWell look I couldn't agree more uh my second book not to plug it is called he needs the fed and which I make a case that the fed is is is rushing toward this it needs to be shut down but I I add\nIf Congress won't do this\nMarkets are shutting down the fed for us they're increasingly making what makes no sense not very well but but I agree with you I think Congress should have the courage\nRealize what's happening they they send about five men after him including one officer\nIn New York is out of ammunition with his rifle and he pulls out his forty five pistol and shoots the last man in the row down in the front man and just keeps going\nAnd he just knocks them down and you know it's a really remarkable is your story as it sounds sort of illegally kills twenty eight men\nBut they did about ten years ago they went back to these are done in the battlefield archeology on the spot that that\nYou know your faith is this incredible uh stand if you will and they found a forty five cartridges over forty of them along with his thirty six and English and in that exact spot\nAnd you wrote that as he when he told his men because this was a guy as you said the mountains in fact there's a great old movie in which he's portrayed and are they talking about what I recommend it oh it's a great movie and it's an old movies not Harry ... if I remember right who was Gary Cooper in black and white was an it\nIt was it was Nineteen forty one and it won a number of awards and uh it's really a wonderful movie it's worse you know ... ... ... visiting\nA you know your listeners out there go watch it again it's a great movie\nSo he's a great strategist as well because you wrote that all the officers were dead so he takes command as a corporal and then when he finishes shooting a bunch of these machine guns in the head every time I had come up I'd done knocked it down and he said and then you said\nHe went right down the position points is forty five at the Germans had and says\nTell your men to stop firing the German blow the whistle on up and down the line all the enemy soldiers stop firing they just stopped\n[laughter] they stop and it's a it's incredible they he captures with along with some of the men in his patrol over a hundred and thirty Germans\nAnd they marched them back you know miraculously back to American lines and I wrote a piece of Breitbart on Sunday for the commanding general says well your guy here you capture the whole damn serve an army [laughter] but he sort of lasted obviously I got a few\nLike two hundred and thirty two attitude yes this is the kind of story that I Want Americans to remember because you know we're used to go on to the movies and seeing\nYou know stories of the single man or a single woman who can run out there and do amazing feeds on his own but this is a guy who actually did it for real and as I recall the story because after I watched the movie and this is a while back a year or two ago\nI went back and read the history of the real history of the man when he came back he was kind of surprised that the I I think the community built in my house\nYou know he was he was not a wealthy guy who was it was not even you know a guy with a lot of money in his pocket but his community was very grateful for what are you're done and he got all these offers a you know Hollywood wanted to see him and everything else and and he was just a simple guy was ...\nHe was he didn't want to monetize\nThe experience and I think that that makes him so exceptional it's not\nYou know ... you look at today where people are are constantly trying to you know they would create a reality show around this York didn't want that and I think that that's what makes him exceptional along with that generation of Americans which you know\nHundred years later and they are largely forgotten but they're going to capture them in the unknown the book I just wrote in and that's why I wrote the book I wanted to let the Americans know about this generation and how important it is and how they change the world\nAnd in fact if if if nothing else I guess maybe he was ... didn't they created a weapons system that was the York [noise]\nYeah yeah the there's an apple anti aircraft guns are attached to it\nThat they called the charge in your car recall that as well now I Want people to see this book can use sketch out and thirty seconds what you've done in the unknowns about this story

national security adviser at our longtime friend John Bolton had been busy these last days\nCorral and what is left on the Iranian aggression\nDuct tape my my my ... an ounce on Wednesday that the U.S withdrawing from the Nineteen fifty five treaty of amity with Iran after Tehran successfully made an international complain that Washington had violated that accord this is a puzzle unless you

evening to you\nThe U.S is withdraw from the treaty of and that he looks like paperwork where is it going what is this to indicate what the next steps craving to\nMalcolm and leaving John you know I think a lot of people look at the withdrawal as well as the other withdraw that was announced by national security adviser John Bolton the same day from\nA more secure and they'll say about corporate of course for the Trump Administration withdrawing from the after withdrawing from the Paris accords withdrawing from the nuclear deal\nBut in fact I think withdrawing from the Nineteen fifty five treaty of amity Bambi meaning friendship where the regime would which we've had a hostile relationship since Nineteen Seventy nine which probably an overdue step frankly\nUm if if you will be drawn at a walk there I see the international court of justice or the world court it's sometimes called a border the United states to do is actually company United States is perfectly willing to do and that's make exemptions to allow humanitarian trade with Iran I think what the ministry shouldn't really objects to do\nIs a very idea the icy Jay has asserted jurisdiction in this issue because of the United states there's about national security and it's not really subject to world courts jurisdiction\nAnd it's a matter of national sovereignty also\nUh having them into fear and as you said America does give humanitarian exemptions and has always provided for it but you know when they talk about the aircraft parts being coming onto this guy's sense of being humanitarian need when we know that the Iranians civilian aircraft are being employed in Syria\nJohn ...\nSyria and Russia are separate story from Iran and Russia because of the ongoing conflict because of the promises made and\nQuestion is

confidence is it was on a disk trusting is there a betrayal of ... ... is\nA good evening and thanks for having me on I think this episode is certainly people embarrassing uh for ... you have a client side regime shutting down one of your own aircraft with weapons that you saw them in a long while ago after hundreds\nUm ... systems that really can't tell friend her phone now it's kind of one on one of one of the problems there for the for the Russians are but it's deeply embarrassing and I think they use this as an excuse\nI'm to transfer the three hundreds to the Syrians would resort video of earlier this week um they've been wanting to do it since I was twenty Thirteen earlier or they had to deal with Israelis back twenty Thirteen to not do it I'm obviously that this\nUh this incident was the excuse that they've been looking forward to quickly go ahead and move forward with the transfer\nWe had very complicated situation this is a one reflection of it when you have the three hundreds coming in addition to the U.S two hundred but we have an ally turkey a NATO member who's getting the S. four hundred supposedly the most advanced the system is are the\nThe Chinese and they've been threats by the U.S about sanctions on ... uh uh the countering America's adversaries who sanctions act and other\nMeasures ... what do you see the the us reaction now both regarding turkey and trying to do they go to the mat on it and how will effect Turkey's relationship though it within the Russian orbit\nAlready saw that the public ... property ministry should issue the sanctions and the cats are related sanctions against Chinese\nOne Chinese agency and the Chinese individuals and executive director of that agency for their purchase of as four hundred and thirty five fighter jets off I think that's certainly a shock to the Chinese to the Turks\nI'm either just report today that the Indonesians were putting on hold a their purchases of sick or thirty five fighter jets because of their concern about sanctions\nSo I should be taken seriously that um you know the conversation has worn turkey that this could lead to sanctions and not their fault through an sanctions and kind of set the precedent what China\nUm you know the the light should be flashing red or for turkey whether their stock um you know I I that's a mistake I think they go they go through and it\nSort of course I'm I'm On a press you on how the Russians deal with the Syrians in Damascus Russian military intelligence is excellent Russian\nNetworks are first prayed throughout the middle east always have been there are a lot of Russians married Syrian so there's a ... there's a comfort here working in the ... do the Russians trust that I saw it in any fashion they totally penetrated his organization did they know everything all the time\n[noise] so I have one person making decisions I don't know if they know everything all the time but they've got no alternative they have this kind of multigenerational forty nine year basing deal with the Assad regime for uh the base and Curtis a naval base it on the air base or I mean\nUm and so they they're holding on and there's no there's no\nPolitical alternative for them they don't they don't see anybody else ... basically guarantee 'em their equities and in Syria so I'm not sure it's a matter of crossing or not but it's that's the kind of [laughter] they've got the foot hold down the law of armed and Assad is\nThe partner for that I'm and I'm not sure you know how that there is no there is no other way for them to move\nAnd as far as it relates to the United states or Israel or are there key players and the reason that just kind of the reality now and we been the Russians are doing with Assad as they are and Israelis are kind of doing it would do it with Assad regime and her very I'm kind of realistic way and\nI'm targeting what they need to target and same with the Iranians um and so I think it's a it's more of the actions than than any trust to having maybe here when they get there as three hundred to a side it's more about making sure that as\nThe kind of the troops that Assad has are ... are really lax don't end up sitting up there on aircraft as we saw when it's incident that they have something that's more advanced\nNow that can actually tell Russian aircraft from Israeli aircraft or from you know other aircraft\nDo we have another front where we're seeing a an ally I'm moving closer to Russia in some regards to visit a president in ... beach in the to Russia I think we'll just have to Sochi do\nYou see this as a an opportunity for Russia to establish another base now that the consolidated the hold in Syria and ... they they long stolen bases series in in Egypt what what else could be on the agenda for them\nSo they've had I mean it's I think it's just it's a fascinating trip on the seventeenth I mean is it an Egypt cc's previously visitor Russia's well they signed kind of a slew of military and economic cooperation deals but on the military side we haven't seen\nSome of the kind of basic things come to fruition yet and so that's that's in my mind is that the key thing on the agenda the Soviets had some basis in in western I'm\nIn western Egypt do they want to revive somebody's airbases to they want to revive some of the naval kind of access they had um military no access to Egypt ... front porch there but I think that's what's really interesting here to wash\nThat this trip is coming about fairly quickly um and again builds on already military and economic ideals say made in the past couple of years so it's it's it should be concerning for the U.S where you have\nFor traditional ally I'm continuing to gotta get get colds here with the Russians and part of that is where we're not engaging with um you know we still\nI'm Still waiting for a ... either to be named a State Department or David shank or there was a factor for Near East still has not been\nUm confirmed by the Senate\nUm so they're still we're we're kind of still playing this game of of catch up on the diplomatic front while the Russians are clearly pushing ahead\nTo detail here about where we are in the scheme of things the price of all guns ready five dollars and I'm told by ...\nThe dollars that got us a cycle it's nothing different about the Iranian upset is affecting it does that give Russia more leverage in the world because their coffers are good above sixty dollars a barrel\n[noise] tricky position where they I think they're planning for around fifty five dollars for their budgets that they don't they can't domestically deal with [noise]\nPrices are a hundred more because you know they had their own domestic prices for oil gas good commodities whatever start going up and the Russian economy is not doing very well uh inflation's up in an all those things so that you see some kind of\nSome small protests some some kind of\nSome some issues domestically for [laughter] so I think there's a sweet spot for them I Know maybe it wasn't it was like oh you know where it goes up to a hundred dollars a barrel it's great for the Russians [laughter] you know if that was doing better on a macro level maybe but it's not\nFar Silverman STD Malcolm how light on John bachelor\nYour hands in a brand new one is as close as participating with landlords dealer stopping what's your name in the box\nBut the unfortunate too many of them are backfiring and he he's operating\nWith so many strikes against them at this point do you see Iran exploiting the situation now and it was what was it was before my John about the domestic reaction it seems young people buy into the twenty thirty\n... to stay in a large enough numbers to continue with it\nI think you're exactly right Malcolm that the reason he's been able to do a number of the things that have done which in in a Saudi contacts thinking historically are really quite astounding I'm not sure any of us would have believe some of the steps that he's\nHe's taking not only on them the empowering women are advocating on behalf of moderate Islam are slashing\nSubsidies to the Saudi population and

be\nLost and if they were able to get this field with Kuwait back up and running it it would it would obviously be a major plot said clearly under a lot of pressure\nFrom President Trump anybody who reads that section of his speech at a young guy and the way he came down on OPEC like a ton of bricks\nI understand that the I think the Saudis are really feeling the pressure that they've got to meet

you know obviously there's you know twenty thirty was triggered largely by an MBA that's his view that that oil is is not going to be around forever he's driven in it that fly and he knows what

cross your fingers your name will be drawn as one of our sea Seventy qualifiers you enter next live broadcast where you can register to win\nI Want to apply this to a real time concepts which is a naval education because I talk all the time to the Naval War college I in fact in fact I spoke to professor Jim home last night about the Decatur incident and I learned deals off from the Naval War college\nIt's a it's a pleasure because that is that's see that's the ideas of the navy for the last hundred years there's also the Naval Academy will use so so how does a lot of ability or a clean sheet review I think that's a technical got older and how does that apply to the institutions educational led to some of the navy\nWhile John I think that that at the end of the day uh are competitive advantage I think in this country is always going to be um our ability to thank our adversaries um whether that's in a business or in war\nAnd so as we look at the future of the navy and where the navy should be headed in our whole defense or a tablet should should be headed it's really where if you look at success organizations a private sector or whatever the ones that have really done well in this in this era of rapid change are the ones that are the most agile\nAnd so I'm ... from my perspective what that means is that we had to have as well forces on the ground that can adapt and be innovative collaborate be transparent and what they do and do things a lot more quickly than they do them now but that would that also means is that we need to have people who have agile minds\nUm and I think that for me is going to be our biggest competitive advantage into what I've done one of the first things I did when I came here with secretary Spencer\nIt to launch a something we call the ... for ... study which is education for sea power study\nAnd uh we we assemble the board of 'em some very intelligent and experience folks to take a look at our educational institutions in the navy and reassess them from a clean sheet perspective you know nothing was off the table to give us some advice and guidance on how we can sort of prepare of this\nAh education and to create our educational institutions but also to create sort of continuous learning and create a learning organization in the navy\nThey're about to release their findings here in the next couple of weeks and I suspect that we're going to be doing some reorganization to adjust to that um to heat the institutions sort of individually are doing well but we do not have an enterprise view on uh on where we need to\nTo go forward into this next into this century with respect to creating the types of agility and education and thinking that we're going to need to to be successful\nAt this point as a force structure assessment that I read in the news is coming in November is education\nOf that no it wouldn't be he would be\nI wanted to that John Force structure assessment Israeli purely looking at as you look at the the the three hundred and fifty five ship call a really looking at that and determining OK what does that mix kind of look like one of the ships going to look like\nA how are they going to operate a what is distributed lethality mean how does that how does that play into the equation and a lot of the things that you've talked to the jury Hendricks about and others and ... and others on your show\nI see so education is special here now let me let me apply this because I I enjoy listening to a speech to the Naval Academy and especially the camera shots of the young people in the audience [noise] uh what are they asking for its Naval Academy that they don't know have I Know just because I've been reporting on this\nThat the army has stood up something called a future command which is a way of talking about cyberspace and are thinking of the future in digital Lee is the ... does the navy have something comparable I'm I'm an educated in this so I I'm just I'm just searching ...\nWell I think I think distributed across the navy were thinking about a lot of these things I think one of the purposes of a forest study is to try and capture that and create a strategy and orchestrate that more in a coordinated way to ensure that\nFor example what's happening at the war colleges complementary to what we're what we're doing at the Naval Academy the post graduate school as well\nOut in Monterey it's a it's an incredible research institution but I think it's been under utilized with respect to integrating with the private sector um and also with integration into the fleet so that we can use what's being research there to actually advance our war fighting capability\nSo it's really a it's a really a holistic view at what we're doing in education and where it should go it it's interesting John back about a hundred years ago there was something called the knocks king ... report which really looked at the same problem for the navy or in a in Nineteen Eighteen\nAnd the conclusions of that study basically set the groundwork for the types of thinking in terms of education and focus on strategy that all of our leaders in World War two in the navy for influenced by and it was ... was essential to our ability to be successful and that caught but\nI'm going to guess that's the study that center Ernest King bill and haul Z back to school to learn how to fly something like that the future is aviation yes\nUm and you are aviation you are in the U.S navy retired aviator and I'm going to call upon just general talk about the fleet now in the fleet going forward when

mean we get that that's what we're all frustrated about seems like these guys are so much more interested in keeping their offices keeping their power they forget to do their job\nUh but uh I suppose the nice thing I mean if I when I'm going to be a freshman in the four hundred and thirty five member house of representatives I doubt anybody will say oh that dusty Johnson's got too much power I mean you really have to work to be relevant in that kind of a large community and you're not going to have a lot of\nTraditional power and not a lot of hard power at some point you're going to have relevance you're going to have soft power because people trust you you're smart and your hardworking\nAnd listen I got a lot you know I'm not perfect but I Would tell you the three ingredients do for relevance in Washington and here's trustworthiness hard work and a smart so I think I'm a I'm a I'm going to do well in that job\nRight you have as you are coming in ... we we have a situation we have a trade dispute with China we have\nA little bit of a trade war with a tit for tat tariffs and things like that on the other hand there's a new trade deals with South Korea or we have the new um US Mexico Canada agreement\nUh where do you see the the trade process going and how would you like to help steer it well\nI'm a free trade guy and I think market access as critic\nThe producers and of course that's drawn the eggs side but\nIt's also true for South Dakota manufacturers\nMinutes not going to do ... tracks any good only sell score boards to the you know the lower forty eight I mean let's make sure that we have a a global market for the people were making stuff or growing stuff in this country\nAnd so I you know now that we're we're at a un held back up to half a step Fred I mean I I was not a fan of starting the trade disputes at least not in the way that we did\nBut now that we're here I mean I disagree with those candidates who think we just need to wave of the white flag we need to surrender and walk away I mean the question is now that we're here how do we get a swift and successful outcome and I think the president's headed and generally the right direction for the reasons you mentioned and when he was in the state\nThis is what I talk to him about this is what I grabbed him about this is what he and I looked a you know I bought the eyeball and talked about in particular with regard to Canada I just said Mr President they are a big deal for us we got to get a deal with Canada he told me it was coming soon turned out he was right\nNow ah and as we talked earlier about to serving in the the recipe for serving there in uh in Congress in Washington DC uh there are some who would support term limits of ah the senators and representatives uh you're one of them is that right dusting yeah\nYeah I mean I Do think forty years which some people in D.C had been there for two years it seems like too much\nNow I Know every once in a while you're going to end up throwing a baby out with the bath water right I understand the term limits are not perfect they have a down side to them but I Do think psychologically it will do a lot of good to lead every single member of Congress know when they walk into that town\nThat they will at some point need to move out and go back to being a you know a normal citizen\nA and that's I think going to make them a little freer to do things that are in the public interest rather than just trying to make decisions so that they can protect their hide for forty years\nYou do make a valid point there I Believe because there are senators and representatives who after they had a ... is the state that they're gonna retire or sometimes make decisions that they would have not made previous to that they're willing to take a risk that they would not have taken before\nAnd sometimes those things irritate me because I feel like they're not being responsive to the citizens but sometimes those things make me feel like they are a worrying less about the politics of the ... situation of more about policy or what you know what's good lesson you know when you when you raise your right hand and you take an old\nUh you don't take it all to do everything it can to get reelected you take an oath to defend the constitution of the United states and and the Senate as a nation you know jeeze maybe some of those guys should be taken that all day every day is just a little refresher course before they cast any votes\nRight now ... where would you set the limits on that because I Know some proposed but six to your terms in the house to six year terms in the Senate is that a good number to start with\nTwelve years in the house sounds about right to ... and I'm not going to let the perfect be the enemy the good if somebody wanted to force that number up or down a little bit you know hey I'm fine I think\nThe existence of term limits is more important than the exact number\nAgain I think the real benefit as the psychological impact it has on people there you know on the Senate I don't mind having something longer in the Senate you know the founders intended that to be a pretty radically different a decision making body and process than the house so if you wanted to push a little higher on the Senate that wouldn't bother me either\n[noise] there are some who would say a term limits encourage those who uh pedal influence in DC they that they have more power now because uh legislators have a shorter terms that there'll be serving\nI Do think if you set the number two small you dude and power or the bureaucrats and I don't mean that term to rice simply just the government workers and you do empower some of the the lobbying interests\nI I think it's important some people talk about six years six years now since six years in the Senate in that situation you really are going to weaken the legislative branch so strongly that staffers bureaucrats and a lobbyist I think will be the beneficiaries of that\nThere are some who would say that the um the legislative branches have given away too much power over the last few years\nYou better believe that that's absolutely right I mean these guys and gals can't get along\nAnd so whether they intend to give away power to the executive or not when they don't act and they don't act and they don't act they create this vacuum or the executive can parachute in issue these executive orders a listener I don't love President Trump's executive orders all that much more than I Do President Obama's\nYes they come from a world view that's more comfortable to me as someone who's on the right end of the political spectrum\nBut I I Do think that when president start to impose the wheel of a single person on on what the rules of the road are\nWe're leaving a little something behind I mean and that that little something is having the people's body the house of representatives do their job and actually put the values of their constituents in place the legislative did a better job this would be a better country\nShe kind of lead me into what was going to be my next question which is is it uh do you believe it's true that the executive as fill the vacuum\nBecause the legislative branch has not properly done their job\nThey haven't passed real budget in decades say uh you know we have a farm bill that six firing that that you know something's going to have to be held together somehow I'm ... how can you how do you propose as one in four hundred and thirty five\nTo encourage the legislative branch to actually do its job\nWell I think one of the most important things I can do is just try to go lead by example and I put lead in quotes because listen I get it\nYou know it's not like I'm going to show up in Washington DC and all of the legislators and go oh dusty ... thank goodness now let's go have some political courage and get something done first term chairman of ways and listen I'm not naive but I wouldn't tell ya I think\nWhen you've got people there who are serious they worry more about policy than they do about politics they are less interested in getting up on cable TV and waving their hands and scream and uh they're less concerned about that than they are about going into a meeting room and sitting down and actually working out the details\nAre the type of leadership style I have read is going to be the kind of thing that I think will send a day to day message to my colleagues that this is about getting something done not about making points\n[noise] ... [noise] now he we mentioned the farm bill ... just a slight passing their son\nIs something that's still there's still a candy and kicked down the road isn't it\nIt's not going to get done this year trying to get done in twenty Nineteen that's why it is that's why I'm so excited\nTo get to Washington DC and get on the committee I Am going to be a great ag committee member uh I understand that but I mean I I'm the only person that I Know I'm sure I'm not the only person in South Dakota but I Am you know I read the whole gosh darn farm bill\nThe house version and I've written most of the Senate version\nAnd uh because I'm a policy guy and I think to really do a good job for real crop country and cattle country you've got to understand how paid forty seven that bill interaction\nSix hundred too many of those guys out there just seem like they're too busy or border whatever to do the real work and I'm a guy who knows how to do the real work\nWell and we as farmers in the uh W.

I don't know who I Would pick it's a tough one I get a close call let's change it up\nJust a little bit if you were going to be buddy buddy with any of them are you are going to be friends right who would you rather be friends with you would you rather be friends with the Terminator\nWould you rather be friends with me I Would you rather be friends with\nWhom I'm Joel ramble is a really you\nJust wonder why they even rats ... is a good deal on Wonder Woman isn't a choice here that no no you got Rambo you got the Terminator ... if you've got a buddy up with somebody who's gonna be ... you're trying to keep Wonder Woman for yourself aren't you [noise]\nAre invisible jak Fred the problem is last time I tried to take a ride to Wonder Woman everyone could see that I was hanging out with her and she got nervous\n... went for a cruise and the ... well yeah that's what you want an eye on that one I may go Rambo you might be able to drink and you might\nBe better for him drop drop who's this land so what do you think it would you rather be friends with the Terminator or John ramble\nOh it's gotta be gotta be rammed clearly ran into a ... why why would you choose ramble\nWelfare on wheel of gun that shoots that God\nOh yeah that knife a was pretty popular to write because when those movies came out those survival knives were the big thing for a while weren't day\nHe ... yeah I got to go to war with them all back\nShe's my choice so you're saying Rambo as at all used to be better off than chip beer in the bar at you know and there's something about that three of you were in the bar with Terminator having yourself a cold beverage people might look at your little funnier than if you were sitting at the watering hole with ramble don't you think Jared\nYeah possibly right yeah yeah I uh I got ya I think maybe is starting to convince me maybe Rambo as the better choice\nFor so they can really look at it\nYeah I area thanks for the call and we appreciate it a hobby is being safe out there are all in one of our truck driver colors and you know that ... a cook it up and down the road or making a living right now so uh yeah so [noise]\nI don't know Fred it'd be a that that definitely for me is a bit of a tough one\nYeah I like I said it's a close call [noise]\nI got to get to my new storage here Fred I I lost my little a stack of stuff\nAll right I misplaced it altogether and we talked about the unemployment benefits or the unemployment numbers being lower and lower rather day I'm a there's still a little controversy up there\nAre just the other day in the news we had a story that Amazon had a given pay raises two people right they changed their minimum wage to ... am out on minimum wage Fifteen dollars an hour right that's a good thing right\n[noise] and generally speaking but I understand there's a catch ... there's a catch to it\nThat's what I've been told well it seems like there may be a catch to it or it turns out that even though they have changed their minimum wage to Fifteen dollars an hour or they have taken some of the\nBenefits of way yeah like bonuses yeah you don't get bonuses anymore\nUltimately\nThe Fifteen dollars an hour for the average workforce of Amazon is a paid decrease\nSo after they take away the bonuses et cetera the average Amazon employees now will make less money than what they had been making before the people who are making less than Fifteen an hour will make Fifteen an hour so they'll make a little more money everyone else\n... ... ...\nSo I'm here's here's the lesson here\nMaybe just maybe it would be an idea that instead of sitting on your couch and just ordering all of your\nChristmas presents from Amazon [noise] maybe you should consider\nGoing to main street in the town you live in and going to the businesses that support your local town right and maybe you should buy more if your presence from them\nI I kinda liked the idea that Britain I Know it's easy to buy stuff on Amazon you're sitting there on your couch and you watch TV I mean when you do not eat or something on line and have it delivered but a tell you what it is a nice thing to have a relationship with that person that has a business downtown\nHere's an here and yanked him and a lotta lotta towns that are listening area of great downtowns don't pay for it\nOh absolutely you know for example if even if you want to go to the big city downtown Sioux Falls is wonderful I'm sue city has some great shopping areas\nYou two and a half you know if you're in the acting your two and a half hours from Omaha these are great places to shop and and you know\nThat if you go to like where things can Minnesota you don't even have to pay health concluding right you're right and so the ...

would withdraw his own name or President Trump would withdraw Kavanaugh's name and then it would be over we'd go all the way to the mid term elections the Republicans would have caved in\nAnd the

that's going on well documentary filmmaker army Horowitz\nIs very good at taking the temperature of some of these people and he found that gullible ignorance well\nIt was really shocking when you

tomorrow unless things change is going to be fifty one forty nine that we're going to see judge Kavanaugh confirmed I think he deserves it\nI think the president has the authority to appoint a Supreme Court justice and I think he picked a supremely qualified individual I'm Sorry that judge Kavanaugh on his family had to go through all this nonsense a story that we've we've finally come to find out was fraudulent ah and and that there were people willing\nTo urge others to lie to the FBI to back this up and I told the candidates the other day I said realize\nThis kind of bomb could be dropped on your candidate tomorrow was talking to a member of the staff\nOf this campaign and I said what are you going to do if a work week out from election day\nThis kind of bomb has dropped on you and you know it's not true\nAnd you know you can probably prove it's not true but you won't be able to prove that in any way shape or form till after the election this technique should not be used by either party I think it should be condemned if there's a a real person who's been harmed and assaulted more power to them their story should be heard\nBut if you decided to simply drop a story knowing by the time they check it out and find out it's false\nOr the the electorate will be over and there's no way to undo it that's wrong so tell me about what you did with young people to try and find out of college kids find out their point of view on all this\nOkay there's clearly a lot of opposition to to cabinet or on the left right no question about it and you you know the stories can continue to come out of the cabinet I did this that we went from you know he was a conservatives don't like 'em\nA he's a gang rape and say like nearly sixty yep so I Want to see what those two parts to it at first I wanted to find out what to what they believe what idiocy can I make up their so obviously falls to see if they believe their outlook your candidate for any office only the Supreme Court\nOr delete so I began with something I said you know\nA cabinet during the hearings he he felt that we needed to take a black man's value to be worth three fit the white men value late but one of those are the things you could possibly imagine right now they're going to laugh myself out of here\nA lot of the old uh every single person I approached believed\nThat he said a black person is worth three fifths of a white person\nDown by the way reminds everybody where the three fifths figure actually come from in American history\nIt's called the three fits compromise and what happened was\nWhen they get paid to the south and the north to to figure out on a census basis how many people you know what what what was the the um [noise] I I mean people were in North in the south of the country as a whole there there was an agreement to count black people's three fiscal white person because it was actually the north who pushed that because they didn't want\nThe south and say well you know their slaves we want to count them as citizens therefore we'll have more people than the north in that sense you had a cave creek is compromise\nYeah so it has a reference in American history but it goes back a long long way there were actually college kids who believe that the the Kavanaugh are held to the position that the black citizens were only three fifths of a person\nEvery single person and then I Want to see if I get taught myself to then I said well he also wants to take 'cause listen everybody is concerned that he's so dangerous to women's rights when you hear that all the time he is absolutely dangerous to women's rights\nSo I wanted to see okay let's see how far they go to believe how how big a danger he wasn't even though he said that he thought that will versus Wade was\nSupreme Court precedents and they wouldn't take that away they still didn't believe him and he was a danger to women's rights in general\nThat said okay let me see how far we can take that and I said well did you know that he wanted to take a woman's wait till so it's a way of course nobody believed that large well except that they all believe that and not a single person push back and they all use it as an example to say why the terrible person\nThat's insane and these are not high school kids these are college age kids so they finished K through ... education they've been admitted to an American college they're supposed to be smart enough to study in college some of the people you talked to had a year or two in college and they still thought crazy things like that\nThat's right that's how much they're arrangement syndrome about public in general are are that has changed in that situation is because they still believe that no matter what their way they are how how do you watch they are when it comes to Americans and to what they think Republicans stand for\nWell and and I guess the really frightening thing for me is that\nThese people who consume mass media if they turn on CNN and and eh or MSNBC or read the New York times the Washington Post\nAh they will see stories that some of us said that is hogwash I can show you the documents that show you the thing that you just read in the Washington Post isn't true even NBC or got caught exaggerating some of what a Christian for to had to say to Congress\nAnd they were called on it but if you don't know to call somebody on it or to go out and look it up yourself and see if that could possibly be true and you're used to consuming maybe two or three sources of media not double checking them you might be just completely taken for that or taking with that information\nQuestion about it and by the way as crazy as that is that wasn't the most dangerous thing that they answered oh what was that what it would it got worse was and I asked all okay so ... you know you don't want a Republican I get it why not let me ask you this question I asked them to or questions\nI said well what is what is the what should be the role of Supreme Court\nShouldn't be what it actually is right now especially that to interpret the constitution or should they simply be promoters of social just you'll know that the only one answer to this question okay every single kid I was still in some quarters\nTheir answer was promotion of social justice that is the role of the Supreme Court and then to take a step further to believe he's still can't believe we couldn't go to this but we did I asked them if the constitution even that was it to you\nThat you want to do you want a suppressed of all the costs to she'll come spring calling on social justice so let's ask the question well events that have to you and the answer was for those people eighty percent of the kid that spoke to said it has no ...\nNo relevance even though on a daily basis they engage in free speech or they are secure in their belongings the police can't just pull you out of your\nHouse and demand your papers as you walk down the street all of those things are things that are locked up in the constitution as safeguards against the government overreaching and doing things to citizens that the government should not be doing they didn't see that relevance at all\nThey did not I don't know I\nMean it's so disturbed it's hard to imagine it just it just it's so disturbing but that is true they did not see the relevance ... whatsoever so I mean the real danger that were\nI Know the real proof is when people see this where can they see your work and and these examples\nShould they go on the dot com and the media was wait there in the city\nThat is I Am I ... I mean it's great to have you on the program things you're doing this because this is a great way to sample what do people know what do people believe and at least in the case of this experiment\nHow much are they willing to believe even when it's so fallacious that most of us would call it out immediately if we were asked a question like a good for you\nAlways a pleasure to have a wonderful weekend ami that's army Horwitz a journalist and documentary filmmaker I'm going to get to your phone calls immediately next why\nWhat can I tell you why that might be true and it might change your mind maybe if you go to if you go to any judge anywhere in America\nAnd you say judge I really hate drunk drivers one of them killed my mom so I have a reason personally to hate drunk drivers if you get a drunk driver in front of him and you're going to be in front of you are you going to throw the book at him\nThat judge if he or she is a response will judge will say I am not going to tell you ahead of you know not recuse they're not going to prejudge case so for instance if you ever saw a judge publically come out and say every time there's an issue of land rights which comes up in court frequently around America\nI'm always going to decide on behalf of the landowner instead of the local government that may say they want to do something with a land if you say every time a case comes in front of me involving a worker who says he's been injured on the job I'm going to decide in favor of the worker\nThat judge should be off the bench and here's why and this is what judges have told me\nJudges should never take a position that pre judge is a kind of case so for example when you have met with\nAlmost all of them in this case from the Democratic party who say Iran or do you take that roe versus Wade is establish law and you're not going to challenge it ... thing is that's pre judging a case that may come before the court\nIf you say your honor a if a if a man is suing the corporation you worked for will you side with the worker or the corporation\nShe should immediately refused and say I want to answer that because the minute you prejudged case you're not a good judge anymore now almost all the things that the Democrats asked judge Kavanaugh about work questions like that\nSaying tell us promises he won't overturn roe v way and they didn't say in those terms were they were trying to get him to take positions on things\nThat almost guaranteed will come before the Supreme Court at some point in the next thirty or forty years\nAnd they wanted him to announce a head of time that he would take a position on cases that he hasn't he been heard yet\nNow we don't want judges like that not just explain to you why does that explain why he had to give non answers to most of those questions because no judge should take a position on a case ahead of time not even your local judges in your town or county should take a position ahead of time now does that make sense to\n[noise] ... you're you're a master debater but uh I have been a master ... yes I bet you are but a ... that the question is why are all those people opposed and\nWhy why there's one word he won a secret word answers your question the word is abortion\nLost it totally ah during that that are that session giving his testimony and so that that is why people say he does\nYeah the judicious tempted well hold on and have you\nBeen doing it was somebody will flee accused you of trying to rape a woman if somebody falsely accused you of that would you have the kind of mild tone of voice that you have with me right now when you got dragged up in front of national television cameras and told\nProved to us that you didn't try to rape that girl thirty six years ago\nSo you've got an accusation that if people take it seriously and decide that you did this a third of a century ago your career goes away you're spot on the Supreme Court goes away your job is an appeals court judge go goes away and likely\nYour entire law practice goes away you will never be employed as a lawyer you will never be employed as a judge\nIf you are facing that kind of threat based on a false accusation what would your response ... would you be angry\nI Would I Would certainly be against it yes but how come how harbored you're what you're talking about is not a re invited him back it each\nIs not the case I Know you've got something wrong and I'm going to correct you on it\nJudge Kavanaugh three days ago sent a letter to Harvard He usually goes there and teaches constitutional law every year and he informed I Am not going to be available to teach constitutional law he's\nGoing to be on the Supreme Court he doesn't have time to go teach college class at this point most of them do not I don't know the single one of the justices the teachers even at the local D.C colleges or universities\nHow in the world with a guy who's sitting on the U.S Supreme Court have the time to go all the way up up to uh up to Harvard and teach a constitutional law cause he wasn't just invited he sent them the letter now I'm Glad I get a chance to straighten things out\nA letter up a sent them the letter and all you know there were people at Harvard who said we don't want him here now if you think that influenced his choice it may have\nHe's the one who decided I'm not working there and he won't have the time
