insurance health insurance homeowner's insurance all of it uh so here is our interview with Jennifer Fitzgerald is a little bit about yourself you have this very cool Web site that\nIs in the insurance business how did you come to this place\nYeah not everybody wakes up in the morning and says I'm going to start a company in the insurance industry\nI Can't wait this sounds awesome I neither do I I'm going to create tender or policy genius I Know it was\nA it was a coin toss uh-huh um before starting the company I worked in financial services and I did a lot of consulting work for the big insurance companies at McKinsey and you know the light bulb moment for me and my co founder who was also can be with me was getting hired to do the same project again and again with these insurance companies so they kept asking us\nHow do we engage younger consumers what do we do about the fact that our um insurance agents sales force is aging the average age of an insurance agent us fifty nine years old\nAnd most people certainly most people under the age of like forty five\nI've never had an agent are interested in an insurance agent but they still have a need for life insurance and disability insurance and the products that these agents sell so you know the fact that the main distribution channels still the brick and mortar agent was just you know pretty indicative of a of a larger issue that we felt like we could solve\nAnd when you say you know the light bulb moment how do we engage younger consumers is it hard to talk to\nAnd tablets industry like insurance and basically smack him around and say well here's what you're doing wrong I mean other words I Know people who work in as consultants to a lot of these places and they present these gorgeous\nRecommendations never to be implemented so what is the problem they scared that they're going to ... their own business and that's it the reluctance there\nAnd money dot com it's ask Jill and Jill on money dot com and if you have not signed up for our furry newsletter\nWell it's time with our new privacy policy mark\nI couldn't do a my birth date it only let me get my months not my

for this free weekly newsletter you can read all the stuff that that we write on an ongoing basis you can't even click on the link and pre order my book\nSmart things dumb people do with their money yeah let's get back to\nThe insurance questions at hand we are joined live with Jennifer Fitzgerald she is the CEO and co founder of policy genius and you know I Love the concept so easy to buy insurance on line now\nIn this segment I'm going to ask Jennifer what's the deal with policy genius offering whole life insurance many of you know that we are not huge fan so here's more of our interview with Jennifer Fitzgerald so why whole life\nSo whole life a was a recent addition um and you know if you read the content in our site talk to our team and we will you know being very up front and say for most people who need life insurance term life is the way to go right\nUm however we do get 'em on tourist site and into our ah channels I network client who do have a state planning made so um we were just as surprised as the next person that you know these folks are coming through\nTo you know had legitimate estate planning needs and wanted whole life ah we're financially savvy you knew the difference new uh the fees that were involved in a whole life policy so again we don't do a lot\nSee if the team who knows how to um you know handle the affairs of these larger higher net worth clients so how many people and you're CSP team so we've got 'em on our CSP disability and Vance planning team about six people\nThat's great I'll just say the permanent insurance has a use case it's just very small number of people already rare okay so you deal with only certain companies and you obviously has some financial arrangement with the so how does that\nWork so we are a licensed broker and also the states in DC and that means we get the company gets paid a commission on the insurance policies we sell 'em the commission's pretty comparable across all of our companies\nUm we don't favor one company over another and our site actually forces that transparency because you can see what the rates are afraid to assuming you put an accurate information about your health profile you'll see right there and you choose which company you want to go with what\nI found interesting about that is that you have\nAccess to some policies that are normally ... only sold through their captive agents like in northwestern mutual has that changed in the digital age you see\nSo some are still a strictly filter captive agent so State Farm and the auto insurance side New York life will still only work through their captive agents but um what we've seen is you know a lot to our relaxing and they have independent and kept of channels and ... um which again it's just better for the for the consumer\nYou added on auto insurance\nAnd you added on health so let's talk a little bit more I mean because those are two huge categories which I probably the vast majority of people need to OK a hundred and fifty five six million people get their health insurance through their employers\nHow many people are buying health insurance privately through places like policy genius so\nThe last estimates I saw it's not a lot in terms of population wise maybe like you know ten to Fifteen million I'm Better than non Medicaid non Medicare individual and family shoppers um but it's increasing rate you know fewer people are I'm staying a job for a long time you've got\nThe rise of the gig economy the self employed worker the freelancers so uh it's small but growing and for those people who leave that you know W. to job and strike off on their own for the first time this is a very intimidating and complicating things to tackle\nHow does this work based on the exchange and how do you have is that incorporate or not incorporate\nHere at the great questions so we um so sites like ours um that offer a private health insurance um you typically plug into the exchange so every plan that's available on your state exchange in your ZIP Code we've got we also have\nA because health insurance can't be simple off exchange plans so these are plants that still has to comply with the Affordable CARE Act but um because they're sold quote unquote off the exchange there's a little bit more flexibility in terms of pricing and plan designed so we've got on and off exchange plans um there's no\nPolitical price savings by buying anywhere else like any insurance you know it's it's regulated or the insurance plans are ... and re tables are filed with the state regulators so you know you buy a signal plan from us or your state exchange it's the same\nPrice so good so that no one has to worry if you're like oh my God I'm Affordable Care act I can still go to a policy at the exact same thing probably more easily I bet your imagination is much\nMuch nicer much more easily and that is you know what we pride ourselves on is creating a really good experience for the again the D. I. shopper for health insurance particular there's no\nI think the thing that's really confusing about health insurance is people think that you know there's a right answer for them or this magical plan that's going to have noted ... and it's going to be cheap it's not\nHealth insurance is a series of trade off right there is no silver bullet answer right do you want lower to dock doubles or do you want a higher premium right do you want a a big doctor network or do you want a lower premium right so we walk\nYou know the consumers lock themselves through those you know a handful of decisions that they have to decide um and that narrow down the the\nPlans to choose from on the auto insurance side on I Love the of ride share insurance brilliant rental car insurance which is usually the worst deal in the world when you're at the checkout counter right Jim use you usually your credit card covers it under your more products I'm interested bite us\nOn identity theft insurance and tell me about that so um\nThese are plans where you pay you know anywhere from eight dollars to upwards of twenty dollars a month that\nI have a um risk monitoring on all the credit bureaus for you um that help you um you know if your identity is a stolen helps you recoup some of the cost of you know fight that in court or rebuild that so um it's an increasingly you know a popular product you\nKnow all day and reaches that are happening out there but it's funny because like homeowners is under the other so is this mean I think a homeowner's insurance is so weird because you can go out and and say okay I Want coverage and you can get a humongous range\nThat's interesting we actually just started a piloting or auto and home insurance coverage so we don't have a live marketplace on the site for auto and home like we do for life or health or pet\nUm what were piloting right now I'm getting great feedback on his more concierge service so we've got an odd one home team do I have the right levels coverage um should I also have on Brelo on top of my home owner's insurance\nEither way on a huge fan of the umbrella yeah so cheap and easy dollars a year and you know a new dollars of coverage to downplay fabulous um\nSo what we've been doing is you know you fill out a form on line or team will prepare and do the analysis for you right so do you have the right amount of coverage and then the recommendations are can we get you more coverage for the same price um or you know the same coverage for a lower price right which is at the end of the day what you want is a homeowner\nDo you win in that concierge service when we have rich people who call in and I'm like you're insured you know I they'll say well what do I do and so like off line I'll be like wow I ain't

[noise]\nIf he I raise or in a trust that could be weird I'm not sure that that you should double check that because most often a people will not put IRAs inside trust\nSo if you inherit an IRA\nGenerally speaking you have to take your distributions during your lifetime or within five years after the original account holder passed away\nAnd you could usually you can roll it into your own IRA I Know the spouses can I don't believe that I'm a child can um but what you probably should do is talk to the attorney\nUm because ... you know you may want to be clear that if you have certain assets inside of a an IRA and it's left to the trust\nCan the trust then distribute those assets into an inherited IRA I don't know the answer to that\nBut I Do know that um anything money you pull out of that you would have to pay tax on so I'm Sorry I'm a little vague on that one Roberta but I I Need a little more information [noise] okay [noise]\nUm [noise] let's see here is somebody called

I mean part of the reason I have the blame myself the economy is so strong that everybody wants to come into the United states and I just ask this simple question yes or no or are you willing to reinstitute that policy you said we're looking at everything and yeah I Will or not and you can say is and what I can say is that\nThere are consequences from coming into a country namely our country illegally I'm not going to ask and again we don't have it but it's the same as Obama OK changing subjects again you are the first president to the United states who\nNever had a political posts before or never served in the military you come up here and you've been here for almost two years what's the biggest surprise and what have you learned\nSince you've been president okay so I always used to

deceit and deception and make a deal with somebody and it's like making a deal with that table give me an example I don't want to give you an example I'm not looking at\nIn the meantime nobody's been able to do what I've been able to do remember that when you look at taxes you look at regulations you look at uh making deals with other countries nobody's been able to do anything like this actually\nMost people didn't even try because they knew that didn't have the ability to do it but\nIt's a very deceptive well the other thing I really learned\nIs I never knew how dishonest the media was I I I really made it I'm not saying that as a sound but I never I never knew how to change the subject to get well no but even the way you asked me a question about separation yeah\nWhen I say Obama did it you don't want to talk about how I when I was going to run your answer but you did it for time I'm just telling you\nThat you treated me much differently on the subject I disagree but I

you can take every legal to ... and you're you can do that that is legal take the doctrines okay\nSo it'd be stupid not to be a massive make any sense yeah if it's legal and if it's that it's there or why wouldn't you yeah you want to be the only one who doesn't know the the key here is to be responsible with\nYour tax code which\nHas never been to Hawaii I think it's thousands of pages long exactly\nHaving played by the rules\nBy the rules you know I bring this up because of Jared Kushner the son of law Donald Trump and a senior White house or a house advisor has paid little to no federal income tax from two thousand nine to two thousand sixteen\nThe report follows the time's piece on Trump and outright fraud during his entire life\nWith me that ended up doing is what that does that doesn't spotlight that Jared Kushner is a bad guy he's probably just fine he he played by the rules the problem is again the tax code and ... who writes the tax code\nOr people who get their wheels greased my life who people who don't want to play taxes you know you got to\nClose loopholes yeah yeah but you know you're a loophole was my vital to shut down that whole thing\nThat had a lot to do with uh the way real estate news I guess we'll uh evaluated and appreciate\nAll and that's what I and other circus yeah yeah I Do like right down to it so that's how he was able to really not have to pay any taxes guinea followed the rules but the rules are thousands of pages of them all written\nBecause of our for some special interest tax attorneys in their ... and they are as his out

don't know come up with some ideas to helping hands wind energy development in Nebraska is that what you hope to do it's a part of this meeting\nWhat we have tried to do a through these conferences I think it's a pretty successful strategy is we sort of identify the pinch points that sort of keep us from moving forward\nAnd then in this kind of Nebraska nice collaborative way we try to figure out how do we deal with that how do we come up with a remedy that works\nAnd and we have sort of been able to do that over time and so we really have taken away a lot of the uh the barriers to development so if you look at where we're at right now in terms of\nA wind development in Nebraska or five years ago we had a four hundred and eighty nine megawatts of wind on line a wind energy today we have fourteen hundred and Fifteen\nOr fourteen hundred and fifty one megawatts of wind so we have almost a thousand megawatts more and and five years and we have a about seven hundred and three ... megawatts\nOf wind under construction\nA that should be on line either you know should be outline next year\nSo or and we've got another seven hundred and thirty to make a lot that is are really far a law in development ah that should be on the next two or three years\nSo we're you know if all of that comes to fruition a you know we're going to a quarter and be knocking on the door of a free

them at the end of the our\nCoach a hobo day is always an exciting day there's always some worry about distractions as well or at least those are things that allow me to keep my job so I could ask you about um every year but the team successfully went through all of that are played well with all three facets and come away with an impressive victory and as we talked about a week ago\nIt's hard to win decisively in valley play you did that Saturday afternoon\nWe did we played a great at times it all three phases\nUm which makes the game easier times we did have one or a event based on hold while they gotta get get blocked in there was late for a walk through we got blocked in Somalia blocked in by a car or whatever and he was late so that least that's what he claims so uh\nUh he did I get to start for the game so fewer their figure out who was that showed up late so\nWell the the Jack rabbits come away with a nice victory but there were some losses one in particular to hit on from an individual standpoint uh in the form of Isaac Wallace the senior running back out of the Omaha area who is really played well this season he's been a key contributor for you for\nFour years I still remember his debut against Kansas a few years ago at how well he ran the ball in that game that helped you beat the Jay hawk or a big twelve program and Wallace goes down and have a freak injury there in the first half gets tackled from behind immediately we knew it was serious and obviously the word we have gotten for his playing career is not a good\nOne yeah his playing career is done and uh yeah that's tough stuff on the team that surely tough on damage stuff on his family\nHe was having such a great year like you said had worked so hard and uh it's a picture of what we what we talk about our program we talk about all the time or last play you know if this was your last play how would you want to be remembered you know and and then he played his tail off\nA and that plan every player had this year disappointed again for him but I think in the end is going to mark all of us in a positive way and we'll all take something positive from\nAnd you've alluded to it so already but Isaac Wallace we had him on the show a few weeks ago I mean it's just such a great kid a positive attitude a big smiley has everywhere he goes a he has an infectious attitude within the\nProgram but yeah he's ... he's a well rounded guy he's with the young man that's also in the choir or he's going to be a doctor he's got his late figured out\nA you know he's a great teammate or you know he's part of a well run back group that share the responsibility and the cheers for his own guys to just uh it's what you want a student athlete and and uh he'll be there once he gets healed up a little bit\nThere'll be with the team but right now is going to have surgery and and uh we get some ... prepared and then start feeling up\nSpeaking of injuries on Saturday or anybody who is there is aware of the fact that it was about five minutes left in the game Youngstown State had a significant injury as well Christian Randall policy one of the starting line backers went down\nObviously very scary situation they mobilized him a card him off or put them in the ambulance we do have some very good news on that front talking with Trevor parks the sports information director Youngstown State\nHe said that Randall Posey actually flew home with the team on Saturday which didn't seem possible when he left a we thought that that could be obviously a potentially life threatening situation apparently it was just a really bad form of whiplash she had trouble with some feelings right away which is why they went through all that\nBut uh once everything calmed down he was fine he was walking around ... pants on apparently when he got on the plane flew home with the team he was in great spirits they say it's a wonderful kid he's doing well and uh obviously that's great to hear as well and\nThe medical staff don't mess around with that type of stuff that there's a a a hint of any type of spinal injury or neck injury they go through the whole regiment and cut the Jersey off and all that stuff and and praise the lord for him being healthy and I'm sure we'll be back playing so\nWith that we should we haven't talked about Charlie Miller yet you having new individual manning are heading up I should say the athletic training ... football this year\nCharlie's or head trainer he'll be down here uh during the year that was a phenomenal job uh you know everybody's different every trainers differ and he's got a a unique approach he likes to push the guy she likes to get to know him really well so he knows a or\nIf they're being honest or not if you will and that just a great addition doorstep\nDo want to highlight our station of the week we have so many stations throughout the jak or to sports network that does help spread the message of South Dakota State University

kick off for the Jack rabbits and the Panthers it'll be on ESPN three but of course we all know you'll be listening at three o'clock throughout the jak rabbit sports network for Alex Parker ... myself so unique and exact description of everything that happens\nAll right let's get to the most important event of the day we have another special guest safety is coach for the jak or but football team ...\nHow are you coach doing great how are you doing while it's great to have you along side and uh we talked a little with ... about if they're coming into the year\nYou lose two guys and Nick Purina Chris bolster played a lot of jak rabbit football and they were very good at the back and not that you didn't have a a plenty in the cupboard but you'll lose two very good players and multiply your daughters and so uh it just to a new starts here when things started in the spring\nYeah you bet to the I Can't say enough good things about those two Boston free now and then who\nAre they are as people are students and then certainly football players and they were great play makers a leader send the biggest gift that they gave the program ah outside of the ... their play was the legacy though that they left and and so the guys in the room are still impacted by those two certainly\nAnd um that's that's the hope is that you continue that trend and and then next year we're talking about slate and Snyder and Romanesque go leaving their mark and uh it then when you can build a culture that's a sustainable so ah coming into this year uh we knew it was going to be wide open competition guys that had played\nUh but uh nothing is going to be handed to you in our program is gonna have to go earn it every day and\nAnd um I give those guys credit to get the guys that are playing a lot and the guys that are maybe their role isn't playing a lot right now are they continue to battle a every day and every week for the betterment of the team and and that's what's special about our culture here\nAnd uh it it's going to continue to be that way\nYou mentioned Alex ... name he was a guest down here a week ago and we talked to Alex too was unable to play here in his final season unfortunately due to an injury but Alex was the guy you were expecting to be part of this rotation in some shape or form he's really stepped up as a leader off the field for you know as a senior\nMan or almost awesome are romas another coach for us uh and he's so smart and he's such a good leader and he's so respected by a group\nOr that it just gives a it gives me support and and and sometimes I'll just have him bring something up to one of the guys just as a as a pier and another player and cause for voice yeah different voice so it's not always me but\nUh I I vividly remember the the conversation at him and I had a when he was injured and didn't know what was going to happen and we took a walk\nAnd we were just walk in and he said coach my biggest fear is is not the health on my shoulder or my career is I just don't want my teammates to think I'm quitting on him\nAnd uh I ... that's the last thing we think of you and um we know that that you need to do what's best for your body and your future and your shoulder working\nAnd are just know that we love you and and no matter what we you know we've got your back with this decision then a couple of weeks later he decided to he's going to have surgery and\nUh but he's been in every meeting he's been locked in he's help helps with drills he takes our weekly quizzes I mean he\nUh he still impacts our football team or maybe just as much you know as if he was playing at just a different way\nNo that's that's awesome to here and so the way things have worked out you have two guys starting who again couldn't be more polar opposites in how they approach things because as we talked about ... ... it's been here since day one of the brain and Snyder who played it I always had a number of knee issues and transfer\nAnd then gets you're basically right as fault camp starts and yet both are well respected for what they bring\nTo the table you but I think you need leaders with different styles and because they're going to impact your room differently\nAnd they got different approaches and their personalities are very different but uh ... they clicked right away a really really the whole group but certainly those two are specially when realm I was a little ... and early on in in camp and then those students started playing together more\nAnd I think ah it's a credit to both of them slay the whole wrong but certainly Slade a was very welcoming to Brandon\nAnd Brandon came in a confident but very humble and knowing that he had confidence in his ability of any news coming into a new environment any couldn't come in or like you knew everything because he didn't and then he had to learn our system which he did very fast and\nAnd uh they uh they have different styles but they work they work well together meeting a leading the group\nAnd a guy whose name maybe didn't jump out to people outside the program coming into the year but it was played a lot made some huge place for you this year it's safety is Josh will match a guy\nWho bet Josh a Joshua sick last year and and we really didn't know what\nIt was and then we've got to figure it out we're talking about that chase current base you know stupid yeah so we're a oh we're blessed to chase entertain to for a number of reasons but\nAh he he's healthy now and and playing like we knew we could and so happy for him because\nHe was putting everything had to uh last year was sick and uh but he uh is incredibly smart knows his strengths and weaknesses are makes plays can play both sides so\nA brand and have been the last few weeks have really been splitting time and actually have a Josh started last week has branded missed a lot of practice with a\nWith a five bruised but um they're both unselfish players where\nIf I was to sell you beyond is now entering this game at tearing Christian would throw for Seventy eight yards and you'd wind going away would you call me crazy\nI would've said in the first quarter now I'd never thought about that again I I think they're really good defense they do play a lotta man demand defense which makes it tough to throw to get a guy open and they are skilled and so credit or offensive staff for that a way to win the game that's our job that's their job and they\nDid we've seen the J Wilson make a significant plays virtually every game this year he's\nComing as a third down back at times he's come in as just an additional weapon for you off instantly ... Wallace had to rely on him even more\nAnd talk about a young man of capitalized on his opportunity sixteen Russia's one hundred Nineteen yard he had the forty eight yard touchdown and the third quarter that was basically the back breaker but he had that huge play in the second quarter that led to the go ahead score\nA CJ ... planet of very high level and just the freshman\nJust a freshman you know initially\nA lot of stuff going on you know we do ... do a lot of things on on a fence and so he couldn't be in and every play because of his youth but he's really gotten up to speed now literally up to speed and I am impressed with him when he gets in the in the open when he gets by Atlanta scrimmage but he breaks a lot of taxes to very fast young man and he's a fun guy to be around\nPlayed without Tyler we're the veteran right tackle played without veteran ... starting at center they both went down a week ago and so Aaron Johnson who played last week it right tackle or he stays in as the starter there\nBut ... Miller to censor and so Miller handled the majority of the ... Center for you are often civil line wise we talked about Evan greenway a little bit already but how do you think the old line held up against a what is a pretty good defense line from Youngstown State\nYou know all that go Kojak I mean he said the tackles played near perfect\nAnd I am side we had some guys make some mistakes but uh you know we we play daddy both a garden center each other and play center so there's a lot of stuff going on in his head and he had the injuries that full full speed yet so really happy with him but he got a couple of guards makes some errors but you know ... Johnson walked on here\nPut 'em on a small scholarship and now he's earned that he's done a great job for us\nAnd of course what the offensive line and all these things you do have a couple of guys starting to get healthy that may be able to help you on top of the group that you had on Saturday\nYeah Austin bone is getting a position to to to play some football and and again you try to ease those guys in and and give them some quality wraps um jak demand has done a really good job but he's been in there is you know not need your guy but really happy with those guys\nAnd you mentioned that 'cause Miller and don't Mandel both have some staff at center right correct yeah so they kinda rotated through things as we said uh other point I wanted to bring up you look at the Brady hail earlier Missouri Valley football conference special team or the week and not just just punting which has been excellent seemingly since the first\nBut it that's the issue but he handled all your kick off duty is instead of change for the Terry on Saturday as well so\nBrings a very skilled\nAthletes and and uh I think he could probably play another position really uh it but he's he's he was a really good kicker add a field goal kicker and high school and a printer\nQuarterback and yeah and when he reminds us of that a lot of these new wants to be an athlete has a but anyway he knew chases dang during the week and he came up to me and said I Would like to have a chance to do the kickoffs and he worked out all we can do really good job of it\nAnd I certainly did well it's a nice when for your program on hobo day in the crowd the atmosphere I had the impression on Saturday\nI Love the energy either for some reason maybe it's subjective thinking but I just feel like whatever the number is there more energetic and in the new stadium than they are and we're in costs alumni and ensure a just being in a new stadium brings some energy of itself for for itself but uh I I\nI'd be I'd be an Arab or didn't say there were four thousand empty seats also loved to have those full and it is for us yeah 'cause the energy we get from the fourteen thousand whatever it is is is great but I didn't get honors or administration arms or ... or honors a president who have stepped up and built this beautiful facility\nWell nice to win for your program over Youngstown State by a final thirty six to seven a couple of other items before we take a break first a page out of the mad manually make a difference manual that every student athlete and the jak or but football program receives during their time here\n[noise] yeah you know go back to the jak right away again\nOr you know I Am a believer and a football is a team first sport you have to do your job as a as a as a team made but I think the prerequisite for success his belief\nAnd it's unique in a college program because you have a hundred and five guys from a hundred and five different backgrounds and you can't have a guy come in and wait to figure out that he believes in your weight program or you're his ... his assistant coach or how we do things we ask them to believe right away and then we're not taking steps backwards are convinced them guys and even more important than\nWhen you hire a new coach when he comes in any instantly believes in his players because that too is a is a defense mechanism idea to recruit these guys I preach belief or all the time in our program and I think it's made a difference\n[noise] All right the other segment that you've created this year ass squares\nOf actual situation ... situations have horses again it happened in the game the scores twenty three seven we're ahead the ball is on the positive thirty nine yard line it was four and seven I Swear to punt\nAnd we needed more room so we sent our a punt team out there and are we called ... and I go out there in Iraq are jumpstart sides and his mom feels bad about it but he's doing his job we back up we put the ball down to the ... yard line we looked like dark so then we looked like geniuses so uh it all works out\nIt was the best part of that was and I don't know if anybody else notice it but Dalton Cox jumps off sides and intentionally does that we all know he's doing it he does it\nAnd after about three slow ... mold throws his hands oftentimes around as if he's all upset about it and it looks around and everybody's laughing and but that caught my eye from the ... thrilled with his arms up just to have a little fun with the proceedings because again it's a well known this was going\nTo have the old paint do a better job of acting\nAnd let's go back to name all cause I forget that you know I'm not in the black field goal that if you don't Cox\nPicks up the ball he's written on the sidelines weaving or that side like the leading down the field and our our sidelines going crazy whose job is to keep everybody else feel ... boy he's grabbing people and thrown back on that is not a ... white because they'll visuals are coming out that white stripe but if you're in there to Fifteen your belly so we got done I walked up during his breathing like you\nJust run a marathon 'cause I'm One of the guys he threw off the lake ... [noise] I Can't\nHelp but notice he did not get the effort award for the week though in a better way to\nSee real quick before we end this Adam ... a little bit to his effort particularly or on the tearing Christian touchdown run\nThat one long long way waved out to the right sideline Anderson stay locked in on his block for a good twenty yards as Christian runs through it's a beautiful shall we have on video that\nA humid that the the point average that it's such a great job in his blocking which gets overlooked sometimes and that's when he was a good locker down with a lot of guys over the years in this program that are excellent blockers in Anderson falls into the category\nThey are and I'm a defensive guy so anytime I see a stark block\nA and I think a defense they said that it's impossible to dominate the defects are wide receivers dominate defense of guys and that that's a credit to coach aren't time that he puts his much stock into as much quality and or an accountability and stopped blocking as he does catching a ball\nAll right so that wraps it up for Youngstown State we are going to preview Saturdays match you up at northern Iowa answer your questions coach staple handled those and more when we come back we're lie to ... sports bar and grill with the John stable my radio\nShow you're listening to the jak rabid sports network ...\nMinutes away from all didn't matter who\nThrow them out you know\nService is wrong we're sixty years let's be\nReal you know the more you wait you monitor these are the challenges of life on the farm\nAs a community bank first bank in trust understands this rural reality we're big enough to help and producers grow for the future small enough to get to know you right now are Agha bankers have Aggie mangroves means will help you work through the top you\nFirst bank in trying real banking really remember FDIC equal opportunity lender\nBelieve feel directors come highly recognized marketing distinction in college athletics across bull divisions were both men's and Women's Sports do you see regimes person for rent solution he missed the Jews and you will\nCome on come on USA Today retail directors come on Twitter or Facebook or feel directors come\nCrowning achievement in college and lately since Nineteen Ninety free\nOr die and I can\nSpeak on behalf of Bud Light and the most sacred up pretty soon you'll gain in my day job only ...
