[noise]\nNuts [noise] miniature looks like troubled times ahead but I'm Glad I gave the oldies real good whack he had it coming\nAnd so jak pushes his raft forward deeper into the woods [noise] darkness has fallen as he continues alone silver path\nAmong trees that resemble rock shots [noise]\nWhere they lead in through the hair of their branches the light of the movie\nWhich reflect the waters of the ever narrow in China [noise] and finally [noise] oh shoot\nThe channels gotten too narrow for the raft I'll have to go from here\nAnd so he starts off on food and has it goes the trees gradually growth thinner ended lengthy looks before him and sees it a clear space that dark blue forests studded with moon lotus as soon as he gauges into the water the season it's smooth\nMirror the image of a woman dancing\nAnd she Chan says she dances with a voice that sounds like a bell\nOf the year like a breeze from the mountains\nGood let's go\nAnd so the swans bind themselves to him by an oath\nAnd jak takes hold of them by the next one in each hand\nAnd the thing that lie away with in the district\nLeaves far behind the eyes of the wrong shocked us going in the sand as they put the rage to see him escape [noise]\nAfter a long while they come down to the edge of the desert [noise]\nJak looks down and sees far below\nThe blues see\nAt a distance in the water\nLike a duck skied jewel on a purple carpeted [noise]\nWith the city on it [noise]\nWhat is that on Monday secret on me [noise]\n\nI mean it's finally the land of the lotus jukebox\nIn his\nIn his delight jak let's go

out of the water like a cork and these before him that long stalled for land\nAnd he shouts for joy\nAnd begins to swim in that direction and his pit helmet come spinning out of the sky like a Frisbee and land just ahead of\nCreeps out of the sea as the sun goes down and overcome\nCreeps out of the sea as the sun goes down and overcome with we're in this\nHe lays down upon the sand\n\nAnd all\nNight long he sleeps\nAnd when the moon rises again fold and round as it to see whether he was told there [noise]\nThe awake [noise]\nFine I met my journey and [noise]\nWhy I'm here [noise]\nAround going to get back [noise]\nBut for whatever reason since that first day I set foot [noise] it's been my say to pursue this chip box\nAnd find it so [noise]\nSo he goes up from the shore [noise] through the streets of the city that lady before and black and white and that raises the silver among [noise]\nBut he meets nobody [noise] it is is empty and dark as a barren room [noise] and silent stone incarnation of the spirit of death [noise] does he wanders\nUp and down it comes at last to a great talent [noise]\nWho's doors stand wide open as though to say [noise]\n\nPasses along wandering without going steps from room to room\nAny interest a door and finds himself in a vast tall\nWhose walls or appears foot tall windows through which the moonlight falls coldest camp\nA moon stones that hang in clusters from the [noise]\nFrom them the nectar falls slowly\nDrop by drop on the floor [noise]\nThe far end of the room on a golden couch he sees lying [noise]\nA dead body covered with the fight [noise]\nCan it be that lives here\nAlone in this in the home\nAnd it moves on slowly\nThrough the lights of the windows in the shadows of the walls\nTill it comes up to the end of the fallen stands beside the couch\nAnd the stoops down over the body and lift up the edge of Paul and uncovers the face [noise]\nIt's\nThe Madonna vampire a\nSo astounded leaps into the air and orders a cry oh and that's just sort of fall with a crash upon McChrystal floor [noise]\nI left to living in ...\nI have traveled for how long and how far I cannot concern\nHere

S. cattle industry where are you pleased with the agreement or ... what do you think about that\nWell unfortunately while the agreement does some very positive things for other sectors said the economy it does absolutely nothing for the U.S Capitol sector in fact it locked in to the bad agreements\nI mean it does absolutely nothing for the U.S Capitol sector and the fact it locked in to the bad agreement that we've had for the past twenty four years\nAn agreement in which we are forced to absorb the over the past or the an overt production in Canada and Mexico and this that presses prices here in the United states\nThe agreement maintains\nThe original rules of origin that says the origin of beef is in whatever country the animal that slaughtered and why we currently import animals from Canada and Mexico and slaughter them here and all the resulting beef deem that the product of the United states of America\nIn the future when the United States Department of agriculture is no longer worried about the foot in mouth disease outbreaks that have occurred around the globe we may well see like cattle coming in here from Australia and Brazil in Colombia and Uruguay\nAnd those cattle will likewise be subject to that follow the rule of origin that says the v for those animals can be labeled a product of the usa and compete directly against the meat produced by us cattle producers\nThat rule of origin should have been changed the administration failed to do it\nIt also failed to include anything to allow the United states to distinguish it ... carrier usa product from the imported products company from Canada and Mexico because there is no country of origin labeling provision\nAnd then there's no provision to protect our industry from in in ... import searches\nWe saw a surge of forty one percent increase in the value of beef cattle import coming from Canada Mexico and two thousand and fourteen and Fifteen and this contributed to the market collapsed that we experience from two thousand Fifteen to two thousand at sixteen\nThere's absolutely nothing then the new agreement that would protect our industry from price depressing import surges that we have already been subject to under the original NAFTA agreement\nWere very disappointed that the administration has failed to include the financial and economic interests of us cattle producers\nWhen they go shaded this new agreement so you'll be sharing this with the ATC then right\nBut we we most certainly will and we're continuing to share it with the U.S trade representatives office right now asking for some improvements to this agreement\nAnd of course then you'll be looking at the some of the other agreements they're working on the Japan bilateral in the deal with the European Union right\nOh that's correct we need to correct this faulty rule of origin in all agree much so we are pressing the administration to make three versions scanned off future agreements\nAnd that's bill Bullard he's the CEO of our cap with this far news foreign Peter Tom writer reporting for five Seventy W.

different set up to chase is kicking the ball as well as any kicker you've had in recent memory and you've got some pretty darn good ...\nSo we we have and and uh I think are a number one that motivates the guy because we had a ... a great history of ... year he's got his uncle to motivate him and and the chase is just a very motivated series young man and has a lot of talent and he has a goal beyond college so uh there's a lot of motivation to be the best kicker\nThirty eight twenty eight was the final on Saturday at Illinois state there is no easy road trip in the Missouri Valley

control that football game and by the time they got some stuff building in the fourth quarter you had a huge lead I Know you will say that you still got to finish the deal but realistically that game was was decided by the time the fourth quarter began your defense was just exceptional in those first three periods in particular\nCrime especially against the run and that that's what the Illinois state wants to do and\nAnd I wasn't surprised but I was impressed with the way we played the run\nYou know people ask well what do you do different we are guys did their job they they came in with a chip on their shoulder and they they left with a a you know some pride about doing their job and doing it very well and and that running backs good player and he had ten yards for the game and so a

Gardner Gardner is really become an excellent tackling the kickoff you'd it seems like we call his name once or twice the game\nBut those guys are pushing those starters and like we've talked about so often defensively if you're not starting you can make an impact on special teams and Gardner is a pure example of that\nI think the biggest thing that they know they are believed in and uh you know we're going to put them in the game and situation that corner of ... going to a red zone guy force and he's had a few interceptions\nDown there and he's really fit a physical tack learn in he understands or is he needs to improve on a ... as well but he's embracing his role a belief that young guy that's got a a\nBoatload of talent and play making abilities still getting comfortable are out there and he's kind of a you know he's he's taken hill Tuesday Wednesday Thursday tracks are important for a young guy you know so he's getting better throughout the week in the season\nA proud of him and then really we talked earlier on our our first meeting as a corner group we talk more about special teams and I think we did corner because all important it is\nA tour football team's success and you know a guy like Lance ... Don gardener enzyme Mosley and in the march on being a poet return or no I mean every guy in the room that we take on a trip is a contributing to a victory I just couldn't be more proud of their effort in their attitude and our energy hum and willingness to improving embrace their role\nIn a kid that to a lot of folks may not know a lot about this is a true freshmen originally from Baltimore obviously you've got to know and the boys town high tide Jay Davis\nHe's a kid that to a U.S smile comes across your face claimed brown space whenever I bring his name up he's a true freshmen he's a puppy with big pauses just going to grow into him and he somebody you guys are really excited\nAbout hey he's big physical athletic a tough smart and he's all the things that you want it was a great leader for that freshman group is doing a tremendous job in the weight room he's played in a couple of games so far or we're going to plan to to play in a couple of more he's got that for game a red shirt and we'll see where that goes but\nUh yeah he's a named to he's got to keep an eye on it and keep track of and so he continues to buy in and do things that Jordan did a at a young age you know he's going to be a a special talent player in person uh and and yeah everybody in jak revelation should be fired up about tied to\nOne thing too about your quarterbacks group and I haven't talked to you about this before today but\nIn the past when you had guys like Dallas brown it linebacker they would stay on the field in past coverage situations because they were formerly a defensive back and you kind of had your own nickel defense already in there where this you're using a lot more if three quarterbacks on the field which other programs used to do and still do but you've done that more this year it seems and you have in the past\nWe just need to maximize everybody's ability to be their best you know I think that's one thing that coach brown has been open to um you know and when you have a guy like Dallas brown he really came in as a corner you know he had some natural cover ability but it's not natural with all the spread off to the teams are running and there are ... things and\nUh for it to keep a linebacker out there just doesn't make sense in in coach said being a secondary guy you know he's always pushed us to get a A R corners and said he's ready to to be able to master different packages and\nIt again you know just it takes time and it takes dedication it takes those guys being a study in film and embracing different roles and then being able to execute in game time and so I think that it's helped us if you've looked at our third down production or this year at the defense it is a night and day different can still can still improved\nA boat from where it was a year ago and I attribute that to those guys getting out there being able to play man's own blitz on allowing coach grounded to have a bigger call she knows third downs and we've had in the past he\nDoesn't get talked about as much as some of the other quarterbacks in the league but your opposition on Saturday Missouri status Peyton use like a quarterback who is they're leading Russia or he can throw the football and they'll spread it out they'll run some triple optional do a lot of different things which present some unique tests for a cornerback screw\nUp until late in the first happened and just some ... some odd scenarios occur starting with what could've been a field goal opportunity for ya\nUh you end up trying for the field goal doesn't quite to reach the cross bar but you had a flag in there a delay a game and you end up punting from across Illinois state territory about five minutes left in the first half Todd ...\nDidn't work out the way we want to talk about that later on in the actual situation as a\nA segment but in the end than we took we got the five yard penalty we did this guy pont which again a radio so good at and our guys cover so well and I think in that one we didn't get it done but uh anyway uh we had a strategy for all that stuff we didn't want to kick that feel go\nOkay so seven seven game they take over deepen their own territory throw a swing pass dispenser Schnell the electric white out as bouncing all over the place and there comes a ... year ward from his interior defensive line position all the way over\nStrips the football as he lands and he looks in the ball just almost falls in his lap and falls or an inch to his right scoop sit right up at a jak rabbit football for a single\nOne of the best part of that is that the amount of guys we had at the ball they danced around a little bit and we had nine of our defensive players there and he kept trying to work for and eventually ... got the ball out and he got through a formal recovery and you get the ball and whatever it was the four or five six yard line you'd better get some points out of it and are often so I got a touchdown\n... Daniel five yard touchdown around then you kick the ball off they fumble the snap\nYou recover it had an interesting play with tearing Christian where he tries to flip the ball backwards after he passed a lot of scrimmage it ends up going forward in the end zone initially wrote a touchdown they reverse it on ... and one play later he throws a touchdown pass the Jacob Brad anyway\nBut now it's Twenty one to seven and back to ... Illinois state your defense comes up with turnover ...\nYeah let's go back to ... play we convert in that same type of play later on in the game and then in our in our last dry we try to run it again he's wide open again any over throws the ball but that was that is a unique looking play but yeah we got points out of it took a little while to get a Jacob browse catch was really good because there are a lot of people are on their\nFront of 'em so a big catch and again like his brother said uh Jordan was excited for\nIt was a heck of a thrill to by tearing Christian and then a minute later after you for ... an eighty one yard Christian to Johnson touchdown pass and you go from seven seven with five minutes left in the half to twenty eight seven Europe at the break and you talk about momentum in the favor of the Jack rabbits that certainly was the store while I was in it and\nUnfortunately or fortunately in our in our case this game that is football and those of you that are Vikings fans which I'm not a fan of any pro football ... last night\nIn the Vikings game and you know a play here and then all of a sudden it's totally different football game so we preach door guys you better be ready to make a play when you're on the field because it can impact the game and you just talked about a number of plays it impacted the game\nCareful the wounds are still open and knew what the Vikings their coach Mike ... Daniel twenty attempts for eighty four yards and the game as the leading Russia and the officer civilized the game went along was able to really start to take control and a big part of that what's happening less ... back in the lineup he took the majority of the stamps as your center on\nSaturday West is a great football player is a great leader of the sense of line he's a highly intelligent a sort of have him back not only allowed him to make plays but are\nAligned guys make checks do those types of things and that goes way behind the scenes way deep but it makes a difference and a credit to my key in our office of coordinator and staff to to stick with it because those yards at the end of the game getting those first downs using up the clock were important in the football game\nCay Johnson eight catches for one hundred and thirty one yard see us third in the valley and receptions he leads the conference in receiving yards he's he's the only man averaging better than eighty one yards per game in the valley and receiving yard signs up at Ninety eight\nFor an average per game a he has had a tremendous here and we talked about how you're not really going to have a go to receive or this year with when it came and got her ... Johnson is sort of stepped into that role\nHe has and and when you have that then coach I just go John Hi ms position coach the whole crew a then started designing place to try to get in the ball or whether he's on the edge you know that again that a\nPlay that turned throws the ball late and the one he talked about on the goal and that was designed to go to Kate that he's a good player any any age at work or as little as he is and as as much as he gets yet I'm Amazed at how well he plays in a football game so excited he's jak ram it\nHow good is your defensive line playing right now\nI thought they play tremendous I mean if you just cut out Ryan ... play in that game you went to see a picture perfect a\nDefensive line play defense and play you guys doing more than you expect out of a guy you know he's in the sea gap which is inside the tight end guy block symbols goes outside across the face and goes takes on another black and then makes the tackle that's phenomenal but\nThat's just keep it simple asking guys to perfect their their trade and then they go with big hearts and play hard\nI Would be remiss if I didn't bring up Brandon Snyder's name what an interception he had on Saturday I Do talking to him today will be our video feature on our Thursday or go jacks dot com or release but brand name was so excited\nInterception he had on Saturday I talking to him today will be our video feature on our Thursday or go jacks dot com or release but\nBrand it was so excited about that place that held the ball there's nobody around I just went running for it I didn't think I get there and then the son was in my I I mean he would have thought it was games over the world series the way you describe this play to me but a play by him because the ball was thrown to nobody insider goes it makes a tremendous diving\nPick yeah yeah I had a great play in the game they also had I think in a psychic he recovered which is equally as important in the game uh but yeah that was the leftist feed the dog and made the play and hung on which is huge his forte is defending the run so for him to make that play as really special\nTalked about how good ... Elizabeth ... hits another long field goal Cay Johnson had a seasoned best kick return for ... return game you throw Jackson ... back there a couple of times I thought it was Snyder at one point to realize there was only ... out there yep you the truth freshman at a couple of nice returns special teams game again was solid for your Saturday\nYou say it was our our yard kickoff team has never been better coach Bergstrom is doing a great job with those guys you talked about individuals that are doing great jobs are those guys to do great jobs have to have the all eleven guys doing doing their job and and we have a great emphasis on special teams and our guys execute when they go out on the field\n... thirty eight twenty eight on the road at Illinois state will get to your question just a moment for the head coach you can walk him up here to the table or find me on Twitter at ... at J. yes an audio lasted about five or six minutes from now do you have a page out of the Mad Men you will be a booklet that all the jacket football players are given every year\nI I don't have a page I'm going to just go uh uh you hurt Jordan say it again you heard all our senior saying\nAbout how the program and I'm at I'm Talking about the program on the program makes a difference in their life affects them in their life and it starts with a madman starts with our philosophy when we recruit well we talked to young man we don't specifically talk about the madman you but we talk about the program\nAnd this is my my my sales pitch verbatim I tell them we're not better than anybody but were different I promise you are different\nAnd our program all investing academically\nWill invest in yet obviously football wives will invest in you as a as a servant and we're going to invest in your spiritually and and all those things are a young man should be looking to grow in searching for answers when they're here in South Dakota state\nAnd that's why I think you hear seniors come up here say this is an unbelievable program because our coach is a truly truly love\nTheir players and invest in them and it's it's just fun for me to be part of that\nYou have a situation you wanted to discuss with us as part of the brand new award winning segment here on the chance to go my radio show known as ass square\nI think the ninth week we got to quit saying it's brand new but a a I've got two of them I've got to them they both occurred in the game the first one uh uh if you watch the\nGame are center her long snapper and the PAT was hit and they call the personal files so it was a Fifteen yard penalty going tacked onto the kickoffs or kicking from fifty to thirty five well\nTradition as you kick in the end zone you get the ball to the twenty five you know you don't get much as well my philosophy as you kick\nGame when law which means you kick a real high kick off make them catch it at the five or ten which is where it should be when you can't you know ... with the distance when you kick it normally from the thirty five and make them make the decision to fare cats from here on out with that situation we're not going to kick it through the end zone\nYou know case when the kids to the field I was going to chase the field or to get to say I never kick off for the little league puts the ball in the middle east so anyway a new strategy is going to be game and a lot after that the only the second one goes back to your ears your a question about the field goal\nOr the officials are thought we were going to turn that when we tried to kick belong feel go so when we got out there I'm I'm kind of yelling at Brady I'm saying snap the ball snap the ball he couldn't snap the ball because officials were standing on the ball over the ball the umpire was because they thought we're kicking apart and they have a different configurations\nAnd pot than they do and feel go so they really got the time that the\nDelay of game penalty so all you that were mad at me it's on the referee and the umpire so the referee comes over and and I said what happened and he went through it all and I said do we get to play over and he said no you don't so our new special situation is where we have a long feel go we need to tell the official or chicken to feel go rather than\n... a long story for a short answer ...\nWe're not going to tell them at night that story he doesn't need another reason to hate officials holding back with more of the jobs tickle my radio show we're live from ... sports bar and grill comedy jak rabid sports network familiar feel [noise]", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Yankton", "day": "29"}
