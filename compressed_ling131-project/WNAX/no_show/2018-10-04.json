review of bread cabin on Christine Ford has now been delivered to the White House a copy of that is going to go to Capitol Hill they're going to take a look at it tomorrow Mitch McConnell already says there will be a vote on friday or Saturday about the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd where does that leave our friends in the Democratic party\nWell it leaves them kind of grasping at straws\nThere are saying well some of us have read the other six background checks done on judge Brett Kavanaugh all of which clear to him for the high level government jobs he had at places like the White House and on the federal court of appeals one of the most sensitive positions in America\nAnd they're they're combing through those things seeing if they can find some other kind of dirt that they can swing a judge Kavanaugh and I think the Democrats realize there quickly being made to look like fools they don't have anything to depend on the now well\nThey're saying that previous background checks may show inappropriate behavior they will smear this man no matter what\nYou know this is one of those situations where the bit into a situation and they didn't know exactly what what the what they were going to get\nWhat they got was they had hoped they would scare Brett Kavanaugh into withdrawing his own name or Donald Trump into withdrawing his name for him and they didn't get that so they had to stick with it they say we know is there as I told you\nTo some extent they seem like that young boy who always wanted his former dad to give him a pony\nAnd on a couple of

calling them a shooter and not a killer but it appears that he is a cop killer and perhaps well we can just say a prayer or the other police officers were wounded in I mentioned\nA moment ago about the emergency presidential alert system was told it today and I got that message and it kind of reminded me that uh uh about a year ago I was on a flight to Washington DC with my producer\nAnd we're on a regular commercial flight we're sitting back and coach where we usually are and uh and I we we were sitting there on the runway and the ...\nAnd I said we've got a ground stop we can't move the plane to the gate and unload all you folks because we've got a thunderstorm going on and right before all the rain and the wind and the lightning and the under rolled over the top of that plane I saw something I'd never seen before\nYou know usually when you land in a plane people pull out their cell phone and they call the person who's going to pick 'em up at the airport or they call their sweet hard like I Do and\nTell Tina that I'm safely on the ground every single phone\nIn that plane lit up at the same instance lit up and began ringing all the same time we all come out and looked at each other and laugh it was under storm alert and that's the kind of thing you will routinely in different places now\nWe have the ability of the president of the United states to send a message to the whole country and I wanted to know what our tech expert Brian Westbrook taught about that Brian welcome back to the program things\n... and if it sounds a little bit louder I'm walking out of a tech conference we had here in Seattle, Washington I was at the gate choir summit and there was about a thousand of us are gathered in the room\nAnd at eleven Eighteen Pacific time when the alert came through we were watching that alert of light up everyone's phone and we had everyone's stand up and kind of a fun little moment we it was an interesting experiment it was a great use of technology was kind of\nWe're not sure how would play out would it be on time with everybody receive I'm at the same time and for the most part you just heard sample set up about a thousand and you can watch the video on my Twitter feed a ... Brian Westbrook knew it was really funny just to watch everybody stand up and within about a minute I Would say\nUh everyone received the alert and it looked like most everyone in the room received it we didn't see a whole lot of people that didn't I think some people were buried in their work or checking their email and not paying attention to us on stage but other than that everybody seemed to receive the alert\nAnd seemed to receive in this case not very important information it was just a a test methods no action required a and then I made a joke earlier today I said please now everybody let's not hit reply all\nThat would just say are of course not only can you not reply to this message which I think some folks would would love to be able to reply to a presidential text message but you also cannot unsubscribe on like a thunderstorm warning that you talked about you can opt out of those\nYou can also opt out of amber alerts you cannot however and and I think rightly so opt out of president solar there is a threshold you're not going to be hearing political messages they tell us these are for extreme cases a major natural disasters nuclear attack\nThat sort of thing hopefully we never received another one of these but that system is in place and it seems like any way it worked for the most part I've been tracking a couple of isolated incidents where phones stopped working for some period of time\nUh obviously those can be some bugs and the software it's going to need to be improved but generally speaking at towns like everything was success\nAs long as you're in the modern era now Brian I did get an email from a guy who's a regular email or I get about nine hundred thousand emails a day\nAnd this man emails from time to time I recognize who's handle any road to me and said I didn't get the message but all my co workers and I said sir you have an older phone don't chew and he may have been one of those guys like my father in law was until recently who stuck with who's tried and true flip\nPhone and he wasn't going to give it up on my father in law\nFinally gave it up and he seems to be enjoying it\nA ... but this guy said that and I said well you just need to get a new phone how old do you have any idea how old the phone would have to be that it wouldn't get that message\nAnd actually do have to be that old I think I think and I'm I'm just making this up but I have in my head that it's about five years old if you have a phone that that old\nYou may not be able to receive these messages because of course the software has to be built into the phone but if you have an Android or an Iowa phone of really any generation like any recent generation if it's currently supported\nYou'll definitely have access to this feature a so you're talking about folks that don't have smartphones or have phones that are so old they're not being support and they're not being updated\nSince this technology was rolled out a number of years ago\nAnd I also want to say that it does you can be in areas where you just won't receive a signal\nOr the ... there were a lot of folks joking earlier on social media today that if you put your phone in airplane mode\nWell then you won't received a message either so there are different cases where you wouldn't received a message but I got to say if I'm near anyone at all unless I have my head in the sand or I'm Out on a remote island\nI Will hear about this weather it's not for myself it's from the Ninety percent or Ninety five or Ninety nine percent of the people in the room that do get dealer hopefully one of them will tell me to take cover necessary\nHey let me ask you about something you know we're doing to the point when when there was wife I was first available on a hotels always charge for these days why probably is becoming like color t._v. and electric light every every hotel is giving at least some level of service\nAirplanes are on their way to doing that in fact there's a new a new satellite system that I understand it's going to go up seven or eight hundred satellites are going to get launched\nWhere they say that stuff's going to go right to airplanes and at some point probably airplane why will become at least at the basic level will be a a regular part of the service if we had been hooked up to air airplane why fi I use that occasionally to work while I'm flying from coast to coast would I've got the signal then [noise]\nI Believe so and it was ... I actually talked to a friend of mine who's a flight attendant for what are the major carriers and he said he learned today and and he thought I was surprised to learn you weren't really surprised that over half the plane had not put their phones in airplane mode\nWent on\nDuring the play I don't I don't know for sure if he was connected to why fire if they were on the ground or or or low enough that they were able to pick up ... but I thought that was kinda funny little anecdote out about these emergency alerts as we know which ones have you have your phone on silent and still receive dealer and I imagine that was a little bit of chaos I mean airplanes\nThey let me ask you this ... there was a big alert about Facebook and cybersecurity is this what should people do about this [noise] you\nKnow there's been some advice floating around and I I've actually subscribe to this for some time that you should not use Facebook to sign into other websites and here's why because you're putting all your eggs in Facebook's basket if you will you're trusting them to rent the to keep your information safe and to keep your sign in and you're lugging secure\nAnd unfortunately they've shown as frequently but they may not be the best equipped to do that or they may not be doing as good of a job of keeping your information secure ah with with something fifty million accounts being compromised we don't know if they have access to these third party sites when used Facebook to sign into another site\nAnd that's actually even more troubling in my opinion than than them being able to say yes you were a compromise the fact that they just don't know he's a little scary so my advice would be this using email to sign up creating unique password for everything and if you say to me than I Know you're going to well that's a pain I Can't\nRemember I don't know I use I use different logging names and and and I do use for everything I Try and make him unique\nAnd you should and if you do if you're not as diligent as lawyers or myself what you do is you sign up for one of these password manager is like one pass or even use your operating system to do it for you take the heavy lifting off you but if you're not\nFor every year on as soon as I have access to your um you know mom and pop online shopping by compromise that information I now have access to your bank I now have access to your social media profiles your email everything\nAnd once you use the same password you log in one site if nothing else you can take it from one that I can log into every site you could ever possibly logged into it just lazy and it's irresponsible\nIt would have to be something so bad that you would get well until until the until and unless the Democrats have a majority in both the house and the Senate is not going to happen period and even if they did get a majority in in both house and Senate\nThe idea that you get enough Democrats who would say whatever it is that he is said to have done ten or twenty or thirty or almost forty years ago is bad enough that we should remove him\nExtremely unlikely very very unlikely that answer your question\n... ... it does um but my main concern is um you know all this came up what law of the week before his final confirmation you know it didn't it\nCame up in July and then a Democrat Senator by the name of Feinstein or as the president calls her Feinstein or decided to sit on the information and I think that was a calculated move because she thought if I bring this up in July\nWe would they would have routinely asked him about it behind closed doors and said did you ever sexually assault this woman she says you did\nAnd he would have said no and that might have been the end of it at that point the Democrats could have decided to go for the Hail Mary pass and say we're going to ask\nHim about it in public under oath and they could have asked him again they could have had it investigated just as the FBI's looked into additional facts over the last few days\nAnd the same result would have happened and instead\nThey thought and I'm telling you I I can ... I Would bet money said this is what they did this is what Feinstein did she said I'm going to hold this information I'm gonna wait as she did until all of the hearings are over our opportunities to officially ask him about it and\nHave all been gone by and we're about to vote\nThey were within days of the vote\nAnd then I'm going to drop this bomb and what they've become accustomed to is this kind of guerilla warfare\nTo this blitzkrieg approach where you say if we drop a big enough nasty end up sex bomb on Brett Kavanaugh\nEither he will decide to withdraw his own name saying I don't want to drag my family and myself through that or the president will look at it and say wow I'm not going to stand up for that I Know this is going to be a rough go so the president withdraws his name or Kavanaugh was draws his name he was basically a giant bluff\nLike playing poker you you you don't have any cards in your hand you shut your whole pile of chips into the middle and you hope that everybody else at the table says wow you know Kyle must have a one heck of a hand he's gotta\nHe's got a royal flush or he's got something special in that hand and they all cave in what they didn't count on is that we have a different America today at least for some people we have a president with a backbone who doesn't take Bernie Sanders lightly\nAnd we have people like judge Kavanaugh who do not take this stuff\nAnd just immediately cave in now you and I both know there are plenty of Democrats who cave easily and there are plenty of rhino Republicans who came easily they were counting on a cave in so that they never have to actually prove that they had a hand that they had a you know so far of a kind or something and it didn't work\nAnd now they don't know what to do and they're trying to ... they're they're trying to salvage this\nJust to clarify hoard actually came out with us ally when the Democrats well\nNot came out with ... anonymously made the complained to her rap or member of Congress who brought it to find scene and then they sat on it they did not ask the FBI\nWhat tiny July, July yeah so\nThat's that's life also although it it it you know I sat on it and it didn't do anything about it that's a problem it is it's real politic and it\nAnd say why it not only in say Israel all modeled\nAs soon as they as off\nAnd imagine this but if what you let's say your daughter some day is about to marry some net where you don't want the marriage tapping but you're heading right for that wedding day and you think there's nothing I can do I know\nIs it might send my daughter down and say look you're intended husband is a dirty dog and here's the information and you're hoping she won't look at it too hard\nAnd you're hoping she'll just call up say I'm not marrying you the wedding is off boom and blow the whole thing up now if you give her that information three months out from the wedding and she says that this isn't true all sit down and talk to him about it and the man sits down says look I can I can show you that\nThis didn't happen what your dad is accusing you could imagine now what would you say about a person would try to use that kind of bomb\nTo blow up a relationship and in a way this is a relationship between the man who is going to be\nThe next justice on the Supreme Court and this wonderful ... you've got the Lars Larson show [noise]\n[noise]\nNo matter\nHow modern your family might be if you're pedaling around that rock and a gas engine vehicle you're living in the past\nMe the era the electric vehicle has a ride with the salaries and electric cars are more fun to drive and more affordable than ever electric cars are here again to the president learned more plug into the present dot com or something like ... ...

give voice to my opinion you think I'm wrong about things I'm Glad to take those calls we've tried to make this a different kind of program over the last twenty plus years\nAnd we do that by saying we want to hear both sides of the story in fact we invite Democrats and liberals and progressives and all those folks on to this program they usually say no because most of them know that their ideas their values their point of view\nDo not stand up to scrutiny ask him a few hard questions and they fold up like a cheap suitcase but we invite them all the same and invite my critics in the audience to call as well\nTell me where you think I'm wrong now the Senate has passed a final version of an opioid package this afternoon we'll send it to the White House just in time for lawmakers to campaign

eight six six eight ... eight six six four three nine five to seven seven emails go to talk at Lars Larson dot com well thanks to Bernie Sanders and cause you of Cortez young Alexandria socialism\nBit of a rebirth among us millennials and that's been a tough one for me to wrap my head around so I thought we'd go to David to row who's\nThe founder president and chief executive officer of the independent Institute and the publisher of the independent review David welcome back to the program\nSecularists glad to hear\nWell I'm I'm Glad you're here too but when I'm not glad to see millennials attaching themselves to socialism and I guess I see this is kind of a watershed change in America\nI think I can speak for myself accurately the when I left high school about forty years ago and everybody would which was on the ... the late Nineteen seventies where the tail end of Jimmy Carter's Virgil recession and things were looking kind of bleak before Ronald Reagan came in\nBut I remember almost every one I knew in school couldn't wait to move out of mom and dad's house and strike out on their own weather was to college or a job get their own apartment pay their own bills be responsible for themselves\nWhat's happened between then and now that has millennials say a word we don't want to move out a mom and dad's house and by the way we'd like the government to pay our bills for us in a social setting\n[noise] well a lot has happened uh the government has grown enormously not just in spending and regulation but in debt and the opportunities that the millennial generation face have been greatly reduced\nOr as a result there they've come to become somewhat cynical a understandably and we found that according to the major surveys of millennials which includes the work of the research center and the Harvard Institute of politics\nThat millennials have a landed on essentially five questions [noise] um because they feel constrained with little opportunity and the five questions are how they pay off their student loan debt how can make it a good job [noise]\nHow come they ever afford a house how can they afford healthcare that that that is going to be right for them and why is the government spying on [noise] and [noise] the results of this is a millennials have lost confidence in sort of the American system\nUm and ah David looking around for answers but they don't know who to trust [noise] so the uh of course millennials were not around pretty much during the Cold War they didn't know about the reality of socialism\nIn the Soviet Union and the eastern bloc and so forth and even in China in some respects [noise] so to them the idea is how do they make ends meet and uh as human beings they're open to getting free stuff [noise]\nSo the other factor that came into play was they are coming out of the uh the public school system and out of college as\nA base for the narrative taught us the progressive narrative that government is a solution to everything\nAnd they believe that they've been taught to believe that the the two thousand eight\nRecession the great recession was caused by capitalism and free markets are words that greed drove this problem and as a result the American system bailed out people who are responsible for it even though the reality of it is that it was federal policies that created the bubble\nAnd then the bailout just made it a continuous actually instead of having the economy it correctly\nAdjust to the problem [noise] so what we found was there's an opportunity to actually to reach millennials millennia but maybe it'll generation is the largest generation American history it's about eighty three million Americans and since they don't watch the six o'clock news they don't read the newspaper or magazines\nThey get most of their information from\nYouTube as far as news and entertainment\nSo we developed a video series to target and when he holds a not so much a series of videos that is preaching to them about what to think but more of a story that especially if features millennials figuring out these five questions and it's funny it's a satire\nAnd I'm the first season of it uh the series is called love of a has reached over eight point two million combining views on YouTube [noise] we've just released the second season about a week ago and it's similar to the sky rocket\nUp and we're we target mainstream millennials in the process [noise] and the results of this is I'm young people seeing through the the narrative the progressive narrative and also the view that they can get something for nothing\nIs there a possibility that we could go back and reach his on this all sounds great and I'd like to help you know remind people of it and have them pass it on\nCan we go back to some of the kids as early as high school and persuade them that they're being sold a bill of goods when they're told that all of you should go to college and I think that's that's a real mistake because teachers Bush should because they are largely college educated married the other college educated professionals usually\nAnd then they told their students who is the only way to go college and what we have is a college degree is diminishing value in part because so many people have them they used to be a relatively rare thing\nAnd I talk to economists said realistically what percentage of of workers in a society like ours should have degrees and they say\nYou know twenty eight maybe twenty eight percent at most ... thirty at the top and the other Seventy percent should have some skills and training but not for years of college that ends up being worth as you point out the reason they have a tough time paying for their college\nBecause they find out it doesn't enhance your earning ability enough to even pay for itself\nIt'd be like buying a machine that produces ten dollar a gallon gasoline you say well what am I going to do with that I can you know I ... I I'm paying a bunch of money for a machine\nThat makes gasoline that's more expensive than the gasoline I can buy the palm why would I Do that why would I buy a college degree that cause a hundred thousand dollars that you know boosts my pay by three dollars an hour it'll take me the most of my life to pay for it\nAnd that doesn't make sense and and get I get to them early\nSent the escalation of college tuition costs has gone up I don't have the numbers in front of me but a a huge\nWe largely um increase over any other major factor that people are facing as far as cost and the pay is of course enormous as you mentioned over time with the student loan debt problem [noise] ah\nWhat Obama did was he nationalize the student loan programs I Believe it or not in the Obamacare measure\nI'm part of the reason they did that was because [noise] uh they actually viewed Obamacare as a way to appeal to young people and get them to become dependent on the federal government and hence to keep voting them in a for other various ... century measures [noise]\nYou're right it it it's a great distortion and\nOf of universities and colleges is enormous most colleges in not just the so called grievance studies of gender race and so forth but also in many of the social sciences\nHas been taken over by a sort of cultural Marxist view um that really doesn't educate people and miss educate people so that's part of the story of the love go series is his college where the worth it and if it is why it's worth it and change that [noise]\nHow do you see through the to the false narrative that people are being given\nThe nice thing about the love series is that is funny and is enjoyable and us millennials figuring out these questions in their lives a story essentially is of a young woman in college his name is Alexis she and her best friend\nLet's get more with us the offices of history because the only thing that criminals listen to the only language that they understand it's a good guy with a guy\nSays right and and I was going to say that if you go back I think it's to maybe Nineteen eighty four was the number of guns in private possession closer to two hundred million in about Nineteen eighty so we come home come forward\nOr not quite forty years and we have doubled the number of guns in private possession in America which by the anti gunners logic\nIf you double the number of guns you're going to see twice in violent crime or or maybe more so and instead we've seen a drop over the last thirty or forty years in violent crime in this country so the evidence the evidence of the number is is that more guns in in the hands of law abiding citizens means dramatically less crime\n[noise] you're exactly right liars and and and the thing to remember is that almost any statistic that you look at for example is New York times\nThey're only port they talked about two thousand Seventeen were eleven thousand people murdered by by criminals with guns in that same year at the FBI came out now granted these are very conservative FBI numbers face\nThey did it a hundred and twelve thousand a non police individuals to send in their lives with cars now if you look at research by Dr ... collectors significantly even more but even those\nUltra conservative numbers ten times ... times more good things happen with guns and bats ...\nAnd and and I guess this this is just that if we could get even more guns if we made government policies more friendly toward people having conceal carry I mean Tim you know I make a nice living you make a nice living if I I bought a new Walter pistol last week uh I have a number of pistols\nBut what I Wonder about is the ability of the average person out there who lives in a place like California where they make it very expensive\nTo be able to get a permit even the bat and makes it a little bit ridiculous because\nYou have to take classes and you have to do this and you have to do that by the time you're all done\nAn average person might have to drop a thousand dollars all totaled to be able to have the permit have the gun practice and and be properly equipped to do that well for an awful lot of wage earners a thousand dollars of discretionary income is is a big chunk\nOf the family's budget over even a couple of years even though it is it's great security but if you can afford it\n[noise] as long as I couldn't agree more I mean the fact that if you have to spend\nThat much money to exercise natural or like\nI eat the permits and all that stuff that's that's just wrong especially in the United states of America we're seeing our country is is based on the concept of the personal freedoms and and that's another point the ironic thing is that the cities and states that have the highest levels of crime or the areas where\nThe toughest support the law abiding citizens to get the guys and and that's I mean to me that's a travesty\nAnd I know that because I have a nice income actually kind of live in a Heinz fifty seven neighborhood they're nice house and they're not so nice as their houses ... nicer there my house and their houses that are not as nice and I think\nThese are people who work hard for you know to make their living and uh and they should have the same kind of protection I Do even though if you live in a nice neighborhood\nYou're ... you're a lot less likely to fall victim to crime the ugly truth is\nThat most criminals are poor\nAnd most criminals prey on the poor people around them in poor neighborhoods and you know the the stance bear that out so if you say you know if we could make it easier and say that the government says we'll waive the fee for getting a concealed carry permit\nIf you have an income below such and such not give them any money but just say if you want to get the permit man you're below a certain income you know we we give out free cheese we give out foods damned all these other things how 'bout waving\nThat's for people below say below the average uh in in income and make it easier for them to do it and put the fear of God did all the criminals out there\nThat will you're exactly right because that is the only thing that puts your daughter criminals that\nIs a a a ...\nViolent response that's what they're afraid of and the good news I mean that's an interesting new laws but the good news is that there's many states are actually going in that direction but even more ... in the sense of touch to to show Jerry so right now we have twelve states\n... states that was pretty much said All right we trust are sort of a security guard you have to ask for a permit you don't have to ask us if we can defend ourselves and I personally think that's fair\nTo I Love it it's constitutional carrying imagine what would happen

Ali Baba the Amazon of China that are doing very well and doing very well for western investors so that's an okay picture\nI get I gather the central bank is basically decided to um ease up a little bit on the money supply basically make a little bit more cash available and that has been able to get the country's true right\nThat's exactly it they basically after tighten credit for awhile and shutting down some of the riskier pass\nFemale star are starting to open the speak again and they're hoping to a few close in small businesses will have a lot of employees to keep employment unfortunately it looks like a lot of the credit just going to go to the state for the most inefficient so this is really not good for China's long term structural growth\nBut it's just the way the Chinese system operates\nUh we have about a minute Andrew I'm I'm most interested in the Chinese confidence\nIs that the country can grow without an accommodation with the United states is that correct\n[noise] while there they were not happy about it\nBut she took care of the president is dealing with you know king that\nKeeps dealing with um attempt to cut down on pollution he's got a lot of domestic problems here looking at a carpet registration that hardly knows what it does from day to day so his attitude is if I Can't control it I'm going to happen to deal with like control domestically\nSo um they're kind of stuck and there's not much more they can do [noise]\n... is the managing director of the Aryan capital research he is in Hong Kong this morning where the weather is better and he's the author of shadow banking and the rise of capitalism and China Gordon Chang the Daily Beast I'm John bachelor [noise]\nYour chance in a brand new Vodafone as close as participating with Lynn Ford dealer stopping what's your name in the box cross your fingers your name will be drawn as one of them are fifty seven she qualifiers you enter next live broadcast where you can register to win\nA we just read tonight that a a great effort is going to name a the perpetrators of cyber attacks by the end of like minded countries you know when we developed this a cyber deterrence initiative\nAnd aggressively go after the perpetrators a you know in in here from an international law coalition perspective uh that's really what's needed to start putting pressure on these bad actors and so now that we have a new strategy\nI'm looking to see that our government is is is going to implement it and it looks like we really are\nAre beginning to implement this new strategy and remember\nThat part of that is uh that uh they're taking the gloves off\nBy and providing authorities offensive cyber operations which is really key\nTo have it I don't know the answer to this so forgive me ask a question I didn't I didn't mention before to the north Koreans work with the Russians and the Iranians in cyber theft [noise]\nA clear but I it it it certainly would be logical I mean the north Koreans work with the Iranians on a missile technology on nuclear weapons I you know I mean\nYou look at the uh the transfer of technology I and so I I'm sure that there is collaboration then of course fine and you know I as St probably with the Russians as well I think all of these hackers and it means people that operate in the cyber realm\nI think they're ah they're sharing best practices\nAre and they all learn from each other and so they can you know and\nOf course if North Korea does something that's useful others can pick up on that and in North Korea one thing we know about them they are very good at learning or from others and so I have no doubt that they're trying to gain any kind of a skills and information from the Russians from the Iranians from the Chinese\nAnd the you know to improve their capabilities and and so again this is why we really need to focus on this threat\nThirty seconds some people say that the best North Korean hackers are trained by the Chinese and the Russians as well [noise]\nI I Would not to I Would not be surprised if if that's that is the case but you know the north Koreans are pretty confident on their own and and so you know they\nUh you know they're not as advanced disruptions in Chinese but but they are developing the capability and of course and that's something we really\nNeed the one million dollars from the Federal Reserve bank of New York have got to be pretty good David Maxwell foundation for the defense of democracy and ladies and gentleman change your passwords I'm John ... coach we just didn't today John had very wide part very why\nOh\nBalance of nature's fruits and veggies in a capsule I care once in a while ago I was walking\nAnd find her right\nRight right and I don't know when it happened I had the actor accept that in my hand and my great and I guarantee that\n... ... ...

I mean look at every single country hate each other out there and they're ready to bomb each other for almost nothing but anyway real quick to us my dad moved to New Jersey I think in my career as a special ed teacher\nOr ice that work with kids who didn't have any qualities that the future characteristic that normal people have this war began to feel like I was blessed George ... uh you have to work with these kids to appreciate that that's when I started trying to pay back\nFor just being normal so I thought my prayer life I always had a prayer life when I started a parallel prerequisite for white had this ... [laughter]\nI mean it's for kids that have nothing going from I even had some kids in my classes\nSo I had these terrible Kansas and I would draw for them and they always they want the joy so that would give them like coloring books in crayon and they would try so hard to keep those those those are ... that the ... in in the lines are numbers more but some of them had says terrible cure cancer say they would rule\nFollow in ... or ... coloring they withdrew al ... was in school you were at\n... yeah I mean the special ed teacher had different classes you know and just happened to be in these classes it was yeah children like that okay I bought a clean it up for\nThem it was nothing to rule because they did that all day long so that they didn't mean anything to them and uh so yeah the anti but you know they were learning the skills that they were never going to you is you know there was no real cure for them back to and even today just really no cure\nSo as a special I teach I had a lot of time in my hand and that the kids need to two hours to belong to the teacher said would help feed them there's no papers to correct the bigger kids that hadn't been in the room\nTo move back as long as I enrolled is you know when you see a tractor trailer pull up to a warehouse and they put out there was only in roles and put the boxes on him to shut them down and\nYou know there's a lot of them don't you know\nThey're so this is me this go supply I enrolled us in my class sideline if the kid I can\nTell the kid get it box put it on the island world he was flooded down to the next kid they get they would open it up to fight it down to ... put something in and fly down to the next ... tape and you know so that's what they did so I had plenty of time so George I know how to walk and so I said bought tend to the nightclubs and I believe this is a real prerequisite of what why they steam and came to this house\nWe doing two jobs John\nYeah I'm a native ... being a special ed teacher didn't take up much of my time at a two hour lines I didn't have papers to correct you know so I decided you know it gets going to do this so [noise] so um yeah so uh uh ... you know people at night that they're looking for fun now a lot of\nUm real estate and the people but there was a certain percent of people out in the dark side of things these people are like little wicked have looking for a cause alcohol or drugs or commit adultery anything they can get their hands on and a good portion of these people were atheists they went to the coast a little bit\nOf joy I can get along with anybody I can relate to anybody that is type of behavior didn't even bother me back there but over the years I noticed that a lot of these people die from\nAccidents like car accidents overdoses suicide cancers and [laughter] and I bought it with these people and and I knew them you know\nBut I felt that these people like ships in the night without a runner any way or the\nTime but take them though the wind was blowing that was fine with them and they died in a state that I thought nobody should die\nThen we're the last rings unusually high\nYeah unbelievable and so um\nYeah I just didn't think they knew how to live I mean that's another thing is because the teacher has it changed the nose I self you know knows I mean it's not trying to be somebody else knowing their self means knowing the truth about you you are what they do look at what your to analyze what you do it and analyze what you believe about yourself you might find that it's completely different person here\nI mean I had one friend I'll Try to get through this quick because I Know we want to get into his name is Chris he was in Boston he worked right alongside and he was an atheist and the need to make fun of God used to make fun of the just used to make fun of the Virgin Mary\nSmoke and drank every night seven nights a week they didn't feel well they went to visit a doctor and he found you're already had four states can't\nOh so he couldn't work anymore so I tried to visit in between my you know going from the school my school job and my night job or we work together I mean it was like a friend you know I Know you had all these problems but\nYou didn't know where you're not going to\nChina had this for about forty years in a in a few months and he died within a few months but I'd like to visit them and I would try to talk to him about God but he wasn't interested at all and he was even more bitten outdoors because of the diagnosis he had\nDied he died in such a terrible state he died in the state and no one should die and uh I I felt like helpless form now in my relationship with salt if people fall into held like snowflakes from the sky especially there's no one to pray for them\nSo I started praying for him and all these other people that I knew and bonded with and I felt they were friends of mine and I would ask God you know don't send these cells to held it unless you go to hell until I finished praying for them\nNo matter how long ago it gives me on this planet no matter how many grains of sand they still got left an hourglass that's what I was going to do and I believe now that was

I I stopped working but may not have to work at ... I guess you just stop\nAnd I stopped ... bartending at night and I love bartending at night but or any of that but I stopped but I still know about those people and they still pray for those people and that's a big ... big prerequisite of why I had to separate just starting to I'm In New Jersey now\nSo I'm doing fine I have a very uh elaborate prayer life uh I I retired from my my my job as a special ed teacher retires are not working at night and I miss those people a lot\nTo kind of have this nice house and the time they were probably about a hundred and fifty feet from the street is on a hill you come in to their house and the the garages are under the house and you pull your car and to the left and you go into the garage descendants back door the come into the garage\nAnd in between the garage George and a basement there's this big indoor and other ... I had three boys here growing up and I think a little bit bigger they want to a little more room so I had the basements finished and a cut in half and I had the apartment bills down near so my first wife\nGets older he wants to more space that he moves down there yeah you have your own interest\nTo pull your own spot to come and go as you want to say yes\nYes that was nice so then he goes to college any moves out thick and boy wants to parliament and so he takes it he goes to college and moved out by third boy\nHe ... he was in there he he was here this whole time so he uh when I had\nTo humans the smart one free rent\n[laughter] yeah well I didn't mind doing that we had this big house and then like when he he he went to college he moves out but he got a job and he said you know can I moved back home I just want to set my own business as they come back home because I mean we got its big house and my wife has this empty nest syndrome\nSure you know what I mean so I I like having to a company to somebody to come upstairs and have dinner with you once in a while and when you tell me wasn't home that much but he's moved out since then he got a great often he took his but anyway he's here the whole time so that the upstairs\nAnd self and their basement you come in that that I endorse steps that go up to the kitchen\nAnd I think it can they okay if you're in that case and you can almost hear that or an enclosed and then next to the kitchen is living ... most of the time George and\nUh that's what I like I I go to the gym in the morning to meditate than in the afternoon I meditate in at night and meditate so I have a pretty long for a life that I took I did get back to my artwork because I Am good at it as a small little town that God gave me you know so uh I I'm doing that and everything's fine to it for years and I've been praying for the last ... and I felt well lost almost\nEvery day for years and I was like I said I'm going to do that until whatever time I have left here so everything's fine\nAnd then a bank yeah\nSo then yeah I'm saying I'm sitting in the living room\nAnd that I into a downstairs I'm by myself and I hear that I enjoy I slam lucky you normally wouldn't even hear it from in the living room I hear it's slanted like it never was slammed before and I'm thinking to myself\nAnd you know somebody's open\nOh absolutely you in a house that funny five years you know every noise in the house you know\nSo I'm thinking I said what was that there was an eye on I think my wife could even if he came home a slant like I don't even think he gave him slam that do that hard\nAnd maybe my son can I don't know why he was doing it lets you had a car accident or with the girlfriend broke up with them or something like that so I'm thinking what is that so I get up I go to the kitchen I looked down stairs usually when somebody comes in down near the put ... put in a lifetime to still talk there so I go into that\nI have a a surveillance system here I I look into the cameras and I rolled back the cameras ten Fifteen twenty minutes I think nobody was on the property I look at the cameras that face the garage doors nobody nobody open those garages Lewis I look at the camera their faces that during the back nobody went through the backdoor\nAnd or what you don't you just heard it all Oh absolutely slam no\nLike slant I didn't know what at the time to us if we can discuss this this creature was using his methodology on me and had a method it wasn't it was telling me that wasn't here for the social call it wasn't passed through with\nNo explain that in a minute so I go I look in the cameras nobody was on a property in the basement I got\nI got bars on the windows but you can get out as a you know if there was a fire in the house he does on lock them and jump out do so I Know he couldn't get anybody if somebody was trespassing I couldn't see them so I go say turn the lights on in the basement and I go down to the basement looking everywhere\nYou pretty convinced you think somebody's in the house don't you\nOh absolutely no actually but I the only problem is but when I'm looking around I feel like I've been in the past twenty five years I feel this menacing sinister I'm In is like the only word to describe this like evil like an\nEvil then I ...\nYeah I'm looking everywhere I look down the steps and like any where somebody could squeezed himself into behind a washer and dryer and my son's room underneath his bed in his closet you know in the furniture to him I look I look at my frantic look and I still have this horrible feeling\nSo I'm thinking well I I Know I looked at some satisfy looking to the cameras nobody came and nobody broken but I still have this really menacing send us the feeling that come upstairs and I sit down and I'm thinking about it\nAnd then I you know and then all of a sudden I hear this wedding steps between the basement and and and and the kitchen\nAnd here's something that really heavy because like I can hear when my wife comes up the steps of the hundred and twenty pounds my son comes up the steps to hundred and Seventy pounds I Know what those steps down like where you get something very silly crossing those steps\nAnd thinking to myself I just checked down here you know nothing was here\n... coming up to ...\nI feel something very heavy slowly coming up the staff I get up again I go over that I look there's nobody there so I'm thinking\nWe were you armed her own armed at this time\nI I have I have a gun you know you do okay\n[laughter] but I but I didn't see anything so you know what I mean it looked in the cameras that looked through the cameras if I ever saw something then I I I didn't feel like I you know but I don't think if I was wondering if that had that feeling of something very menacing sinister\nAnd take it if if I could this possibly feet but then I tried to shake it off to us because he was like I'm just a guy I don't think that's you know\nWhat John where are you convinced that there was this creature demon in the house\nWhen it actually I actually had the ... but I Want to try to build up to that before

considered to be a good for 'em and they had they've kind of in federally increasing and yeah now that their their highest level\nBoy so seven hundred for I Know there's been some recent changes that

had\nOne off kind of things taken off of their scores here that won't happen again and that helped people had those problems but you know keep them about ten points on average which is significant so that is one of the things that's happening but luckily some of the other trends are a little bit more substantial and actually indicate good things about how we're using our credit nobody like what for example\nTo one thing is that um we have fewer deaths in collections and before I'm now just twenty three percent of consumers have any debt collection which is down from twenty six percent several years ago I'm twenty three percent so a lot different you know a lot of people that have\nAny accounting collections but at least it's coming down another good thing is that people who are

spend\nA hundred and ten dollars per day per person you are considered by the worldwide standard because there's very few of us\nAs you put it a hundred million or there's only two hundred million people out of seven billion billion people that are considered reject that spans [laughter] [noise]\nSo is that good that that's the case or bad [noise] near a whole lot more rich worldwide than you are inside the country ... obviously that gives you an idea of what our standard of living is here versus other country exactly yup exactly interesting numbers [noise]\nAlright on me of\nStory of US Senators are now have the view of the FBI investigating files on Capitol Hill [noise] what are the rules regarding that it's sort of sealed room\nOnly senators and a stream select aids can see it to not be removed\nSo you can walk in any field is while the room is can look at it and you can't take it with you cannot take away the\nRules so that why can't you take it with you because they want to secure\nNow I understand that that's what you're saying but ... why would why is that they don't want to leak and why do you not want to leak\nTwice so I Would suspect part of the reason is or maybe names of people in there that are kind of innocent bystanders and all this\n... okay what are the odds that it doesn't get leaked I Would say it's pretty slim as we'll get a lead times going to say yeah but I mean I I on on one hand if\nThere's damning information there we would want to see that right you with on the other hand if there's not damning information there that it exonerate the judge that there's nothing really here well I assume we would want to see that I'm doing we're going to hear that from the right\nBut I don't want to just take my senators advice Sarah what they say yeah you know because if you've got an army said your name you're more likely to say this if you got to do besides your name you're more likely to say this yeah I Would rather see it with my own eyes I have no our or D\nYou don't trust your senator no I'll [laughter] you want to think about that oh no [laughter]\nWell yeah and by that what I don't know whether it's\nDamning or yeah on a rating or why wouldn't you want that to be out\nIn public you know well I'm just saying one of the reasons could be because of the names of people associate with that well you can blackout yeah exactly I Know it could be done but yeah I agree with Steve the chance that being leaked are probably pretty\nGood coating to an NPR PBS NewsHour Marist Poll they all got together and pulled their money evidently it was released yesterday forty five percent of those polled Americans say that Dr Ford was telling the truth thirty three percent said judge Kavanaugh as the ones telling the truth twenty two percent are unsure\nMeanwhile a different pole and economists Hugo poll shows that fifty five percent of Republicans think\nThat a proven allegation of sexual assault does not disqualify a person from serving on the Supreme Court\nFor the race question about child molesters yeah what what would what would that ... you're a bank robber ... where did you kill somebody well yeah what's the disqualification there so I think it depends on if you've got an army sergeant or any yeah huh every ...\nWe tend to be very forgiving if if you're a Democrat and Republican something you're not forgiving but if the Democrat does the same thing you're very forgiving and vice versa\n... is like now in this Kavanaugh saying a lot of the folks on the outside are pointing to well what about Keith Ellison Minnesota what about him well what ... and\nOf course he's not he's running for attorney general Minnesota that's different deal kill our local deal and people in Minnesota should heat of that right and the sort of police have declined to a follow up at this point my is that\nThey don't believe there's a case there apparently they're afraid he's going to be their boss wants to be the AG is not technically am\nTonight President Trump will travel to Minnesota speaking of which for for a make America great rally in Rochester uh and then on Tuesday he will be in Council Bluffs\nMeanwhile as Senator Ben Sasse was on the floor of the U.S Senate yesterday he gave an impassioned speech on sexual assaults and the hash tag me too\nMovement [noise] uh let's see uh Utah man evidently\nIs in

that I brought up that a Stephen King Jerry oh story and I didn't do so well on the test actually which is surprising I mean there is a lot of brain cells right there and that right state well but a world\nIf that doesn't know [noise] um\nSo we uh uh I was saying that I wasn't absolutely with great certainty could name all Thirteen of the original colonies Fred can you do it um\nI Know I could get about eleven or twelve eat what I yeah yeah yeah that's that's what I was just you know it was like yeah I can get you know I mean one of the original Thirteen no now I thought\nIt was a Delaware was I think you guys miss Delaware originally ah Delaware was at the end we do\nThe other hand um but no main nor know Vermont ah [noise] ... know Vermont so who do they miss well we must have had fourteen because we I think we\nOh we missed New Jersey\nOh how about we as we miss New Jersey yeah oh known as a roadway between New York and Philadelphia the uh the the original colonies New Hampshire Massachusetts Rhode Island Connecticut New Jersey Delaware\nMaryland um north and South Carolina Georgia Virginia\nPennsylvania and New York\nBut see maybe I missed because I Maine and Vermont or to the I think five States I've never been to\nA so I I've never even been to Maine and Vermont so\nMaybe that I come to think of that maybe that's why I think I've been on the extreme southern tip of Maine and I've definitely been in Vermont and the rest I've been to New Hampshire but I have not been to a remote\nAnyway we went through these questions and most people have no idea what Ben Franklin was famous for and that too is a little bit tricky yeah Ben Franklin was known for lots of saying hey well I mean literally hundreds\nOf saying you could say hill says electricity experiments you could say bifocals you can say yeah you\nGet hit he probably he ... he was a founding father yeah he was probably most well known as a diplomat\nRight he spent a lot of time in France yeah and a little bit of time in England to but I mean he did so many things is probably hard to zero in on one particular thing that Ben Franklin was you know really famous for he was famous for lots of different things\nSometimes nice to look on your pillow and see Ben Franklin meant\n[noise]\n'cause I knew where the button was I I I really would hit it okay I've forgotten you know I don't see very often and I know\nI Can't [noise]\nAnyway um so so anyway there was twelve percent Fred incorrectly thoughts at a Dwight Eisenhower was a civil war general right well of course you and I having lived in Kansas I think we're more likely to well you know it wasn't even a you know I actually\nI have a great admiration for Dwight Eisenhower\nBecause think about this for a second I mean [noise] he was a veteran of World War one right okay so he was a combat veterans of World War one\nFirst of all he went to West Point okay combat veteran of World War one I mean he was in the thick of it sure Kay [noise]\nThen we got to World War two he becomes not just a general he becomes Supreme allied commander right the general he is I mean he's the top dude right there right [noise] and he's victorious he makes it all work right sure\nAnd then after he's done with that he's a two term president after that\nRight where you find that more successful individual as far as we do riding on his interstate highway yeah you know you only do I don't think Dwight Eisenhower gets quite the credit that there's like a Ben Franklin does that mean Dwight Eisenhower was a pretty big deal\nYou know I'd be curious I I always think back in my marriage and history classes like in high school or something we would always get done before we got right we always get to ... just short of we'd get through World War one and everything but you know ... to get\nTo World War II and you've got Twenty years on me yeah and and that's the way it was when I was so what are they\nGetting too nowadays I mean are they yeah I mean we didn't get to the Korean War I mean you know do they get to the Vietnam\nWar and I you you could actually make a a you can make an argument the more recent history might be more important than the ancient history ... because of the things that are maybe more relevant in today's world because of what happened in recent here more\nContemporary lessons we can learn from it\nThen the last chapter is at well read that but it won't be on the test yeah yeah yeah\nSo that's the same stuff so [noise]\nAnyway not very many people are able to uh do the civics test and and and you only have to get a sixty percent on this test to pass which isn't exactly that high and only thirty six percent of us citizens passed this test at sixty percent so\nThat's how some people propose that there should be mandatory civics test at the end of high school for those who were born here and to actually from your citizenship\nOr you know I mean I wouldn't be against that at all like ...\nOr ... or maybe before you get them food stamps\nCurrent replace that Latin\nTest [laughter]\nThat was it hard to rolling up the girl says yeah this is the time convinced that over the course of time\nAnd you you read about you know some French history and some English history and different things like that and as it regards to Latin\nLatin it was kind of back ... language that if I knew

right Michele has been my pleasure to work for the south Dakota department of agriculture and the role as for recruiting dairies to start with to help meet the needs of our processing plants back in South Dakota\nAnd we are looking for ... that just right now so the chicken and egg get kind of flip the little bed\nExactly we've been very fortunate ah the last two years ago we ran into a brick wall we're we couldn't accept any new milk and any of our process\nAsk city with bell brand came on board they help alleviate some of the pressure but then also the investment that valley quaint cheeses made in over fifty million dollar investment up and Milbank\nTo increase the capacity there but now we have a a huge investment being taken place by the egg appear folks down in like Norton and they're taking that plant from a three million pounds of milk a day up to nine point three million pounds today\nSo it makes sense to bump up the existing infrastructure first and then look at bringing other new plans in but you told me that we're not just looking for cheese plants we're looking at other products right exactly\nYou know or is it getting to the point that milk is actually going to be a byproduct\nAnd we're looking at the opportunity so what the lactose to the white products that were our ... you know separating the milk out to add value added protein supplements that can go into whether it's in the human nutrition or into livestock beach\nThat's right you are out here and they asked you to get re science division and here as well helping to do some of that recruitment even talked to students stray oh exactly\nThat's one of the fun things the first two days of the show or a really we have a lot of students that come through from other universities other a lot of high schools from here in Wisconsin Illinois Iowa that come up\nBut at the opportunity to tell the story about South Dakota about South Dakota State University and what they do for not only dairy production but also dairy manufacturing and you know as soon as he was just a great place to go to school grade education great professors to work with\nYou can't you don't have to convince me of that as a former jak obviously in alone there but as far as you know talking about growth certainly there are growing pains that a lot of the states including South Dakota and then going through and you guys have been trained to do this from a responsible um nature and direction right\nExactly it has to be a control girl a\nDay and we've been very fortunate in that aspect that we've been able to you know promote that reasonable and responsible growth so that we don't end up in a situation similar what Michigan his head where they added thirty thousand cows and the thumb area Michigan\nAll of a sudden they have way over production of milk there have been shipping milk out of state to other states for processing and their farmers have been taken a real hit in the pocket book or what their milk price\nFeeling argument that I hear though about that growth is that why is it always big Gary's why can't it be small dairy\nWe really tried to recruit some of these smaller areas too but the capital investment it takes today to continuing the dairy business is really tough and had we had some opportunities for smaller producers yes we have but we struggle with our ... you know somewhere processing plants they want to be able to take a semi loaded milk every other day\nYeah that's right that dynamic has definitely changed in the industry but\nWe are adding value to the crops in our area and that's really important\nIsn't it well that's true you know when you sit here and you look at what the you know the price of corn that three dollars and twenty cents and then you have a a anywhere from twenty sent to an eighty cents basis to shift the corn out of the state of South Dakota go livestock feed someplace else why not add value to that\nFeed that be are those ... corn soybeans to our lifestyle whether it'd be dairy and or swine chickens whatever it works it keeps those dollars here it keeps our crop producers getting that value of not only\nNot having to pay that

they believe that all the Democrats are\nTrying to do now is delay and delay and delay we've also heard that some of those who managed to read the investigation the quick additional background check was done by the FBI at the request of the Senate Judiciary committee and the president of the United states\nThey've looked at it and said yeah this was thorough and now at this point the Democrats are trying to come up with some other reason to delay the confirmation or we think Saturday morning by the Senate voting I was going to vote to confirm judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court\nMy friend Andy McCarthy joins me now contributing editor at National Review and former federal prosecutor Andy good to have you back on I Want to get your take on on what's happened the last few days we've had the FBI do the traditional background checking and those who've read it say the report shows\nNothing new that would change our impression that was left after last Thursday's a testimony by both judge Kavanaugh and dodge Ford\nWill thanks so much Lars ... there's nothing surprising about there being nothing new because the allegations were obviously very thin\nAnd that's saying a more than they probably deserve so it's not surprising that there wasn't any eight to ... them and it's not surprising to hear Democrats now complaining about the process\nRather than talking about the allegations he goes to says never been about anything other than the law you have forty nine\nDemocrats who do not want to have a shift\nWill liable conservative votes on the Supreme Court so what this has always been about is trying to push this\nBeyond the mid term so that the Democrats hope that they will take over the Senate and it just she\nA cat and on the numbers the same way the Republicans were able to defeat Merrick Garland on the numbers all the rest of it is just focused focused to get to that point and the sad thing is that they didn't care about destroying a guy in order to pull this off\nAnd in fact I think they vowed that even if he's confirmed they plan to tried to impeach him but I I looked at the history there's only been one Supreme Court justice ever impeached isn't there\nThat's correct but you know I Am going to write about this for the weekend laws but there's all kinds of norms that we've always relied on\nThat are no longer kinda norms that you can absolutely back on I mean I Hope that's right and I hope that um\nThat that we maintain the tradition that judges can't be a champion caged ... engaged in some kind of a conduct or use their offices abuse ugly but\nHe he you know there's all kinds of norms that we we had\nIf you had two or three generations of students Fulton told the norms are\nBasically instruments of oppression that they that the establishment uses to keep them down and deny their desires and denied their policy solutions and the like and I I I just don't know how much we can rely on them anymore\nI just wonder because I've been to explain my audience and I think you'd back me up on those and told me if I'm wrong that if they adapted to an eight member court it would've been fact I'd be effectively made a lot of the tightest decisions for foreign effectively and know it would have new to the Supreme Court to a large extent\nWhat could they get the same effect if they decide to try to introduce articles of impeachment against judge Kavanaugh and and by doing I Would still be able to function as a Supreme Court judge wild that nonsense was going on\n[noise] I think he would because he would just put his head down and continue to do his job which is one of the reasons we should want him\nOn the court I also think Lars as a practical matter the chance that Kavanaugh or any other Supreme Court justice is going to be removed is so remote\nOr as to be the ... that's not to say that you know like President Trump if the Democrats got an a majority in the house they couldn't impeach\nA sitting Supreme Court justice but the Senate would never remove them and everybody would understand that this was transparently political and I doubt historically that it would ask for much\nUsually Andy I ask you legal questions because your background is a federal prosecutor the guy put the blonde shake in prison for terrorism and Andy by the way is the author of the grand jihad how Islam and the left or ... dodging America and he was a great example of it but let me ask you a political question do you think that the Democrats by behaving in this way\nI mean it was actually referred to as a demolition derby today that it was a scorched earth policy that it was you know search and destroy mission was one of the descriptions I think John Cornyn throughout to Senator John Cornyn trout today\nDo you think that Americans average Americans who don't follow this closely as we do are going to look at this kind of behavior and be turned off by it to the point where they might change vote this fall\n[noise] well I think laws if you look at it as I understand it if you look at for example the polling that we're all looking so carefully at\nOf the Senate races where you have these Democrats in red states Democrats in states that Trump won in in some places very decisively or trying to hang on what we're seeing is that\nThere's been a shift in the sense that the party out of power and in this case that the left with Trump and has been very animated and where it's all very excited about the idea of of\nVoting against Trump or sending a message to Trump in the midterms I think having overplay their hand with\nAh with with cat and ah what they've done is awake and they usually more bond\nA party in power for the midterms in mid term elections all all of that energy and enthusiasm so I think we're seeing some indication that what you describe exactly is what's going on they people looking at this and they're frightened by it\nAnd that means that that they miscalculated when they first calculated maybe we can take 'em out with an anonymous charge of the last minute that didn't work so we'll do a name to charge your doctor Ford's name has come out Christine foreign\nAnd that didn't work so then we'll throw in a Debbie Ramirez which was even weaker case and then we'll throw in Julie sweating it which is by my read a gigantic mess because she's got all kinds of of other baggage he brings with her and then as they did that\nAnd they started as you say to turn people off and and and both do that turn off Democrats and wake up Republicans and now I guess Heidi Heitkamp has come out and said she's going to vote against Kavanaugh and that might just that you might literally remover in North Dakota which wouldn't be the worst thing in the world because she's given her opponent a real boost\nThe I think I think all of that is right and I think lawyers that it just goes to show what a monumental miscalculation they've made because I think what's respect to professor Ford\nMost people even if they thought that she was long war of the mind to at least credit her good shape that you know was sincere or even if she was in ... not not particularly credible and I think by the time you get to sweat neck\nUm it's so preposterous\nPeople now look at it and where they were originally willing to credit people's good faith on the left they now see that this was a campaign as as Kavanaugh says it was it\nTurned this whole idea of advice and consent and just search and destroy and they they were willing to destroy this guy's life\nDestroy his family destroy his character over Supreme Court seat and I think people should lightly beat fight you buy that\nFunny almost Twenty years after the phrase the politics of personal destruction was used to well get appropriately genetic trend or a real a real creep in Bill Clinton or were you all rape is somebody who really had done terrible things to women\nAnd at that time they said oh you can't engage in the politics of personal destruction I guess unless it benefits your side and I hope Republicans see all this and say we're never going to behave this way no matter how much of my cost us so we will not do it I I I for the most part I don't think they will candy things are in size we always value them\nWell ... what what what more did the other you know that what more do the beyond me downs doctor before\nWhere you can ask a follow up question the question\nShould want you don't want you to know little on it or should\nYou could ask questions about it we have

she doesn't know where it happened to you know when it happened or even what year it happening and he's not sure about any of that do you think of the FBI sat there and senator best agent in and said ask her again you know where that is the answer would train\nTrip and he actually she was born in ... how do you know to to just put in what she ... so we're we're pretty close we actually there are questions are getting where exactly what time of please\nGive it happened what time of year and then we can cut short questioning by that he looked less sugar they brought in the Republican\nCouldn't even hold on hold on a jury Gary ... wouldn't you miss the facts\nThe Republicans got five minutes at a time and they turn their time over to the professional sex crimes investigator for the Democrats each each of the questions on the panel got five minutes at a time they got exactly the same amount of time\nIn in one of them spent all his time asking about sports and and about uh about what flying was in high school or you know and what devil's triangle was which turns out to be drinking game just as he said so when you say the Democrats didn't have time to ask her word happen\nShe's been very clear and all the things you said in her letter to find signs in her testimony under oath to the Senate committee she doesn't know where it happened a jury\nYou realize how ridiculous is is to say you've only the FBI to ask that question for five more times her answer might have changed\nLet's go to another nice here now that is what we call my wife when the grandbabies around now welcome to
