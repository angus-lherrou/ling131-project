I don't know if they I don't know why because I said to my doctor I don't understand was prescription anyway and I'm not asking for a bottle of oc say I'm a I'm asking for a meter it's like getting a prescription for a tape measure\nAnd she said well I don't either but uh but uh but you have to have one so I got as long as an hour and I said hey I Want to buy one of these and they go now cancelled so you have a prescription for like ... plus just stupid\nAnd frankly the little cheaply meters at Walmart they're like twelve bucks and you don't need a prescription and the strips are twenty or thirty cents apiece so you know you can save some money but there's a beauty if you actually made people pay for it I think the prices would come down but because they're like oh it was covered by insurance and they\nSo they just say well we can charge you know I my wife was stunned a few years ago I said well you pick up a bit being fifty tester and so I was using one of these ... and they were er and she comes back and says fifty stripped of sixty five dollars on black fly\nOut of the game and the insurance companies anyway\nLet me ask you about this let me ask you about gender filters on job sites he's at a form of discrimination\nAnd is it legitimate for a company to say we are more interested in males or females in this particular job and do you think they're doing\nIt and and and and then the question whether they're doing it or not we'll get to a second I'm going to the fence on the phone and I know you hate that but let me give you both sides of the coin here on site number one the argument is they want more diversity in hiring they want a candidate pool they want page one page to page three of the results\nTo reflect the overall mix of gender now the reason they haven't had\nAny consideration I Believe developers at length and now of course owned by Microsoft had done a really good job of keeping gender out of the equation and developers have said we don't want to even enter that into the data pool we don't want to know about it because it's not necessarily relevant now what they're saying they're saying well we want to encourage diversity\nBite subtly encouraging if there's a sixty percent female applicants indoor pool of responses to your linked to an ad\nOr going to put sixty percent of females on page one sixty percent of females on page to and so on and so forth so I get the intent I get the goal I get the purpose I'm just not sure that I Want my technology provider like linked in can be shoveling the result in such a way\nThey could consciously or unconsciously determine who I hire the best candidate should be hired guard lists of race and that's where the ... question comes in our we now putting that front and center on the same token I think we can all agree anything that helps that company be my more diverse is a good thing so it's really\nActually I'd probably disagree with you there just because look if you're going to ask for the best candidates Brian if God Forbid you end up in the hospital you've you've probably been once or twice and I want to sign on have been there with family members I'm In the hospitals have patients since I was a kid but\nIf you do that what gender will be the predominant gender among nurses\n[noise] I Would say female\nFemale and I've looked at the numbers would something like eighty five Ninety percent so should we told our hospitals will you should filters so the job get it as you look at her fifty actually fifty one female forty nine men would you accept that and say you have to leave it so go ahead if\nIf the if the market is eighty five and say you walk into a hospital in the market is eighty five percent female\nAnd and you get eighty five percent female applicants that number may vary I ten percent one way or the other but at the market as a whole is eighty five percent female you're gonna get ... percent female applicants so quick question is are you getting the applicant to the first place the question is\nSaying the same mix it up against page after page after page well and health what ultimately be the same\nGuess I I Would just rather they rank order people and said here the people with the best test scores are the best whatever metric you want to use a measure their capabilities and and give us those candidates well it turns out they're all female or almost all female soldier well do I want the best I don't want the nurse in in the ...\nOh you know with the diversity actually I'd once more Republican nurses instead of Democrat nurses as that\nSounds fantastic Republican or just\nYeah well you know I I don't know I don't know how many nurses are going to ask them I I don't know we probably don't\nHere's your economic lesson for today and it's a lesson that a lot of these pools at the Federal Reserve bank and they had a lot of these games and it kind of us don't understand when the economy is is cooking like it is now you've got\nYou know near full employment you got four percent broke you've got you know\nFor jobs for people to fill them you got more and more production you know that means the economy is producing more goods and services now my question to you our says\nWhen you get an increase in the output of goods and services what happens is the price up things up to ... county produces more apples what happens is that price samples of apples doesn't live said Valls yep so I reject this notion I'm so glad you mentioned this concept of overheating 'cause it's a bogus cuts out\nYou know we had a great job growth of eight percent under Reagan he remembered that why can't the economy grow up four or five percent\nWell and in China and India had some tremendous growth rate does well exactly why we've got a moment do I do I did plan to ask you about this what you call the credit rating agency raccoon\nDescribe is for my listeners about how these government agencies have been ... you know putting the USDA approve stamp on on on a whole bunch of credits that really doesn't deserve that and and they helped create some of the problem right\nThis is one of the great scandals of the two thousand seven and two thousand eight a real estate\nYou know a crisis which led to a belt out of the economy which was that that we have these credit rating agencies the two big ones are Moody's and standard and Poor's and outliers up almost until the day the you know the banks collapsed\nAnd the mortgage market collapsed these agencies that are supposed to rate the credit of the debt\nThey were ... basically giving AAA bond ratings to all of these mortgages that were worthless and we now know that they were just you know I'm you know practically worthless because people are walking away from the homes that my point would be why why are we still relying on each credit ratings\nAgencies that they still dominate ... percent of the market and they've got a terrible track record related to that I'm not trying to scare people but did you know ... hours to this day ten years after the crisis because the prices get exactly ten years ago virtually the day of today\nI'm the I'm the federal government his continuing to provide one hundred percent tax payer guarantees three and four percent down payment loans\n[laughter] not that long hours from no back door and exactly what we're doing the oil and\nBy the way Steve mommy I Want to make this personal\nI Am a producer who just bought a house and he was telling me gosh I said what are you having trouble getting the down payment together he says no the way they've engineered it\nAnd he has good credited and he's a decent job but working for me if you can go about a decent job and he says one they've worked it out so we have to put one person down but after the ... the purchases complete we actually get the one percent back\nAnd I said to effectively you know well I agree I watch and yet\nI understand why wouldn't people find that in the marketplace they don't say that's ... yeah they say well that's great my son or daughter or brother or sister or whatever can buy a house and you say yes and they have almost no skin when the game which means if things turned south they can say well we don't have anything in this place let's just walk away from it which is part of the way\nYou know gets you know get screwed the taxpayer yes we we care on TV it's mortgages that's why the banks make them mortgages even when they know that the person may not\nPay it back I mean it's just it is so ensure eating and and I do worry a lot about it because if you got somebody put one or two or three percent down payment on the low and that and let's say this is a house falls value by ... percent\nNegative equity that means that they're better off just walking away from the home and that's what millions of people did and the taxpayers got old ... you know got a shot holding the bag of a trillion dollars of bad debt that we're doing it all over again in it that's the problem with government they never learn the lessons from the last place as\nWell is there any way to back away from that or make is slightly less attractive you know

um\nA of a ... Frank Frank and uh what was the other guy died Frank remembered him do you do any of that all you need ... dollars\nOh you need is to require five or ten percent down payment to temper sat down payment on the house that asking somebody put ... percent down payment if you do that\nYou're going to cut the number to call by Ninety percent because I look at the below that tale almost all the laws that detailed and two thousand six seven eight\nOr those below five percent down payment lot so let's just ... percent down payment and you want to add up by national crisis like we had the you\nKnow and in fact as I understand it in Canada I think you have to put down as much as thirty percent down and uh and the as a result they didn't suffer nearly as badly as the United states\nThe thank you very much he's the author of fueling freedom exposing the ad war on energy more from the Heritage Foundation I'll be back in a moment your calls at eight six six four three nine five to seven seven [noise]\n\nI'm Jay foreigners CEO of Quicken Loans America's premier home purchase lender today's fluctuating interest rates can leave you with unexpected higher mortgage payments Quicken Loans we created a new way to protect you from unpredictable interest rates so you can buy a home with certainty it's called ...\nAnd here's how it works with Rachel you can lock your interest rate while you shop for a new home so afraid to go up you don't have to worry and here's the best part if rates go down you get the lower rate\nWith ratio we really have you covered here are more reasons why you want to work with America's largest mortgage lender for eight years in a row now JD power has re Quicken Loans highest in the nation and customer satisfaction for primary mortgage rich nation and for the fifth year in a row they've also ranked is highest in the nation for mortgage servicing rate shield\nAnother way we can save your money on your mortgage calls today at eight hundred quicken or go to rocket mortgage dot com\nBasin right and what you said in comparison to all the data records racial prove only about thirty thirty or just turned ... information conditions equal having one or licensing office he paid ... thirty thirty additional conditions are excluded may apply\nDid Clinton season one long green sleeves I can make a world of difference though you can protect yourself and your clothes talking co workers how\nSigning neighbors two month old and he's constantly moving and specially trained permitted to prevent it over ... million police on through the thousands and buy for your time today what is the dollar code with most insurance because protecting the world starts with protecting you are plump green thank you know one\nThing to do any stage and health related restrictions may play\nTechnology truth to buy like a\nYou have fourteen blogging passwords Andrew can't remember any of them are one or two does is a is awesome one two three\nGroups so easy to switch and save on car insurance at taco dot com is super cool and present underscore exclamation point exclamation point Nineteen eighty five [noise]\nFifteen minutes because they'd be Fifteen Percent or more\nTime somebody W.

raising money on line to provide foreign fighters in Syria with military hardware\nThey're using bitcoin they're using telegram and they're using the watts up to collect the money to supply fighters so they're quite unlike weapons and drones and food and clothing and outside of the sort of thing I think of a social media platform does this and helps out that effort to raise money\nThey should be

from Lars Larson show it's a pleasure to be with you on a Wednesday evening blind to take your calls too in a moment at eight six six four three\nNine five to seven seven emails go to talk of Lars Larson dot com well as we keep telling you the economy is booming so loudly that a lot of employers can\nSo it is to fill the hundreds of thousands of jobs out there than there are a lot of people who may be ready to get a job but do they have the skills to fill those jobs Peter Murphy is vice president of the invest in education coalition Mr Murphy welcome to the program\nFlora thank you for having me great to be with you\nSo tell me this um [noise] we have a situation in America where we have a record low level of unemployment I tell people that I'll be sixty next year in the last time we are the unemployment is low for the whole working population was when I was nine years old and the last time we had female unemployment is low\nI was a dream in my\nEyes was Nineteen fifty three\nSo if we have this record low level of unemployment we have a lot of employers hiring and we have some in millions of Americans who are willing I I I don't know if they're willing to work\nBut as far as I'm concerned if they're working age they ought to be working do we really need to provide tax incentives to ah to get employers to fill those jobs\n[noise] ours we have too many Americans that don't have the skills to fill the jobs and I think that's really what this is about it's not a kind of an open ended a tax credit saying we're talking about here at the bill that we are pushing\nA ... by a congressman Lloyd Smucker Pennsylvania called the usa workforce tax credit act that it would allow up to two billion dollars a year\nOr so fairly modest some but it's some it's another spoken this we'll another a policy that would compliment other efforts that are designed to get\nMore young people in particular skill ready to take these jobs that are going unfilled right now\nNow if I go old fashioned on you because I'm now old shortness of socially and I say well if I wanted to learn construction and I I was I said fine if I'm going to get off my ... and go out and get a job and I'm unemployed even in a in a situation of an economy seems odd for employment in all directions and employers begging for that\nI think I'd go to a construction site or a construction company and say can you put me to work\nAnd they always need people who are what I called mirror fog or somebody who can fog and mirrors qualified\nTo say you can start to leaping up you know I mean there's a cleanup guy and every construction crews sometimes more than one\nAnd when the young man's or one young woman says but I Want to learn how to do drywall or hammer nails or I Want to I Want to learn how to pour concrete and finished concrete and say well we can teach you how to do that\nUm but you got to start at the bottom and if you did that I Would imagine that is the people who've been\nThe mirror fog or jobs before move up the ranks that there will be gaps they're an aren't some of the jobs that are available\nOr that can't be filled or it's a tough time to fill them in those kind of categories where people just say I don't want to do that job doesn't sound very interesting that sounds physically challenging and it doesn't pay very much money but that's where all of us including me started in our jobs doing the job to nobody else wanted to do\nFrom yours truly I mean my summer jobs didn't look too glamorous but I got a lot out of it and uh and built from it so I'm really what we're trying to do though is to get a more Americans skill ready for these positions so it's not enough to fill them and\nWe're not moving quickly enough to get people to a skill level and I think too many young people are going to college which is not the right choice for pre\nCouldn't agree with you on that\nAnd I think you know even the industry is responding to that by going to job fairs and sending representatives and selling the guidance counselors and saying we've got five figure ... figure jobs here that these young people can sell them in a year or two\nAnd nine and current college debt of the same time so a lot of it's just industry having to take extra steps that they didn't have to take before um and we're offering to accelerate that process so we don't go month after month year after year potentially trying to grow at four or five percent and then the economy\nAnd not selling these jobs I mean there's other risks with that that you know we don't want companies going elsewhere or overseas to fill positions or or move operations or anything so [noise]\nSo it it just designed to you know we we have job corps and we have the government spending programs a career in tactile education let's let's get the private sector more involved in selling\nThese positions in in investing in the workers and at the end that adding more apprenticeship opportunities and and still a choice component to this bill as well or getting children in a better school so they graduated college and career ready as opposed to sit too many of them now or neither\nIt's hard to so this will be two billion dollars as a practical matter how has the money gets spent so if if I'm an employer and hire somebody who's currently unemployed has been unemployed for six months that I get the credit or how does it actually work\nFor ... lawyer would work is the sea\nInvestor and leave the employer or would go to the Treasury Department and actually apply for the tax credits up to two hundred and fifty thousand dollars\nFor apply for them\nIn a rant either a random selection or first come first served the Treasury Department ... program so and it's just out of the state level in other areas where do you literally apply for a finite number of tax credits back with a ceiling you have two billion a year at those employers would apply for them\nAnd uh they get approval almost like you're going for a concert tickets on line or something it's a similar kind of process and the cat you know automated process and they get the credits and make the investment and you know report bad accordingly and\nBut when you make the investment does that mean they say I Will hire somebody who is not currently employed into a job and I'll provide them the training to like I said if it's construction to do she rock to do framing to do a you know a concrete soaring in finishing ... what do they have to actually do\nSheila I'm gonna I'm gonna spend X amount of dollars at this community college to to hire or to train a four thousand students\nTo prepare them for this line of work or I'm going to I'm I'm partnering with a state workforce agency to ah at X number of apprenticeships in these areas\nAnd [noise] that's that's basically I mean there there have to be an application process and all that um but it is simply it's going to the government getting the you know making the application getting the credits and making the investment after that willing to what you propose\nIf it's two billion dollars of taxpayers' money one thing that would make me happier about it is a big and making relatively revenue neutral and I would address the college question you raise I Wish we forced to everybody wanted to apply for any kind of loan\nYou know unless you if you want to go pay for college on your mom and dad's bank a gun go for it I don't care what you can study fighting among a pay for ... yeah well and that's that's how most of us did I did it that way and and you know I didn't I didn't finish but that's that\nIf we sit down with you and you say I Want to spend two hundred thousand dollars on a degree\nTo get a job as a social worker paying forty two thousand thirty two thousand dollars a year who say that it doesn't pencil or not giving a Pell Grant no we're not giving you know to go study something where you invest a gigantic amount of money and make a ... and you know somebody else's money that you're borrowing and then you'll expect somebody else paid off\nSo if you did it that way and and made it the pay for I think they caught on Capitol Hill where you say the money we say by not spending it on people getting you know degrees in a you know left tended French literature or something that they don't have any practical application will pay for the kid who actually does want to learn how to weld\nSlurs you're making way too much so I I think that ship I I think that that was going to get can't put the put that back in the fall right actually putting a criteria I mean look the things they have far to our own shock on the government's not going to do\nTerrorists um for who were not originally from our country the media we immediately leap and say oh it must be the Tea Party she pretty it was not us time after time after time after time and I I resent it completely resent\nThe way that they're trying to say that the out I'll outrageous unlawful behavior that is leading to more and more violent we're seeing from the left is anything like the roof of the people who I had worked side by side with for nearly the last decade\nYou know I'm going to make a comparison and [noise] I think this is something we can work with\nI made it earlier tonight when I was talking to a friend of mine\nAnd I said a few remember when they do cause alleged to have endorsed Donald Trump and turned out he had not and Donald Trump disclaimer the connection but the media went crazy\nTrying to tell the president if some crazy man who's affiliated with the Klan endorses you you have to immediately come out and\nAnd I guess you're not recanted you've never accepted the endorsement and I'm sure there are people who maybe have unsavory attitudes based on race religion or otherwise you say I Love the Lars Larson Joe ... well\nI don't control what people think so somebody told me there's some big it live somewhere in California that really love your show I'd say\nOkay I got nothing I can do about it he's entitled to think whatever crazy things he wants offensive though they may be the ... fault you know because I I didn't ask for his endorsement sent\nAnd so the reason I'm bringing this up as a media extent it expended a huge amount of time and energy telling the president that if somebody unsavory endorses him that he would have to come out and condemn that endorsement and condemned the Klan\nOkay on that same basis I Would like to see people started showing up at whatever public events democratic candidates in Democrat office holders are holding it I mean federal as well as local\nFolks around America and say will you condemn the acts of violence by left wing extremists in this country\nAnd I'm willing to bet that most of the folks out there running for reelection all the members of the house and a third of the Senate\nOn the Democratic side will not want to do that they will not want to condemn it and and the problem is right now the mainstream media isn't even bothering to ask the question and I think to some extent if you could get major office holders to condemn this kind of thing from the left\nThat it would have some effect because right now they're happy to just sit back and let these extremists go out set fire to things\nAnd and enjoy what they think is the benefit of it without having without having to be asked are you endorsing this is this something that you believe in and and because of the mainstream media is in the position where they are the ones who should be asking them\n[noise] on the the means should be asking them but they're not they're not going to ask them because the people on the left or the elected officials and the people that are left to its leaders are getting them up and pouring fuel\nOn the higher Eric Holder today when we when we ... that Michelle Obama was wrong it say when\nThey go low we go high no all he said no no when they go low we kick them yeah I Know it's like to be kicked by Eric Holder and the IRS and that the Obama administration so yeah that's exactly\n[laughter] exactly the kind of behavior I Would expect from our former attorney general Maxine Waters hauling for silence chasing down on supporters of the president wherever you can find them a gas station the grocery store the department stores wherever you can\nStill left took her up on that we see that time after time Hillary Clinton saying well it's on and we're not going to be civil to people who disagree with us because they're trying to do what we did politically yet there is a waited\nYou get through the political system you do it at an early on to keep all throughout the rest of the country who your fellow Americans unless you're trying to send a signal to them that you watch can chew cause violence and I think that that may very well be with Hillary Clinton is okay with\nI think that's what she's doing and she's making the threat we will continue to be an ... until you give us power back which is such an outrageous kind of challenge to say so you're going to continue to cause trouble in major American cities around the country until we give you power back\nShe wants to rule

is you know it it it's not considered a problem and\nUm I think there was during during the time when um the west was backing some pretty nasty elements in Afghanistan um the Indian knew that this ... problem would flow back in to India\nAnd were I'm not averse to working with the Soviets during that time either to try to contain it so a lot of their relationship with Russia is very much reflection of their immediate border you know the problems with how to one side and the problem with China on the other and\nThat's the lens through which they view their relationship with Moscow\nAnd ... what is the state of play between a Islam about them do it today oh\nThat's terrible yeah and in fact what China did I'm immediately after ah India bought the ... the missile defense system was hit announced he was going to sell some very high tech drones to Pakistan so essentially opening up a second front for that missile system to try to defend but from\nA puzzle also about India playing the Russia card if that's what they're playing it can be a dangerous game the Russians are not easy to work with you that forgotten just Soviet days does that regarded as that was all that was then there's just now is that the fresh thinking\nIt's not really because they're because if you look at the age of the people in both administrations say there are people who would have been engaging with each other perhaps his juniors or during the Soviet period so they know each other um you know there there was\nThere was all sorts of stories about Soviet infiltration into the Indian system during the during that period is well\nA lot of compromise material all that sort of stuff\nThat's the way of putting it yeah [laughter] so um you know I think it takes a long time to to to read that up but also you know they\n... the Soviets were there for India at a time when sometimes others weren't but there is that the more serious ...\nYeah that Russia fell to India has not been great equality has been particularly good and the price tends to keep going up and up and up with a very slow delivery the actual quality of what's called an ... hasn't been a real problem\nYet I Wonder if they are going to send all those all broken ... and ... back to Moscow for her money back\nI'm not sure that ...

what happens if we put people in groups of\nYou know groups small groups in my workshop you know will will they keel\nAnd so this is just another experiment in my own mind and I was sitting there trying to figure out how to do this in a workshop because this is back in two thousand and eight and then I wasn't I hadn't really done many workshops before you know I'm an investigative reporter by training that's how I used to bust baby selling rings when I was you know young\nSo um so I I Will carry around this with my husband and I'm sort of saying well I don't know maybe I'll just put people in groups of eight and ... or so and have them send healing intention to each other\nAnd he's a good headline writer and he said yeah I Love it the power of eight so it can be about totally by accident we put people in groups of eight in our workshop the first one we ran in Chicago I\nI was kind of I I knew how to do intention I studied it we've intentioned masters I'd put together a program I'd looked at what we're doing scientific in the scientific lab\nBut it wasn't sure about these small groups should they hold hands which and they do so I'm I'm kind of making it up as I go along\nAnd the next day I figured I'd have them come back the next day and tell us what happened\nAnd I had all the groups and intention to somebody in the group with some sort of health challenge and when they came back I assume they were going to tell me it's\nIt's kind of like having a facial or getting back ... do you know nice little feel good effect that isn't what happened what happened do stuff like this\nThey lined up I gave them the Mike in turn and they said things like I have cataracts and their eighty percent better I'm due for a knee replacement my knees completely messed up and I'm walking normally today\nAnd I can do deep squats\nI have terrible insomnia and I slept like a baby last night you know and on and on it went like that total instant healing and I was completely shocked because as I said I'm you know I I look at things\nAs a journalist I look at things I Try to look at the science of things that are trying to prove things\nAnd this was completely out of my realm so I didn't believe it I like to be honest George I thought it was a ... effect but then it started happening over and over and over I mean I've run hundreds of these things\nAnd I've had people where their their arm is dislocated and its slots back into place during the intention or somebody who had couldn't see well because she had a stroke and her eyes went back to normal somebody ... says\nWho went completely out of pain and we then you know a month or so were daughter wrote me just say that her back straight in so much they had to change the rearview mirror of her car\nShe stories like this over and over again and the same thing going on with some of the Sanders too and that was the thing that really was amazing\nTo tell me about this some show how how powerful the baby and then what was happening to them\nWell their ordinary people this is the amazing thing of at George we all have this power this is our birthright it's just we don't know this we don't know how to use it and we don't realize it amplifies in a group\nLet me tell you about the story of West with when I met him I put together a couple of groups at the mile high church in Denver just is kind of just as a test this was last last so I'm just last month full\nAnd um I ... wanted to put himself forward he was one of the ... the\nInitial groups um because he suffered from terrible depression but\nThere was a woman there with stage ... cancer Linda and so we\nWe decided to go with her but when it's had a terrible life he had been a really bright guy in college studying biochemistry wanting to be a doctor and he got a he got cold and he had a low lottery number in the very last years of the Vietnam War\nAnd they done away with draft deferments for college um college students so he had to go in the last horrible chaotic years of the war\nAnd it was so traumatic for him he came back was really depressed\nAnd that continued in his life even even lost the love of his life too fast growing cancer it was just terrible story so by the time he he got to meeting me he had gone to a point of feeling like what's the use\nAnd he was living in a senior facility barely able to get up and make themselves breakfast in the morning really depressed\nSo he does his intention for Linda [noise] and then that next day he told me he woke up and everything had really changed it was almost like he had this amazing heightened to sensory awareness you know the grass is greener than it ever been\nHe drank a cup of herbal tea and knock the socks off he says um but even more amazing was the next night he had this extraordinary vision was a dream almost like a vision where he was back in college and he met his Nineteen year old self\nAnd this than Nineteen year Old West communicated to him in some way it's all going to be okay there's still plenty of time and\nThat experience to him was so life transforming he's a completely different guy now he is power walking Ninety minutes sees lifting weights he's running group says it's at his church he's writing is trying to write again\nHe's doing all kinds of stuff and he had completely given up and that is only one time from being a cinder\nUm and this is a story I hear over and over again we're that active being part of this group of being kind of a higher consciousness is life transforming\nWindows two sons or need to have any special abilities\nWell here's the really interesting thing that you know I again did not believe this I was looking at it from every angle um it took me ten years to even get the courage to write this book\nAnd you were the skeptic ... skeptics\nI was I was the ultimate doubting Thomas because as I said I I started the intention experiments because I wasn't I wasn't really sure about all of this\nManifestation law attraction I didn't I wasn't sure I believed it and I wanted to find out how far can you take it you know we talking about the shifting of quantum particles are we talking about curing cancer here so um that's why\nThe intention experiments but I never\nI never thought these little groups would have the power but the thing that's interesting is I had a life university the largest chiropractic university I'm In the world and they offered to do studies of the power to let their nearest science department look at that [noise]\nWe set up a group of students and we put a ha kept to measure the brain waves of each one person one hindering each of the group and what we found was so amazing that within a few minutes\nThey would have completely different brainwaves signature it would turn off all the part of the power of a group we have a quiet him all the parts of the brain that makes us feel separate\nAnd also the parts of the brain that make us\nHave worry doubt negativity\nThese are basically brainwaves signatures of somebody who's handling\nInto the static one and when we compared these signatures when scientists you work at the doctors can't step me some of it um [noise] we looked at other things like the work of the University of Pennsylvania looking at the masters and and and Buddhist monk\nAny static prayer they had an identical brainwave signature but the only difference was I had you know it takes years to become a Buddhist monk or a female after sure my guys we're told oh no they were students who never even done meditation\nAnd all they had twelve minute video for\nMe I always said to lend we're going to take a quick break we're going to come back and just a moment to talk more about your work\nThe power of age and some of the

of age limit should amazing how would work and does it take much effort to make things happen\nWell that was the interesting thing about this [noise] no it doesn't I think would it take is meeting regularly it it takes some techniques and you know in my book the power of eight I've got all the techniques that people have to to follow to become a really good in tender\nAnd author contend well in a group but for me the thing the real key element is creating a little group of eight or so and you asked before\nThey have to be a no fly but work eleven or work you know eight is kind of a Goldilocks figure yeah you know it's like the not too big not too little\nUm but what's really important meeting week after week after week and I found that after I'm putting people in groups and twenty Fifteen I wanted to do my own experiment because I wanted to see\nBriefing and their lives would begin to heal not just their health so I got a group of two hundred and fifty together and have them you know I taught them for a while and then I put them in groups of eight or so and had the meat every week for a whole year\nAnd it was extraordinary of two people who continued to meet regularly you know every week\nAnd that was about a hundred and fifty of them pretty much a hundred percent of them had major life changing experience is so it wasn't just their health\nYou know they got financial windfall or they got amazing new careers or they made up with this strange relatives or you know they got a great new house just the one they wanted\nUm just came out of nowhere or they found a new knife purpose but pretty much everybody had extraordinary stories to tell\nOur our ... are you sure that this works primarily from the ... or ... or science we are\n[laughter] well I think there's a science in the sense that um we did that brainwaves study and we found that you know there are major brain changes that go on when you do intention of\nIn a group called ... group prayer in a way I'm In a sense that's what it is it's kind of secular prayer because you have these major changes\nWhich are really very very much similar to somebody having a mystical state do you know somebody having a mystical experience\nPeople get changed during those kinds of experiences and they allow themselves to be open to a lot of possibilities or they suddenly feel you know something major has changed all their senses are heightened um they feel really optimistic about their future\nAnd so in a way that starts to pave the way if you want to just look at what happens to the individual that paved the way for major changes\nAnd and possibilities but there's something more there's a bigger piece of this George that\nAnd believe me I'm trying to figure out what is it is a group of fact you know is it just the power of intention but a big piece of this is the power of altruism\nUm that was the big surprise for me because I remember this Sanders we're having amazing effects to healing effects\nAnd when I started looking into um the science of altruism it's extraordinary I mean people who do stuff for other people no matter how small live longer are happier are healthier in every regard\nAnd nuts what we found in a lot of our intention groups I mean when I talk about that group and twenty Fifteen and I was studying for a whole year\nI'm One of the people you know there were a couple of people that weren't getting anywhere you know one of them was a woman cold Andy and Andy was going through a divorce\nAnd she had two small kids she needed a new job and she was very talented in marketing and coaching and she just couldn't get anything you know young woman just couldn't get anything and she was just trying everything and\nWe talked with her and tried to work with her and this and that are group tried to work with her and finally I was a bit frustrated by it and I just said oh Andy get off of yourself start intending for someone else\nAnd she was one of the people who was intending for that young boy Luke and the moment she did that she gets a coal out of the blue from somebody offering her a dream job so can I tell you any everything about how this works\nSure absolutely not [laughter] there's a complete X factor here I don't understand but there is something about that power of getting off for yourself and doing for someone else that

haven't who were a little skeptical really didn't\nYou know sought to themselves yeah right and they had some healing doesn't mean everybody in an audience gets healed but a lot of them you know there's enough to say something really interesting is going on here\nAnd are you interested in the healing because it's easier to track in terms of the experiments\nYou mean at physical healing well yeah because it is it's easy to ... you know somebody had a condition they don't have that condition and we had a woman\nWas staged for cancer I talked about earlier and she's now you know down to

California Tom go ahead\nGeorge thank you for taking my call lamb that's really a pleasure a comment and then a question um I ... just\nYou know your audio or lecture programs one called living but field and the other one called living with intention and boy those audio compact desks are in constant rotation on my CD player\nI just want you to know that they're just so much information now you think about\n... causality retro in tension and you cite a number of experiments that appear to prove\nThat we can not only in ... for the president but we can and tanned for the past that the past is not\nFixed in stone so to speak that there appears to be with spare mental proof you cite a lot of researchers\nThere appears to be a robust cross talk between the past and the future and you cite ... how much mapped a job of the peer group in Princeton and each of the experiments that they did\nThat to appear to show that you couldn't influence the past that the past is not fixed my question for you can you utilize retro intention\nRetro causality for healing [noise]\nThat's such a great question thank you um yes the answer is the short answer is yes now I Do this all the time in my master classes a workshop semi just random retreat in Italy last week and we were doing a lot of retro intention one I tend to do though is\nHe can't change the past of what of what happened in the sense of it happened what you can do though is change your response to it and going forward and in a way that is part of this whole thing of time being really elastic\nTime being one big smeared out now and that's what the studies you're talking about demonstrate is that you know we what they really show is that and this is a weird thing um\nWe don't change the past we changed the present as it unfolds the future affects the present as it unfolds all those studies show\nBut just to answer your question why tend to do is ask people to go back to the moment\nTo moment in their health just when something just started before blew up to full blown to seize a moment where they first argument argued that somebody in a relationship\nAnd eight then deteriorated afterwards just that moment when it started for a moment when somebody told you you weren't good enough as a child or you were terrible at some\nThings we just just did something like that and to go back and change your response to that teacher and you say no I'm not use the math I just don't understand this now I Will later\nSomething like that or imagine that that healing that that illness doesn't blow up into full blown disease I'm actually had somebody\nWho got ... from an infection go back and imagine that time and I swear to you know she told us her skin was starting to re pigment in the workshop it was extraordinary and loads of people where\nThey were they were told something and it's in his sense released it for them going forward\nTo it's an interesting little technique but there's plenty more to mess around with with rich who intentions because even standard physicists now are saying to us all\nUm you know time is it what we thought it was it's not just for we're going era that we thought from cradle to grave it's much more as I say like one big smeared out now and one big smeared out here for space\nRich in Monterey, California is with us here rich go ahead\n[noise] yes can you hear me don't carry a

Twitter poll question we try to make a question out of each and every day's news\nAnd some days is more interesting than others but this one is intriguing should President Trump\nHas talked about Jeff Sessions possible replacement\nWith some obsessions subordinates now imagine this you're working at any job and the boss comes down and talk to people who work for you under you\nAnd he's saying who do you think we ought to replace Larson with when we get rid of him that kind of thing the Washington Post the venerable Washington Post and left leaning so they're never going to paint Trump in a favorable light\nReports President Trump talked recently was Jeff Sessions' own chief of staff about replacing sections as attorney general according to people who've been briefed on the conversation signaling the president remains keenly interested\nIn getting rid of his top law enforcement official the conversation between ... a Trump President Trump and Matthew would occur that seemed somewhat nebulous it was not clear for example whether would occur would take on an interim\nJob as attorney general or be nominated in a more permanent capacity or how definitive the president's intentions were on a long list of the indignities that session has endured from his boss Trump's discussing replacing him with his very own top paid kind of stands out\nOn the other hand I Want to give you a perspective on this\nBecause I'm not a legal expert enough certainly never served in office like this\nBut Jeff Sessions has deeply disappointed almost every conservative I Know that I've had the opportunity to talk to in fact every time we take the show on the road Washington DC a wind up talking to members of Congress and their staff I asked them what the heck is up with Jeff Sessions\nHe comes into the job and everybody I think almost every conservative thought very well up Senator Sessions he seemed to have a steel backbone he seemed to have a real command all the issues that he took

to take your phone calls and emails we'll get to that Kanye West have\nJust a little bit later on this hour but uh I've got Frank ... with me who's a a foundation professor at George Mason university's ... school of law and the author most recently of the Republican workers' party how the Trump victory drove everyone crazy and why it was just what we needed this ... welcome to the program things all the time\nFlora thank you for having me\nI'll tell you I Know there are a lot of people who are dismayed by the fact that we now have a disruptive force of the president but frankly I I think we needed a disruptive force and your thesis is that he delivered just what we needed\nA survey right I mean what you were and bound for stagnation remember when people talked about two percent groping the new normal now we've got four percent yup they said it could never happen and we had to say I'm Sorry to say we had a Republican Party led by\nYou know really nice people but they just ... up to the struggle of take it on to them you\nKnow they weren't and so he's kind of kicked the bucket over and force everybody to rearrange things and obviously that causes disruption I mean it didn't cause the departure soon enough for me of Paul Ryan but uh but he I mean we are getting rid of him eventually I mean now at the end of the year\nUh but but this is the kind of thing that occasionally even private organizations need you need somebody to come in and act as a disruptor\nAbsolutely right I you know and the thing about that and I'm Glad you mentioned Paul Ryan I couldn't agree more of a thing as the Republican Party has lost touch with you know with ordinary Americans\nAnd I worked on the campaign I wrote speeches for the for the president I buy some ... we were very consciously going after just regular American you know all raised his grades and all that I mean but we're looking after the people who have been left behind\nAnd I you know I'm a I'm afraid that the kind of internationalist wing of the Republican Party ball in favor of you know\nFree trade agreements and all that bad lost touch with them and and then the end you know we succeeded I'll tell you one thing about the book I debate left wing hurt and and they say workers kind of we're on that or not I say you know your ears to\nThere you can be a Democratic Party but look after ordinary people and that was an honorable party but you've given that up and you know what we ate lunch\nIn fact doesn't seem that outlook I'm a conservative I'm a Republican I've got a dog in the fight here so I've got an a built in biased but when I see the Democrats trying to position themselves as the the you know the party of the working man working woman\nI keep wondering uh policies they adopt seemed to be about shifting and redistributing wealth which means not just the well to be like Donald Trump and Bill Gates but also the wealth of folks who are just making a an average family income of I think now the ... sixty thousand dollar range their redistributing that wealth as well and and so they're\nThere to the antithesis of representing that individual worker who's probably worked very hard to get to that sixty or Seventy thousand dollar household income\nBy the way that uh from about fifty six thousand about five years back I mean we're we're doing pretty good I mean it wages are going up\nBut you know the thing about the the the downs as they invested in identity politics which had nothing to do with the concerns of a bit of people looking for a job\nAnd you know and and now they're talking about socialism and a boy talk about a way to bankrupt the country I mean that you know they they do not have a clue I mean I I feel sorry for ordinary Americans than uh you know who who are misled into voting for these guys\nYou know ... ... you just said something that made me think uh from time to time I'm Talking to folks and you follow politics closely so do I and\nSometimes are used terminology that that seems a little opaque to folks and I've had people ask me about various terms and one of them is identity politics I Want you to define that for my audience the way you see it\n[noise] it's hard to hear from them um you know you start by saying what's their race what's their gender and so on\nAnd uh and and you know and then if you're the wrong way to the wrong gender that does to your your your there they're not they're really interested in New but mostly\nYou know it means that they're obsessed with you know the old concerns like\nTransgender bathrooms bicycle lanes I mean concerns that played to the elite of the country\nI mean it's only people are really rich are going to worry about that stuff it's okay it's it's not the the coal mine are looking for a job\nRight to know about the oil worker who's who's worried about uh about you know what regulations are doing to the economy so you know they they've gotten invested in frivolous Lutherans are the people got you know made it\nAnd made me that everybody else behind I'm Talking to Frank Frank ... who's at George Mason University School the school of law and the author most recently of the Republican workers' party how the Trump victory drove everyone crazy and why it was just what we needed\nBut I I think you've spoken to some of these really important because\nWhen you become an a lead in other words most of the people that you have daily contact with our people who've made it they make big salaries they don't have to worry about money nobody's saying I Wonder if I make the house payment this month or the car payment or can we really afford to take a vacation this year these are people in an entirely different class\nAnd so like you say your ear concerns change when those are the people you talked to daily and then but you have to build in or out in pretend they care about that coal miner who's being who Hillary Clinton famously promise to put out of work right to their face and said we're going to put you out of work and then we'll find a job running a computer or something\nI I tell you something that was really I found really interesting there's this county and Kentucky Harlan County the sacred ground for the leftist toward the series justified as sad and that's where\nThere was this big old union battle back in the Nineteen thirties and Pete Seeger had this song which side are you on and I I I thought this was great you know I Know which side the elite is on I saw the coal miners and Harlan County voted eighty five percent for Donald Trump\nSo you know but you know talking about the elite that look you know I Confess I'm living inside the beltway I'm a lawyer\nBut then I aspire to be a traitor to class 'cause I got these relatives who are working on the assembly line than Detroit and I figure if I'm On the right side of them I'm On the right side\nI think you're absolutely right one of the things you wrote about in the wall
