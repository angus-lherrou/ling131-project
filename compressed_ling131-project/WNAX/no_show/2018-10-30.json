It's MORNING and\nWe get together\nReally five Seventy ... maximum\nLars Larson show the it's a pleasure to be with you on a Monday evening and\nWe are one week away tomorrow from the election that will decide what happens in the midterms typically in mid term elections the party that is in the White House loses seats and the party not in the White House gains\nOn thought to talk about that with Dr David Byrne who's an adjunct professor of history and California Baptist University in Santa Monica college and the author of the new book Ronald Reagan and intellectual biography Dr burn welcome back\nBaptist University in Santa Monica college and the author of the new book Ronald Reagan and intellectual biography Dr burn welcome back to the program\nThanks for having me Lars\nSo let's talk about this a Ronald Reagan did not do well after his first two terms in office city\nThat's correct now he lost twenty six house and Senate looks like Trump may be poised to lose something similar but as you noted it's common for the president's\nParty in power to lose seats on you know the the first sentence but as you also know Reagan was able to recover it and he was able to land a massive reelection they hit us twenty six house seats as his first term elections\nBy the way Donald Trump at this point is showing approval ratings that are in the forties where it was Ronald Reagan at about\n... roughly the exact same place as far as his approval ratings um towards the end of a second term or high thirties forties but gradually like Conley approved and the third or fourth year\nOf his presidency approval ratings or to propel it in ... reelected in Nineteen eighty four but at first I was in his presidency his approval ratings are roughly right where Donald Trump's are\nYeah because you point out in your writing that\nWhen Reagan left office in Nineteen eighty nine there were still people in his own party who didn't like him there were lots of Democrats who didn't like him I Know that there are lots of Democrats today who aren't even alive when Ronald Reagan was president who don't like Ronald Reagan a lot of that based on mythology\nBut people have to remember that if anyone thinks you're going to have a president with approval ratings in the sixties or seventies\nIs not likely to happen Reagan had an average of ... approval rating as you point out that went all the way up to fifty two point eight just barely above the middle and so you have Donald Trump gets into the forties now and the economy continues to do well\nHe might hit twenty twenty with some very nice approval ratings from Americans about how well he's doing the job\nI think that's definitely true especially if the American economy stays strong although unemployment rate and it's actually lower today that was that any time during the Reagan Eric ... today um it's probably\nAbout ... five during the Reagan Era so yeah I think the economy continues to grow and expand and as long as it stays in Trump\nOr probably maybe beginning towards the end of his third year maybe even the middle of next year he will begin to see his approval ratings rise too much like Reagan's\nDead so even with the crunch down by the fed which is raise rates now three times\nA it looks like we could actually finish out the fourth quarter of this year or getting close to four percent GDP now I think I think the Trump would be doing a lot better if he got the kind of favorable coverage that\nA a bronco bomb a God for producing a lackluster economy the media seemed to be in a slobbering love affair with Obama and they seem to hate\nTrump with a passion if they were to to do stories that pointed out how much things have changed and how good things are right now economically speaking for Americans\nTrump might have an even higher approval rating the fact that he has a an approval rating in the forties when the media keeps telling Americans no matter what's going on around you the guy's a terrible guy\nYou know I I agree lawyers and you know and I think I ... followed Reagan ended up until ... does that compare the GDP Growth with Obama parade and GDP Growth that darn it eight years president average about four percent\nWhich is very strong so it was nearly two percent I'm ... right now it's it's been about three percent and the second year but yeah you know I I think your light it lead it certainly always and no one with the ...\nWith with a point that that that made it much harsher on Trump than it has been Obama which you know and they completely stay are considering a GDP Growth has certainly been stronger under Trump than Obama but of course it hasn't been yet styles that was under Reagan I Know that are all over again that was nearly ... percent\nNo it has an and and I guess some of this is about times do change and I know that when when Reagan was showing these great growth numbers for the economy I\nDidn't hear I hadn't heard any economist saying it'll be impossible for us to reach those and the other piece that I think is not being mentioned and you tell me what you make of it\nIs that if reporters were honest and said heading up to the twenty sixteen election when Donald Trump was saying we can grow it three or four even five percent\nAnd all of them said no no no no the smartest people in economic say America has a new normal that different than the Nineteen eighties and then we can never get really much more than a tenth or a two tenths of a point above two percent and Trump is already producing that number if that contrast was being drawn by reporters\nAnd believe me doctor I say this because as a reporter myself for Twenty years\nWe always I mean that was a big part of the job of being reporter because he didn't just say well the number is to this today\nA ... because people would routinely want to know well what does that number means you say well it was half of that a year ago and it might be twice that a year from now\nThen that gave them some contacts for understanding what a particular number means whether you're talking about unemployment rates are\nAverage household income or any number if you said gee we got a lot of rain this year well how much should we get well we've got twenty percent more than last year uh then then that gives people a contact surrender saying oh we did get a lot twenty percent more than last year\nBut I have yet to see a single mainstream reporter maybe I've missed it but I read a lot of different news sources but from both the left in the right I've yet to see anybody in the mainstream say\nAll the smartest economists said that economic performance above about two percent was simply impossible including the likes of Paul Krugman and Donald Trump is already eclipse that number handily\nStill here exactly right laws you know the same thing happened in the late seventies early eighties right before in the early years of Reagan's by a safe you know the economists are saying well you know several eight percent unemployment ... percent GDP Growth that says the new normal but Reagan was a ... optimistic and all that and that it's better than that\nAnd like you said it it it definitely has a price so the economists say well\nYeah the ... the GDP Growth is going to continue like ... percent uh yeah it doesn't it has to be that way as an optimist\nKenya that America ... to do better than that and I think you're right and I think that the media to be a little more optimistic and do a little better job of shelling out you know the American economy has done better and can you can continue to their\nDoctor burn is the author most recently of Ronald Reagan an intellectual biography before a ramp up tonight with you I Want to know\nI Know that this makes it certainly makes a left cringe when I say those but it also makes even some of my conservative friends cringe when I say are their favorable comparisons to be made between Ronald Reagan president Ronald Reagan and president Donald Trump\n[noise] sure there are favorable comparison and stuff for example both Reagan in ... I Believe in heavy dispense defense spending most of them believe that that you know a strong America's it better America a Reagan of course along with Tom you know the lower taxes for for for all classes really\nAwake and of course cut taxes or every class so basically the same thing so they're definitely you know by comparison the similarities between your prize that he had a difference as to but you know there are similarities they certainly are opposites\nBy comparison similarities between your prize at the other differences too but yeah there are similarities they certainly are opposite\nKnown in fact I've I've seen that as well and while obviously does the communication style of the two men is very different they both are very good communicators\nOh absolutely they both are that ... thing or a message on my ... Reagan message a little more optimistic and Trump\nIs a little more gloomy and pessimistic but despite that I agree that they're not ready to convey a message that was the content that what they can say it's a little difference I really hope that he's lost his interests or at least the next two years as president it\nBecomes a little optimistic and supposed to regulate ... you know the classic argument that raking made with it It's MORNING in America at best days are before us and I hope that Trump at least to emulate Reagan\nA little bit more and and as often as I\nSee I I supported both to demand is president I voted for both of them in\nTo get it all the way from white lab coats you know doing experiments with bickers all the way to appeal you can get from your pharmacy and take is about two billion dollars if you can't get that two billion back\nVery few people I think are going to be willing to say well let's throw a lot of money into that will come up with a wonder drug and then everybody will insist on getting it for fifty cents a bill that that doesn't work nobody wants to do that and nobody will do that so\nWhen we stopped doing it who's going to develop the new drugs to treat ailments you know that that aren't treatable right now\nYeah absolutely nobody will and and that it's a big part of the problem there's all sorts of ways to address to the price controls\nOverseas in terms of intellectual property right you know in ... with the countries and that's something that because we know we should be pursuing it to make sure the respect our intellectual property rights and that's it\nI think a smart way to proceed but it price controls is going to do exactly what you said we've had some great innovations in terms of cancer in terms of hepatitis C cures it didn't exist before and we did a lot more to do and if we if we step on price controls we're not going to get\nWell and see that's the concern I've got dark because I'm I'm pushing sixty at this point I have to take a couple of medicines that had been out of copyright or pat and for a long long time so they're dirt cheap even if you have to pay for him out of your own pocket\nBut I worry that we're ... we're gonna have all these companies say I'm not going to go out and spend a lot of money to come up with a new drug if I can get the money\nIt seems like the uh get the money back for what the cost of developing was and making a profitable and frankly\nFor all the people curse the pharma companies don't curse him\nThey want a Fifteen Percent return is a high risk activity if they took the same money and put plowed into a restaurant they get eight percent return and other investments they'd get other returns what you want a slightly higher return\nBecause you're doing a more risky activity that brings lawsuits and you know terrible stories in the news you make a bad drug and you don't know it's bad to lose out and you know a hundred thousand or two hundred thousand people a ... they're all kinds of risks for risk there ought to be reward so\nIs it I'm I'm just wondering why when the president's focus so much on trade and intellectual property up till now why he doesn't say we're not going to put price controls on we're just going to Canada and China and Russia and Western Europe you got to pay\nSomething closer to the real cost of these drugs and if you rip us off we have ways to punish you through lack of access to American markets wouldn't something like that also have the ... in other words\nIf the pill really takes twelve bucks a pill to recoup the cost and Americans are now paying fourteen dollars a pill and Europeans are paying four dollars a pill or because because they're ripping are candidates for being four dollars a bill\nWhy we tell candidate they gotta pay the same price we do and Europe has pay the same price but the overall prices will drop from fourteen down to nine Europe will pay more will pay a little less the drug gets paid for\nIt doesn't seem like a more sensible way to go at it\nSo close to the way it is you restrictions we have it any better off kind of globally things would be so things are always complicated so they don't always work out you know we would like it or as you were describing but\nI I I think the end of it is spied on in terms of having trade negotiations and we we all we need our intellectual property rights are respected and that's something that you know if it's important to achieve a pharmaceutical isn't it's important in many other kind of interesting\nIntellectual property rights respect it isn't that something that you know if it's important to achieve pharmaceuticals inch it's important in many other kind of interesting is well that's something that you know we want to engage more with the world\nAnd into until we need to make sure they do all the intellectual property rights are respected you know you hear the point that you made which I think he's also\nReally important to emphasize is if you're investing your money for your retirement or your kid's college or whatever you're saving for vacation new boat ... you're not going to put it in a company that's going to lose money\nNo company we can't get that risk or or trade off if you think about it ... your own investment where are you going to put the money\nAnd if somebody said hey look we're going to slap on price controls on some of the most innovative drugs and you can't recoup costs can that company I think most people would say no\nAnd I think that almost humanize is exactly what they kind of capital markets sausage occurring why would\nYou invest in a company that can't get you kind of your\nOwn personal financial goals\nAnd Dr the only thing I Wish I Wish the form of companies were out there more instead of talking to Congress talking to the American public\nBecause almost every other industry the traces these kinds of problems with government said markets comes out and makes its cage to the American public and I think the former industries for some strange reason is being very very quiet about all this and that makes me wonder why aren't you making the case we need\nThe money and if we have to get it from you will get it from you and if we can get it from you then you might not see the drugs at all\nDr Weingarten thank you

Patrick O'Donnell a bit this year in twenty eight teams because it is an historic time this year\nA hundred years ago this week\nAs he writes the first raised with Don were poking through the trees\nMarry US military cemetery in France as lieutenant Arthur do we know in the ... earth beside one of the hundreds of crosses in that field Patrick welcome back to the program and would you like to tell the rest of that story for me please\nIt's great to be back Lars\nAnd what we're talking about is the anniversary of the selection of the unknown soldier fitness is America's unknown soldiers\nThere are several uh know soldiers in the actual tune in to a soldier wants but there's the first soldier of the first on a soldier which the world war one soldier there is a World War two soldier there's then there's the Korean War soldier and what we're talking about is the original announced soldier\nAnd it's really a a solemn and in a court and storied American history\nWas that I tell in the book the unknowns which air route and\nIt's it's really a remarkable story we did not have the with with the conclusion of World War one we did not have an unknown soldier for several years the um you know\nThe war department felt that they could identify the twenty seven hundred Americans that were listed as a male and they were in many of them had been badly ... mutilated\nBy heavy artillery shells et cetera they were missing in action it was hard to tell who was who is still I Know but they still felt that they could do it\nAnd um there was the thought that the that all of our soldiers can be identified and that really it wasn't happening and what what occurred though is the great powers like France and England\nBoth decided to designate a special to for those who are considered a no it it really represented all of those who had fought as the great war it was a sense of of ... giving a sense of closure to the war\nAnd what happened is in the United states there was a movement that that was created interestingly enough it was a a a woman editor for a very popular women's magazine those delineate or to sort of\nYou know put out this thing that we need to have our own no soldier and she created a movement the press got behind it and then the war department finally got behind it in a very influential congressman from New York I'm a congressman Hamilton Fish who was a\nIt was an officer in\nWhat was known as the Harlem health ... so this was a um a a segregated unit in during World War one um and he was a white officer in the unit the distinguished themselves in combat it it fish really got behind the idea of an unknown soldier gets it through Congress in Wilson signs it and then\nBasically you know the anniversary last point where\nWe went the greatest registration units went to the four great cemeteries and France where the major battles were fought this is bill or the use our God sand and how even the ... fought with the British\nAnd they were moved for unknown soldiers from the cemeteries they carefully checked the bodies to make sure that there were no dog tags are identification papers they wanted to make sure that these were really unknown soldiers from America event brought them back\nTo show loans France or there was a ceremony and\nThe French population turned out for this there were many many of those in the population that have lost their sons to war and they really felt a connection to America they'll love for America for what we get done ... basically said France during World War one\nAnd there was an honor guard made up of of the ... you know the Koran and the French Army that at really saw an action n word highly decorated and\nThe plan was for the for an American general to select the unknown soldier and\nIraqi official at the time it was as Andrea ... who is a tension Mr conscious than other friendships initial said hey look we used an enlisted man to select are on the soldier that literally that night\nSay an enlisted man was selected who was one of the polar bears a vis a procession\nAnd his name was Edward younger surgeon at ... who's with the nineteenth century regimen is the second edition I get into this if you were younger story in great detail and he ended up because in most of the major ... he was wounded several times and that was really is distinguishing marks\nHe would he had effectively what was known as the wolf shepherd what was the precursor to the Purple Heart and he had two of them and\nYounger was selected that night uh spontaneously because he has the best record of the other men in the group and um he was given that morning and he collects you're white roses\nAnd the inside of the the city hall she loans for flag draped casket\nIn younger as words were it was absolutely sublime as he saw the flag or these caskets the flow was lined with with rose petals and he walked in but he realized the gravity of the situation he couldn't decide and um he\nCan't taste around nervous late and then said a prayer and he said that the second casket to his rights here to help this motion when his hand he just stood there frozen in his hand literally move without him moving it he felt like he felt like the heat\nOh this notion way they can you just stood there frozen\nAnd it can literally move without him moving it felt like he felt like that he had no and the man in the casket somehow Batman because ... somebody that had died next to him maybe even taking a bullet for him and he placed flowers on the casket it mad as America's unknown soldier\n... ... you know it really is amazing and one of the things you mentioned a moment ago that the war department even a hundred years ago where we're confident that they could actually determine who all these service members were and and you can imagine how much easier would be today\nTo identify the remains of a service member or even a civilian uh who who might have been killed you know and and yet they thought they could do it back then and and by today's standards of what they had to work with was was not much but they\nThey they clearly were intend on trying to make sure we identify every one of our of our last to members of the service and uh but it was it was smart it surprises me that out of the civil war there was no\nUnknown tomb of the unknowns of going going back into the Eighteen hundreds\nNo there wasn't and then the thing is a true American history there are large numbers of unknown grades or even at Arlington there is a mass grave of union soldiers that are ... that are considered a nose and uh you know that still exist there's there's ... there's multiple areas where there's no ...\nIs there any ... or is there any effort going on today to try to go back and identify those service members or are simply too many years gone by\nYou know I I don't know if anybody's actually thought about it you know and another example I can give you is this shit um memorial that's in Brooklyn in their lives literally\nUpwards of over ten thousand bodies at the American service members of the revolutionary war and these men were imprisoned on on British ships\nConcentration shit shifts basically and their bodies were just hold overboard after they died them die because it will do the shifts were\nFilled with disease they were starve to death on these a prison hawks in their bodies are just thrown overboard and those were literally washing ashore\nObject cage after the revolutionary war and there\nAnd they were just gathered and gathered up into a pile of skills and do the place in this little oil a which is in in uh near green park in Brooklyn so there's literally\nPotentially you know thousands of Revolutionary War sort soldiers that are buried there that are unknown as well\nBut you would think knowing that that's a country that knows it has to protect itself and even on the very very grassroots level that you would think it would make perfect sense to say we we need to have some some way to repel an attack like this the police will be there quickly but not nearly quickly enough\nTo stop this kind of of of murder and and there were in fact for police officers who were wounded as well and so\nYou know this this is something that and yet in that very city in Pittsburgh last week the school board voted not to allow police officers to carry guns in schools and then a couple of days later this happens I Wonder how the vote might have gone had the vote been taken this week instead of ...\nWell it probably won't be changed sadly that you know we see this over and over and over again I've had clients who were told except will bring their children to daycare to drop them off in the morning on their way to work in uniform\nBecause they were carrying a firearm\nYou know and people have said well we don't need firearms we don't need people to be able to react to it we just have metal detectors well first of all metal detectors at a house of worship basically would be running\nThe individuals who support the congregation through the metal detectors and if somebody shows up to the metal detectors will start shooting you still are start stabbing people are dropping an id you still have to have someone to protect\nThem and someone to respond to that threat and\nYou know it's really interesting and due to a you mentioned a law enforcement response an excellent law enforcement response the United states about four to six spinach and due to an incredible military\nAt an incredible law enforcement source throughout the United states we have lived in relative comfort with soft targets being exposed other countries recognize that these targets need on security\nAnd you know I listen to the mirror Pittsburgh's comments he said he does not want to live in a world\nOther countries recognize that these targets need on security and you know I listen to the mirror Pittsburgh's comments he said he does not want to live in a world where we have to have on security outside of a church well no one does but that's all\nWell and when you imagine I haven't checked but I'd be willing to bet you ten dollars lands\nThat the mayor of Pittsburgh has armed security with him so would you imagine that there's armed security at the mayor's office there is in almost any medium to large size city in America there's armed security with public officials\nHave to go to a ball game at a stadium at a university there is routinely armed security now may take the form of state police were assigned to that event but they understand large gatherings of people are often the target of Mad Men like this Robert Bauer\n[noise] well it would not surprise me if the mayor of Pittsburgh it's a large city I visited it's great city\nI wouldn't surprise me if there is on security but what you know people don't even realize at conferences that long for psychologist we'd had armed security outside of the doors before and and even though law enforcement tends to be a harder target\nThere is a vulnerability there where people are not focused on their own safety so\nHow do we fix this problem I mean because if we have institutions like those who say I'm not for forcing it on them but how do we how do we stop this problem if the people who are perhaps the most attractive targets to nuts like Robert Bowers will not protect themselves\n[noise] well the first thing is be realistic and stop living in a dream world you can't say to yourself well we don't want to bad things to happen here and therefore they won't happen but it's just not realistic in addition you know my son has been retain several times\nTo help design security programs are trained people inside of houses of worship because there's a recognition that there is a different risk for a little\nChurch than there is for a church in the downtown area with a lot of exposure\nWhere the congregation meeting times are published all built big billboard out and ... and the realistic nature of the assessment has to be done and to deny it really is not only tonight a truth but it's to put people at risk as we've said\nWell and I think about the fact that most houses of worship in the United states are open some of them are open twenty four hours a day which is great and it fits right in with the message the most religious denominations believe in but if you're going to be open twenty four hours a day if you're going to have a door that is open to all\nThen I think you have a duty to protect the people there\nAnd that's not to blame the people who lost their lives on Saturday\nIs to say I wish we could have made sure that they were still alive today Lance thanks for what you're doing all mentioning

think it's a split screen election in part because where I think kind of back to where we were at the beginning of summer which is a house that is poised to flip to the Democrats may not but I think

or\nAre mixed at best to very poor and voters interested in and making changes for all sorts of reasons and then in the Senate you have a very pro Trump Republican battleground bunch of red states

are that are helpful to Democrats or helpful in terms of where they're going to steer independence and then I think they're going to overtake the\nUh that are helpful to Democrats or helpful in terms of where they're going to steer independence and then I think they're going to overtake the care of an issue but in part it's just because we have to defer battle\n[noise] um it's fun and the Trump voters in ... saying we're not routinely people that the Republican Party counted on for voting I'm being very diplomatic monitoring around this story are they going to turn out is there an issue they care about or did they wait for twenty\nFive spoke tonight with John McLaughlin a Republican pollster who says the most important issue next Tuesday will be does the Trump will turn out\nAnd that's why Trump is so ... going to Trump centers in Fifteen twenty states car running six rallies between now and the election trying to get out the vote a he's not going to any counties were he was close or lost to Hillary\nBob we will know that and I'm I suspect them the whole thing about the caravan is about driving out the Trump vote saying that you know I'm president but you don't know time to for relaxation the country is still in danger and that's why Trump uses such Marshall language even at a tone that would seem inappropriate after Pittsburgh\nHe's trying to basically say we're still in a war footing which means we have to demand sacrifices from you go vote\n... to have a question a general we're talking you know obviously it's a mid term it's a base election both sides want to turn their supporters out are you seeing any single issue that is really swaying the independence one way or another David [noise]\nI don't know if we're seeing a single issue I think ultimately Trump is the factor and were trunk can be helpful and John mentioned where he's going to be traveling\nTrump is helping to turn out his base and what we're seeing unlike a year ago is very little separation between the Trump base and the standard Republican base and there's little separation between the Trump base of the Republican incumbent who Trump didn't always get along with but does at the moment\nI I think in the house it's working against Republicans by and large you just have so much energy and money even where Republican enthusiasm is ticked up\nUm they're still fighting across such a big plane field it's become so why even today the Republican House campaign committee ... advertising in Charleston South Carolina in a district\nThat are elected Tim Scott a few years ago and really shouldn't be a problem for the Republicans but all say they're just so many house districts that are competing for because of all this anger and a mixed that as being motivated by a a rejection of Trump but that's what's making it very hard for for Republicans in terms of the house fight\nJohn you know the\nFirst billionaire president ever elected as apparently encourage lots of other billionaires to go take 'em down\nA Michael Bloomberg was obviously running for the Democratic nomination won some scouts of all he is a dumb I think in the last day or two six million dollars in a single house race Dana Rohrabacher is in California which is now I think the most expensive house race in the country almost thirty six million dollars spent\nThe amount of money that his poured into this widened the playing field that David mentioned is astonishing we've never seen a party control Congress can be so swamped in terms of resources\nBy the opposition party which is a minority\nOr it's almost as if K Street spiritual donors are irrelevant these super PACs are by the way Democrats by the way no longer complaining about Citizens United you'll notice these super PACs and these billionaires are dominating the playing field financially in the selection of the Citizens United is not benefiting the Democrats the Republicans\nAnd John six million dollars from Bloomberg uh one district in one district because he wants the house that said\nHe wants credit for turning warehouse he wants to read it for carrying certain districts he wants to establish his bona fide he's as a democratic\nYou saw him as the Clinton team that's again John today well if\nThe Democrats take the house you'll hear more rumblings about that or it may be implausible but she says she she looks at

that you know and the site and every place and the NYPD court stepped up its efforts we have a meeting tomorrow where we bring everybody together to address this subject\nThat once and for all we have to make security a priority and while law enforcement everybody has its role and government has to help it's got to start with the community and will help every community because the more we do\nThe more the police can do and and that we filling the gaps that they don't have to do and this is it has to be a priority and the the you know it's expensive it's difficult when you have such a plethora

right now the market of oil traders housing grossly underestimated the amount of oil that will come off market so one of the big distinctions between\nThis set of sanctions on the sanctions under the commerce ministry Russian when when they were in fact\nWas that there aren't going to really be any exemptions sanctions you won't get any relief\nSo we could easily see the the amount of oil prices go up another five dollars\nAnd then possibly five more dollars so it could easily hit Ninety\nAnd then we've got huge problems with excess capacity there really isn't much access capacity in the

difference because people say well hey does that oil and and you know we want control of batch etc etc [noise]\nIt it will make a difference to the vote and Scotland is already quite pro Europe is definitely there's a sudden\nI'm twinge of and the London\nIt's hard to be on the London unless you live in London um because of the way it seems to disregard the rest of the United kingdom but having said all that it looks like Britain is going to accept the European Union it's headed my direction and no matter what tricks\nThe European Union is as played Theresa May\nHum as just as tough as old lever and she is just going straight for keeping keeping going um doesn't matter what's happening around ... see what the Labour Party is doing she is just going forward towards the cliff if you like whatever you want to call it we're going to be cutting the cold with Brussels\nYes I see that but the remain or is are very strong Simon I mean I my reporting comes from what I read is the economist which is a runner and the Financial Times which is a writer and I appreciate that they very rarely bringing column is that our breath sitters\nThat would be the that that would be a challenge for them given that all journalism as I understand it in ... as practice in Britain these days is that remain are and they repeatedly say that it's going to damage the economy\nLeave Brussels to leave your up is that the opinion in Scotland that it'll will damage our economy\nThe opinion and Scotland that that I've heard it is multi faceted I'm the one is that we don't like your pain people send in Scotland does a lot of your parents live in an ad and brought a lot of your parents live in Glasgow as well to to be on to big cities that are in in central Scotland\nThere is some talk about it I think the economy but to be quite honest there isn't much of an economy in Scotland say compared to the to the rest of the u._k. it is a relatively small I'm\nA small amount of GDP and installed and so I don't know that we're necessarily going to see a massive decline in the economy here in Scotland I think the big issue\nIs that Scotland has a long history of being closer to the confident that it is to the rest of the u._k. and that that goes back to your point prince jolly on on those days\nYou know I think come on I think it could hurt in the short term it could have a financial services in London but I think the longest time\nThey could actually be very good for the economy or one of the things that\nEveryone should know is that to because food is a it's a big portion of poor people's budgets than as we get the sort of European Paris out of the way I can trade on World Trade organization rules the price of food will likely come down\nOn that will be an absolutely brilliant

especially with Northern Ireland because of the border between Northern Ireland and the republic of Ireland and that at the\nLondon is ready to make a separate deal a side deal in order to get that done for Brexit and Scotland wants the same deal why what would that do for you\nYeah that would be pretty interesting let let's go let's go through this ... them at Northern Ireland um it is critical for the how in the house of parliament for Theresa May's go much because of the Democratic union party which has this form of ... conservatives\nWithout those votes the MPs bat represented to you pay in London's parliament's\nTheresa May could know half a workable government so she has to deal with them\nAnd I can see how the Scottish national example if you're dealing with them it's only that but you should cut us the same deal and no doubt some necklaces such and who's the first minister of Scotland will be making much hay out to ... to try and get a separate\nDeal more more independent sort of in and out and that might happen I'm not so sure\nThat's necessarily going to fly because it almost looks like it's a it's breaking up the island of ... ...\n... on another island on the island of Ireland\nHum wherever Scotland isn't and I think that that could cause a lot more psychological problems an optical problems when you go back to London so hang on a minute you've you've cut a deal that basically the queen mind like which I Know sounds ridiculous\nBut it's a big deal I I I think it's a big deal and it was certainly be a big deal to be living in Scotland anyway that that's my boss I don't necessarily think that will happen but yeah it could\nSimon constable is my ... watch he is in Edinburgh, Scotland which is why we were keen on how the Scots are viewing people's lives in Scotland are viewing the Brexit ... going on in London in Brussels or we can count on the fact that the price of oil is going to help the Scottish environment\nIt's also a very good idea to look at the price of oil these next month is not driving season it's foreign policy events\nFor limited making marks he can get to kind of ... pairs of planes lenses that work for ten forty nine dollars on single making eighty nine dollars on the ground than\nA ... is the minister of interior and the ... that stands for the Islamic ... the law enforcement force of the Islamic republic of Iran a belly up is basically the official state police um they're responsible in theory for\nUm insurance law and order and uh I'm sure they do that to some degree in in prosecuting legitimate in the ... actual crimes\nAre but what they also do is a key role in suppressing protests and what we've seen over the last year about that in addition to folks like the ministry of intelligence um they have been on the one they had been the ones on the streets shooting at protesters are arresting\nA thousands of them um and playing a key role in stopping them um the minister of interior also plays a role in uh approving permits or or or in this case not\nApproving permits for protests you know in ... according to the Iranian law you can't a protest without a permit but in\nPractice or it's virtually impossible\nFor any protesters or to get a permit because the regime does not want anyone to demonstrate against them so [noise] uh the minister of interior or I think maintains this process they prevent people from protesting and when they try to prevent people from protesting and when those wells are defied\nThe day a ... you know the regime response to force\nThe minister of justice his name is ... ... a vi he was appointed directly in twenty Seventeen by Rouhani on the recommendation of lowering Johnny the judiciary achieve what do we need to know about how he presses the Iranian people say\nWell the minister of justice plays a key role in administering ah Iran's justice system though I think the term justice system is largely a misnomer um this is actually a system really aimed at enforcing\nThe will of the regime against its political opponents um this is a process in which trials can often last a few minutes or access to a lawyers remains limited uh or or none at all [noise] um\n[noise] ... basically if the regime or if there's even unhappy with any particular person they can throw them in prison that will um torture is very common death sentences a car or very calm and um so this is a system that really um\nShould not be regarded or with any real seriousness as ... as an independent a check\nOn the rest of the government um I I Would also add that the minister of justice of I in this case has also played a role in the Nineteen eighty eight massacre of thousands of political opponents that was perpetrated by the regime in Nineteen eighty eight or ... and the fact that\nHe was appointed to this position a despite this record I think is a very\nTelling rather troubling statement about a President Rouhani who um it's frequently us described himself as a as a self described the strictly describe himself as a moderate and yet proceeded to appoint somebody with an an an immense amount of blood on his hands\nYou mentioned the massacre in Nineteen eighty eight so we'll leave the ministers from the moment and go to other actors\nThat are in the list of twelve people who ... who I've been identified by the foundation for the defense of

about what's happening is\nArchery as supremacists or often allied with the left of that that's a that's a very worrying as I say statement about what's happening in our country more broadly\nYeah because you warned us for a long time that uh with the rise of sharia law in in various places in the middle east with a hint of it at least in part to Western Europe like friends and even in England\nThat we worry here about folks you know handing out offensively floods or or uh you know they they'll go in and they'll build vandalize the synagogue um but we don't often hear\nAbout people

reportedly up more I'm certainly in Europe it's on ... and I think that has an awful lot to do Lars with the rising\nPresence and increasingly in both the attitude of uh these surreal supremacist you know ... says\nForward into Europe but by the billions are not all Muslims are sure is a process as we've talked about uh we're talking about a subset of them but unfortunately there are there are hundreds of millions of people who believe that this uh ...\nBrutally repressive anti Semitic\nA massage mistake although phobic intolerant\nDoctrine of authoritative Islam is a is being practiced increasingly in Europe and it's creating I think an environment that's dangerous they're much as we're seeing in other parts of the world it's a it's it's dangerous for both Jews and Christians and as I said that sign outside the synagogue a\nTree of life that squirrel hill\nMinute if Pittsburgh inspired an effort that I've been involved in a cold that saves the\nPersecuted Christian Coalition and

getting a job or you know people are unpleasant to the talking about people being tortured or raped or driven from their homes or [laughter] crucified or or\nMurder on mass and that is part and parcel of what's going on it's not just let me be clear and it's not just Islam us who are doing at but an awful lot of our our meeting this said that the heads of those folks and we need to be alive to the fact that it's a it's it's creeping a through\nVarious parts of the western world just as an example are just one other skirt out that that just this past week [noise] a good friend of mine a woman by the name of the ... of Austria or was founded\nBy the European Court of human rights to have trans harassed by\nSpeaking about the prophet Muhammad exercising her freedom of speech which he has the

offend\nOthers religious feelings as they put that surreal blessed with me and that is the leading edge of the effort to force a you know a civilization to submit to this\nSugary a doctorate in programs that ...\nIt is very and let me throw another idea that you and this one's one I just just occurred to me as you were speaking about that Frank you remember how we worried over the last couple of years to the Soviet Union tried to use Facebook and other social media\nOr not some union Russia or did they use it to try to change the outcome of an election and we also while they're there have been efforts were kind of puny\nUh but you know we don't want people doing that anyway or having a foreign power or trying to interfere with their elections\nI heard the discussion the other night that was talking about the fact that an awful lot of these anti Semite like Robert ... hours or you know the guy who said do all the Jews most guys use being taken into custody in synagogue on Saturday\nThey've been pushed off can most conventional social media because social media sites like Twitter and Facebook say we don't want you on your so they've gone to other alternative ones that are more you know wild wild west when it comes to you can say anything you want\nAnd they said that you know in some ways that's good because it gets them away from the conventional sites where most of the people are focusing their social media with his band in the sense that they almost disappeared from public view until they pop up doing something like what Robert Bowers is accused of doing and it occurred to me\nIf you were in the middle east and you are a real law you know a a proponent for at here and and you said how can we screw things up in America and how can we advance our cars because they clearly hate Israel and hate the Jewish people\nOne of the ways they might do it and they could do it from a distance would be to get on social media and encourage the Robert Bowers and the world couldn't they but does anybody even looking for that phenomena\n[noise] I I think people are are perhaps not enough and maybe not aggressively enough but uh uh uh let me just add something to to round out what you said the hours because it seems to me that it's at least as problematic that\nA while the social media platforms that Google Facebook so Twitter's and so on are are migrating\nThe Robert power's off of their pages on the grounds that they're saying a pilot or hateful things they're also using the Southern Poverty Law Center which is a political warfare instrument of a left to try to keep people like\nUm it's not consistent or I should say it's not required by the fourteenth amendment of course Congress it does have the authority to extend citizenship to whomever lives but it's never acted to extend the citizenship this far and so a really this could be corrected today tomorrow\nIt doesn't need an amendment to the constitution as many people have objected to the rumors about what President Trump is planning to do it doesn't actually required amendments of the constitution to change it is it's really been a mistake and\nApplication of the fourteenth amendment and by the other branches that has given us this problem\nWell if there's no statutory law to speak on this and there is the amendment than all it takes is the bureaucracy to behave differently as you said the passport office or any other government agency that takes into account where you are what what country you're a citizen of primarily the state department than it is within the president's power to say\nStop issuing passports or any other documents to people who are not citizens by birth\nFried and and then the economy I understand it and actually\nWhat what we have is we have a a statute eight USC fourteen out one it's simply that teach the language of the fourteenth amendment including saying something that to the jurisdiction thereof and it's been executive application or you could say miss application of this language that's given us the current problem but it president\nWanted to correct it I don't see any reason why he couldn't correct that of course what we've seen during the Trump Administration is that\nFederal judges a hostile to the president have floored at his attempts to exercise is a legitimate authority in connection with in rats and eat grass so foreign people so I suppose we could expect to kind of blow up in the lower federal courts about this\nIf the president acted on it but it could well be that now there are five votes on the Supreme Court to uphold his decision\nWell and again in this case that law was written I think in fifty two and the other one we spend a lot of time with I think it was the McCarron act was written in fifty five do you think that the legislative history is at the members of Congress in Nineteen fifty to\nThe way back to what are we talking about our eyes and our the Taylor tail end you know I think it would be ... and our at that point wouldn't it where it was a true motives\nFifty twos Truman yeah of course we have there's a general rule in in the law that where you have a language that's been used before being repeated it should be understood as having the same meaning so what that would mean as if\nIf the Congress uses language directly from the fourteenth amendment to understand the language and the Congress has used as having the same meaning as it had in the fourteenth amendment which gets back to when I was saying before about what the chief author and another one of the most prominent are proponents in Congress said this\nThis ... subject to the jurisdiction there are men then again in what they said it meant was that the person in question didn't ... agents to any foreign stage so that would not cover uh foreigners it would not cover anchor babies that would not cover birth terrorists would not cover any of these people\nKnow and in fact you could start applying that right now although I Wonder about the practical application because he's at today's practical application if a\nIf a South Korean mom flies into Los Angeles or Seattle stays for a few weeks delivers a baby and goes home she likely goes home with a birth certificate from the state of California which is a sanctuary state\nSo does that become definitive of what and who that child is or is it the U.S government's policy at the time they were born it's definitive\nBecause if they go home to South Korea with mom and the kid turns Eighteen and then says okay mom I'm headed back to America since I'm a citizen\nDoes it matter what what we said today or does it matter what the policy is Twenty years from now or Eighteen years from now when the kid comes back to America hoping to establish himself and then at some point bring six or eight of his family members with him\n[laughter] well this is the kind of question that in a law professor would get on a final [laughter] to try to answer of course the\nThe legal answer I think is that that doesn't matter but practical answer is well I'm the president Eighteen years from now could order that he'd be given a passport so on the other hand of course\nYou think Hillary will be running Eighteen years from now [noise] I mean she's running right now I think so why not [laughter]\n[noise] well I'm a boy
