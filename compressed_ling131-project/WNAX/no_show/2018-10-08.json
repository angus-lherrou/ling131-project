probably most of us won't be able to do ourselves but maybe take some little pieces of it for yourself\nHere's our interview with Ben fatter author I take off your shoes one man's journey from the board room to Bali and back how as a little bit about where you found yourself and he thought this was going to be sort of a short term I'm going to fix this thing and get out to talk about that a little bit\nUm so we found a company that my partner and I found the company that was a really troubled SEC investigation FTC investigations being threatened to being thrown off of now stuck and you

out a lot about himself when he took his family\nTo bally for an extended period of time to kind of figure out what it is that he wanted to find him himself and for his family the important stuff\nSo I'm In this segment we find out what it was like to land in ballet for Ben fatter and his family so what was it like when you first got there what did you find in chanting about Sally\n[noise] so you know one of one of my little transformations was I became a lot more spiritual oh it was there and somebody said to the company which I didn't quite believe what a beginning to believe that there are certain places on earth are just spiritual\nUm ... one of them ball he's got one of the last intact remaining indigenous cultures that are really on political by a western culture it's a little small island in Indonesia and the world's largest Muslim country puzzles whole island is an island of ... and ... and it's very kind of\nStory more that's very kind of old from an ancient and um and yet they're inviting or westerners to participate [laughter] so I found there truly fascinating and spiritual and you grow up with religion in your life what did I grew up as north Dr wow so where are you the kind of or is it I Would if you are it's just become a Jew or come a Buddhist\nI was just getting day you're kind of the Jewish guy that was like yeah I get the spirituality I've seen a different flavor of that is where you are you more it's more state of mind than anything else right good when you go there how do you how do you happen to that spirituality like what happened they know you talked about yoga which you basically\nThanks [noise] well I used to lift weights I used to you know as cardio is kind of like I was doing what any hard charging that could you imagine what do they look when I went there I tend to set my wife's like what am I going to do over there I'm so used to all the stimulation coming at me from all directions\nThat no idea what was going to do and she goes you know you'll be boring it'll be okay you'll just be bored I wasn't worried at all I was curious about meditation I'd read a book about meditation I thought that was fascinating\nI wrote another book about brain plasticity and how we can change we are by changing our thoughts I started getting into meditation and into yoga into sorts of things that I just really about\nBeing centered and grounded and um you know spirit spirituality is kind of a big word and I don't think it has nothing to do with religion honestly in more down I just think spirituality is love love yourself for others love for compassion for\nPeople animals or whatever but I'm not at all interested in what are called like the ... the the church of Buddhism I'm interested in the philosophy but how did\nYou hear on kids adapt I mean because you and it was a finite period of time so you went in and said this is going to be a six month thing we're going to have our kids in school it sounds like he found it very cool school that was really interesting so you have this eighth grade granting boy what was his reaction upon learning about this game plan\n[laughter] so we we don't like is one of the time and we took a semi out to lunch at a local diner and uh you know kind of dropped I'm slowly but eventually kind of like you know who's listening and then he's like what what what did you say\nAnd what kind of repeated it and then you just sort of fell silent and he didn't speak again for two days so my God I just sort of I Need to leave that just walked out and he just kind of he didn't speak and then eventually victorious such and such I spoke to a guidance counselor\nThis is not going to hurt your chances at all for getting into college I 'cause that's the only thing he said you know like in about ... keep it actually came to realize like way there's no downside to this and I get away and I get a little vacation\nAnd I know at my college I think it's going to be said I don't think\nHe was a sophisticated as it turned out to have been a cause I don't think he knew a lot of them [laughter]\nWhen he got in his admissions officers sort of wrote on the foreign letter you know there's a form letter but yeah ... I really enjoyed reading but you're talking in Bali\nOr that I said oh You're welcome you and but I just you and\nThe bad effects on the other three tell me about what the way that they experience that you\nKnow they all changed in their own ways I thought my daughter was really bullied in school here and had a really tough time in school and one of the things she was curious about what is whether girls were me and like that everywhere in the world or just in her school and I'm ... I mean I kind of I I feel for those girls in her class also 'cause they'll probably that ... been girls [noise]\nShe was she was in a tough place is really tough choice and she blossomed blossom how\nNice okay you come back after this experience he or change then did you come back to the same job like where you take a sabbatical and you leave that you come back now to talk about the re entry and what that was like\nIn general my work now is really trying to synthesize what I learned in Bali in terms of um you know kind of being mindful and spiritual and all that stuff while at the same time being engaged in my work and competing in the world [noise]\nI don't think I could ever go back to who I was but at the same time I don't think I can be kind of this and I don't know what I don't know let's say who I was a label it but you know the kind of person I was while on sabbatical models about a ... but I Do want to retain us retain certain practices and I picked up in in uh in Bali\nThat guide me in central me and I'm allowed me to live a very full life and I I Move in the world is much different way I think my edges cut off\nAnd paradox we got like a more effective and able to achieve for what are you doing now\nWork was I run partnerships for large Chinese they're too big to giant Chinese companies want is all about those um the other is ten cents an hour south of us Kai further videogame business\nWhen you went back and I just got to the chase and the fascinating and she said what came back in and it sounds like he's sort of got pushed out from the previous position\nSo you're right so I came back you know we took over the company is part of a a from a private equity firm and then when I came back at what back not to the company but to the private equity right and it had been five years since I've been there and but I got there I was like it took about a year for everybody to realize my heart wasn't in it I wasn't into it they weren't into it so we\nWe kind of um came up with a plan and I became a vice chairman on executive robots inability to my own thing which is what I wanted to do a half and I was happy doing them until I got a call one day from Tempe something I thought well the school\nHow is it that way and you know you're working today\nSomething comes flying in your face talk about what you mean that phone call just rosy retire to yes so maybe that one or that e now where I sometimes get like the email\nAnd my heart starts racing and I have a whole like interior dialogue about what I'm about to say yeah and then I hopefully take a breath and say what do you do I try to breathe and\nNot say it because I sometimes I said here in Studio ... captured on tape he'll added it and he'll send me an audio clip of might be saying something horrible\nWhich is like he makes me a better human being by reminding me now to do that I wrote it has many Afghans usually and various languages so what do you do\nYou know even before I went to Bali had this rule about that which I call my twenty four hour rule which is don't respond or react to a twenty four hours even as whatever our ... applies to situations where like I'm totally screwed I don't I have no answer for how to get out of the situation\nUm and just by giving twenty four hours and letting it percolate solutions begin to emerge so give it a little bit of time and so I I kind of do what you do a little bit which is like I'd give it some time and breathe through it\nBut I find since I started meditating awhile ago I have this kind of like matrix move where it kind of feel like I just slow it all down\nTo ... you know ... it's a little bit and sort of observe and I'm so that I can respond to react\nSanta comes naturally now after years of meditation or just come into that stuff to say that I don't get those feelings every now and then human like everybody else\nBut on the margins I I have a much different approach to all of that right and I don't ... I don't take it personally right I mean forget the emotional part of it but cognitively it's good to know that we are all pre wired for that kind of um\nFight flight thing for a ... or whatever or negative bias is just the way the human brain works\nAnd just that knowledge to know it was like oh there goes again right sort of say there it goes again right recognize it for what it is 'cause it's not reality right it's just this this creation of your mind and which was the result of your brain the result of buildings that millions of years of evolution you know to recognize that for seconds like I'm not real\nThank you so much to band fatter check out his book called take off your shoes one man's journey from the board room to Bali and\nYou are listening to jail on money and we're not going to Bali just now now we're going to break and when we come back we're going to take more of your questions if you've got one send us an email ask Jill Jill and money dot com we'll be right back\nI used to post their job ... tons of resumes just to find a few people who are right for my job at old process was not smart man I went to a different technologies can resume forms to find the right people\nAnd actively invite them to apply so I get qualified candidates\nBut that's about it that's all you can do because no one cares about you or me if I'm not in their district right\nBut yeah I guess the other piece of good news Robert is that it this is going to get taken care of many people don't believe that it is going to get taken care of and the reason I Know that is that\nPeople who have Social Security benefits coming to them\nBecause those people want those benefits and in many um in many cases in most cases these people actually vote and so to not have these folks vote for you\nIs very bad so somebody is going to have to fix this problem it's going to become clearer and clearer\nWhat has to have okay so I think it's a great question now\nAnd I'm very I'm Glad you asked it but I also I think writing is a great thing but they all know what the problem is they don't want to deal with it\nThey just don't want to deal with it [noise]\nIt's sad but true All right you are listening to the Jill on money show or hey you know we've got tons of resources on the Web site at July and money dot com including links to Social Security how to manage your account online Social Security estimator\nAnd also of this led to a cool service called E.

liar\nI'm Tyler Perry him the number two team in the nation in this week's poll South Dakota state coming up and overtime victory over Indiana State in the inaugural precision agriculture bowl we we'll recap that victory what the head coach we got a couple of guests with us\nAnd we got a busy our coming up here from ... sports bar and grill so or to lie to you could join us a\nCoach we talk about playing the Missouri Valley football conference each and every week and I guess the best way to hammer home what happened on Saturday throughout the valley is that there were five games in the league all ten teams played\nAll ten teams lead in the fourth quarter or overtime of their respective games\nFor teams were trailing going into the fourth quarter and rally to win and then of course the wild game you had where you had the big lead Indiana State came back and then you're able to one of the overtime it just shows you what it's like in valley play any team could have won or lost in all five of their games and you're much happier to be up here after when\nThat a lot so without a doubt [noise] you know it's a you say it's a tough legal that was proof come Saturday Night that we knew Indiana State was good football team we didn't player best football but they're good football team and I think there was more games or when some games in the Missouri\nThough there are certainly much improved from a year ago and Ryan boil prove the quarterback why he originally went to Iowa why he was a two time ... or the year they really hadn't turned him loose but\nMany made some big thrills for Indiana State on\nSaturday yeah you did and and uh really managed game well uh I thought he did a great job throwing the ball he ran the ball when he needed to cut some scrambles and got some big first downs and that's always a concern when you have a running quarterback in people feel the same way about terror and when it when he drops back to pass so a\nHappy to get to win a any time in the Missouri Valley\nYou made this point I thought it was so apropos in a game that your defense didn't play up to the level you would like it to yell out five hundred sixty nine yards of ... per se\nIn the end you're defence when to the game first Joshua mantra guy it makes the great defensive played a battle pass away late and regulation that would have potentially won the game from Indiana State instead it settles for a field goal you force overtime\nAnd then second and goal from the one third and goal from inside the one you turn Indiana State back twice do we talk about the great pressure from around the outside that Ryan eras finished up on that tackle on third down to help them do a field goal so despite the struggles of the defense when you needed it most it was there\nWhen he preferred not wait that long you that but uh you know just an example or ... you know there's a close game there's going to be two or three the plays that end up winning the game for yet in this case when it's that close it's going to be at the end of the game somebody's got to make a play that has that makes the difference in the gang\nTearing Christian became ... career passing

leaving their marched in different ways obviously Karen would be a slightly better runner than the first two would that be safe to say\nThey would there he would but uh again a great young men great
