Monday Night glide take your phone calls and your emails I'll tell you it has been an interesting news day new claims about Elizabeth Warren and her DNA heritage Paul Allen the co founder of Microsoft with Bill gates all those years ago\nPassed away from non Hodgkin's lymphoma it announced a few weeks ago that the disease and come back we had no idea that it was that serious\nBut he has passed away

male who identifies as a transgender woman has won a women's world championship cycling event it happened this last weekend Rachel Kennedy a professor of the College of Charleston won the women's

gotten of the Netherlands and an American cyclist Jennifer Wagner to take home the gold and the Kennan celebrated victory on Twitter writing first transgender woman world champion ever allowing biological males who identify as transgender women to compete in women's athletic events\nHas been a controversial subject I Would say so\nHere's my thought on it [noise]\nIf you encourage your son and your daughter to take part in sports I think that's a good thing I don't think it's the be all and end all but it's a good thing to do however how are you going to encourage your daughters to go out and play in any of those sports where they may end up competing against somebody who is a biological mail\nNow imagine if your daughter plays tennis how would she play against somebody with the muscle structure and the height and the muscle advantage of a biological male\nAnd still looking at sunny and dry weather conditions even into your upcoming weekend on Saturday low fifties for high

[noise]\n\nLars Larson Joe pleasure to be with you on a Monday it's going to take your phone calls and your\nEmails Grover Norquist joins me now who's president of Americans for tax reform and I don't think anybody likes paying taxes but I pay what I'm legally required to pay for over it won't surprise you that some of my listeners have been paying way too much attention to the New York times story\nAbout Donald Trump and his taxes and how much the state of his father paid in taxes because apparently a daddy Trump managed to figure out ways to or that the Ira signed off on that were a legitimate way to transfer wealth\nFor themselves to his kids can can you fault him for something like that\nSaid absolutely not for starters Seventy percent of Americans for decades has supported the idea of polishing the facts that it should I pay taxes several times you pay taxes when you say you're stupid enough to die they want to take ... so this is ...\nMost Americans have wanted to get rid of for a long time Republican came close to getting rid of it under Trump is still there are a little bit uh\nBut what outrages me is that somebody in the IRS leak this you know uh you know somebody's tax structure uh I'm I'm kinda concerned that we trust the Iraq War that personal data that era taxes set for political reasons it might get\nShared a that quite sure what\nHappens politically member a Nixon after he lost a Kennedy was audited for the next eight years and both Obama and Clinton politicized the IRS I served on the condition or to look at the IRS during the Clinton years I was a Republican appointee and\nUh I heard many conservative groups heritage foundation's citizens against government waste other groups\nWere harassed by the IRS I talked to my left of center friends to see you know maybe they're going after all the the larger ... none of the left groups were a hit by that and I asked the head of the IRS who testified before our commission or as congressional presidential commission and\nI said look ah\nMy conservative friends are being harassed and gone after for no reason to them on the left this is not happening what's going on and he said that we've got to bury even handed a way we look at this I said well explained it to us and they said no at the secret\nYou are really ... and that was yeah that really you'll have to trust\nIs a ... a carry the senator from Nebraska said okay we've really exhausted the subject of what this is talk about something else gives the Democrats out of there\nYou know I Know ... we've exhausted at all I in fact Grover I've told people on the air listeners they'll say well why didn't ... release his tax returns I said you know\nThere are people who would sooner sure their home address with you or their cell phone number or the email address then they would tell you how much they make want their paycheck is and to know somebody is taxes you'd have to end up knowing not only how much they make\nBut how much they take home and what they deduct\nLike Hillary Clinton famously deducting charitable donations of her\nHusband bills underwear and things like that um blood talking about something a little more serious there is an analysis that you've done is president of Americans for tax reform about who actually pays the taxes and I think this may surprise a few people um who does pay the bulk of America's taxes right now\n[noise] well on income tax is about ... percent pay the top fifty percent [noise] um it's the top fifty percent pay almost a hundred percent of the income tax or it's extremely progressive a and a number of people\nWho are paying the taxes are shrinking a number so all Americans pay some taxes that's why\nA lower income people they they're particularly badly hit by cigarette taxes their taxes property taxes\nSales taxes so nobody nobody goes through unscathed the Democrats think they can tell people I'm going to make people pay for it lower income people are smarter than that they know they have the taxes they pay\nAnd if they think about it they know when the grocery store pay property taxes they pay for it when they buy eggs and del ... at the grocery store\nOr the grocery store does not any money it doesn't get some customers and every tax dollar that a grocery store pays in property taxes\nAre in sales taxes and income taxes to that workers that all come straight out of the customers are pockets so everybody gets hit but the idea that the rich are paying anything and they could pay more we actually I was just looking at church today United States has the most progressive\nOverall tax structure of all that major ah companies countries more than Europe you know all the countries you think of is very socialist and so on\nOurs is very scared out of the additional taxes on everyone instead of playing this game about that person seems to have all ten fingers let's take one\nHow about you know not worrying about how everybody's doing just let's get taxes lower on everyone\nAnd rover eat you know nobody would run their own life this way when I see the numbers you have the the top fifty percent of taxpayers the top income earners paying Ninety seven percent of the bill and the other half pay three percent I I tell people imagined you go to dinner with ten family members and one night you decide to do something different you say\nLet's have all the people at this table all you know cousins or nephews or uncles or whatever will seat the five highest paycheck folks at one end of of a long table and we'll put the other five people at the other end of the table and then when the bill comes\nIf the bill I don't think you could feed you know ten people for a hundred dollars but let's say you could just make the map easy\nWhen bill comes for a hundred dollars the people at the rich under the table Ninety seven dollars and the other five people at the other end to pay three bucks can you imagine doing that to your family one night\nHow long would it take for probably with leaves one end of the the wealthier end to object to that kind of arrangement\n[noise] since the ... one of the things that's very important to the left is to constantly say\nThat a higher income people middle income people aren't paying their fair share this because you can think that somebody is the government can get more money for free out of nowhere or instead of understanding that that a higher income people pay a great deal of taxes as it is um\nBecause the tax code is complicated and because they're trying to squeeze more and more money out there like to hide how much it's hitting you and where are there are problems and that it's too complicated we should go to a lower and simpler\nTax structure ah I grew up in Massachusetts where flat rate I'm Ted's at five and a quarter a\nFlat rate income tax and the very liberal blue Democrat Massachusetts the idea that we should have graduated a progressive income tax which Carl Marx lights at night yeah I'm not sure I get\nA in Massachusetts five times the left has put on the ballot let's go to a progressive her graduate income tax like the federal one and five times Massachusetts voted it down\nBecause they realize that if you divide the taxpayers into different groups and they pay different rates and they'll get mugged wanted at times seven year they'll get a lower income people raise it and then the middle of the upper and the back and forth constantly be changing but always up for it but if it's a flat tax\nThan the Kennedy kids and your neighbors cut all out don't raise anybody's taxes\nI think that's a great way to go Grover Norquist is president of Americans are transferred from reform Grover things for the time by the way you don't want to not smart jobs sites that overwhelm you with tons of the wrong resumes you know what he was smart zip recruiter dot com slash Lars\nUnlike other job sites zipper ... doesn't wait for the candidates to find you zip recruiter find them for you\nThe gene scans thousands of resumes identifies the folks with the right skills education and experience for your job and then actively invites them to apply so you get qualified candidates fast\nNo more sorting through the wrong resumes no more waiting for the right candidates to apply it's no wonder zipper critter is rated number one by employers in the United states that rating\nTool for western advanced economy and then along comes truck and it was amazing to me it is it wasn't even just the the new policy is the deregulation of cutting of red tape and eventually the X. cut it was the expectation that no longer would you have the federal government\nPiling Oleg elation of ... American business things like the clean Power Plan and so you see this manufacturing boom start this very moment that Trump won election in November of two thousand sixteen because the economy the business people knew that it was going to be a different day\nAnd I believe that tear point\nAt these policies but in pursuit earlier we have a much larger and more vibrant economy today\nYou know it's funny I'm Talking attractive or who's vice president of the national of national initiative for the Texas Public policy foundation all of that Keynesian economics gee if we just pile a bunch of money out there and we'll prime the pump and get the engine of the economy going again\nDo the folks who push those kinds of policies now see that they didn't work that having all that cheap money out there didn't mean anything if somebody wasn't taking advantage of it and the reason they weren't taking advantage of it\nIs that they had the expectation that they were going to have more regulations and limitations piled on top of them and the minute Trump came into office as you say\nBusiness began to react so there were folks out there in the economy who knew it was the moment he was elected that this was going to be the result and yet all the reporters who covered the race did not seem to know it which kind of suggests to a disconnect on on factual information\nThat apparently the reporters you know we're so focused on the election they didn't go out and said of business if this guy actually gets in what's going to happen instead they heard the scare headlines that\nYou know Wall Street was going to go upside down\nThat the economy was going to go into a giant depression that all these bad things were I Would have happened and they were all\nParents to in these stories while apparently all the business owners knew he gets in ah we're going to be off to the races [noise]\nI think you're correct it isn't just so recorders I mean it's people like Paul Krugman those the New York times who is supposedly an economist he was\nFilled with a forecast of doom and gloom because of President Trump's election and we see the opposite you know I don't think a lot of people are going to come out with a vehicle that myth that they all along they have too much invested\nThis is about a world do you think\nThat the federal government is equipped\nTo tell us how to live our lives to tell business how to operate to layer regulation of regulation written by an elected bureaucrats\nOr do we think that liberty that freedom that unleashing the dynamism that is the American economy and ingenuity do we think that the better way to go and if you think the latter if you think that freedom is really the the answer is and your body to come up with a completely different\nA solution than someone who thinks that centralized control and more regulations telling business what to do and what to do is the answer\nI guess ... the thing that frustrates me as a couple of things number one is not that I Want to go back and re debate the Obama administration but it's it's like one of those situations where somebody comes and says I can help you out which I said well where were you two years ago or ten minutes ago or whatever was why didn't you come to me sooner well we could have had the solution sooner\nAnd I think in particular about those people who are perhaps in their late fifties\nAs we had over seven to no wait where the time when most workers make the greatest paychecks they've ever made their lives from their late fifties out to retirement most people are peeking out their careers and they're making very healthy incomes those people lost a decade\nAnd by the time we came out of it that particular group had no way to recover\nThere was no way to say well now it's almost Seventy I'll go out and get that job back like the one I had a decade ago when the economy went to ... seven and overweight and I'll I'll make up all the ground I missed out on because there isn't the time left in their lives to do it and and they're not going to find anybody interested so those people got cheated and if\nObama with a recovered economy by June of ... said okay we're going to make sure we come out of this thing fast and and do that but but he wasn't willing to do that and neither one of the people around him\nSo not at all but let's look on the positive side of the sinking of the ...\nExperienced a sort of economic boom we saw under President Reagan and frankly even under President Clinton the dot com boom and of course but with a look and controlled Congress but it really kind of held back the expansion of the federal government\nI just hope they don't take it for granted truck divorce is the Texas Public policy foundation Chuck\nThank you very

McNally the executive director of free our Internet ... good to have you back on the program Oh thank you for having me so what does Google think about the possibility of legislation being written that might affect the way they operate\nI I don't ... the um [noise]\nI think they're it's it's\nKind of a to faith thing with them um I think they say one thing when they're up at uh the help\nAnd they kind of and fight a legislation and then we have this new leaked document called the good censor um and it talks about how they want to basically turn the Internet and American into a European a utopia so [laughter] um\nI I think they're talking about of both sides they're males and um I think people like you and I and the other\nPeople who are what free speech need to keep their feet to the fire\nYou know it's interesting that as a search engine uh I I Wonder if people understand the senior groups trying to bring to people's attention and that is that\nBy slightly changing the search results you can create an entirely different reaction by people to all kinds of brings new developments and that sort of thing\nUm there was an example of bit over this past weekend I was looking for some stories that I knew existed from a short while ago a couple of years ago where a man had ah been confronted by a group of and Tea Party pulled a gun to protect himself and then he was prosecuted for doing that\nAnd I know the guy's name or I Know bill from covering the story and I know how to spell than I I put it in and nothing popped up about those stories and I thought I Know there there so I put the name and quote marks and again it didn't pop up because it was an example where a man it actually been prosecuted for engaging in self defense\nI thought I'm Wondering if this is part of their new algorithm where I put it in you know Mike Strickland which is the guy's name and then I put a gun and then I put in charge or convicted I knew he was convicted on he was sentenced to some time in jail\nAnd the stories weren't popping up at all and I thought I wondered how I mean I was using Google is a search engine\nBut if you if you change things just to ... you can make it appear to somebody that certain stories just don't even exist even though these are in mainstream big newspapers and it was covered pretty extensively at the time do you think I'm running into some of Google's new censorship where they're trying to uh to make\nYou know make good as European uh paradise you talked about\nWell and and that's not actually in ... it's not a new thing that they're doing I'm back right after the Parkland incident uh for at least twenty four hours if you put in a word that had\nThe sequence in G. U. N. so like right near where I live there's an stock you know New Hampshire and a gun and roses or any guns ... roses and didn't exist\nAnd put them into a while\nYeah so they like with that sequences gee you and if the word had that sequence in it could not be found uncle so it is not something that is new I think\nThey um are get people like you and I have been talking about it for such a long time now people are starting to notice it and with this document you know that was\nA leak last week people are starting to become aware I'm you know we've been\nBeing told that past two years it's a conspiracy theory there's nothing to this is the algorithm as a computer you know we're not doing this on purpose well clearly\nThis document shows that they\nWant to be quote unquote the good censor for you know we're going to ban them free speech for safety and civility\nOne and how do you increase civility give you the immediate aftermath of something terrible happening\nYou know a plane crashes and so you say I Wonder what the history of plane crashes is associated with that airline you might go in and put in a plane crash and and the name of an airline\nIf they say well we don't want to bother people you know so we're going we're just going to censor those results you don't really need to know about plane crashes or somebody is poisoned with\nYou know strict nine or poison with arsenic and so you put in arsenic poisonings and nothing pops up how does that make them more civil what does even their argument for how that makes them more civil society when you say whatever news people are asking about right now\nDon't tell them they can ask about it in a week\nWell my the bigger question is who are they to decide to self a point\nAnd I guess are straight ahead answer which is a tough one for me to answer is there a private company\n... they're not a government so they can engage in any censorship they want to technically legally\nJust like I couldn't decide to take a phone call from a listener or I can decide I don't want to take the phone call from a listener nobody can force me to do that or forced me to talk about something or not talk about something they could say we're no different than you are Lars and so it's a tough one for me to beat\nExcept by maybe shaming them by saying why are you denying people access the information if you want to be the index to the Internet of all things\nWell I think I think here's where where we might have them because in this document that they actually talk about being a publisher\nUm and um how they get you know right now they may get around you know the whole censorship thing because of um you know some certain legislation that you know they allows them to um\nIf they can act without a you know they they\nThey go on building right go down and you know you know the\nThe ... communications Dietz decency act um but if they want to start considering themselves that publisher um and they can start doing that kind of thing um then we can definitely\nUm start kind of more than putting putting their feet to fire the other argument that I haven't even I have gone over this a couple of times um where they control Ninety\nSix percent of it you know the search engine um Kmart or to you know\nI I I mean I I Love you ours and I know a lot of people listen to you [laughter] you don't have Ninety six percent market share shorter don't control\nI mean they're literally controlling what people see and I mean and if I mean let's let's talk about China saying they are willing to completely put an alternate Internet in China that government can do all\nGovernment government controlled in quotes but they're willing to sell their souls for the almighty dollar to get into China and China as a as a Richard ... they're going to go in there they're going to put on the Internet and they're going to let the government tell them what those people can see and what they can\nSend if they're willing to do it in that context why wouldn't they do it with us and they're and\nThey're willing to do it with us because they they have a view of how it should be anyway you know and and and the crust that my argument as\nThey talk about how bad the United states you know they get up there on their little soap boxes and they say you know the United states is you know massage and a stick and were horrible to minorities and all this stuff and the reason why we have to you know\nDo this is because it's\nBut being sold and they're being bullied and um you know it's just a pool and I'm sitting here thinking okay you're willing to work with the Chinese are very\nWell and and the thing about this how even work it\nOut or Christian leaders right now is executive director for your Internet I think about this ... I look things up because I was taught by my dad always look things up imagine five six years from now I'm writing an essay about women who've told lies about alleged sexual misdeeds and I think\nI was the name of that Ford lady what was your full name where was she a college professor because maybe I've blissfully forgotten about you know about to proceed lazy a crispy forward and and so I Want to go look her up but they've decided that well that will just be one of those examples used by massage in is to try to disparage the idea\nThe person who actually write to the rule maybe six or eight levels below that person and when that person makes a changing the rules on\nI don't know how section eight housing is regulated and you know in theory this the cabinet secretary above and the president above the cabinet secretary responsible for it but it was actually written by a civil service lifer who can't be fired am I wrong\nYeah oh you are not wrong at all [noise] um the amazing fact is that\nIn the last twenty five years in\nEvery year the federal government's administrative agencies and regulatory agencies have put out three\nThousand rules wild and that's over a hundred thousand rules over the last twenty five years now that haven't hasn't been that much legislation that would require all these rules so what we have is these agencies using legislation\nThat was made years ago\nTo write new rules now\nAnd the question is have ... they really empowered by Congress many years ago to be writing the rules if they're writing today and that's one of the things that I think the the court system the judiciary has to look into and stop\nWell let me let me try one example on you\nKnow there was a law or there was a an a a rule called title nine and as I remember the the essential purpose of it was we got all these schools public schools and colleges that have sports programs that are mostly aimed at benefiting young men uh football basketball baseball golf or whatever\nAnd that you know young ladies were not getting the opportunities you write a rule and in general people said that it's probably fair if you're gonna have a football team you should probably have the equivalent so that a young ladies can get some opportunities as well not a bad thought but ... not bad in practice until you find out a couple of decades later\nBy the way it's going to regulate which bathrooms are used by transgender individuals in communities and you don't have anything to say about it because Obama cramps a letter of guidance or his department of education does and all of a sudden you're you're ... your your daughter comes home and says hey\nThere is a boy who is using the lady the girls restroom now school well how'd that happen but it's something to do with title nine\nWhile I thought that was about sports no it's been used to rewrite the bathroom rules is that a good example where\nFor they've taken a friday and misused it\nSet is an excellent example and something even more pervasive in the bathroom rule that is part of that and although you're entirely correct that what\nWhat Congress authorized was for any school that accept federal money it has to make have a educational resources available\nWithout a corrections without any connection to sex that is women\nShould have the same educational resources is Matt what has happened to that now is that is that legislation has been turned into a question of sexual harassment at ... although it was\nIt was directed at schools schools are the ones who that we're supposed to comply all of a sudden as a result of that language\nThey uh education department has created a whole system\nFor sexual harassment of student\nTo student um and so not only what sexual harassment is but then what the punishment should be and how the person who was accused of sexual harassment should be tried none of that would ever have been considered by Congress back windows\nThat statute was passed in Nineteen Seventy two\nWell how 'bout that that's the kind of problem we're facing ... okay\nAbout a minute but Peter let me throw an idea that you saw all these I don't expect when they write the

don't want to I don't want them I don't want Congress writing and duck season starts on you know August fifteenth and ends on\nAll that administrative detail does need to be dealt with somewhere but if you said at some point within a year or two all those rules have to come back pass Congress and Congress has to say yeah that's right that's what we intended for you to do they can write the details but then Congress has to say yes and when we knew because we'd be alerted\nThis is coming before the Congress those crazy rules that they wrote on section eight or ADA or or or or sex or title nine it's coming back up ... vote if they don't vote to approve of the rules simply goes away\nDo you think that kind of thing in ten seconds would actually make a train\nIt wasn't that could change

I mean it's only one poll but it's a solid one\nThe Democrats have a generic lead of almost ten in that poll but on the sixty six swing districts twenty four which went for Hillary Clinton twenty sixteen the Republicans are hit\nBy one point the Republican no other polls don't quite show that but they show the\nSwing districts are much closer because Democrats are going to waste a lot of their enthusiastic votes in districts they were going to win anyway so I think\nAnd CBS back the CBS background poll also believes that if the election were held with normal turnout today they will be a two hundred and Eighteen two hundred and Seventeen split not clear which party would have a majority I think we're getting to a much closer house\nUm result than people anticipate because the battleground districts are not the countries\nThat if you have institutional memory because you wrote for the title wave for the blue in two thousand and six and you also saw what\nA block Obama as a candidate he did in two thousand and eight how do you read how do you interpret this way it's one poll I understand that it's a moving story but how do you interpret this\nThis unusual sac said the battleground districts are Republicans do well in\nSome ways much better now than it was back in those six and always has Mr ... can tell you that made it exceedingly difficult for the Republican majority in two thousand six and for Republicans in general in two thousand eight because we've already lost the majority in\nIn the prior election my question for Mr fund is you're talking about the house one about the Senate [noise]\nOne of the Senate is very interesting because there's poll movement in places you didn't expect\nA there's a new poll out a conducted by a democratic for the chose the Minnesota special election for the Senate can be competitive in clear single digits New Jersey there's a very hard hitting ad out attacking senator Menendez the Democratic incumbent for\nSex with teenage prostitutes quoting FBI reports from the Obama Justice department um I think that the Democrats are now defending more seats than they expected and if I had if the election were held today I think Republicans would gain Senate seats\nAnd game of clear advantage and can hurry more judges including a possible mothers Supreme Court appointment next year\nTo fund the Democrats were doing very well talking about health care health care health care I saw that on ads for the last two weeks and yet these other issues have come up a it's a puzzle to me\nIs is a lack of discipline or is this because in two thousand and six the Democrats in the house had the leadership of Nancy Pelosi and as far as I can tell she's completely disappeared I Can't find her [noise]\nRemember about forty democratic challengers have said they're not going to vote for Nancy Pelosi should they get elected\nSo the last thing that she wants to do is remind voters that um she's there it is trying to become the next democratic speaker even though many members of her party clearly recognize uses liability on the campaign trail\nSaturdays they may realize as you well know John that when they get there and they started getting shall we say acclimated to their ... as soon as books can change can't they\nWant if you have only two hundred and twenty Democrats or two hundred and Nineteen or two hundred and Twenty one you know than it is it has been since Nineteen fifty two that we had the congressional majority that was less than five seats\nAre from two hundred and Eighteen we've never before in our living memory had an extremely close house where every member counts because the speaker has to be elected with two hundred and Eighteen the majority of the entire house\nI watch clips from CBS the sixty minutes interview between the president and the correspondent but I was struck by one thing John and I'm puzzled whether this is too late or too little\nThe president is acting very presidential these days he's quite quite clear about his accomplishments he's expansive about the policies that they've initiated there's nothing hesitant about 'em at all is that is that showing in the polls job [noise] well actually\nLeslie stall who conducted the interview said I've interviewed the president three times as candidate as president elect and I was president the the change in his level of self confidence and assertiveness is dramatic ah she says he's he seems to have grown into the job and he was a country may not be comfortable with him and the job but he's comfortable and and\nI didn't see a president shooting from the hip I saw a man who who was prepared for the issues you know how he makes a little pyramid out of his fingers you and he's confident that the man I saw in that in that interview\nHe's on this message discipline I think through the election if it stays that will only help his party that is\nJust got a counselor Mr phone does the greatest thing I heard tonight the country may not be comfortable with him as comfortable in the job [laughter]\nWhat what do you do you think that this will translate in the next couple of weeks the the messaging the tight messaging and the president and more parents whose because he's not going to stop campaigning for the rest of the Republicans [noise]\nNo but I think that the Democrats submitted enough mistakes he's just going to remind voters over and over again that even though they may\nBut the other guys and by the way given you know Elizabeth Warren and given Hillary Clinton and given ...

minimize the sanctions in panic they continue to fund terrorism and there's signs that the the flow of oil seems to be according to new data from September that the oil industry is still quite robust and and it means that they're using\nA subterfuge and and other means like the example of India um\nWent to uh to bypass or to cover\nTheir uh their exports so sanctions banning transactions with Iran central bank the shipping comes to oil companies are all scheduled to take effect on November fifth so it could be that they're trying to rush to these things these as much as they can export\nNow but it is certainly indicative of the weakness of the Iranian economy we know the teachers went on strike today we know that the price of milk has has gone up sharply and other goods that cannot tomato paste\nSold for sixty thousand ... in March is now a hundred and eighty thousand ...\nAnd the ... the currency as a has fallen so dramatically I think it's a hundred and forty six thousand to the dollar now\nAnd the projection is that the Iranian economy will shrink by one point five percent or this year and maybe almost four percent and twenty Nineteen so Iran is under a lot of pressure that the sanctions were worked a new sanctions could be very significant and the U.S has to find ways to close these loopholes\nFatty milk and listen you guys are recent reports show the Gazans believe that the ... the bigger problem from us\nIt's exactly right and I think Palestinians overall a blamed the PA by a bigger percentage than than a blame the um\nAh the Hamas for for what is happening in it and and it's reflected his lack of confidence and it shows that in the election or change is not going to bring about any uh any dramatic ah\nWe're seeing the um uh the ... the numbers that that came out that the more than ... almost fifty percent almost half\nA do not trust the pay they don't trust come on that's a fairly but they certainly don't trust the Palestinian authority\nAnd this is a you know a very significant figure when you're looking at what are the prospects for a changing things in in the I'm\nA ... and the guy and gossip for instance because it forty three percent of Palestinian say the ... responsible for the bad situation and only a quarter blamed or how much\nAnd that that's why they don't want to demonstrate against from us because they don't like the alternative and they don't want the ... to take over and and especially the like its measures against its own citizens the fact that was another study that's coming out that shows a tremendous number of arrests by the\nPalestinian Authority figures against those who oppose it in the west bank so they they seem to accept Hamas control of Gaza\nAnd Europe out I'm I have learned because you've talked me\nThe Europeans have a profoundly different understanding of anti Semitism than we do here in the United states I don't know where it started but I Do know it's here to stay\nAnd Israel has always struggled against that anti Semitic tone and all of the major France Germany Great Britain\nOr Italy we struggled with it by you indicate there is there a change is there and in light ... are they pulling back from their exploitation of the the the tragedy of the twentieth century [noise]\nUh it's it's a good question but I I think it goes too far to think that the that they pulled back what we're seeing according to this latest survey that the Israeli foreign minister\nDid in in major European countries show a clear rise in support and this is the first time in memory for me that um there's been a turnaround\nIn in Germany in Spain and Portugal in Romania where more maybe the support for Israel grew to fifty six percent in Portugal or it went to the forty eight percent and and uh versus thirty percent were not supportive\nIn Spain it was forty percent in Britain it went up the eight points to forty percent\nAnd it's you know in the urban area or a rat and everything else and with all the negative media and and measures that were adopted into campaigns\nIn Europe against Israel to see this turnaround I think it's really remarkable and it will tell you some it is not something I Would have anticipated\nOr the fact that in all these major ... countries in Europe or sympathy for Israel is increasing maybe it's a greater understanding of the um of Israel's unique position maybe it's because today the middle east includes or did they see what's going on in Syria they see what's going on in these other countries that have come\nTo realize that you have one source of stability and um you will have to see whether this is borne out over time but it's certainly a a surprising about\nWe have a minute Thaddeus go ahead yes but let's remember that the people here are different than the elite that were deemed to govern correct\nThat is true in the countries like Britain and France which starts top down France tendency is to be bottom up but I think you're quite right that that that is a distinction and and still the numbers are not as positive as they should be\nAnd we see the campaigns continuing but this split the left side split that is exacerbating things may are also tend to benefit the understanding of Israel [noise]\nJeremy Corbyn not withstanding correct about that would be a tragedy\nVery much a tragedy and and the very fact that that he continues in the in the current path in Britain is very disturbing may be part of this is a reaction to that\nYes our cousins in London you're aware of the fact that Jeremy carbon as prime minister

about the rights so\nPeter why did Edmund Burke the uh the parliamentary in addressing parliament don't do this to the American revolution and don't mistake the American revolution for the French Revolution what did he make up these claims have rights in the French Revolution and elsewhere Peter\nUh he was appalled by their claims that price but the fight needs to be emphasized not because he

disservice radios as\nWith his lawyers are so\nPeers Lars Larson\nFrom back to Lars Larson showing welcome to Tuesday on honestly provocative talk radio for the United states of America let's start with a Twitter bull and you can find data Lars Larson dot com our Web site you can also find it on Twitter at Lars Larson show we ask a brand new question based on the news of the day\nWe talked a lot about Elizabeth Warren yesterday I really didn't want to make focus on just the the focus if you will of the ... tonight so how about this\nShould Donald Trump cut funding to Honduras if they won't take their people back you know we get foreign aid do a lot of countries in sometimes it has some usefulness\nBut here's the bottom line the president this morning\nHad threatened to cut off aid to Honduras if it's government does not stopping migrant caravan that is headed north toward the U.S border United States\nHas strongly informed the president of Honduras that at the large caravan of people headed to the U.S is nonstop and brought back to Honduras no more money or aid will be given to Honduras effective immediately that's what the president tweeted out this morning\nThe president was responding to reports that originally a group of a thousand people were on their way toward our border now it's sixteen hundred people hoping to reach the United states and cross into this country\nNow if they do it legally that's fine but you know in this case they're not going to do it legally\nThey're hoping to come across that border the U.S gave a hundred and Seventy five million dollars in aid to Honduras in the last fiscal year according to the United states agency for international development we finally have a president who will play hardball on this don't keep sending your people\nIn this way it is not good for the United states but I'll tell you what is not good for Hondurans either think about the kind of dangers that you face\nAs Honduras sends people north Mexico has apparently been acquiesce thing because Mexico has a very tightly guarded southern border with Central America\nAnd they could say we're not going to let people across we should probably be sending a message to the Mexican government as well stop letting people through your southern border so they can come up and illegally cross our northern border so tonight's ... goes this way\nShould Trump cut funding to Honduras if they won't take their people back by answer that would be absolutely yes\nThey should not be able to do this Mexico should not be aiding at Honduras should not be encouraging at and the United states government is finally led by somebody willing to lay down the law by the way in yesterday's shorter pull after this\nHolding on to at least lower sixties rise into

and we have of course the last couple of days been talking about the brutal murder of Saudi born legal permanent resident of this country ... ... and I wanted to talk to Frank gap thing about that he's the founder and president of the ... Center for security policy did you know ... Frank at all\nI did not was on ... but a lot of personal acquainted with them now\nWhat do you think we're being told that he was in that embassy in Turkey for uh some interrogation ie apparently walked in to try to get a birth certificate of some kind that was going to allow him are no divorce certificate that would allow him to get married to his fiance\nAnd he goes in his fiance standing outside he simply does not come back out at the time the embassy a closed up and he was apparently a interrogated and they say an interrogation gone wrong what little we been able to find out about what happened\nIs it pretty clear here that the Saudi Government or people who acted on behalf of the Saudi Government murdered this man\n[noise] it seems as though that's the case of course and the and the consulate it would've been people who were supposed to be there um\nPresumably representatives of the Saudi Government there were some Fifteen a man of many of them with special forces background who for or flown in I think\nEarlier that day or the day before and left immediately after this incident but it is a lot of circumstantial evidence that suggests that the government of Saudi Arabia was involved I I kind of think of this from what we know so far Lars this kind of a\nA mafia war\nBecause on the one hand you had the\nSaudi Government a predominantly now guided\nBy the crown prince Mohammed bin saw law and order and the U.S a man who is clearly a consolidating power and trying to take his country and about different ways uh uh in a new direction yeah\nOn the other hand you had a guy who was very\nClosely associated with it seems to have worked for the former head of Saudi intelligence turkey I'll flies\nAll of a man with the Muslim Brotherhood background or who had worked in kind of media relations a space for a turkey ... and the intelligence services and Saudi Arabia under the previous government or the one that\nI'm ... and the father of essentially replaced and what we know about that\n... evidently a this Muslim brother a democracy hoagie was a working it\nAppears with circular file against his own government and so it wasn't just that he was saying nasty things about it and that can be a capital offense by the way they're Islam years insulting the keepers of the holy places uh the the family of Saudi Arabia oil satellite but\nHe was also threatening it seems uh the the uh the government is now predominantly and B. S. as they call it so it was a it was a\nFairly well that was designed to such or whether it just went bad wait until now at the moment but I think it was kind of like a you know what ... ... and took out the other end of ended it in a ruthless Sasha\nMy because Frank I think the American people and I I think you know there's been a night or being sold a bill of goods we're being told welders innocent journalist who's just writing things that are critical of the government which journalist in this country do all the time whether it's Obama\nOr Trump they write critical things about the government I said critical things about the government but this guy was a player in the Muslim Brotherhood he was a friend of Osama bin Laden\nAnd you said that he shared that organizations goal of trying to supplant the current government which is you say the current government of Saudi Arabia is trying to take\nThat country in a western direction and uh and and this guy was trying to stop that so you know wild that while that may not justify his murder um\nI I could certainly see that if the American public's being told was just a journalist who was murdered and that's wrong they're not being told he was a political player who may have been trying to is it fair to say overthrow the current Saudi Government and take it back and in Islam is direction\n[noise] oil or certainly reason to believe that that's the aspirations of the Muslim Brotherhood you know they they didn't to\nOverthrow of the government of President Mubarak in Egypt Today they were able to achieve that through a democratic process but they certainly were I'm\nTaking in Egypt in ... premises direction now the government of Saudi Arabia Sharif supremacists too but it's it's a it's a\nGroup under the Brotherhood that would be very hostile to us as was the Morsi regime in a post Mubarak Egypt and I think\nWhat the president of the government is is trying to wrestle with his first of all we don't know as much as we'd like and second of all we don't want to\nBring or otherwise contribute to a they remove all of the relatively friendly not\nAltogether but relatively French government under most of it that solve odd was one that would be dead set against us and our vital interests and a strategic place like Saudi Arabia the Iranians would like that or the other enemies of this country would applaud but I think that's not in our interest in the president's walking a fine line I think yeah and it's a\nTough one let's talk about something else the statutory commission to assess the threat to the United states from electromagnetic pulse big name we've talked about EMP before on this program it could come from an an attack\nFrom any number of sources it could come from a natural solar flare\nBut it would literally knock out some or all of every single computer chip in America which runs everything refrigeration water power sewer you know the the whole thing in in many many people would die if that happened in even up an area of this country the Congress has passed\nFinally hearing some specific things that can be done to safeguard against this threat\n[noise] well\nThey've been hearing it for years a large the first of these commissions supported in two thousand four and a has done so several times since I'm a whole bunch\nOf reports were finished about a year ago they haven't seen a public life some of them are classified but some of them are supposed to be unclassified and they got from that sort of sitting on them meanwhile the commission that\nWas extraordinarily informed knowledgeable talented and uh I think authoritative on these matters has been replaced\nBy a politically appointed one that I fear is going to be none of those things and so we may not actually get the kind of\nA clarity about the danger that will say single let alone the tide of corrective action that's needed\nUm at least at this uh this new commission that's coming on stream of presumably shortly is a is involved and and this is heartbreaking because I think the president wants to do something about this I Believe John Bolton as bus or\nA national security advisor is very consistent committed to trying to\n... so the executive order that sort of a kicking around inside the uh the executive branch at the moment to protect our grid it's absolutely vital and you say a lot of the 'cause like die by some estimates according to the previous ... that might be Ninety percent of us yeah\nThe vehicle ... yeah I mean if we had a ... kind of attacks and you know North Korea that maybe a smaller a threat at this point but if anybody a terrorist group gets the west coast\nWith any MP and knocked out all water all power all sewer all all all supply all ability\nTo move goods around or anything like that we could we could end up with a lot of communication dealt all of that even if the rest of the country we're capable of throwing in to help we see how even small disasters or will

this story about France refusing to honor and honest to God hero because it might offend the Muslims\nAt one point this is from gateway pond at one point a local policemen sacrificed themselves so that a hostage could live be French hero is named are no bell train he was stabbed to death by an Islamist jihadi\nBut they will not honor the hero with the street named after him because the French government has said it might upset local Muslims\nYou might remember twenty four the march this year an ISIS terrorists stormed a supermarket\nArmed with a handgun a hunting knife and three homemade bombs and shot two people dead took others hostage\nDuring negotiations with police the terrorists to excepted police officer build trains offer to swap places with the last hostage\nWho is a female cashier build train also set his phone on a table with the line already open very clever so the police outside can monitor what was going on inside after a three hour standoff with the police\nThe terrorist rod do on like being a twenty five year old ... stabbed and murdered the police officer or no bell train but we're being told that you can't honor him\nHe can't name a street after him because that will upset the Muslims [noise]\nIf you were a follower of Islam I have no problem with you practicing your religion if you're a follower a follower of Islam too it'd be troubled by honoring a police officer who sacrificed his own life to save that of a hostage\nThen you're not my kind of Muslim that'll let's go to Jonathan and Kentucky hey Jonathan welcome to the Lars Larson
