golden years are just that\nGolden seven zero three two one five to five to seven seven zero three two one five to two by two\nWhite on retiring we\nCome back and write on retirement with Kelly Campbell ... former here with Kelly of course he has been a trusted leader and the financial services guild\nFor over twenty seven years now helping others get right on retirement they were just waiting through this new tax law that we've all been experiencing this year and when it could mean for tax payers like like you and me\nThat a big change that is impacting people financially Kelly\n... question the biggest one that are really starting to fact a lot of people is the idea of itemized deductions and the standard deduction so if you are itemize deductions\nThat means you have to fill a schedule way and so they ah what they did was they took your standard deduction which used to be sixty three fifty for an individual and twelve thousand seven hundred for a married filing jointly and they raised it they pretty much doubled it\nSo it's both thousand for individuals twenty\nFour thousand of married couples for two thousand Eighteenth and what that means a lot less people are going to be itemized deductions and a lot more people are going to use the standard deduction so that's a that's a significant impact on all of your taxes and even some of the things we'll talk about soon will go into more detail about those things so so you'll see those uh but even like the child tax credit went from a\nThousand to two thousand yeah um but they also did away with personal exemptions the\nFour thousand one hundred fifty dollar personal ... that's gone now I'm so again it makes up for for different things different ways\nBut another one that I've heard people not like so much as a state tax deduction right now this is the biggie because what we're what they're saying is that\nYou are you are limited now ended deductions for state and local income and property taxes the deduction you can use is kept out at ten thousand dollars that's a big number is she for Virginia residents where you have personal property tax\nAnd and real estate tax income tax\nYou know ... it's going to be interesting to see how the how all this plays out here in the upcoming taxis and you know like that a lot of people will be going realizing you know what all this means do or any other changes on the ... side that you think are worth mentioning\nOh yeah definitely so uh some of the itemized deductions we're limited and when it hits home to a lot of folks who may be the ability and really hits home for me too because it's part of my business is the ability to duck tax prep fees\nAnd investment advisory fees they go away in two thousand Eighteen or you can still do it for Seventeen but not Eighteen so also medical expenses people can now claim a deduction\nFor qualified medical expenses above seven and a half percent of their just gross before it was only ... anything above ten percent of adjusted gross I actually got a little better which is a good thing uh but remember that doesn't come into play\nUnless you're itemize and\nSo even mortgage interest home mortgage interest there's some new limits on what you can do and how much you can deduct and even on the home equity line home equity loans so we'll talk about those shortly but the one thing to remember\nIt's on what you can do and how much you can deduct and even on the home equity line home equity loans so we'll talk about those shortly but the one thing to remember is that there are a lot of moving parts with all the tax rules with retirement planning in general\nWith investment management when you're trying to get income for retirement\nAnd a lot of that can seem almost daunting\nAnd so one of the best things to do is meet with professionals were offering me the opportunity to today so just call or text the word plan to seven oh three two one five two to five too and we will put together your own right on retirement financial tree ... we're going to look at everything you're doing we are going to put a plan together to give you confidence to\nMake sure you're doing all the right things so coast today it's seven oh three two one five two to five to\nYou're listening to write I'm retired met with Kelly Campbell Kelly is president and CEO of Campbell wealth management and he's been featured in US News on Fox does this ad on CNBC and he's the author of the ... fire your broker again he has twenty seven years of experience helping people get right\nOn retirement check him out on their website Campbell ... dot com the S. and P. B. E. L. L. O. L. dot com\nShot to all these changes\nWell it just depends on whether you're an individual or whether you're married filing jointly it depends on your situation from an income standpoint but the one thing you can expect to happen is you'll see a sharp drop in the number of people who were itemized deductions in other words the people that are\nFilling out that schedule a like a talked about earlier and I saw one estimate projected where it said that it used to be about thirty percent of Americans are itemize\nInc that's going to go down to anywhere from ten to Fifteen Percent and that means something so again it depends on where you are and what you're doing your situation but when it comes down to as your own individual circumstances how many dependent children do you have what's your household income\nOr whether you're in a high tax or low tax state all those types of things the elimination or reduction of many there's high value itemized deductions is it's going to hurt some people without a doubt a and having a standard action or even a higher child tax credit is going to help other people so it it really depends but it's all a matter of doing the math to\nFigure it out to see where you are with the new rules\nIf nothing else I imagine that new calculations surrounding itemized deductions standard actions all that is going to keep accountants busy trying to figure out strategies to help minimize the tax burden for people right\nWell that's definitely true one new strategy here attack saving people talk about is lumping deductions\nSo think about those people who who used to itemize all the time but under the new law they're going to struggle to have enough to ... they make kind of look at things a little bit differently so going forward they could choose instead of taking you know there are let's say their charitable deductions each year or their their medical procedures each year\nThey may start to lump them into one year instead of spreading them out in multiple years that way for that one year they will hit the the um they'll go above that standard deduction and be able to itemize or they'll have a reason to itemize right\nThat's approach that might allow them you know again not to itemize every year but every few years but it's amazing what kind of hoops people would jump\nOut the taxes ha ha you know but you know I mean we live in a in a country where we have a complex tax code and it certainly keeps accountants and people like me you know trying to help us navigate through this you know this retirement process and income in taxes doing when it came out of trouble so it's going to keep us dance and it was as well\nHave another question and that lifts our question for you everybody was very interested in the tax code in and wrote in about this um this person has for years I've been doing my own taxes without any problems that this new tax\nLaw has me a little ... do you think it would be wise for ... like me to seek it by some and accountants such as a CPA at least for this up Kevin tax here\nThat's a great question and I don't necessarily think it it you know something you should definitely do some people are fairly confident about it if you don't feel confident or don't hesitate to\nTo do several things one is yes you could absolutely the CPA too is you could just do some searching 'cause what's interesting on Google you find out that everybody's got the same question you have so if you Google the question you have on your taxes while you're trying to\nFigure it out yourself you know say you're in the tax offer\nYou're trying to figure it out good and Google it and er and nine times out of ten you're going to be able to find that um and even just tried joined the tax return to yourself\nI'm On a you know the tax offers I think you'll find it fairly easy um I don't think it's that that significantly different\nNow from a pure planning standpoint yeah you may want to talk to someone but it's not always the CPA sometimes it's the financial advisor\nLike we're helping our class decide whether they should be rough conversions and things like that because it might make total sense in some of our financial planning software actually has a the actual tax suffer with it and it helps us make ... says help our clients make good decisions so again that's why we offer this\nRight over time or financial tree out so if you're one of the first ten colors and you put together five hundred thousand dollars or more of a festival assets for your retirement and then you have questions just call or text the word plan to seven\nTen colors and you put together five hundred thousand dollars or more of a vegetable assets for your retirement and then you have two questions just call or text the word plan to seven oh three she won five two to five to\nAgain call or text that were planned to seven oh three two one five two to five job and will actually put together your own right ... financial ...\nIf you own a home if you claim medical expenses on your tax returns or if you're saving for family members college education chances are the new tax bill is going to impact your wallet well that in fact the positive or negative\nDon't have a lot of income so when you have especially in this area you have married filing jointly couple they're going to have a lot of income typically and that raises the phase out level for that tax credit to four\nHundred thousand of adjusted gross income levels for couples filing jointly it used to be a hundred and ten thousand so literally that went from one ten to four hundred thousand dollars that's a major difference and it offers a five hundred dollar tax credit for dependents\nWho aren't even your children not huge but again something that adds to the planning\nClear reference children and grandchildren I'm kind of surprised\nYeah I did and the reference is to people who are using college savings accounts just have towards it as a child or a grandchild college education the new tax law expands funds in those so called five twenty nine plans and how they can be used\nIn addition to covering those college expenses beginning in two thousand Eighteen money from those plants can be used to pay up to ten thousand dollars of tuition expenses per year per student for private religious schools from elementary to high school so I figure out of five twenty guys\nAren't just for higher education anymore\nIt's a pretty big deal if you're sending your kid to to private school ... sample right or again to a religious school and there was a high cost of that you can actually use a five twenty nine plan now for that and it may make a lot of sense\nThat's great to now I'm not a grandparent at bat when that day care and the kids want their kids to get a private school that'd be nice to be able to help out you know Kelly everything that we've been talking about today with the new tax code to um you know makes me think that uh we should explain to our listeners how\nYou incorporate these changes in your planning strategies with your clients because our listeners are going to call in and go in and meet with you if you could tell them how you see these benefits\nYeah that you know that's a that's a vast fairly often you know when people say hey how do I do tax planning how do I make sure that\nThat uh maximizing where I Am from a pure tax standpoint you know the way we do is we bring it into our actual financial planning software and it was so we when we do a plan and we put together a plan or even a financial tree ours for clients were looking at everything they're doing from their income to their investments to their needs for for cash\nTo even what types of accounts they have as I said before whether it be cashed your taxable or tax deferred\nOr tax free accounts and then we start to build an income plan on where they're going to get their monies from believe it or not when you start to to tweak that and make or let's say maximize efficiency of where you take your money from in retirement you start just see some pretty significant benefits and and the success rates of retirement significantly increase\nWhen you take your money from the right place sadly a lot of people take it from the wrong place but we we can make it more efficient\nIt makes a lot of sense has kind of like taking Social Security if we take it at the right time it can mean a lot more to us and have a lot more money long term than if we take it from the wrong place\nSo that's the same thing with tax planning so that's why comes into our planning process that's also why we offer\nThat a writer retirement financial tree eyes to anyone that any one of our first caller is causing today so again if you do want to take advantage of you want to see how taxes impact your planning I advise you to give us a call or text the word plan to seven oh three two one five two to five to again it's seven oh three two one\nFive two to five to just call or text word play into that number and we'll get just set up so you get your own right on retirement financial tree August which would be a deep dive look into your financial situation assessing everything you're doing maybe doing correctly maybe doing incorrectly\nBut will help you figure out the mistakes are making if you're making any uh and how to correct those\nSo and that will give you confidence in your retirement so we can call us or text the word plan to seven oh three two one five two to five to\nThere's a lot hidden in the new tax bill that couldn't pass your finances and your retirement what can dig into more of the nitty gritty details and what they actually mean for you coming up next you're listening to write I'm retirement with Kelly Campbell of Campbell wealth management stick around we'll be right back with the rest of our show [noise]\nYou're listening devices on retiring we can [noise]\n\nYou often hear retirement called the golden years\nBut it is when it comes to your health it's clear you consult your doctor board vice so why not consult for professional when it comes to money just like your doctor's advice you get from a financial advisor can have a direct impact on your quality of life are you paying too much in these with your current financial professional\nWhat could happen to your nest egg if there's a market correction you aren't sure about the answer to these questions\nIn too much in these with your current financial professional what could happen to your nest egg if there's a market correction you aren't sure about the answer to these questions they may be time for a second opinion selling Campbell is an independent advisor doesn't have a boss on Wall street Kelly and his team at Campbell wealth management\nActualize in designing retirement strategies that can allow you to spend more time enjoy life and less time being concerned about your finances maybe it's time for a second opinion\nSeven zero three two one five two to five to Kelly Campbell wealth management can help make sure your building years are just that\nGolden seven zero three two one five two to five to seven seven zero three two one five to two by two\nWhite on retiring Kelly [noise] they're\nComing back family land former here with Kelly Campbell and you're listening to ride on retirement for over twenty seven years now Kelly and his team at Campbell wealth management had been working with people just like you\nKnow creating financial strategy to get them to and through retirement successful they and they want to help you enjoy your ideal retirement whatever it is your ... to ... to help you have confidence in your retirement and build true well All right today we have been trying to go through the one thousand\nPages of the extremely dry tax bill that passed\nThat the first of the year Kelly you'll have been doing a great job of it one other\nAspects I've just new tax law should people be paying attention to well\nThere are also some important changes for those of you who are business owners among the biggest winners from this new law or corporations as we said before they'll see their top tax rate go from thirty five percent\nDown to Twenty one percent oh wow that's awesome that is a big change and so and that just means more in their pockets that means more\nUh to pay employees more things they can do for for research and development all those kind of thing but you know there are other businesses that should be winners as well that's because a provision that allows these so called passed\nThrough businesses like A L L sees and partnerships and ask corpses sole proprietors they give them the ability to duck twenty percent of their qualified business income so essentially\nThere'll be paying taxes on on the eighty percent of the revenue that's big news for business owners especially if they uh you know they fit that profile\nThe benefit of the dust has phased out for specific pass\nThrough service businesses with taxable income\nThat's exceeding our hundred and fifty thousand a and three hundred Fifteen thousand for married filing jointly but again it's still\nIt may apply to you so you really have to check with your guest which attacks that supposed to be the best bad but this presents a really interesting new twist for people who are still working group plan to work on retirement as against sole proprietors or these pass through entities that we talked about\nKelly what's another new tax provision that you think we should be aware of\nBut this one impacts the charitable minded and it's a good news bad news proposition the good news is that the new tax bill expands does adoptable amount for charitable contributions from fifty percent up to sixty percent of adjusted gross\nRight so that makes sense so far so that's a good thing but not so good news is that she's still need to itemize to take advantage of it and itemize is becoming harder and harder for people to justify\nBecause a new standard deduction so as a result to that increases than has actually risen retirees may benefit from making more charitable donations but less frequently and what I what I'm Talking about there is just\nRemember that stacking we talked about earlier ... baking stack their deductions stack their contributions within\nOne year and and um I think you're going to see this a lot I think you're going to see charities have really good years and really bad years now or or some people aren't going to they're not even thinking about stack and there's not going to donate anymore right into Dr ... the sad thing and that's where like I said some charities could\nYou know could lose the benefit of that route but but again there are other things as well and so just to kinda\nFits to let you know as well and I know our listeners that we have questions about this because I I get this question fairly often\nWhat about IRAs what do you do about IRAs minimum choir distributions and charitable deductions so low in an interesting thing about this and this is kind of a a little twist a lot of people don't understand and Everytime I bringing up people are especially older folks that are in their seventies there they always kind of\nYou know get all sparkle in their eyes and here it is if\nYou contribute money to charities on a regular basis what you can do instead of doing that because now you're not going to be able to to do it unless you itemize deductions won't be able to deduct it you can actually do an eight year required minimum distribution remember that money you have to take out a Seventy now yes you can you can donate that directly to a charity\nAnd you you actually becomes a straight deduction and you don't have to itemize so in other words\nSay give it this way if I'm you know like you had mentioned before you or\nYou give money to you know goodwill or things like that and you get your little receipt yeah well instead of doing that you could say you know what I'm going to donate instead of donating you know that the money I'd give it to the church and then the money I give it to this charity naturally you can bring 'em altogether and instead of doing it too straight through your IRA\nNow again is better for people that have minimum choir distributions and you're not quite old enough for that uh\nBring them all together and instead of doing it to a straight through your IRA now again is better for people that haven't been in choir distributions and you're not quite old enough for that a blue and I know that\n[laughter] no but I don't either [laughter]\nBut you can so if you're Seventy and a half you can actually take that that courtroom distributions Senate directly to the charity that let's say you were going to donate throughout the year five thousand dollars a different charities now let's say you can take part of your requirement of distribution just do it that way because now you will get that deduction without having to itemize and that's what's going to help people a lot so", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Washington's Drive at Five", "city":
