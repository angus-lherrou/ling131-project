A. L. and\nLike Kelly gamble Kelly is the Ellen hesitant Campbell well managed based here in Alexandria I'm Lou and\nFormer Kelly it's great to be here with you again tell us let's sit on the minds of their retirees and their pay retirees that event like this past week\nWell the way it is great to be here as well um so we actually had a few less meetings over the last couple of weeks because we actually moved to our office big\nThat's never easy\nYeah far away when the only a few minutes away from the old office but a much nicer setting and the beauty of it is that the company's growing and we kind of ran out of space or at least was up and so we said you know what we want to be in a in a great area uh with bigger space and nicer space so um yeah so it'd be better for not only four\nHours or team but then also for our clients to come to\nYou want to get your new location on the air\nWe're at three thirty John Carlisle streets\nAnd that is sweet six hundred still in Alexandria forget Virginia so again it's a three thirty John Carlisle street and sweet six hundred you know it's interesting though so it it kind of reminded me when we were doing the office move you know we were in our old office for about eight years\nAnd I was just thinking about this we had all these different things that we had to move in you know kind of put together and get a look through some different things to say why do we still have that you know and and and I can just imagine what some of our clients are going through it I've had a lot of conversations with them\nYou know let's say when they're moving from here to what's going to be their retirement home\nOr they're downsizing or in some cases we've had clients that up size but you know they've been in in houses for twenty thirty even I had one one client that moved recently it was in his house for over forty years\nAnd I can just imagine what that's like trying to get all those things together all those memories but then all the things that you're going to throw away deciding what to throw away and you know what to do with things so uh\nIt's like trying to get all those things together all those memories but then all the things that you're going to throw away and deciding what to throw away and you know what to do a thing so uh so our heart goes out to our clients that they do make that move because it's difficult but it's often for the better that they do it\nExactly men are never easy but boy does it feel good to get rid of things [laughter] hasn't it early died out a doubt without a doubt well today we're going to talk\nYou often hear retirement called the golden years\nWhen it comes to your health is clear you consult your doctor board vice so why not consult for professional when it comes to money just like your doctor's advice you get from a\nFinancial advisor can have a direct impact on your quality of life are you paying too much in peace with your current financial professional\nWhat could happen to your nest egg if there's a market correction you aren't sure about the answer to these questions they may be time\nFor a second opinion Kelly gamble as an independent advisor doesn't have a bomb on Wall street Kelly in a team of Campbell wealth management rationalize and designing retirement strategies that can allow you to spend more time enjoy life must time being concerned about your finances\nMaybe it's time for a second opinion seven zero three two one five two to five to ... to gamble wealth management can help make sure your golden years are just that\nGolden seven zero three two one five to five to seven zero three two one five to to buy\nSome light on retirement gamble ... former here with\nKelly he's hesitant as Campbell wealth management and they have offices here in D.C\nKelly has been a good leader and the financial services field for over twenty seven years now helping others get right on their retirement thanks so much for Cheney and today we are back to building a sound financial house for our retirement\nKelly's been taking us through the various ... that we need Kelly what's the next ... we need to solidify our financial foundation for the next phase of life retirement\nWell in in the last segment we talked about vision and then we talked about access to the bill that vision\nWith retirement looming right around the corner or some people right here and now you also need to build up protection around your assets so that's the third of our eight pillars\nRetirement for many people means shifting from that accumulation mode to the distribution mode for their assets so instead of focusing more on growth need to start thinking a little bit more about preservation and it really isn't a shift in your mind set a shift in your strategy but here's the problem a lot of people don't make that shift and it\nCan be a big problem especially with with where we are in the markets like I mean we with a market where to go down to day I Am seeing people every day that comes somebody workshops and educational courses I'm seeing them when they come in the office having Ninety\nPercent plus in stock or eighty five percent you know it's just it's too much there'll be crushed if the architects and that's what you really need to be this is what this protections bathrooms maybe think it up so as part of that shift is important to to take the additional steps to protect the assets\nFrom the risk that loom in the in retirement market um respect because see deplete a person is hard earned assets a really kind of taking back financially if they're not really address\nRight that tell us what are some of the biggest risk we should address Kelly\nWell the biggest one I've talked about her looted two so far as market risk you know the possibility that that ill timed significant Chastain downturn in the financial markets will deplete those retirement that's that's that's a biggie and for a lot of people especially those that don't have pensions that really relying on those assets to give an income and so if you are\nYou want to make sure that you've got that downside protection built in and and often I see that many people do\nAnother though is longevity risk the chances that someone's going to really live too long or they're going to live longer than their\nAssets will support them right so that's a big deal as well and really that comes in the planning side you can fix that was planning a healthcare costs they can pose a big risk as well because they're not going down and we all know that\nAnd find the inflation that's an increase in the cost of living it's another very real risk that people need to protect themselves against\nSo how can we protect ourselves from all of these rats there's a lot a year and a lot to do\nYeah absolutely so let's take one at a time so keeping in mind though that there are other risks beyond these things that we're talking about really just talking about a handful of them now but we're talking about the biggest one\nSo historically the best defense against the falling market has been diversification in other words having to write allocation among all the different types of asked the classes and just you know we talked broadly we're really talking stocks bonds and cash\nThen you can kind of go into the other sides of stock you know large cat made kept small cap\nA value oriented growth oriented even like international versus domestic and so just to give you an example if you had international stocks in your portfolio in the last year you didn't do very well\nYeah but that's one of the problems if you if you're looking at that you'll if you look at your portfolio and you're asked allocation and having the right mix of them you would have seen that coming up where you said you know what is less risky to invest inside the United states\nYou'll if you look at your portfolio and you're asked allocation and having the right mix of them you would have seen that coming up where you said you know it is less risky to invest inside the United states right now than it is the best outside did I say so that's\nOne of the things we we haven't had international stocks inappropriate for a while for that very reason but that's where you want to start looking at that ... it can have a lot of impact\nAnd you also want to have a downside protection strategy a lot of folks they they know the market can get down they're expecting it but they have they done anything about it\nAnd when I say this I'm Talking about investors I'm Talking about financial advisors brokers even certified financial planners\nThey don't have any downside protection that becomes really important [noise] so so that's a big piece of the pie and stuff they need to focus on\n[noise] so then there is that longevity rescinded folks the numbers don't lie and LOU LOU and this is really an important thing to remember\nUh other than the blips in both two thousand sixteen and Seventeen when the average\nLife expectancy for American actually decreased by tens of ... percent to Seventy eight point six lifespans have been trending upwards for decades literally decades now according to the U. S. government figures is an interesting uh man reaching age sixty five today can expect to live on average\nUntil eighty four point three so that's interesting any\n... any land [laughter]\n[laughter] that's a little less [laughter] ah\nBut even more startling to think about this for a woman turning sixty five her average life expectancy is basically a six point six I so people are living longer without a doubt and river Social Security let's say Social Security's going to continue to pay let's say you have a pension but a lot of times\nThey're not going up with inflation as much as your expenses are going up inflation which we'll talk about the second so when you're living longer you got to make sure that money's going to be there not just the money but the purchasing power that money as well\nRight there's so many strategies and volunteer now how should we address healthcare costs and the inflation risk\nYeah so on the health care side you need me think kind of like longevity the numbers don't lie\nAn estimated fifty eight percent of women at forty four percent of men would need nursing care it some time after the age of sixty five that's scary in a nursing care is expensive so new findings show that the annual meeting costs of long term care\nIs increased by about four and a half percent from twenty sixteen to twenty Seventeen deck nearly three times the annual inflation right now those inflation regular inflation didn't go up but the cost of a nursing home did go up it's hard to fathom that\nBut right hard to plan for that exactly that's crazy yeah so what you want to start thinking about what this is going to look like the total projected lifetime health care premiums including Medicare supplemental insurance dental insurance for healthy sixty five year old couple retiring\nLast year so I'm twenty seven teams are expected to be about three hundred and twenty two thousand dollars in today's dollars\nNow and when you add into ducked couples because at that didn't account for that when he ... co pays hearing vision all those cost sharing programs as well your costs can now go up to four hundred and four thousand dollars for a twenty year period\nOr a hundred and four thousand dollar that's expensive this was something you have to focus on in something they have to bring into the picture from a planning standpoint\nSo in most cases the best protection for your assets against potential health care costs than Bush is insurance\nInsurance for a long term care insurance for disability or critical illness I met a GAP insurance to cover gaps in Medicare coverage now and even potentially life insurance that depends everybody's in a different situation but those are the important things you want to focus on when it comes to health care wrist side of things\nAnd what about the risk of rising inflation Kelly\nWell and that's what I talked about before is that\nIt's going to cost more every single year to buy the goods and services that you buy and so your money needs to keep up with it as I said your pension and Social Security may not keep up with as much so you really need to be focusing on that inflation protection which is really the stock market which has always been a good hedge against inflation but again you got to do that and be careful all\nThe same time All right we've been talking about a lot of looming around retirement Kelly how about a pillar for retirement that's maybe a little more positive ads do you have anything\nI have solely due in a building that solid financial house for retirement you know you've got to look at all the what ifs but you know found out all doom and gloom who you start thinking a little bit more about the fun stuff which is how do I make more money how do I get gross\nInto growth is important and as I talked a little bit about before gross comes from the stock market for most people now does that mean putting a hundred percent of your money in the stock market but it means having some level of stock in other words\nWhen you retire you can't take all your money and put it in CDs or in the bank or you know just in bonds you still need that stop because those are the ones that are going to outperform but only over the long term\nSo you need to be thinking about that from how you build your portfolio to give you that income that you're gonna need and the future so gross is that next pillar and it becomes a really important part of your retirement\nSo what you're saying is just because we're retired doesn't mean that we need to move our assets\nIs that next pillar and it becomes a really important part of your retirement\nSo what you're saying is just because we're retired doesn't mean that we need to move our assets out of the market right\nRight that's exactly it so when you when you do retire depending on who you are you need a downside protection plan something it\nJust says hey when the market really does go into that tailspin when it really does start going down I've got a way out I'm not going to be subjected to you know losing thirty forty fifty percent of the market\nAnd then if you say okay if I Know I'm spending eight thousand dollars a month but I Know the Social Security and my pension is only given me six thousand dollars a month I Know that I'm going to need to make up\nFor that short for the what we call that that income gap or guarantee gap because remember the pension and the Social Security are guarantees now I've got to go to the non guaranteed side to get the rest of that income\nTelling you let's say we see that gap you know that two thousand dollar gap what would be some options for feeling that income Boyd\nBut now you need to look at your different investments and so this is where the portfolio management comes in because again if you said hey I'm taking all my money out of the stock market and putting into the bonds are putting in his CDs in this market with these rates it's not going to make up at income gap\nOr maybe it will for the short term but over the long haul it's not going to because they're just not paying enough\nSo it becomes a little more difficult now you got to start thinking okay if I'm going to get the income what's my portfolio need to look like is that is really remember that set third leg of that stole we talked about which is now how do I invest my money to provide that in this case two thousand dollars a month of income but to make it steady and they make it ever increasing does that make sense\nYeah it does have got to have a steady even got to have the three legs two legs I on friday enough [laughter]\nYeah we kind of hard to run with three legs [laughter]\nBut you're right when you when you put together a portfolio and it's got to provide an income it's got to be a different portfolio then when it was just growing\nSo I see a lot of people again I said this even before that I've met with so many people that are so aggressive in their portfolios they're eighty Ninety percent of their money is in the stock market well that may be great for the market we've had but it may not be great for the market we're about to go into and again I Know the market's going to go ahead please don't win\nSo if it starts going down today and you're eighty percent or Ninety percent stock\nYou're going to start to lose some pretty significant dollars which means it's what you mean at some point that portfolio may not still give you that two thousand dollars of income that you need that that gap\nOr maybe it will but maybe it won't be enough to kind of put it inflation factor in there as well so it keeps increasing and that's why you need to start looking at it a little more conservatively but again when we're looking at our portfolio growing we can be more aggressive\nWhen we're looking at our portfolio let's say providing an income that we need to live off that they actually need we've got to be more\nConservative we definitely have to so we have a program that we call our right um retirement financial tree as we do it all the time you do it for a number different\nPeople but at the bottom line is it allows us to look at what she currently have so your\nCurrent assets all the things you're currently doing your income sources your expenses well ad and things like inflation factors in rates of return and then we can from that determine whether you're on track or not if you're on track that's great but then the second part of this was making sure you stay on track\nAnd will actually look at your portfolio and make sure your portfolio is well aligned but not only well aligned with with what you need out of it but also well aligned with your risk tolerance because you don't want something more risky than than you want to be because that'll keep\nYou up at night and you don't want to do that and retirement so if you want to take advantage of a right or retirement financial tree I just call us or text the word plan to seven oh three two one five two to five to again call or text word plan to seven other three two one five two to five two and we'll see you soon\nKelly and his team at Campbell wealth management had been working with people just like you creating financial strategies to get them to and through retirement successfully we're ready to reveal the final two pillars of building a sound financial house\nFor retirement find out what they are coming up next this is right on retirement but can we can handle about management [noise]\n\nYou often hear retirement called the golden years\nBut it is when it comes to your health it's clear\nYou consult your doctor board right so why not consult for professional when it comes to money just like your doctor's advice you get from a financial advisor to have a direct impact\nOn your quality of life are you paying too much in these with your current financial professional what could happen to your nest egg if there's a market correction you aren't

Campbell wealth management rationalize him designing retirement strategies that can allow you to spend more time enjoying life must find being concerned about your ...\nCampbell wealth management actualize in designing retirement strategies that can allow you to spend more time enjoying life and less time being concerned about your finances maybe it's time for a second opinion seven zero three two one five to five to six Campbell wealth management can help make sure your building here are just that\nGolden seven zero three two one five two to five to seven seven zero three two one five to to buy [noise]\nA lot\nOf time they can tell him on land former they're finished or\nEven ... years and years of hard work\nInvesting in planning and you've made it to the time in your life even dreaming about and I am talking about retirement but are you truly ready do you have a plan according to Kelly and his team at Campbell wealth management you got to have a written replant and they call it you're right I'm retired financial ...\nKelly we've covered about six of them so far and that leaves us with round table or to complete that blueprint so what's our next Taylor\nWell we've talked so much about building a financial foundation that's dirty\nBut as people in California and other earthquake prone areas no all too well that house doesn't just need to be thirty has to be built with kind of a shock absorber quality\nSo if you think about being that she her having a shock absorber where really mean is building some flexibility to maneuver ability you know into your retirement blueprint it's crucial that that house not be too rigid by that financial house\nThat retirement has not be too rigid because you may need to adapt to some different different situation different market conditions different personal circumstance you priorities may change rigidity won't necessarily make a house stronger in fact sometimes it'll make it more vulnerable\nHave you ever been in a building wave ... sort of sway I have and it's kind of creepy failing isn't it oh my gosh yeah it's dealt with that flexibility\nWe actually had an earthquake here not a few years back and I was actually looking out the window and I saw two buildings move opposite of each other know\nCrazy crazy All right so how do we build flexibility into that retirement blueprint Kelly\nIs so so the thing about flexibility is you need to know that with your portfolio with your planning everything is subject to change and when I say that what I mean is that everything happens yeah kind of everything happens for a reason to think that that way but\nWe don't always know what's gonna happen so it could be that well you have a death of a spouse and it's unfortunate but that could change things drastically it could be that ... the markets changing it could be for the better you know the market didn't really really really well but that means you need to adjust your portfolio as a matter of fact we call that rebalancing\nSo think of it this way we know that in the year let's say Ninety five to the year two thousand that technology market did really well and so a lot of folks let's say they started out in\nThe Indian Nineteen Ninety five is it had like ten percent technology stocks well technology stocks did so well let's see the end of Ninety nine going into two thousand\nThey may have had like sixty or Seventy or eighty percent of technology stocks heck they may even bought more technology because doing so well\nBut guess what in two thousand technology is the worst performing ethic class so if you didn't continually rebalance then you lost a lot of money\nSo that's really what this kind of flexibility is all about either rebalancing your portfolio are changing your priorities or in some cases let's say\nLet's say you over spends a little bit it may mean that she needs to under spend a little bit for a little while so it's having that flexibility in your planning having a flexibility in your portfolio you know and then you're you're you know your income versus expenses that's what's really going to help your overall retirement plan\nKelly are there other flex plants that we need to consider building into our retirement ...\nYeah absolutely so there are one involves life insurance and so a lot of people ask me when they come into my office they say hey you know what I've got these old life insurance policies but I don't know whether I Need it or not so when we look at life insurance we look at it from a real number standpoint we say if you die today how\nWould your spouse your family you know whoever is also relying on your income how would they be affected because then we want to find out do we need that death benefit do we need to be looking at final expenses are we going to have to have immediate access to cash\nFor whether it be just paying off debt or paying you know if you find more let's say assets from an income standpoint it's also the other insurance is like that you know that medical insurance the met a gap when you go on to Medicare\nThe long term care plan you know so when you end up in a situation where let's say you you know you you're not terminally ill but you're ill enough that\nHealth care is not going to cover you you can't do some of these what they call activities of daily living so you need help around the house you need someone to be there to help you with things like bathing in eating addressing that for a long term care and\nLiving so you need to help around the house you need someone to be there to help you with things like bathing in eating addressing that for a long term care insurance comes in and there's a number of different ways to do that\nBut again that's that's some of those things where you need that flexibility and that flexibility will help for those unexpected things that could pop up\nKelly how much cash do you recommend your clients have I've always wondered about that in in even my own plan\nAs a great question I get that question all the time because people are sitting on so much cash right now I saw someone the other day believe it or not had two million dollars in a checking account", "show_name": "Washington's Drive at Five", "year": "2018", "city": "Washington", "day": "13"}
