all these people are registering devoted so great tells you shut them all the politics\nAs changing the world a and she's proven that she's not a Republican that's the whole point of this by the way is to try and demonstrate to the media that she's not a conservative whatever you might think or suspect about her\nA because ticket sales depend on it you can't be Republican nobody will have you on the yell at you will spit on you know just like they'll they'll get upset that you showed up in the oval office alongside the president of the United states like happened today with Kanye West\nSo Phil Bredesen who's running for Senate there\nIs Marsha Blackburn\nShe he is in a situation where a he'd because he's trailing her he decided that he was going to\nSay out loud that he was supportive of Brett Kavanaugh he's a Democrat he supports Kavanaugh's it was a big deal\nAnd\nIt turns out James O'Keefe has set up a sting on his campaign\nAnd spoke to some of the field organizers who actually work for ... and what did he discover\nFulfilled Brad as soon as a diplomat as politicians\nDo Brett is and\nWhat's not genuinely for Brett Kavanaugh\nHe was only saying the things that he thinks the

they react that becomes nearest unfortunately for ...\nUnfortunately for them local media is going to be covering the all the TV stations in Tennessee are going to be talking about it and Hannity is leading his segment tonight with Hannity on ... on Fox is leading a segment tonight with the ... so it's not\nThat they are saying things I did talk to the campaign manager who told me to quote get the hell out of here um and I and I got kinda shocked about him last night at the at the debate I get catch up with will who were in the street and you'll see that video released a actually right now I'm ... I'm sure they're going to eventually\nSay something they're going to have to because you can't have people working for you who say these things at at the ... the truth it's game over for the whole campaign\nOkay so you were at the ... debate last night and you encounter the campaign manager there was he a\nCounter the campaign manager whose name temporarily escapes me here at the glitter Colby or something like that\nAnd the campaign manager for job resident for Senate he saw me I was going to die at the auditorium there was a debate watch it and then there was the debate across the street and I and I said hello and he could grab the comedian could hell out of here we have this on on video\nAnd it's being published here in the way they they when they see me they get angry all rage you furious at the notion that group report this stuff but I I again I think that\nThey have to do something here that have to fire the people or the at the cop out and attack me but they're not going to do that unless they're forced to in contact with other media outlets\nOkay I think I think it's Bob corny as the guy and it did not\nCorny thank you that's that's the guy that that sort of up to me and then crushed me off\nSo and then you encountered him and I saw a video on your social media feed about this and then he called the cops on you when you try to get the cops to throw yeah\nThat was a different ... so so it could just quickly what happened was that after debate\nLast night in in Knoxville I stood outside the bigger the camera trucks everywhere there's film crews there's you know the everyone got cameras on their shoulders and and I'm standing in the parking lot amongst the truck and the AIDS sees me to call for pulling you call the police\nUnder the under ... report I've got a flag Mike and a cameraman and and all that on video we just published it and I think you know there's a greater issue and it's a crisis in journalism where\nI guess people view often what we do as such a threat it is so lethal what we do reporting on what they're paying out of their own mouth that they feel the need to use character assassination and stop tactics all on video of course but\nYou know it it's going to be a big impact locally and I know that the local media stations are covering tonight\nYeah okay so you and that means that you've been speaking right with these local media outlets I'm assuming they reached out to you in an effort to kind of report this out and if there is a campaign\nIf you look at Twitter the local I don't have the people's names in front of me at the

people to know what the the politicians actually believe it's very important\nYeah it's a it's a big deal it's a big deal especially if again they're just trying to say things for political experience I mean it is a big deal when you hear a Democrat come out like a ... in a tough race against Marsha Blackburn were last night he was challenged by some eight points are so maybe even more a and\nThis is a guy who claimed that he was going to support Brett Kavanaugh and here you are with cable on his own staff saying you know what that is actually on why we're just trying to trick the ignoring voters of Tennessee this after by the way just a couple of days ago he got this big news the Taylor Swift was endorsing him\nAnd probably thinking man there's wind in my sales well not so much any

saw that they were in the way the way MSNBC reacted to it Jim Acosta was was getting the vapors that he used a curse word in the oval office like it was the first time I'd ever happened like Lyndon Johnson was never a president\nLike [laughter] it's like it's it's crazy but here's here's a Kanye West and listen as you listen to this and to think to yourself OK and if you're a Democrat and you

have a racist but we certainly not the whole conversation so one of the liberal\nWhat can a person to the concept of racism because they know that we're very proud of most people when I said I Try to like someone that liberal they'll say well what do you think races OK\nOkay a little bit of all over the place psychology there but the point is like the whole like liberal try to control blacks or racism Kanye West says like half the cameras shut off like no we're not covered that [laughter]\nSo ... are causing some trouble today a and he and he also had this to say I'm sure ... you know President Trump\nHas to be beaming he lets you know he puts the name Trump on the side of like everything\nLike he's proud and he wants to be seen as impressive\nAnd Tanya wants to see them that way too\nMany Saturday Night live to improve\nOn the liberals are promoting he don't\nOr three in power\nHere Trump he's got his hands crossed in front of him as he always does do you live out like this his arms folded is if it's true it's true I've got to be the fly us [laughter] I've got to be the fly is president [noise] ah so kind of making a splash that I\nAnd I like the and the press hates this
