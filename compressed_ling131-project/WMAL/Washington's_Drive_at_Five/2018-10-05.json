in the Bush White House who writes for the wall Street Journal [noise]\nUm we don't know how he's going to rule on on that affect immigration\nYeah ... ... and Chris I I don't necessarily disagree with that but the conversation today has to do with the tactics used to try to spike his nomination ... whether whether Kavanaugh is the perfect choice for the Supreme Court was\nPretty much a ... a moot point as of July eighth I Believe which was the day Donald Trump named him I mean at that point what are we going to do\nA bat said would you agree with me that this entire process that we've seen over the last several weeks in his confirmation has taught President Trump and hopefully Republicans in the Senate very valuable lesson I'm not ... enough with trying to get the candidate who's going to be a you know up he's people like Joe mansion or if these people\nAre on the left or Democrats and get the guy who's going to be the most acceptable now I this is what they do to the most acceptable guy yeah\nAbsolutely I agree with that All right Chris got I was like do agree are good good talking to you and good senior the other day how about a Jonathan in Maryland Jonathan you are on WMA now\n[laughter] now you Larry\nI'm good what do you think of it are you [noise]\nSo\nI'm like I say I'm a little different because I think that this has been going on both ... both during President Obama's\nThing where it when I'm his nominates and they all agree with it and decided not to vote on it so they kind of bark the blame of this going on now that the majority how the ... the say no we're not going to vote on it\nYou know I I hear this a lot Jonathan and that's why I'm very happy to take your call because there's there's a whole lot of both sides to do this kind of talk going on I'm here here's the difference and I think it's a very important for you and for everybody here the difference what happened with Merrick Garland was not outside of Senate precedent\nThat had been done before to various nominees to the Supreme Court a bit of president has put in when he is about to leave office number one number two even if there wasn't precedent even if that was brand new that they decided to do that and wait for the presidential election\nThere's a real difference here between what happened to Clarence Thomas what happened to justice pork and what just happened to Brett Kavanaugh they may not have decided to consider Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court but they did not slime him personally\nThey did not try to destroy him personally they did not call him a sexual predator or a rapist or or a person who's going to roll back\nCivil rights or anything else in this country to back to the slavery era like they've done to Bork Thomas and cabinet don't you see a big difference there [noise]\nI I Do and I do not agree with what the ... right I just saying that they kind of help bark that part of the fact that ... not maybe not right but they also at the\nHe's going to be a Supreme Court judges that that's a regular position with a lifetime appointment though at the same time I kind of have a feeling that the people\nHe's going to be a Supreme Court judges that just a regular position but the lifetime appointment though at the same time I kind of have a feeling that the people that do they need at least to hurt or right if you're making back or they\nAnd they hurt her right they hurt or ended up day and then they tried to corroborate what she said and nobody could corroborate it and therefore they did the right thing but that was\nThere for that you made the accusation at that time on them right\nOn who the Democrats though well actually it is I actually it is on them and now explain why they leaked that letter to the media\nOr somebody for the Democrats leak that letter because they're the only one that had\nAnd if they wanted to have an actual process when Dianne Feinstein had at the end of July she could have easily share this with Republican or the FBI could have been investigated that at that time when they had plenty of time to do it at all could have been kept out of the public\nEye you don't think that stuff comes up during these FBI background checks that senators know about that we never learn about because it never gets corroborated that that happens a lot it happens more often than you think\nThis was brought out to the public for the sole purpose of destroying this man's character\nAnd and that is something that shouldn't be forgiven\nJohnson thank you for the call more of your

that vote if necessary and you know Mike Pence isn't going anywhere until Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed\nOr your reaction to this historic day today and in a broader sense of ... do you think the left or you think Democrats learned the lesson here\nBut I think I like to hope\nThat there'll be some grownups and their party who will step back and say this thing work and forests guys first of all we didn't stop this nomination a number two we have we have radicalized people like Lindsey Graham Chuck Grassley Orrin Hatch for God's sake [noise]\nAnd ah we even though we were looking okay for the midterms maybe even how I'd have a little bit of a blue wave we've now snatched defeat from the jaws of victory and\nWe've put a whole lot of seats in play because we've energized Republican voters thanks to these tactics maybe we should rethink our strategy on this maybe we shouldn't have a scorched earth policy uh I'd like to think that but sadly I'm well aware of the fact that there's a whole lot of money in this town that rewards this behavior\nAnd sadly Democrats at this point are so beholden to these deep pockets that they've got to show them that they did everything they possibly could even the most disgusting underhanded slimy tactics\nThrowing an innocent man's reputation in the gutter for their own political and they need to show all of these groups that they're willing to do that so that they can earn\nThose campaign donations they can earn that financial support\nMean we're going to have over twenty candidates running for the Democratic nomination in twenty twenty they all think they can beat Donald Trump and guess what twenty presidential campaigns are more\nOr they don't grow on trees that it takes a lot of money to support that and they they need to keep all those deep pocket well funded interests\nAre motivated they need to show them that their money as well spent\nIf not for results at least for effort and frankly Democrats can now at least point to one result sure they didn't stop Kavanaugh assuming that this goes through tomorrow but at least for the next twenty or Thirty years anytime Kavanaugh boats on something they can say or remember that guy he was a rapist [noise]\nSo so hey mission accomplished Democrats sadly I'm cynical if not realistic enough\nTo believe that that's really the lesson the Democrats have learned here hey it was close and look we can keep raising money off of this show in\nFredericksburg your next step on WMA ah what do you make of today's historic events\nLarry I'm sure you know exactly what a straw man argument

the burden of proof that you're given a criminal case but share the burden of proof of their whole case uh it's not likely the preponderance of evidence as opposed to beyond a reasonable and ...\nThat's right that's right she she really did meticulously dissect every argument that has been thrown up against Brett Kavanaugh from the ... a good faith ones against his jurisprudence and whether he'll up whole precedents and all of those things to the outrageous ones calling him some kinds of sexual predator or do you think it'll make a difference\nBetween you and me I think it will make a difference in the court I Do I think it will make a difference between what the Democrats are going to do in the future [noise] no I think they're going to continue to do what they're going to do and hopefully Trump yet another\nAppointment on the court I think that yes they will need Republicans have been out the cardinal radicalized and we're not going to take it anymore\nRight Joe thank
