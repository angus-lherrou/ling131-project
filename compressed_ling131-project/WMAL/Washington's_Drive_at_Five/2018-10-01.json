president's remarks with regard to the auto manufacturers which I remember when after was first being discussed back in the mid nineties\nUh automated factor seemed to be one of the biggest biggest sticking points with people who are hesitant UAW was not happy with it or what major changes have you made here that will ah protect North American most so specifically American auto manufacturers\nWho I Love what you share it with ... there's a lot of people who are around that time who remember that there are a lot of people want and in Nineteen Ninety four that we're ... we

blind and uh and screwing us in the long run then yes it should have been renegotiate and things should have been changed and we should see the details you just heard from Peter Navarro and I don't think anyone's had this conversation\nIn the media today a where he said yeah okay these reforms that were making to manufacture automobiles in North America to be able to get that stamp of approval saying\nYou know there's not going to be any taxes are terrorists on this\nWhen this car is sold in America it's not going to be treated as a foreign built automobile\nUh to to be able to get that stamp of approval you need to make a certain percentage of the parts here in the United states and in part of the NAFTA countries where the north American countries ah okay that in theory that sounds great but you heard Navarro just admit\nAs I asked him a couple of follow the questions that that could raise the price of your car\nMaybe a thousand dollars he said\nBut that's that's a fair trade because it means we're going to get more people working in this country and working in\nA tree and working in those manufacturing jobs so in the long run it's okay for the economy because yeah maybe you'll spend a thousand dollars more for your car but there's going to be more people working\nAnd working in good paying manufacturing jobs are are you good with that trade off\nIf we just wanted to
