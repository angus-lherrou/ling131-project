not why on earth how on earth does that not come up\nJust outrageous cam sure any Republican would get exactly the same treatment\nA DWI would do totally an ass unnoticed and and not talked about whatsoever don't questions from the audience nothing from Dana Bash nothing just pathetic\nJust pathetic okay so here's Tom Brokaw and I hope I have a ... my cuts right here it's my this is my fault if I'm messing up not anybody else's\nI'm Tom Brokaw was on MSNBC\nOh no the today show the today show on friday yesterday talking about today's anniversary of the Saturday Night massacre by Nixon and there's all kinds of parallels that these people see and and you know et cetera et cetera so I'm amongst you to listen to cut fourteen\nForty five years ago tomorrow president Richard Nixon the unprecedented step of firing the special prosecutor investigating the Watergate cover up\nSlicks and did not turn over the most incriminating shapes and a one after the press\nI have never heard or seen such outrageous vicious distorted reporter and twenty seven years of public life\nIn the end of course Richard Nixon had only himself to blame credible out and watch the history and then you poor thing you see some parallels\nYou see some parallels well Tom Brokaw sitting there and in cut Fifteen Tom Brokaw said this\nYou see some parallels well Tom Brokaw sitting there and in cut Fifteen Tom Brokaw said this what\nYou think Tom just quickly about the differences between then and now\nI think there are big differences one is that uh we knew that there are parts of the teams that were very likely incriminating\nAnd they're going to say the president's words we don't know that about Donald Trump's assistant does he have we have the evidence that is their own some form but we were the only are we would tell everybody what we knew\nThat we didn't make judgments about guilt or innocence doesn't say is and then my report yeah I think he's guilty ... we would deal with what we had and we all kind of were a check on one another on the White House press corps [laughter]\nYou know going too far here better be careful trip with what I've got to this true um\nA huge difference because now the whole country is involved in a so terribly polarized left and right when I was on twenty four seven\nThere you go so good for good for Tom Brokaw\nWe have no evidence we've seen no evidence that's the big difference though evidence and back then they didn't do their reports and say well the\nPresident's guilty now of course that's what they do and these women on done the today show who's the parallels what's the parallel\nThe date I mean I don't understand the president has been\nFired anybody involved in the investigation is a parallel there there's been no Saturday Night massacre or any kind of massacre\nThere's been no no no the assault on the investigation\nAnd there's no evidence they don't even know what\nThey're accusing them of their no parallels and broke up basically said that\nAnd\nBasically scolded so called journalists today that's what he was doing\nBy painting the contrast between the way litter gate was handled back then not withstanding Nixon's assessment of it and comparing it to ... days out of control he's guilty he's guilty he's guilty\nIt's freezing because he stood next to pull ... he's not see\nHe's an authoritative dictator is a third Terry in these this is that he's a racist these big it is a homophobic vena fall being you know my God\n\nSo good for Tom Brokaw I mean you know no one's more critical of the media than I Am\nBut when they deserves some credit or a specific individual deserves some credit unlike Dana Bash uh [laughter] I Will be there to present it to to them so they're okay\nLet's um get back to a phone call is do we still have Raj from Vienna hello Raj and as you well know Raj Vienna waits for you\nHello Raasch\nNo I guess Raj is no longer there or and this is a distinct possibility he fell asleep\nRaj there no okay\nNo
