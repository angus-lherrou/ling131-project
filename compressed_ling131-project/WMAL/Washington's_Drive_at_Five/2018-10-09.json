lead\nVoters are engaging engaging and at the Republican side of the aisle and that's good friends heading up the effects are\nNow ... ... talk to me about this engagement and about how important the energy and excitement is because let's face it I mean the Republicans have both houses they've got the White House and things are pretty good right now the unemployment is at a what a fifty year

sort of coast through this thing is that normal\nYeah complacency is always a concern heading into that first term at that\nIf the party in power just sort of coast through this thing is that normal\nYeah complacency is always a concern heading into that first term of a sitting president historically the party that holds the White House loses majority in those terms so we're working to defy history but the results of the economy and the results of what Republicans have died are\nYeah I think so certainly are the ... the I call him will push for that conversation thought so and so the basis of my columns with those last weekend with a former general counsel the FBI\nA ... interview with Congress Mark Meadows Jim ... members of the house oversight committee each and a during that interview Baker said hey there was no joking about this uh this conversation it may twenty Seventeen was real it was serious we are seriously talking about wearing a wire\nAnd recording the president and taking that information to the cabinet and hopes that we can get him removed from Congress so and his source of that information was he had talked directly to the acting FBI Director ... former deputy director Andrew McCabe and to Lisa Page capes\nA lawyer at the FBI support of bakers\nAnd as we know these debates is also famous for her text messages or with Pete stroke the or Russia lead agent ... lead agent yeah but uh by his account everybody yeah yeah I thought this was a serious matter that local seem hysteria so\nIf you think about it is John dropping out of the FBI whose job is investigate crimes is now trying to get involved in an effort to remove the president a it's a it's really remarkable\nNow I just want to be clear on this because a lot of people are taking your story John to interpret that a that a Rod Rosenstein is lying when he says it was just a joke that he really is a problem yet he may have been joking right\nBud man with your own oh right but your story says that may Cade and those guys at the FBI they weren't joking about that they weren't they were serious about\nIt so at least the people in the room walked away with a serious in France if this was something they should consider doing\nIt one of those awkward moments where you might make a sarcastic joke at a table and everyone looks at using oh is that something can we really do that\nYeah no that's right we don't know and and we should give ... Rosen seem to benefit without really testifies on eleventh hour should be on a later this week on Thursday the ...\nSo the real question is uh what is his account what does he take of it did he ever tell the FBI you shouldn't be talking about that stuff who brought the idea of a there's a lot of things that we don't know about I think most importantly though\nThe Congress was hoping to get on by October fourth advance of their interview of roses team\nOr the Medicaid and other member that that reference this meeting that they ... this\nConversation about recording the president and the Justice Department has yet to turn those documents over so we've seen this pattern many times that Congress wants documents justice says no they do an interview then they turned over documents later and you'll find that there were things you wish you knew what documents before he did\nYeah and speaking of all those FBI documents you know one thing that we've all noticed is these ... we're told they're releasing any any documents would jeopardize national security jeopardize the FBI and how they go about doing their business in their sources and methods\nAnd then then when we finally get the ... that's not the case at all and and you found in your article two days ago I was a little bit of a paper trail here that suggest that this is all politics\nBut yeah certainly certainly the reaction I found there is no national security reason whatsoever and this involves a another thing that James Baker told Congress last week which is that\nDuring the height of the Russia investigation a few weeks before the end of the election or they were going for the Pfizer ward member of President Trump and Hillary Clinton are competing against each other they're going to go get a five weren't based on the political opposition research paid for by the Democratic party and Hillary Clinton yup a\nOf the DNC is one of the DNC main lawyers from Perkins Korea guy named ... bike assessment comes over and he dumps a a document dump on the ... FBI console James Baker and says\nI I think you ought to look at these and there there are things about Russia Trump and hacking and he then gives them\nA outside of the normal chain of custody normally you would get me to an agent you have to be interviewed by nature but he gives him downstream to the FBI agents working the counterintelligence taste\nAnd why that's significant well first it doesn't follow the normal protocol right line agents gather evidence Afghan general counsel's review legal memos here you have the general counsel at a very senior level kind of sending stuff and the DNC on down what messages that sense of the eight downstream but secondly this\nUm item was referenced in a footnote in the house intelligence report on Russia months and months ago but guess what when it came time to release it the Justice Department redacted claiming it was national security\nProtection information it can't be possible\nThat the Democratic party lawyers\nIn time to release at the Justice Department redacted it claiming it was national security protected information it can't be possible that the Democratic party lawyers contact with the FBI it involves national charity involves politics\nIt's all politics and they're just trying to cover themselves in fact that leads us my final question thirty seconds jumps on what is the status now of the secrets vacation I've seen some people speculating that by\nPutting it in the hands of inspector general Horwitz it's the White House a really sort of a dot the I's and crossing the seeds because this is a major information and they want to make sure that all legal protocols are followed what what is your take on this\nThat's right that's the Justice Department raise some concerns of presidents trying to be careful you want to be transparent but he also doesn't want to do anything that's wrong but I think one thing that President ... the way the very Justice Department that is telling it now that there might be concerns and really give you information\nIs the same Justice Department that played this game of keep away for the last two years or so I think yeah the way past experience for the Justice Department keeping valuable information like stroke text messages away like Hillary funding of the ... away from the other problem\nIs I'm against uh their their current admonition if I had the gift I bet you the president released assembly documents that guy I think so too bad right up before the election perhaps I Would ... well that we played a lot about the John tell them and thanks for joining us always good stuff and\nSo every day five twenty four on W.
