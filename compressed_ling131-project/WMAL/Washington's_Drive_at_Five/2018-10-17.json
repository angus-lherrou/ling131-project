process and one of the innocent people that got slammed in the process is Carter Page\nAnd to this date there have been no charges brought against Carter Page but if you ask any journalist if you ask any a follower of Hillary Clinton or the Democrats are liberal ... they would probably tell you oh yeah Carter Page he said\nHe's that's huge of the government that he's that Russian agents he's that\nHe's that a traitor to America\nWho worked with Moscow and these corrupt mafia like Olive Garden to undermine the presidential election that Carter Page as well if that's not true then that is one of the most horrendous\nDefamation of a man's character that you will ever see this as a man who was a navy academy graduate he was a naval officer worked in intelligence he's been an

behind the backing and the creation of this a defamatory story behind a about myself and just as a way to tear down the Trump campaign\nThat's right but they also tore him down in the process and they didn't care one great thing about a civil lawsuit like this is there will be discovery which means you're allowed to look at a whole lot of stuff\nThat was going on there at the DNC and what this law

themselves from this lawsuit\nThe way they can save themselves\nIs very simple all they have to prove is that everything in the dust is true with regard to Carter Page you see that's it all they've got to do is proof in a court of law that Carter Page is in fact an agent of the Russian government\nThat their best defense and Carter Page knows that so ask yourself something\nWhy would Carter Page

was\nAnd that was an agent of vitamin ... operating against the best interests of the United states of America on behalf of Donald Trump to get him elected\nIf he really was that thing why would he
