that evil evil murder a and the thing a little bit about them both the president and I'm personally I'm leaving the Mentos on the the makeshift graves and um and it is a a solemn moment to be sure and the president's executing his duties as Warner and chief today in a pretty solid way from\nFrom my standpoint or we can talk about that a little bit further on but I Do want to turn to the other big story of the day and that is the president's footing the idea of using an executive order that would undo our current policy of granting birthright citizenship\nI Believe it to children of illegal immigrants but there may be more to it I'm not sure let's let's get some clarity on this Mark Krikorian is the executive director of the center for Immigration Studies and he joins us now a high mark how're ya\nDoing very well thank you all busy because of this\nI bet for citizenship issue yeah you thought the care of them would keep you busy so tell me what's your understanding based on what's being reported is this a a an end to birthright citizenship in general for even for children of of a legal residence or is it just for children of illegal immigrants\nWell it's not clear because there's no actual executive already at the president's just mentioned it in an interview but the Supreme Court ruled more than a hundred years ago that children born to\nA legal immigrants are essentially green card holders all didn't call it back then right um our citizens and there was argument at the time as to whether they should be in other words the way people a lot of people understood the fourteenth amendment citizenship provision back then\nWas the only people born to us citizens people were all parents were already citizens\nWould become citizens so to speak but Supreme Court settled that they said anybody born citizens anybody born to legal immigrants as a citizen they did not address\nThe issues we're dealing with now which is children born to illegal aliens and children born to tourists yeah there's a big burst tourism businesses you know right\nAnd so what the president basically has done is done everybody a favor by [noise] um [noise] presumably saying that\nAnd so what the president basically has done is done everybody a favor by [noise] um [noise]\nPresumably saying that the federal responsibility here is probably the first thing that will come up is passports in other words the way this his ruling would be challenge our his executive order will be challenge is that a burst tourist\nRight citizens are you on board with the president just sending an executive order up there it's really just triggering the court case that's really it\nOr do things that trigger the challenging court sets the president's executive order or legislation but it looks like Senator Graham as moving something to his son is not going to go anywhere [noise] ah the\nOnly other thing that you can do to either clarify redefined or ricin birthright citizenship as we know what right now is to amend the constitution through the traditional way or through an article five convention that's it\nSo the executive order seems to be the way he's going and I don't see it as an extra constitutional forget all these people were like oh the president thinks that he can undo a constitutional amendment just by executive order no he's not saying that uh nobody's saying that and don't be more on and don't be an idiot to even buy into that argument they're\nJerks you know who they are there Jim Acosta that's who they are Jim Acosta today tweeted out executive constitution greater than the executive order\nThat I don't remember him making that argument on DACA and by the way they do it again just to reiterate what are we just discussed\nThe doctor thing was totally different than this first of all that wasn't even an officially an executive order a number one and number two he actually one of his way to grant citizen status for legal status to people who are here illegally through executive ... that's not what's happening here at all all he's doing here is a determining giving guidance to\nUh his agency an agency that works on the executive branch on how they should be a shooting passports and who they should be shouldn't passports to with in the current understanding of the law\nAnd no one can point to a Supreme Court decision that says wait a minute the children of illegal immigrants deserve their passport no there's no it's just become a tradition as you heard Vicky in Alexandria your first step on WBAL ...\nHi what do you think of this I\nThink that the president is absolutely correct I think our laws should be or his executive order shit stand and who should be able to decide that I Will prevent wrong all along and that's what caused all the issues we're having a day but the dreamers I mean if we have a hard\nPlace all along like you said there's never been a mass Supreme Court ruling that says they automatically have a ... yeah and if that were the case then it wouldn't have been an issue all along right and and I definitely agree\nVicki just for clarity saying this is separate from the dreamers the dreamers is even more complicated what's not complicated but uh it gets bogged down in\nRhetoric the dreamers were born here no one argues that the the people that are called dreamers were brought here as children illegally and then grew up in lived here because nobody enforced or immigration laws and and deported the people who had\nWho had brought these children here so that that's even frankly more insidious than someone coming here and then having a baby and then expecting them to get full citizenship which they have been able to do or how about a Dan in Virginia Dan you're on WWE a male\nStudy I've got a couple of opinions about this first off I'm yeah I'm thinking of Sandra Day O'Connor's opinions were the weight which she made and extension from sixteenth century English property law applied that unborn children are not persons\nUh you know there's something well we're going to hold on there and you've got to clarify that cause the Justice O'Connor wasn't on the court for the roe v Wade decision was that is that on some sort of stuff that went to Justice O'Connor was not on the court for the roe v Wade decision also and you you must be a different abortion decision you're ...\nYou know I\nWas well I retired I Can't I mix footing the bill or lead to the point that it's it's really extension to previously existing law and in this case we have the issue of\nUh what is the dome of style of a child the child from a long standing legal precedent is almost all of its parents\nSo if a couple comes here illegally from El Salvador and as a child here but almost all of that trial is they'll sell it or not the United states a\nSecond thing\nWhen the fourteenth amendment was ratified the language that was put in there all persons born\nOr naturalized in the United states are citizens the United states the ... state which they were the people say future tense board it doesn't say show have been for porn or we'll be bored\nAnd what that was intended to cover it was people who were already present in the United states but writing a former condition was slavery\nNo absolutely you write down and actually I took a lot of time going into this earlier in the program I Know but then in in Eighteen Ninety eight the Supreme Court than applied the fourteenth amendment\nThis uh this child of Chinese immigrants they were not citizens but he was born here they were legally in this country has residents he left to go to China and then they wouldn't let him\nThe elder of Chinese immigrants they were not citizens but he was born here they were legally in this country has residents he left to go to China and then they wouldn't let him back in the country\nAnd it was at that time the Supreme Court saw that language and said okay we know this was written to apply to slavery and those who had been enslaved however the clear language also applies to someone who is born to legal residents but a new way was that Supreme Court decision apply to the legal\nResidents illegal aliens having a child and yet that is what we've done by the way some of the Day O'Connor\nWas part of the case the decision they should involve abortion so maybe that's what you're referring to\nOne of the thing I Want to blow away here ah one of the arguments you're hearing about the fourteenth amendment and that it was rooted in an old English pace law I Want to talk about that and much more in a moment we're discussing birthright citizenship and whether the presence on the right track with his executive order Tripoli security W male I'm Larry economy kind of shocked\nWashington Mall
