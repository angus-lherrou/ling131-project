generations had been named in alphabetical order like the next baby that was to be born duck the next letter in the alphabet and by the time my kids were born they were already like\nThe third time through the alphabet so we knew our child had to have a name starting with cue\nWhich sort of limits your options they're right and so we decided it was going to be Quinn whether it was a boy or girl and and she's thrilled with her name Quinn then the next order was vie for Veronica and ah and we chose a saint Veronica\nA with a great story of Veronica are you telling a crisis face during these er during his walk to [noise]\nTo crucifixion and then uh and and I think we nailed it on those two names very unique very pretty no other corner Veronica in their lives everyone remembers and then for some reason we named my first son Christian\nWhich is a great name don't get me wrong and we're very happy with it but he's got like seven Christians in his class\nAnd and\nBut he's are Christian and that's the important thing but he has a little miserable about that what about you how much did you put it into this and they tell me your story and that in Fredericksburg your next step on WWE a

husband's name with my son\nOur son and then my daughter has a name that like in that but if it's Hannah it's a form of hand and then she got her grandmother's middle name and then my brother let me think about that his son which was really nice and I try to his name her first ...\nWith his son so he's kings Arthur when we have Samuel Arthur when we have ...\n... so now that's cool because you can you basically all of your kids can look at members of the family and know that they're connected in some way through their names to those people in their family because\nThey are important and I don't come come the old fashioned I like several calls like strongly um when I like claim that you can tell if it's a boy or girl\nI like those too in fact it was very it's funny when we when we chose Quinn a again we were very limited because it had to be with accused who was like Clinton way and for ... we just yeah I I agree with you but that frankly I'm not a huge fan of ... names are but for
