[noise]\nThe stories that have been breaking well you've been in Iraq these these delivery O'Connor's show\nWrites we have I just said somebody just tweeted at me on Twitter saying uh Larry O'Connor appears to be interviewing the whole damn White House today\nWe did we did we absolutely did except for a two main figures president of the vice president\nThat was because sadly of that story but it turned out to thankfully to be not true that there was an incendiary device on the grounds of the White House Secret Service took about twenty minutes of investigation thirty minutes of escape included but sadly that screwed up everybody's schedule but we talked about\nAnd your device on the grounds of the White House Secret Service took about twenty minutes of investigation thirty minutes of a bitch included but sadly that screwed up everybody's schedule but we talked to a hell of a lot of people you're can check 'em out off the counter show dot com secretary Ben Carson stricter gun or a cost to secretary Robert Wilkie Kellyanne Conway Mercedes swept up next\nWe're juniors own representative Barbara Comstock talk about what she had to do there and talk about race you got some news is she's breaking in this interview you want to hear it Barbara Comstock ... W A L leery about her show\nAnd then a law enforcement component to keep the drugs out whether it's people getting mail in drugs from China or drugs coming over the border\nAnd then also um [noise] my bill that's been incorporated into this package that's being science today is finding non opioid alternatives and making people more aware of those and one of the examples of that now for say you have a knee replacement surgery like my mom does then this year\nThey gave her aside and her knee because for the first three days she didn't need to take painkillers that all the ... and not the most difficult time post surgery she didn't have to take painkillers and then by the time she did she was able to take Tylenol you know ... or Tylenol\nAnd didn't never had to take a much of the opioids if at all I don't think she had to take any of them well and let let's talk\nAbout because I think there's a perception out there that you know people might have a medical problem it could be as minor as you know getting their wisdom tooth pulled and then they get hooked on these things\nAnd but then there is a criminal elements involved here because they make it hooked but the doctors don't continue prescribing so then they turn to to discriminate and you're right coming in from Mexico coming in from China this has been a real real problem for law enforcement agency about what are you doing to support them what have you done to be a Virginia well\nThat's what this bill has supported as one of the things that I've done is high intensity drug trafficking 'em\nMoney we've gotten increased every year that I've been in Congress I got\nMy entire entire part of my district designated as a high intensity drug trafficking area so then you can get more funding in that district for your law enforcement to battle it and I'm pleased to say we have had you know a reduction in the problem with with the problem in our area\nThat we know addiction itself so faces so many families in every income and you know every now and the graphic and so that's why you know and and and debts from addiction and from you know whether it's opioids or\nHeroin or now surpassing car accidents so that's why there's three hundred and sixty degree approach is so important and we appreciate this bipartisan legislation things aren't today we're speaking\nWith her it was Barbara Comstock of northern Virginia and it's interesting you know people think of your district in particular people moved to the rural parts in suburban parts of Fairfax County and loud and county because they want a quieter simpler you know a not a crime written urban existence and then you find out that there is the\nThis opioid problem in in a little sleepy community like Virginia town um and I say that in a nice way I Love it I\nUm was it surprising to you when you saw how prevalent it was in your district and you saw the very real human cost of this\nWell as prevalent whether it's inside the beltway or all the way out in Winchester where we've had challenges where they kind of come in\nYou know a baby one in drug trafficking so there's a great ... out in that area in the northern Shenandoah Valley has put together again in a three hundred and sixty degree approached the hospitals are social workers education law enforcement of Sarah and even our faith community has become a big part of it\nIn Winchester we have a pastor pastor Brad start at a church to really have the ultimate wraparound service for dealing with addict and that they could get them treatment and get them\nBut then also have that support system going forward because addiction as a chronic disease and so we need to treat it bring it out of the shadows how people know that we're going to have that support system for them\nTwo weeks from today you're going to know whether you continue is congresswoman from the time so strict or whether your opponent wins is very very hard fought raised but their Thrones so much money into\nCan you talk a little bit about how important it is to demonstrate today that wouldn't you agree with President Trump your partner with them and you're able to get things done important things for your opponent appears to me she's just a resistance member she's not going to work with the president even on something like that\nYes exactly you know I'm about results not resistance and my opponent actually is attacking me very results that we're here for today [laughter] you know you've seen that scorecard where they attack me for a voting with the president\nRight in the in the primary rich tax for not voting for\nActually well but what they don't tell you on the scorecard is eighty two percent let me repeat that eighty two percent of the bills on that score card or a bipartisan\nFour or five of those bills are dealing with the opioid crisis stick to the builder to cut your taxes which of course my opponent doesn't like but apparently she doesn't like dealing with the opioid crisis either\nSeven at the builder to keep the government open and fully funded are fully funding our military our veterans things like the opioid crisis and I ate should we search medical research eleven others\nOpened and fully funded are fully funding our military our veterans things like the opioid crisis and I aged research medical research eleven those bills or to deal with over regulation of our business is three of them were to deal with help from veterans I'm One of them was to stop school violence to act\nNow you haven't heard that on the door and they yeah Jerry Lyn I mean there are other bills that my opponent attacks me for supporting yeah and then another bell seems attacked me on\nIs a criminal gang remove a lack of criminal alien gang removal act Richard bipartisan which merely says if you're a gang member and my Thirteen year here in the country illegally we don't want you here you can't come in and the first place and we want to get you out [noise]\nOr members of the Hispanic caucus twelve eleven or twelve Democrats supported that bill my opponent opposes it so she is about resisting I Am about results I Will sit down and work with anybody of my party [laughter] I've been a leader an sexual harassment\nAnd on that bill battling you know sexual harassment anti sexual harassment bill we passed\nI worked with Jackie sphere one of the most members from California and Bradley Byrne one of the most conservative remember members Republican from Alabama that's how you get things done and I've also for the region gotten pay raises for federal employees are now in our\nBudget I've gotten that trip funding\nAnd my opponent who just wants to attack and resist isn't going to have the voice that I have\nTo fight on a bipartisan basis and during a Republican administration which we're certainly going to be for the next two years if you have a one party town which is what you will have\nIf I'm not in the seat we're going to become in our area more like Chicago and Baltimore and I don't think that would be good for Virginia and that's why I'm going to and I should tell you we're up right now in in our phones ever so narrowly it's a dead heat tied up by one or so\nBut we have always I'm One of these racist because they go out and we talk about results and the issues and we did invite your listeners to take a look at our website at Barbara Comstock for Congress dot com are going to win this for you and get results from Virginia ten and continue to do\nAll right we're going to we're going to hold it there because we add more to say to Barbara Comstock and she had more to say to us but you heard that she said that based on her latest internal poll she's up might be by one or two points but she's not up that far cry from what we're hearing\nFrom many of the media polls that say that she said no to the water ten points down they say that I'm telling you they'd been saying that every single time I've covered her\nIn these races I think the first race that I covered room was twenty fourteen if I remember right they always say that she's down and she ends up way but look I'm not saying that this was in the bag but she's not seeing some movement there are a very important race with Barbara Comstock in northern Virginia we continue our interview with her in a moment but let's go to ed Rodriguez
