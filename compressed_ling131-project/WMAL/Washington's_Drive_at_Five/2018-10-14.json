{"month": "10", "state": "DC", "station": "WMAL", "content": "Not used to losing like there used to the Republican just given it\nAnd and the question I had was what do you think would happen\nIt 'cause I don't know what's gonna happen I actually think this blue wave talk is is not true from what I'm seeing out here what do you think what happened to the Democrats in the media if instead of a blue wave if there was a red wave I mean what do you think actually what happened do you think they self destruct I mean what would the day after look\nI have been you know I think it's a good question because I myself have been thinking about that in terms of survival uh and safety because I think if the Democrats do not win the house and if you if you listen to scuttle but sounds like our bodies preparing for the Republicans to\nHold the Senate maybe even expanded air hold there but the conventional wisdom is that the Democrats are going to retake the house\nIn numbers we haven't seen and who knows how like since Nineteen Ninety four and I've been wondering what if what if all of this is just a bunch of ... media and and and polling unit manufactured\nJust like it was in two thousand sixteen they were not very many polls in two thousand sixteen that got even close to being right Rasmussen was one about away Rasmussen as trumpet fifty one percent approval the CNN approval number for Trump's forty one\nOr the ... the polling David the drive by trust shows them just ... even now after the Capitol hearing expanding\nThe blue wave\nMeanwhile do you know that the Republican candidate just as an aside here on the Republican candidate for governor of California is only six or seven points\nUh the show started out focusing on a bad guy who had little kittens in his basement in a cage and\nThey asked me you cops are running around trying to prove this guy is a reprimand of the first order and you\nKnow officer you know\nOur government money is separating the two parents that are born or and I am having them\nAnd the cops we fought everything whole wow we don't have a pervert here we have a hero this guy and I watch the said well that's it for the show the level of idiocy and stupidity and ignorance that just permeates\nPlaces in this country where it ought not be there people ought to be more educated more informed is smarter\nBut that's gone we have replaced\nInformed people educated people learn in people with asthma so load block candy idiots\n\nWere not separating and Trump never did separate families at the border that is actually Democrat Party policy it's related to families crossing the border illegally seeking asylum\nTrump in fact wrote an executive order to end it\nWhich was beaten back on the basis that it was unconstitutional lift the statute in America today says families will be separated\nAnd it's to protect the kids the reason for it the reason for the separation is the parents are shoveled off in the holding cells while their cases are adjudicated\nSo I'm watching this stupid show\nAnd I see a guy who any under normal season will be a pervert with a bunch of kids in cages in his basement converted into a quasar hero because he is rounding up kids that Trump separating from their parents and saving them\nSo I went to the DVR and I cancelled law and order and you're SUV I get rid of that ... been out\nThere long enough twenty some odd years anyway so and they're all dropping like flies they all feature stuff like this in it\nSo you really you think that two hundred and\nNine Republican House seats can be up for grabs be cause people all over this country are fed up with Trump and the Republicans separating families [laughter] [noise]\n\nWell [noise] uh\nThat wasn't explained to hundred night certainly assistance for a lot of Republican retirements ... yeah committee chairman are retiring cause their term limited\n\n[noise] forty three members are retiring some of them are committee chairmen and the reason they're quitting is because they don't want to go back to being average ordinary members when you're a committee chairman you got perks\nDoris ... committee chairman and the reason they're quitting is because they don't want to\nGo back to being average ordinary members when you're a committee chairman you got perks you got a ten chicken TV Time you know you matter but when your term limited out of your chairmanship when you quit and you're part of your time there and the big bucks in the private sector\nYou know there are some Republican retirements but there are two hundred nine of them but my my only\nPoint is for there to be this kind of blue wave forty four forty seven of retirements does not explain it not with the Democrats think they've got to hunt for nine seats leaning in their favor\n\nOr you don't think it's policy it will it there what people if this is all true there has to be something or a series of things\nThat the American public is just fit to be tied over and want to take it all out of Republicans as again the media to Democrats will tell you it's Trump the people whose country hate Trump they're embarrassed of Trump but that's what they think\nThe evidence that the country hates Trump to it isn't there in any even even if you look at the leftist opinion polls at forty one percent approval\nThat's not in the twenties where George W.
