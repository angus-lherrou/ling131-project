... is there he'll be sworn in later today he'll take to the bench on Tuesday and it is just such a wonderful wonderful moment for this country\nOr that in in in the face of the hate and the false accusations and and and and the the the ... the accusations without proof without corroboration how they tried to ruin this man's life and to an extent they have\nWill not allow the twins are coming out these were not witnesses nobody was there to see it in fact the people she said well they're all said no we weren't so when you say witnesses these would not I witnesses who could corroborate that it ever took place\n\nBrent I'm here to get what I did\nSo I mean I I mean there are no witnesses\nNow they were more than thirty people that came forward and it will reduce the calling the FBI tip line because no one at the FBI would take the call and interview them because based on multiple public reports\nUh McGahn at the White House ah refused permission of the FBI to interview them and I thought that was a disgrace so\nCollege they can agree\nBut no one should say there were no cooperating witnesses corroborating witnesses were not given an opportunity to talk to the committee\nThat know that you're not young they will not cooperating\nLike the like saying she told me about it is I Believe that witness point she\nShould have been given an opportunity and I emphasize I never said cabinet was guilty of anything and and I have the lowest opinion of Michael ... and I never even race that case in my column right okay\nUm but they should have been given the opportunity to talk to the Senate and to talk to the FBI and then we can all listened to what they said and we can all evaluated objectively well\nAgain uh the agreement that the Senate came to an delaying the vote to conduct an FBI investigation for delaying the vote for one week was that it would be based on the accusations that were already out there\nNow what what the president said not not that he's the most believable witness for what he believes is they should be allowed to investigate whatever they choose\nA it's not the role of the Senate if it's conducting an honest\nInvestigation or if it wants an honest investigation if not the role of eleven name Republicans on the Senate Judiciary committee\nTo tell the FBI how they should investigate it I think that if you could only investigate things that they aren't corroborating the whole investigation was a fraud and it should have been investigated what we saw today and I'm speaking on behalf of a lot of women\nWho who were raped who didn't report it who are fearful who were hurt who deserve better\nThat that it is unconscionable to not let thirty forty people who said that they had evidence\nTo have an opportunity to be interviewed by the FBI and interviewed by the committee I'm not giving a a a value Judgement on what they would have testified tear I'm saying to not listen to them was a scandal and an outrage well\nThat that's because they didn't have evidence\nAnd over again I don't know that they were saying that they're not they're not used as evidence and look is\nOn an FBI tip line they should have been hurt the women of America have a right to have their witnesses heard than the world\nWho have which Monday but\nTo say we won't listen to them and and for you or me to\nGet to ... to put a value or not on their testimony that they were not allowed to get this wrong let them say what they thought that they saw and they\nWorry about it is not right they said I don't remember these ... these in these witnesses\nNone of them claim to have been there none of them\nI predict we will find that out and there were reports that he's written contemporaneous notes does that sound familiar about what he was was not allowed to do at the FBI that's my\nOne who is not allowed and not allowed to do\nThe FBI was banned by the White House from interviewing major witnesses who wanted desperately to to be heard and to be\nAnd then you know what they're not then then they called them up\nI'm sure they'll talk to you\nI'm not the FBI I Know\nBut that's not the story\nThan Collins said there was no corroborating witnesses\nThere is no corroborating evidence you keep you keep the looting and and money and the issue\nI don't know and you don't know and Collins doesn't know whether that test\nYou keep the looting and muddy NBA issue\nOkay I don't know and you don't know and Collins doesn't know whether that testimony would it be exonerated or or being corroborating we don't know that\nBut it but and ... is the difference between you and and me and between Collins and me and between the White House and me is I think those witnesses have a right to be heard I think the women were disrespected or at a time when they had the two women Ramirez and forward\nWhen when they had major complaint with people who vouch for their integrity and honor and they were not heard and their witnesses were not hurt and the FBI investigation was only one\nSided where we're going to do and we're ... we're talking about the destiny of the hill and we're going around in circles on this um again if there's any witnesses out there\nYou could bet Ronan Farrow the Washington Post rent for Dallas ski or any number of publications or or cable TV stations will sign them and get their story but you know what\nThey've already talk to them and they may there's nothing there\nFBI that they would not permitted to interview people they thought they should've been able to interview\nThat the middle market where we're going we're going around and sell cars so let's let's move on to something else um and and that is when when the ... the the left but they're not going to let them know that\nThis is about women\nNo it's not about women it's by him out\nWomen yes it is they're all women listening to the show right now we know exactly what I'm saying because similar things have happened to them and they go through hard decisions about whether they want to come forward or whether the president of the United states is going to lie about 'em and ridicule um and it's something that made public that is\nAn ally to say what she could remember and couldn't remember he was just repeating her testimony\nShe was honest about what she couldn't remember he equally honest about what you remember the one hand on ... percent certainty\nRight but what what then she said she gave people saying witnesses\nNow they're going to get a lot more than that I had an off year where we say that a parrot on of the ... has to\nFight that's not an honest investigation that's\nNice to have a Nineteen ways for\nAncillary and they say she told me once you know that's a catch Twenty years ago or whatever that's not a witness who could corroborate a story\nA fair hearing\nIt's no here we didn't have a fair hearing she testified ... hours\nWell let me let me out beyond escape because I Know a woman who was raped violently by somewhat you know you don't go on television and say everything you know\nCompared to give you a good ... ... talk to the Federal Bureau of investigation that\nRun she put a plaza we've talked to the\nIn homes but according to Susan Collins\nWere wiped out in my opinion\nShe had the option to stay home and tell us to the investigators how do you like that ... like what how do you like the fact that according to Susan Collins across the board or ... or the concern was never killed that just by her\nThat she was also the opportunity to stay home I like\nTo hear the other side on any side of it he believes those women should have been denied the opportunity to have you ever see you're not answering my question can you can repeat the talking points given vices they caught him talking point it's a question that bottom line she doesn't treat sterilized invest I'm telling you\nTo the school and Collins did not tell\nShe had the option to stay home and do this in private\n\nHow do you feel about that I feel that the FBI could have been allowed them\nOkay I'm using them announcing her so we're talking around each other but listen I Hope that the Yankees
