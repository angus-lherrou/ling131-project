just need to figure out how to deal with it and I think for years years and years and years now it's been drilled into our heads that when our kids go to a high school party we got to make sure that we have that talk with them about drinking\nWe and and the most important thing that has been emphasized the U.S is we should just take for granted that there's going to be drinking just make sure
