of the gathering ... could you give us some context hear about this a Middle Eastern intrigued with turkey\nWith the Saudi family and also be before we even get into where we are today of ... the ... the palace intrigue there in Riyadh where there still is a power struggle is they're not about who is going to lead that very well to get them\nTo be there isn't the there and be asked my father who was the crown prince ... the head of state Saudi Arabia but she has been things things up quite literally in the kingdom for their loss yeah\nYeah but he has been picking things up a quite literally in the kingdom for the Los yeah put putting a lot of a lot of people were um unless the flu risk ties\nTo um the hottest around the world in two very luxurious house arrest or he is he's basically in control but the game isn't over yet how this individual because it has been caught in the middle of the geo political contacts between NBS\nPlenty other nation that we're supposed to dominate the Sunni world which is of course won the um the head of the Turkish state Turkish state that is three feet ... ... if I may not used to be the most successful secular nation\nOr in the ... the world's Stoltz member of NATO but things have gone south that recently on the line and this seems to have been caught in the middle but let's be very clear here it was a great article that are on the spectator lights on grass that you all the details Mr ... who may have been killed\nWas himself completely innocent individual I remember all the Muslim Brotherhood the my seventies no sign of democracy ... a great liberal mind but clearly opposed to stop the train these\nSuits you a political players because he was an American national or American resident\nResident usually Haley had resident resident resident alien and was working for a major publication Washington Post at our responsibility to investigate this reporter's badgering the president saying why don't you send the FBI to look into this what is our interest in us [noise]\nYeah I can I just respond to that by by raising a point that out good friend Chris ... late this morning isn't it surprising the mountains of column inches and increasing spilled\nWith regards to the up and moved to obey foreign nationals who had a green card occurring in a mother country compared to the three Americans who were killed in\n... the one of ... who was a U.S ambassador to the thing you learn all of a proportionality between these two events tells you a lot about the media gets it they don't you think it\nSure does and and yeah I heard Chris make that point to and and thank you for for raising it as well if I had done it I'd be copying him so yeah that was well beyond that I didn't know I guess you did\nOdd but but you're right I mean listen there is a huge amount of pressure and I guess I'm I'm not a obviously my heart goes out to the Kentucky family I don't know him I don't know the details it sounds like a horrific experience I don't understand why this is an American issue\nWith no it isn't but it's something that you can use to control the president with this is this is all part and parcel of all the press trying to cover up its tracks and trying to uh the flack from that over the lack of a\nBonus coverage of the Trump Administration I think they can't stand it when the president dip says\nRallies that everyone having spent too late and what does he do half way through he points at them and it says the look of fake news and the fact that they take it personally it instead of\nLooking at why or why they sequester the coverage all I don't know the Russians could lose him to lose him yeah why they have gas from Maine mainstream quote unquote cable channels\nThe core Kanye West ignorant ... grows because he likes the president's\nNo instead they're going to find beat the president over the head with the death of a foreign national in another\nCountry I did well that explains the media is a\nPressure on the president and and clearly I agree with you I mean they're just to corrupt institution at this point but what about Marco Rubio and Lindsey Graham who basically seem to have just concluded that this is the handiwork of of of the crown prince of Saudi Arabia and Lindsey Graham say he's got to go on it it is that\nHelpful rhetoric coming from the Republicans in the Senate\nAnd the unfortunate but I didn't I I don't like cats and Lindsey Graham I never thought I was you know say the the the word\nUm how is that Lindsey Graham has ... the man with a two and the Kavanaugh hearings which is which is what he did that was an incredible response to the mall to the truth of the Democratic senators on the Judiciary Committee but no senator you don't have the evidence\nOf who or that this is\nScience what Mike Pompeo is trying to get to the bottom while we're it's five Fifteen guys\nDiplomatic passports went to the concert apparently to interrogate and then to eventually motor cars salty okay that seems to me the circumstantial evidence we have right now but we need to have ...\n... to ... okay that seems to be the circumstantial evidence we have right now but\nWe
