Louie Gohmert who represents of a large\nPercentage of the majority of the population of\nTexas with his politics but then there's Joaquin Castro from the other side of the state in more ways than one

let you hear it from his own voice but right now I Will read you what he said\nHe uh implied actually didn't even imply he basically alleged\nThat I'm Yvette Jared Kushner the president's son in law and advisor in the White House\nA year in some way less I Know there has been a lot of discussion about this let me get to the point that I think is most disturbing the reporting that Jared Kushner may have with U.S intelligence delivered I hit list and enemies list to the crown prince\nMohammed bin salon although I I think he calls them NBS because everybody is like the ... the law and the city that you have to call them BS\nIn Saudi Arabia and the prince may have acted on that and one of the people he took action against his Mr ... shocking\nAnd poppy Harlow of all people as like the voice of reason puppy Harlow says or just\nTo be clear congressman we know I I Want to be clear we don't have any of that reporting I don't know where you're getting that from a\nAnd and the best part of that we have it now All right so ... he listened to the whole thing this this you know the house intelligence committee used to be like a revered position where you had people you know who were singing and serious and actually cared about the defense of our nation and now we've got Adam Schiff\nAs the ranking member for the Democrats and he certainly set the tone when you've got people like a Castro [noise] uh the following his lead listen\nI Know poppy that there's been a lot of discussion about it they'll be more discussion on CNN and all the other networks today let me get to the point that I think is most of the survey right now the reporting that Jared Kushner may have with U.S intelligence delivered a hit with an enemies list to the crown prince the NBA or Saudi Arabia\nAnd that the print then may have acted on that\nOne of the people that he took action against circus OJ getting cut and\nWe have I just find me clear from the or we do not have that reporting I'm not sure\nWhere you're getting there hadn't been reporting to that effect\nSoldier kit kit and they're not that we have I just wanted to be there for me or we do not have that reporting I'm not sure\nWhere you're getting there had been reporting to that effect\nNot according to that effect\nSure I Love the puppy Harlow the main focus here is to make sure that CNN and the clear\nHow ... how about we are hearing that congressman and by the way just because it's being reported for God's sakes or you are a congressman sitting on my house intelligence committee you're just gonna jump up here and make allegations because you're right it on a blog so Castro take ... to Twitter to clear things up is that\nJust to be clear I did not intend to accuse\nJared cushion or of orchestrating anything\nBased on press reporting I'm asking for Congress to open an investigation I loved that they do this now\nAmong report something and now a congressman in a place of authority and power and responsibility to be reported we've got to open an investigation no you really don't want to actually representative Castro and when he says I didn't intend to accuse you're accusing her\nOf orchestrating anything [noise] listen to his words again\nI Know probably that there's been a lot of discussion about it so I'll be more discussion on CNN and all the others that works today [noise] let me get to the point that I think is the most disturbing right now the reporting that Jared Kushner may have\nU.S intelligence delivered a kitten with an enemy is where the crown prince you\nDidn't in hand it's like saying why didn't intend to preclude words that I just hope I didn't intend to actually say what I Know what you said because you intended to say it and we know it's just that

[noise] rash of tree an accident specifically in Montgomery County although there was one down in DC uh about ten days ago and I thought I saw one in Alexandria is well we're in a car and acumen match\nAnd it did not end well for the human [noise] and\nAh did it quite a few in Montgomery County actually in the last two weeks so much so that elected officials are saying are pleading with the state to reduce the speed limit on Rockville pipe now [laughter]\nI don't know maybe the speeds Rockville ... on Rocco pike are artificially high I never noticed that I live right\nRockville pike and by the way a\n... the latest accident so horrible because it happened to this production rock\nOfficially Hi I've never noticed that I live right\nNear Rockville pike and by the way I'm\nThe latest accident the horrible accident happened it was put up here in Rockville pike happened during rush hour woman's last time you went anywhere near me wanted during rush hour on ... what it does beg a question\nThere have been an increase in ... an accident with automobiles recently here in the greater Washington area why do you think that is\nThis is the greatest innovation ever and so we all had our cell phones we had our mobile phones that we could have a conversation while driving our car or walking down the street and then suddenly texting became a thing\nAnd now nobody calls each other\nIf you're in the car and someone text you\nWhat are they thinking\nAnd instead of replying via text why don't you just hit the button\nLet the phone rang and have a conversation this is the weirdest weirdest and by the way I'm not holier than thou here I'm guilty of it myself I don't know why I Do it why do we prefer to text message rather than have a phone conversation\nAt age are are we looking to have a paper trail here we keep our keep our backsides covered I just I just want to throw it out there because I Do think the smart phones are part of the problem [noise]\nAnd I think I think in addition to that I don't understand this cultural shift that we've made were texting is preferable\nOr preferable to an actual voice voice conversation we've got the technology it's sitting there that if they're smart these phone companies will create a phone that only does text and Internet and there's no ... there's no phone capability I don't know if they'll save any money\nBut it does anyone using anymore do you have conversations on the phone\n[noise] uh how about Brian in Rockville a specific to this incident recently in Rockville on Rockville pipe but it is a larger question but go ahead Brian you're on W male [noise]\nYeah um I I think Larry I think that the problem is in the drivers or the tax day where they are calling on the phone but the actual people who are Jay walking across for I feel like I mean if you live in the area I mean especially that area hunger for it wrote I mean there's like ten different cross walks but people decide that they don't want to\nCross the cross walk across some random area and uh yeah there's no one there to enforce\nIt yeah and and that is a bit of an epidemic a specific to Rockville pike too I've noticed a lot of cross walking there are which is remarkable sensitive state wrote it did it is very busy what is it like you know four lanes going on\nIn either direction sometimes ah what do you think that is our people just lazy they don't wanna walk to the corner\n[noise] yeah I I I think ... and everyone's like so happy when they get like an open state I felt like that they they're just flying through it and then they don't have any doubt if these people are crossing and all this random areas yeah over there and I think I think it is late\nMay be and and it's funny uh Brian thanks for the call Brian or somebody earlier today said you know we don't emphasize this with our children enough anymore that they need to only cross the cross walk\nI remember as a kid that was a big deal when I was walking to school you got across Russia\nAnd then what's funny is and it and I'm the point of making it we need to start emphasizing that with our kids not because our kids are the problem but because when we emphasize things to our children parents and adult end up modeling for them so even if a parent or an adult would instinctively cross a J walk\nThey won't because they want to set a good example for their kids and that might that might help things out how about will in Virginia will your next up under the under why do we see this rash of pedestrian accidents will [noise]\nUm I agree um I was calling it about that Jay walking as well the health of selectivity or to force it's one of the legislatures I'm simply create a law and we are so let the police force or the law April ignore the law that we're living in a situation where there is just\nDisorder there is no\nPrimaries in it and as a as a driver anecdotally you're seeing more and more Jay walking going on than before\nThey walk
