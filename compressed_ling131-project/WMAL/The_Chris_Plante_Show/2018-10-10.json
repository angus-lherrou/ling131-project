uh just this one\nToo but the Democrats Kavanaugh's worth a lot is worth a lot more alive than dead\nA and a U.S resident and he writes things that are critical of the Saudi regime\nAnd uh and has been published and fits like the Washington Post and a and this guy went into the Saudi embassy in Istanbul beautiful Istanbul haven't been there you should go to a great city one of the great set of my best growing on vacation there a few years ago now\nAnd uh had a great time in his son both\nBut we weren't what it wanted by the Saudi Government and he went into the south Sudanese embassy in Istanbul and never came out\nAs like a like a Roach Motel that uh that fact and he went in and they never came out and it turns out that the the hypothesis is the theory is that the Saudis sent in a team of Fifteen men\nTo take out this journalist can show you know and he's disappeared and nobody knows where he is\nAnd one this one group says oh they jumped him up into pieces and took them out in separate suitcases something like that like it's a they don't wanna Alfred Hitchcock movie\nBut one way or the other guy has been disappeared just like the head of Interpol who was apparently grabbed by the Chinese 'cause their economies and the you know that's that's how companies have its other companies have always behave\nAnd they'll throw them in a gulag or or just kill 'em or something ... the bill for the bullet to his family which the Chinese do the Chinese when they execute you and they exclude a lot of people they send the family the bill for the bullets that they used to kill you and you better pay it\nBecause they mean business right but the Washington Post their leader trail today actually blames Donald Trump for the Saudis snatching this guy in the Saudi embassy in Istanbul\nBecause they say that Donald Trump set the tone and now we have this big um and encourage them or something and it's just they're they have mental illness I don't know how they got all these people with mental illness into one business\n[laughter] and into one party but there's a lot of mental illness on the left and it's on parade boy is it on parade\n[noise] yeah so they're blaming they're blaming the Washington Post blaming President Trump for the disappearance of this journalist ...\nBecause they believe that the Saudis grabbed the guy and bad things happened and uh and it must be Donald Trump's fault\nAnd speaking of hurricane Michael which is a horror show racing toward the panhandle of Florida Michael pierce is kind of proud he's got these headlines with hurricane his mom sending them test text messages asking them to not be too destructive and things like that [noise]\nAh but I assume there'll be blaming Donald Trump for hurricane Michael because they've blamed Donald Trump for past hurricanes so they've got it's amazing how powerful they think politicians are\nThey think that rock Obama can slow the rise of the oceans and that the healing of the planet we'll begin because he was elected the news media believed that they they sold that message for the Democrats and now they're selling the message that Donald Trump is responsible for hurricanes say\nBut Democrats affect the weather in the oceans positively and Republicans affect the weather in the oceans negatively that as a sign of mental illness that is truly a sign of I I'm not a a clinical psychologist or psychiatrist by any stretch of the imagination [noise]\nBut that's a sign of mental illness you don't have to be I mean that's you're crazy you're not you're cook here a fringe case\nThat's that's crazy stuff and and let me also say a lot of this stuff are hearing from the news media and the and the Democrats just a few years ago what is mainstream now just a few years ago would have considered to be that would have been considered to be\nFringe extremism the rhetoric of the left the get in their face the dead or alive all this stuff they these people are\nThese people are a medicine it's not as though there is no violence that's going but that there's lots of violence that's going on whether Brooke Baldwin is aware of it or not I mean I understand

Democrat gubernatorial nominee Ben Jealous accused governor Larry Hogan of bullying which is a term that I think should be reserved for grammar school I think it's a grammar school term\nBullying him with the release of a new campaign video that mocks him for several gaps they say gas they call 'em guess including one where he said he's running for governor of Virginia\nWhich in case you're a

does they they just showed clips of him making a fool of themselves and then they've got a funny graphic at the end where it says Ben Jealous for president and they cross out president and then they write a Virginia\n[laughter] because they're mocking him now this is not allowed because he's a Democrat and now he's being bullied and guess what he's got a victim thing to fall back on he's got a

imagination\nThe news media is doing everything they can to uh you know help the Democratic party the midterms are coming up and Hillary says there will be no civility unless the Democrats win and if they lose and I think the funniest thing in the world I think they're going to win the Senate I don't think there's any chance that they are going to win the Senate\nThat that Nate Silver number cruncher guy said that the Democrats now have a one in five chance of winning the Senate back\nA few weeks ago before Brett Kavanaugh they had a one in three chance of winning the Senate back that's not forward progress for the mob I think we should just call them the mob is called the ...\nThe mafia is more civil than the Democratic party I don't think there's any doubt about that the Democrats\nEliot kill more people I think the left us in any case let's get on to the today show the today show has an employee who is a hardcore Democrat whose name is Jacob sober off I brought him they're bringing in Soviet Bolshevik snow\nThe today show sent Jacobs sober off to UC Irvine the University of California at Irvine\nAnd he's an idiot than it does it like a does it like it's an Internet thing he walks up on a long line of college kids sitting along a a low wall and the high wall sitting there all sitting and they're texting and they're looking at their phones and their zombies and they're waiting for a bus\nSitting along a a low wall or need high wall sitting there all sitting and they're texting and they're looking at their phones and their zombies and they're waiting for a bus or for whatever reason and Jacob\nGoes up to them and starts talking about who you're going to vote for on election day ... aren't you are going to get out for the Democrats because the Democrats really need you I'm a Democrat NBC is Democrat and we want your kids to go out and vote for the Democrats on election day it uh he he starts slow and then build ...\nPlus ... think twenty five thousand years ago to school here and the Democrats and get all of them to vote for them\nTo be in trouble in the district but if a Democrat I don't get all of them to vote not to be annoying but\nWe're with NBC News and I'm just trying to think that anybody you're going to vote Democrat ...\nFor Republican ... if they all came out and voted for the Republican he's going to vote [noise]\nThey don't care anybody going to vote in a congressional election in November\nThey're all stone what do you I mean what are you talking about it's UC Irvine up some money\nThey're sitting at a bus stop that they all have apes there there are sitting there doing oil rich uh and and also he's he he's pressuring them come on don't you guys aren't you really concerned about but it'd be ever expanding Russia probe that has been inserted into America's um body politic\nUh and and I know they really don't\nIf you were going to vote one what is the thing is going to get your vote\nYou're not talking about the issues that\nPeople talk about in the news all the time the Russia investigation and the court you don't watch that stuff\nI don't watch their shaking their heads are looking at um like what I'm worried about paying my bills to city expensive school what she was really saying is I'm\nIn a money issue is what they used to go pocket book issues that uh their self interested in in their own financial straights them you know the Republicans and Donald Trump credit a booming economy where they might actually get a job at something other than a stinking Democrat non profit\nUh destroying civilization or when they got out of college they might get a real job now Jacob the Democrat or who well if you get out if you all get out and vote for the Democrats will be really bad for the Republican now he doesn't walk up and say if you vote for the Republicans because\nNBC News is completely corrupt to the very marrow of their bone corrupt\nHe walks up to two Asian students Asian students at uh UC college I Can't I Can't believe that and I said and and they're like why don't you care to come on don't you want to be a Democrat like me and the people that would be seeing support our party and vote for Democrats because we're Democrats ...\nGoing to be the first election\nYou could decide whether or not the house representing democratic or Republican control [noise] are you thinking about what\nAbout currently maybe if I Want I'm like and formed about like what's going on and on all day I assume that\nThe people voting have at least some idea of who they are even if I\nWere like the most reliable they're never going to make nice to like\nWell that's what the Democrats why [laughter] can't count on you that necessarily\nWell that's what the Democrats why is this a DNC video well that's what the Democrats want they want to get you out to vote for them to everybody in college drugs Democrat um that it's the you know place this is the it's the narrative isn't it\nBut he's just completely out of the closet as it were\nAs an advocate for the Democratic party then ... goes and jumps I guess they have a little subway ... Twain somewhere in Los Angeles and I'm sober I went and got on the subway train and there were a couple of older women sitting on the train and he started plugging them with his BS\nTo watch the news all you hear about is Brett Kavanaugh right the guy who was\nLike what gory I found that that bond hearing about bad about Kevin Marie I'm being out here to find Kevin I can you think that that's what you're going to be thinking about when you go into the polling booth on election day now now now\nWhat are the things you'd rather be thinking about\nTraffic and pollution traffic to a certain number one issue ... Jacobs a little befuddled by all of this because he's trying to get the Democrat voted out he's a\nI might be an illegal in kind contribution by the news media to the Democratic party then perhaps NBC should\nHave the FCC take a look at their licensing because there are certain requirements for FCC licenses in order to use the public airwaves for your Democrat Party propaganda\nI'm pretty good number five or six number six ... number five is Trump to oh that's a oh yeah okay yeah you're right\n[noise] um\nWell that's kind of fun too though\nThat's actually do number five because President Trump was a lot of fun yesterday and uh he's asked about um\nYeah well that's kind of fun too though it's actually do number five because President Trump was a lot of fun yesterday and uh he was asked about um Hillary and uh and uh this Hillary says there will be no civility and um and isn't Kavanaugh terrible person Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton and her lack of civility ...\nWhat's your response to Hillary Clinton saying last night's swearing in a judge Kavanaugh was more political event that it was a national\nI guess that's why she lost\nShe doesn't get it [laughter] she never did it I knew that a long time ago [noise] Hillary never got it [noise]\nThat's why she lost [noise] anything else\nThat's like anything else see ya Bye bye see ya bye what's actually jump to number seven let's jump to number seven\nNow the president talked about what a great week it was just start you know what you are right let's do number six I Know you like number six we'll go to number President Trump speaking to a rally a ... who's the stick from American Americans in Iowa way", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Chris Plante Show", "city": "Washington", "day": "10"}
