John Brennan's name on the package sent to CNN attention John Brennan only problem is John Brennan doesn't work for CNN and he works for MSNBC and for NBC\nSo emailed it to the wrong network so that's all right misspelling dumb point sending to John Brennan at CNN where he doesn't work dumb point misspelling that'd be was a man ships name ... miss melt misspelled ships and a misspelled shields and he also misspelled Florida\nNow they packing\nTags are printed on computer paper they're not handwritten they're printed on computer paper and it seems to me that if you're riding on your computer or your your packaging slip your mailing slip\nAnd you wrote Florida or your computer with red flag that for you and say you misspelled Florida put a red ... lying under it or try to auto correct it or something because you've obviously just misspelled Florida now who is dumb enough to misspell Florida and then I'd miss and then ignore the the uh the computer checking it for you\n... that seems to me that's a red flag and that suggests to me\nThat somebody has deliberately misspelling words now if you're deliberately misspelling words then you're probably not the right wing Unabomber are living in a mountain somewhere in a shed\nYou're probably a left wing or who has complete contempt for your fellow Americans and for Trump voters because you watch MSNBC and CNN and you know that you're smarter than all the Trump voters and they're going to misspell everything they're going to misspell not only Brennan and ... they're going to misspelled Florida\nAnd what kind of a you know hillbilly robe what what what kind of stamps were day by day by those American flags stamps even when you're delivering bike courier you put the stamps on with the American flags that's another red\nFlag that's another clue I it it it looks like a document the clock boys bomb and uh and and that's a ... you know it's not really a ... how's it going to detonate it looks like it's not a serious thing\nThat's another clue now does that tell you that it's a lefty maybe it does it and maybe it doesn't and and that's the truth maybe it does and maybe it doesn't\nAll of this good man that you got a really\nRight wing guy who can't spell shelves can't spell Brennan\nCan't spell Florida doesn't know how to use this computer\nBut was able to buy all these pieces assembled them make them look good you know the police are looking out who's buying the PVC tubing and\nWho's buying these digital clocks in bulk that got ten or cheaper by the does on the Internet or something like that they've got video of a career delivering at CNN and there's lots of video cameras there are lots of video cameras around Manhattan so you can follow him out of the CNN Center\nA giant building and Columbus Circle and and the whole neighborhood is going to have lots more cameras where you can follow this person around and you can get a lot some clothes there\nI Want to know where I met as where's that at the clock but but here's the New York post and I just read from the the New York times\nThat uh they said that they talked about and experts who said this doesn't look like a real bomb\nAnd it looks like it's not designed to actually go off it looks like a movie bomb the clock is stupid that's awesome meds radio shack bomb and all of that but here's the New York post with more talking about the device that went to George Soros says house which was apparently delivered by career also\nAnd I can assure you be billionaire George Soros he said you know that he's a philanthropist he's ... he's a money market manipulator and I became very very well paying has been messing with the United states and our principles ever since and the Democrats love them for it\nAnd the media too but I repeat myself his was apparently also delivered by courier I think there are going to be lots of cameras around the the billionaire George Soros as property don't you think I think in ...\nAlso delivered by courier I think there are going to be lots of cameras around the billionaire George Soros as property don't you think I think and so the police are going to be all over this the FBI NYPD as first rate counterterrorism operations\nAnd the FBI secret services involved come on CIA is involved it's everybody's involved\n[noise] and the New York post reports today that a source briefed on the device at cirrhosis house and the one cent to CNN told the New York post on Wednesday that's yesterday\nThat they couldn't actually have blown up the devices and this is what I'm reading right here that they couldn't actually have blown up because neither was quick to where they blasting cap or other means of detonating explosive material\nThe source said there was nothing to ignite there was nothing there\nNow if these are not real explosive devices but only half baked explosive devices\nThen they're virtually identical to the castor bean attacks the pseudo rice that attacks we had [noise] and it wasn't just there was you know this guy was charged a week ago\nBut we had these rice in attacks early against all of these government officials CIA director FBI Director secretary of defense or chief naval operations turns out the guy was a navy veteran he's got to be for the navy but he's a Democrat he hates Trump one was sent to the uh the White House center Trump\nAnd um and they caught the guy that is good\nBut it was just after and that was early October earlier this month\nThen at the time of the Brett Kavanaugh vote there was another terrorist attack by left days\nWith white powder and envelope sent to the home of Susan Collins Senator Susan Collins of Maine and also to Senator Ted Cruz\nNow the news media doesn't care about any of these things that I brush them off and they say well the the powder was a nurse so it's not a big deal well the black powder here is effectively a ... because there's no way to detonate\nAnd uh that's that's important these are important clues\nAt the scene of the crime\nAnd I expect I certainly hope that we catch this will be real soon either way I don't care what his politics are I Want I'm caught anyway but just reading the tea leaves there are a lot of\nUh peculiarities they're a lot of\nStrange little items here who's ... is the guy really so dumb that he misspelled okay you misspelled Brennan a B. R. E. N. A. and instead of at NASA you misspell she'll she'll leave off the the seat in ... and then you misspelled Florida\nAnd you don't catch that and you're so smart that you're out buying these parts in your building the thing and you're on the Internet\nYou know looking at al ... a website to build a bomb in the kitchen of your mom and you build these devices and you get the clocks and you're now you're saying you're and you're wearing rubber gloves and you know finger bend you're so smart now you're doing this the pretty advanced stuff right and you misspell Florida and you misspelled Brennan and you misspell shelter\nAnd use the giant American flag\nUm things now now my friend Danny I talked to my friend any last night\nAnd here's his favorite clue at the scene of the crime\nThat leads him to believe that it's a Bernie Sanders fan the return address on all of the packages is to Debbie Wasserman Schultz in Florida she didn't get one male tour of Eric Holder was involved in this\nShe didn't get one male to her but or should they be rejected for delivery to their actual destination the return address was Debbie was mentioning is now who despises for if you're like hey right wing not living in a cabin in the ... year the right wing Unabomber\nDemi was a mention it hasn't been on the radar for a long time where she's irrelevant she's not she hadn't been on television and months she might be having her makeup read tattooed on or something she's she's been out of the bill limelight for months now\nSo you can't have what you don't see unless of course\nYou're a huge Bernie Sanders fan and you still bitterly resents\nDebbie ... for stealing the nomination from Bernie Sanders to give it to Hillary Clinton who hates Debbie Wasserman Schultz right now\nSome right wing Unabomber living on a mountainside in a cabin or being bitter to Bernie Sanders supporters who feel that they're being robbed them of the nomination\nWho hates Debbie Wasserman I I mean if you're out there you know Republicans here W's name and and sort of go there you know but that's about it because she's she hadn't been a part of the discussion for ages now\nAnd she was replaced when it was found she was cheating and lying and stealing for Hillary and uh and and I don't think Republicans are all burned up over that'd be ... but I couldn't tell you that Bernie Sanders supporters are so\nNow if you're just pursue that line of thinking for a moment of frothy hate filled angry Bernie Sanders supporter is lashing out and and\nSo now if you're just pursue that line of thinking for a moment of frothy hate filled angry Bernie Sanders supporter is lashing out and and I don't like the false uh do you know that phrase I Try to not use canned need Washington phrases\nBut this might be one of those or it might be a fake\nA right winger our guy trying to pose as a wreck ringer and he thinks there are so stupid he deliberately misspelled the names he thinks they have a flag on them at all times so he gets the big flag I'm a stamps and in the end the big joke is that a Debbie was mentioned it gets all of the buildings that are rejected ha ha that's funny\nIt was a false alarm bell say never mind crisis averted and then they'll get back dating Trump on something else but they will act as though when they learned that it's a left if they learn that it's a lefty\nThere will act as though it's not one non story now it's not a terrorist attack now it's nothing now ... you know I I don't want to use the false flag thing but that they won't ... view it that way they will just say that\nNow it's a non story now it's not what we thought it was now it's not really a terrorist attack\nIt was just a scare and they'll start using different words to describe it again in the New York times and the New York post not on the same page generally saying based on sources that these devices don't look like they could be detonated under any circumstances that's close to\nTell you what I

directly to the American people taking them to silence let's not get lost in who is responsible for this heinous act is the person who made and that leads to package it\nThe president also took aim at

can't look better to have ... blasting cats don't have the electronic detonation don't have remote detonation don't have been a radio frequency ... nation or a cell phone detonation don't have any of this stuff none of it so they can't be blown up so they were never designed to blow up\nSo in reality they're kind of fake bombs it based on what the New York times is saying and what the New York post is saying you combine those two stories and you see that you've got bombs that\nWon't blow up what's a bomb that won't blow up it's a paper weight right [noise] and\nThe news media is hysterical but uh you know if I had brought this to school they be defending I said well there is no detonator oh sure there's some black powder but it's an honor to can't blow up so it's just like the white

we are\nSix actually run his but uh we heard the Democrats the Sunday say this isn't the country or but only when they're pointing the finger at other people and somebody clever last night tweet it out but Democrats have two messages today\nThe first is we need more civility in our political discourse the second is these pipe bombs are all Trump's fault and that's it those were there to measure does yesterday because\nThey're caught ... clown a ship it Critz speaking of climate of hypocrites here's the very sweaty Philippe Reines\nWho is a a water boy for Hillary Diane running Clinton he has no qualms about spreading untruths whatsoever none whatsoever\nIf you look at who they've targeted so far yeah it's almost like they're following Donald Trump's Twitter feed and starting with Debbie Wasserman Schultz not everyone had that kind of security and you have to be really concerned that while everything so far have not heard anyone that might not hold\nYeah that might not home yeah well I you know all the talk of civility and all of this great civility is tough I I think I remember Hillary Clinton talking about civility quite recently\nYou cannot be typical with a political party that wants to destroy\nWhat you stand for no that's right a bronco bomber was president of the United states um you know he doesn't have all the facts but he knew that the police acted stupidly and of

it's causing the problem there and then there's ... send you remember hands up don't shoot [noise]\nCharges they're okay with all of that [noise]\nTo John Brennan number thirty [noise]\nThat's that's just normal Democratic Party violence and the news media as turned a blind eye to it for years they don't care about\nUh Republicans or conservatives being assaulted and battered and spat upon like Lindsey Graham and women in the Trump Jersey a they don't care about the video of a Bob Kramer explaining how they train people and hire people wouldn't pay people to disrupt trumped events Trump events they just don't\nThey just don't report that and and in the end they're not even aware of it themselves because they don't ever see anywhere at the news sources that they that they watch John Brennan\nIs a pothole of a man and he was brought to Obama's Communist Party supporting CIA director is an amazing and by the way the real CIA director received one of these packets with white powder earlier this month but the news media doesn't care about that\nIt's all Trump too often has one site has some of these feelings of anger violent\nWhen he points to acts of violence or also talked about [noise]\nYou know a swinging as somebody uh some of the press the media\nAren't you the guy that um that um has accused President Trump of treason and a sell this crazy stuff you know I this this guy Brennan has been out there oh it's trees that have the one of the dance on the head of opinion about the difference between the word treason in treason a season nuts\nThat I said it was nothing short of trees and I\nDidn't mean that he committed treason admitted he committed was turned I'm literally short of trees that he didn't mean that he committed trees enough friction there's nothing short of trees that with the term that he is yeah that's that if we if we diagram a sentence nothing started changing that means that street and words\nWords have meetings and this is the Brennan who's out there saying he's guilty of trees and then all of this other insane stuff\nYou know and and then he wants to make sure everybody else about the rhetoric of Donald Trump\nWhen the left these mowed down a Congressman Steve ... said ... the other Republican members of the house and Senate running police officers right I think what five people were shot that day police officers had to shoot him to death well it's going to number six team\nThe these these guys she's there just amazing a Wolf Blitzer\nTake a look at those targeted George ...
