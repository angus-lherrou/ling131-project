don't have a conviction here we don't know with a hundred percent certainty oh it looks extremely likely that this Fifteen man team went in there and killed him\n... that looks extremely likely there is no body it appears there's there are reports any way that they used acid\nOr you know hold so they called in the wool fake called and Harvey ... tell and they created the acid bad thing to do away with the ah the parts and there's a story also that the Saudis the team recorded it\nWhich would be pretty gruesome too but perhaps to show to whoever it is that send to them\nTo be satisfied it reminds me of one of the attempts to assassinate Adolf Hitler or one of the unfortunately unsuccessful attempt to assassinate Adolf Hitler the the the ... the conspiratorial were rounded up\nAnd they were executed as you might expect some were allowed to commit suicide in certain cases\nThey executed the number of the conspirators\nAnd Adolf Hitler couldn't be present for at least a couple of the executions\nSo they filmed the executions for him so that he could see them later at least a couple where they hang up a Hitler's enemies with piano wire and Hitler wanted to watch the films of this so is print psalm on the the uh the culprit here behind the curtain\nQuite possibly and perhaps quite probably\nThat said there's a lot of Palestine trigger round there these days you know he turned the Ritz hotel in Riyadh into a prison and through a bunch of his cousins in to a luxury sweets or that they were not allowed to leave they could get room service\nUh but uh you know it was in Saudi

were very critical and it's possible that the prince drunk with his own power decided that this was the best course of action wouldn't surprise me at all\nHuh yeah but it wouldn't surprise me at all if there was some nefarious behind the scenes effort to destroy the prince in Saudi Arabia by whatever means necessary\nSo I just wouldn't go round counting all your chickens and leaping to conclusions as to whether a the crown prince is behind us not to defend the crown prince by any stretch of the imagination as just that you don't have all the facts yet and leaping to conclusions when

turns out they're very easily distracted I got some advice for the news media who keep complaining about the president distracting them\nBeing so easily distracted the matter with you people what are your cats playing with a ball of yarn when Joe Biden walks into the room with a pencil laser and starts making your chase it around but\nWhat's the matter with your people if you're so easily

much like the Saudis had this guy killed because he was a thorn in their side it looks very much like the news media not surprisingly and legitimately\nIs rising up and the United states and around the world to say hey we can't have government so fascinating and butchering reporters even though he's not he has to be a reporter was some Arab News outlets where they didn't really\nHave a great deal of interest in publishing but ground truth but who are we to a judge their culture and compare their culture to our culture their culture is just as legitimate as ours is this is what the left has been telling us for many decades now for many many decades [noise]\nAnd and that's a the ... of course until it's not and and that's standard protocol with these guys because that's the way that they are\nSo the news media's pushing the president over Iraq and say well we know what happened the news media always knows what happened they they know that with Brett Kavanaugh he gave those girls quite loads and Nineteen eighty something and then they stood outside the door waiting in line for gang rape pulling the train on teenage girls\nA with braces and thick glasses because that's what happened in the news media said that's what happened here it is this is Mrs it and uh you know so these are not the best people to put in charge of judging whether something passes muster whether the facts have come together or not\nBut they want the president to overreact and it looks like the president is actually\nStruck a pretty good balance the news media doesn't approve but\nThey don't approve of the sun coming up in the age of Donald Trump and the White House so\nI wouldn't worry about that too much but I'll get to the news media people and some of the commentary on this because it's pretty crazy pretty crazy\nHey if you or someone that you know gets leg cramps or foot cramps you know how painful and disruptive they can be muscle cramps can jump shot of a sound asleep and the middle of the night or interrupt your daily life\nWell listen carefully because I recently learned about\nSarah works relief terror works release was a non greasy phone that's proven to relieve muscle cramps fast and reduce muscle ...\nPlus where the daily use their works relief can even prevent muscle cramps before they start so you can get a full night's sleep or do the things that you like to do without worrying about it\nWorks really only takes a couple of minutes to apply absorbs quickly and it works people love the results\nYou've probably seen doctor drew Pinsky on TV talking about Sarah
