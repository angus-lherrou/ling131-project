M. A. L. more Washington comes to talk\n[noise]\nThis is a wise investors show I'm Alive investor network\n... shows Simon Hamilton here so I started reading articles and maybe you have as well talking about stocks as a leading economic indicator that this sell off his poor tending an economic decline [noise]\nIs that true what does the stock market say about the odds of recession this is important because I continue to argue that we won't get an actual bear market protracted extended decline unless we actually start to see signs of an economic contraction\nBend Carlson has caught it on the show a number of times up at ... Asset Management New York wrote a really good pace on this entitled can the stock market predict the next recession he had some really good data\nMean the old joke is that the stock market has predicted nine out of the last five recessions [laughter] investors assume that stocks are forward looking so we'll look to the sort of tea leaves in the market to for clues as to what may happen you know in the economy okay that makes sense\nBut historically speaking if you actually look at the data the stock market has not gotten the head of many recessions so Carlson looked at the performance of the S. and P. five hundred using the returns three six and twelve months prior to distorted every recession\nGoing all the way back to the late Nineteen twenties and what he found is that\nThe lead up to march of two thousand one no one the tech bubble collapsed was really the only meaningful correction that occurred before the onset of a recession and that was really because of the dot com crash which preceded the recession\nBy about a year so that was sort of a a one off type of event most\nOf the other numbers look pretty run of the mill and not out of the ordinary so by Carlson calculations yes and the five hundred has had twenty Baron markets defined as a twenty percent drawdown or more at about twenty seven corrections somewhere in that tend to twenty percent drawdown since\nBerra markets defined as a twenty percent drawdown or more at about twenty seven corrections somewhere in that tend to twenty percent drawdown since Nineteen twenty eight of those forty odd those forty seven double digits sell offs\nThirty one of them occurred outside of a recession and didn't happen in the lead up to a recession means basically two thirds of the time the market has experienced a double digit draw down with no recession as a as a primary calls\nSo we will have a recession at some point but the odds are based on what Carl saying Carlson is saying and other data that I've read\nIs that the stock market will not tip us off at a time in fact most of the time we don't even realize we're in a recession till after it's already been done the recession that began in March of two thousand one wasn't officially caught a recession until I think November of that year\nSame thing or you know if you look at the Nineteen Ninety One Ninety One a recession and the Nineteen eighty one eighty two recession\nI think it's possible that the stock market freaks out from time to time because there are so many other variables that move the markets outside of the economy I mean\nJust since the market bottomed in early two thousand nine which was sort of the last economic recession in this country we've seen corrections of sixteen percent Nineteen point four percent top point four percent Thirteen point three percent and ten point two percent and he has some ... five hundred and that's not including what's happened over the course of the last few weeks\nSo again the only reason I mentioned this is don't necessarily assume that what's going on today is some harbinger of a much worse environment over the course of the next year or two and by the way if you do look at the health of the business cycle I read something from Credit Suisse they always do some good research\nThey have a number of like we do here at the wives and best of group they have some economic sign posts if you will that they watch\nFor when looked at in aggregate a sort of give them a a signal or at least a clue as to what I think the likely trajectory of a is of the business cycle and the economy in general yield curve inflation trends job creation credit performance manufacturing strength earnings quality housing market\nIf you go back to other pre recessionary periods\nA lot of those were flashing yellow if not read so for example in December of two thousand seven right before the credit crisis all those I just mentioned we're sending\nA negative signals with the exception of job creation which was sort of mixed\nWhat do we have in in in the present\nYou'll curves do positively slipped job creation still expanding credit performances been fine we haven't seen a lot of evidence of credit stress\nManufacturing strength has been high we just saw some data this week that was still expansion airy burnings quality Barry good housing market they they list as positive I Would say that's a little bit mixed we are starting to see some more sluggish home sales data and inflation trends are somewhat mixed\nSo two out of seven factors slightly mixed five still pretty bullish things can change and things can change quickly but I'm not seeing any imminent sign of an economic collapse so maybe we should see this sell off for what it is painful and violence that maybe not necessarily predict of\nPot next door a transitional but away from talking about stocks talk briefly about what's going on in the bonds Mart or the bond market more importantly how you should think of bonds from sort of a long term perspective\nYou listening to the boy he's invested show sound advice about your personal financial situation coal eight six six seven five eight

N. ten year treasuries were negative in the same year\nSo when you read headlines about the carnage in the bond market I think it's very important to put those losses in perspective from an ... an overall portfolio perspective\nOkay ... bond short term bond losses a nominal bond losses are nowhere near what you've seen from short term stock losses but we've all lived through\nBut what about when you look at things over a longer period of time\nSo I wrote a piece from Michael bat Nick who's also offer ... management I Want to give these guys credit 'cause they put out a lot of great content that I always borrow from but I always want to make sure I give them credit he looked at um the long term returns for bonds relative to inflation\nOkay uh what they call real returns\nSo he looked at data going back to Nineteen twenty six and found that the worst real bear market for stocks the worst stock market performance relative to inflation was minus fifty four percent\nLasted eight and a half years and the peak to break even length was about twelve point seven years and that was September of two thousand three May of two thousand Thirteen\nThat was even worse than what happened during the great depression but get this five year treasuries the worst real bear market again that means relative to inflation\nWas minus forty three point seven percent pretty close [noise] lasted forty years\nTake to break even as was forty five years since the period for November of Nineteen forty through September of Nineteen eighty one if you want to look at long term treasuries thirty year treasuries\nTwo thirds or to third loss sixty seven percent drawdown relative to inflation also lasting about forty years\nThat's unbelievable now keep in mind nominal returns before in ... and counting accounting for inflation are actually pretty good for bonds during those real barriers\nOver forty five and fifty a year real Baron markets a five year treasuries and long term bonds actually returned it in the mid for is on an annual basis has still not you know that's not too bad but doesn't matter much you have to factor in inflation if you're a long term investor\nCutting bill Bernstein wrote a book called deep risk and he classified as these risks of ... in a very similar to fashion to what I said about underestimating an over Mitt estimating he defined it in terms of shallow in deep ...\nIn a very similar to fashion to what I said about underestimating it over ... estimating he defined it in terms of shallow in deep I'll quote\nRisk then comes in two flavors shallow risk a loss of real capital that recovers relatively quickly say within several years I like you'd see was stocks and deep risk a permanent loss of real capital relative to inflation\nI'm Still recording put into different world and into into different words shallow risk if handled properly deprives view deprives you only have some sleep for a while deep risk deprives you of substance not being able to meet the goals of your financial planning a big difference\nBrutal stock crashes are ugly they hurt but they ... the band aid off quickly\nThe worst kind of beer market is the one that that doesn't show up on your initial statements and the one that it's the one that's slowly drains your purchasing power over time [noise]\nSo what does it mean to me it means you need to have some balance\nYou need bonds and your portfolio to help you in times of short short term stock market drawdown because bond market draw downs generally aren't going to be anywhere near as severe they can help buffer risk but over the long haul\nIf you have a long term horizon and I know some of you listening not you know don't have long term horizons you might be retired and not that worried about what happens ten Fifteen Years and I get that but over the long haul for a lot of you or you're passing money on to your kids are grandkids\nI think you have to have more money in stocks than you do in bonds stocks to a heck of a lot better in the face of inflation\nAnd it's not even close so just want to give you loved her perspective and this is why we diversify folks this is why we liked to have portfolio balance and stop the only reason but it is a major reason\nPart but transition a little bit from the general to the specific of course it's been third quarter earnings report in season as I said in the first half hour\nSpin a bit of a bloodbath and just because you come out with good numbers does not mean that the stock price is going to be rewarded in the short term so it's a very important\nThat you understand what's going on with the business behind the stock price we've had some really good companies some stocks that we really like in some stock so we own down literally five ten Fifteen Percent the last couple of weeks on earnings\nI Know you don't like it when you look at your portfolio\nBut doesn't necessarily bother us if we have a multi year perspective on what's going on with her eyes and simple Veasey you own overrides and trading round for a little over fifty six dollars a share\nThat are really good quarter I thought and they actually did trade high a higher uh initially gave up some return towards the end of the week but they had a stellar quarter\nThey beat estimates for both revenue and earnings I'm mostly on the back of their wireless segment that offsets softness in their wireline segment and also their oath business which is their digital media business [noise]\n... has taken a much different tact than than a TNT no symbol T trading around thirty bucks not going to get too much into Eighteen teeth today or I Will maybe on a future show even though Eighteen tease now paying almost the six point seven percent dividend market did not like they're quarter in the least\nBut they've taken a much different strategy Eighteen tea is decided that for them to really be successful they need to be a multi by sort of media conglomerate of course they were trying to you know acquiring um Time Warner\nAnd they wanted to have all kinds of different platforms you know not only traditional wireless business but they acquired a direct TV the satellite business they want to be as diversified as they can rise and has taken a much different approach and really stuck to their knitting and focused on wireless business\nWhat are their commercials about\nTheir five gee network upgrading the speed of their network that's that's what they care about and that and that's been really successful\nIf you look at their quarter there a subscriber gross 'em beat a beat it estimates their average revenue per user which is a key metric a had a second consecutive quarter of of above consensus performance so\nClearly a customers are migrating to a higher price unlimited plans and they're adding more connected devices like wearable wearable devices for example\nAnd that's been a big margin a boost for fries and as well as high margin business\nAnd it's also clear that we're not seeing a lot of meaningful competition or materialize yet from some of the cable ... operators like people thought they've also been cost cutting on the bottom line they have a goal of ten billion dollars in cost savings by fiscal you're twenty two they outperform that goal so far this year\nOnline they have a goal of ten billion dollars in cost savings by fiscal year twenty two they outperform that goal so far this year\nAnd I'm from a a valuation perspective I wouldn't call them cheap at this point but I think they're fairly valued train

talked about in October however a few months later everyone kind of saw the reality of the collapse of the global financial system and\nEvents with hundreds of people coming in and we had one event where students that are members of our mastermind community and to that as our highest level community for folks that are looking at treating themselves like a business\nAnd what we've done is we've created a streamlined way for them to take advantage of the resources available to them in the mastermind community and mess my community allows them to tap into expertise from our instructors\nAnd so we have we have over a hundred twenty instructors all a professional traders and they hold sessions and the mastermind community also students from all over the world have the opportunity to hold sessions as far as sharing what they're doing with their trading\nAnd swapping ideas for a lot of people that are engaged in the financial markets you know the only source of ideas that have is you know watching CNBC or Bloomberg\nOr you know the wall Street Journal or their parents just stuff that's the kind of dated and bought into the old model of making money whereas if you really want to be figuring out where the best opportunities today you want to have access to other people at the same perspective with the same training\nAnd you know think about this you know if you worked for Goldman Sachs\nYou wouldn't just roll out of bed in the morning and start trading right in your pajamas you ... you know that your best suit on you'd make sure that you connected with your experts from all around the world sort of understood what was happening out there and then you would apply you're proven system\nAnd look for income opportunities based on what you've proven to yourself works\nAnd so that's the mastermind community allows our students to do is they have access to hundreds of instructors as well as hundreds of students from all around the world that are looking to build us up as a business and looking to generate income\nYou know for the rest of their lives and do things and safer and smarter ways and also get outsized returns for those who have the experience of being taken the time\nTo really develop their own personalized approach to the market\nSo if you want to take a look at designing your own lifetime income strategy\nHe'll come visit us in the next Saturday November a third of Pan Am\nWe're going to be at the home would sweets in Springfield, Virginia and so for the folks down south you know folks in Woodbridge and Stafford or the folks over and and at Fort Washington or Alexandria they'll come and visit us at the home would sweets in Springfield on Saturday November third ten am\nAlso have classes at the online trade academy Baltimore as well as the online trade academy and Tyson's corner I'm trying to carry Baltimore's right up for one hundred between Ninety five and two Ninety five\nHundred academy and Tyson's corner is a Spring Hill road so if you're ... metro accessible and get on the silver lawn and we're short walk from the silver line metro ... Spring Hill road stop\n'em but also anyone in northern Virginia can access us Saturday in November third ten am\nWe have other dates as well so Thursday November first we're going to be an Alexandria we're also going to be up in Germantown on Thursday November first\nAnd friday November second we're going to be out and do all this corner and also in Columbia town center and so part of that says you know we started this year with the mission of reaching ten thousand students a touching ten thousand folks this year and so in November we're going to pass that number\nAnd part of that is is that this there's been a huge demand for people to learn about becoming a do it yourself investor\nAnd it's also you have the opportunity for you to start saying and realizing that you you are on your own but there's never been a better time for you to be engaged with the market\nAnd so you know folks that are looking for strategies to generate lifetime income\nYou know we're going to have Sam side and on and he'll talk a little bit about you know how to create your own annuity in the next segment\nAnd part of that is just realizing that whatever the financial services industry provides for you you can do yourself and not pay them the fees and not incur the same level of expenses related to that so if you want a mutual fund does it do it yourself investor you can\nPay them the fees and not incur the same level of expenses related to that so if you want a mutual fund now has to do it yourself investor you can create your own mutual fund\nIf he wanted annuity has to do it yourself investor you can create your own annuity and not pay commissions not pay fees not pay the same level of expenses if you do it yourself and if you're looking for a kind of a safe investment is going to\nProtect your principal and make sure that you get a opportunities for upside whether that stock market upside or upside and other markets that are trending up their strategies you can use to protect yourself but more importantly give you the peace of mind and so part of what we do students has helped develop your own personal life success plant\nSo every student that comes in works with an education counselor that education counselor helps you identify you know what assets you have and and one of those assets are currently unproductive because remember\nAnd unproductive asset is anything that's designed to get single digit or negative returns and for most people the majority if not all of their assets are in unproductive opportunities\nAnd so we want to do star identify more productive uses for that unproductive asset and think about this if you were operating yourself as a business if you were going to be a business person would you ever invest your hard earned capital in something designed to generate two three four percent\nThere's no way you would do that right you are looking for you know ten percent twenty percent beyond that and that's what we wanted to start thinking about with your financial assets is stopping satisfied with these mediocre returns and open yourself up to the opportunities around you as a do it yourself investor\nAs one of the things we know today is that you know people are wealthy but they don't feel wealthy so we have a number of students that came in this week who had a nice income but they're still living paycheck to paycheck because they have so many expenses between college education student loans car payments\nAnd part of this that says you taking control of your own income and realizing that you have time that you can be using more effectively focused on learning how to generate more income and the financial markets and recognizing that you know as friendly as they are you know the conventional financial services folks aren't for you\nAnd ally back is telling you that they're they're insiders and they're telling you that folks in their industry are not looking out for your best interest\nAnd you know they're basically you know the cost of the other bankers as a bank robbers or if back in the um\nPacked into bad make two thousand nine instead of calling them gangsters or called banks stairs\nBecause they just figured out how to extract money from us as individuals and keep it for themselves and so as a do it yourself investor we want you to understand that you've got to start learning how to protect your money and that's the first lesson particularly in this market environment\nWith increased volatility market's going up markets going down and as that ... happens that's more opportunity for do it yourself investor\nThere's more fear for someone to use the conventional approaches 'cause the conventional approaches don't work in a highly volatile market they basically need a sleeping market where things just go up up up well that moment has passed we've had that for a few years we're no longer in that sleepy market where now in a high volatility market\nAnd high volatility market if all you have the conventional financial approaches that's a really scary market\nHowever if you have the tools of do it yourself investor and you have a proven system that you can use to find safer and smarter places to buy and sell\nAnd you understand how to lead bridger assets and then also have to make sure that for any risk you take you understand it but also you have an opportunity for greater award you know that's the foundation for you know learning how to generate money has to do it yourself a best er\nIt's also the foundation for learning any skill\nYou know if you want to learn something new you need to get the probability in your favor by\nGoing to someone with a proven system so learning about a proven system\nLearning from someone who has more experience has had success in that business or that would that skill and given your and learning how to practice in a focused manner so focused practices essential to allow you to start getting better better skills and better results in your life\nAlso to leverage you want to leverage other people's knowledge they wanna leverage other people's resources\nAnd no matter what scale you're learning getting probability on your side\nGetting leverage on your side is part of how you learned like when you went to a school\nYou use their textbooks you use their chairs you have their expertise to allow you to build up your skill build up your confidence and then once you start then the next step is to help them understand your risk and how to reduce the risk in any action it\nConfidence and then once you start then the next step is to help them understand your risk and how to reduce the risk in any action you take\nThat part about his learning the rules of the game and learning how you know you can you know what your best that in the game and learning how your opponents thing and that's how you start developing an edge\nTo develop any skill including the skill of do yourself investor so part of the class that he'll be attending is focused on give you to understand probability leverage risk ward and doing that in the financial markets but recognize\nThat's how you learn any skill by giving probability leverage risk reward on your side and that's what you've done up to this point in your life and going forward to develop your lifetime income strategy you know the strategy that's going to get you from here to a hundred [laughter]\nWhat what do I do with all this how does this help me you know I Know I you know and um and then they started to realize wait a second there's big risks here that I never thought about and\nLike you said unless you have the confidence um it's it's a scary place to be and what I'm getting at is you know the vast majority of people their financial wellbeing and their life just ebbs and flows with the rise and fall of the stock market and we've all seen how that story ends\nAnd the people have most of their money in the stock market are the ones with the least amount of confidence\nAnd we have people come in all the time telling us they're afraid of that market drop right right right and so ... so as we get back to the perfect investment so more before characteristics and how do you start putting that together so it yeah what everybody\nWants obviously are a big gains low or no risk low fees and a liquidity many I can I can you have access to my money pretty much what I wanted\nAnd of course everyone laughs when he talked about those the foreign ... well that doesn't exist naturally does exist and um again it's not something that you're going to see on TV or learn about the book has a Wall Street certainly doesn't want the average person to do we're we're going right now we're getting out right now\nSo it's like a financial unicorn right people think they'd like it to exist they don't believe it really does ... do you do is actually show people how to create that financial unicorn\nIt to the average person than the unicorn too for the wall street from it's a it's a horse that they deal with everyday lives there and not only do they deal with it they repackage it and sell it and they slice and dice it yeah yeah and and it's really not a it's it's it's you know it's not that hard to understand so I guess if we start to unpack it right [noise]\nSo what we do as and and and you know we've done this is something that you do yourself but yeah yeah you know how to do and we we actually we and we teach this and we executed or for for\nPeople that have this concern in need 'em first up so\nIt starts with where your money's invested so instead of having all your investment capital in the stock market right whatever age you are and whenever you have um don't have any of it there instead put it into bonds or you know interest generating\nA vehicles right for example um corporate bonds or in this day and age there are some pretty good bond funds out there there's not a lot but there's two or three really good ones and um we're talking short maturity high yield very safe\nAnd would that so you reducing the risk and basically you're limiting stock market\nOr you're limiting stock market risk but now you have this pile of money generating income generating interest income\nWhat we do is that as we use the options market so instead of buying the stock market by owning stock we can buy options on the stock market\nSpecifically find calls if you don't understand why cause our options again instead of buying the actual market you are buying the option to buy the market so it's it costs so much less far less money than to actually buy the stock but you still get the benefit of the gains of the stock market so\nI'm so essentially what we're putting together he what was put together as a\nGift buying options on the market so the market goes up you make money\nIf it goes down you can hear your principal you're not losing any of your principal because your money's not actually in the stock market\nSite and so it's totally protected and then at the same time you use that extra income by the calls which gives you\nThe upside gains in the market now there's nothing there's no risk right I mean I'm so where is the risk in this investment there only risk is in the credit risk of the bombs right so um now I I Can't remember any time that there's been a ... up on his fault that you stick with safe stuff [noise] and um\nSo that's part of the analysis that she helped me to walk through sure so once they own the calls how frequently would they do that would just be once a month once a quarter once a year\nBarely once a month this is not an active strategy is a very hands off but essentially the end what you've created is stock market gains with zero stock market risk to your principal\nBanned um fees are low because you're doing yourself extremely low and I'm a liquid he's fine\nAnd I'm Steve are low because you're doing yourself extremely low and I'm kind of liquid he's fine\nAnd the interesting thing is that's exactly what Wall Street does when they create an annuity and we have a lot of people that are buying annuities because they want safety and what you're you just laid out to people how they can do it themselves what they said if they do it themselves\nOh yeah so I'm also suggest tobacco but you need that um what were essentially saying here as this is how you can build your own ingenuity and removed it sees\nRip remove the whole you know ten to twenty or lock up period and all that stuff and um\nWhat what Wall Street dogs with the exact strategy that we just laid out is you know they put it in a pretty box in with a pretty ribbon and had season and lock up periods and surrender charges and everything else and it's called an annuity right and and you know the United states I mean billions of dollars every year goes into\nA new lease right so um [noise] and uh\nAnd who and the people are paying for their brochures and all the fancy offices basically get to keep all that for themselves if they use the strategy you just laid out [noise]\nSure you don't yeah exactly uh you know you can learn how to do this and do it yourself and there's other things but again starting on the wall street side of the business you know you learn simple strategy is like this and how things really work [noise]\nAnd we know to be an effective do yourself

basically ten percent right off the top\nAnd then on top of that on an annual basis you know they're charging fees cream four to seven percent per year\nWhereas if you learn how to do it yourself

N. A. L.\nNow back to the underwriters quarter was ill for easy\nWelcome\nBack to the underwriters quarter\nYou know in the beginning of the show I talked about the quick apps that they have on your phone or to space ship mortgage and hocus pocus mortgage\nBut you know there's a whole group of people who don't fit into that cut he caught that that cookie cutter kind of a of a loan application you know they're the self employed people the people who are working two jobs or maybe you're on commissions a or maybe you have your overtime and your bonus money or tips\nUm or maybe you're a nurse that work sometimes you work night the night differential or weekend pay\nMost people have a lot of different little things about their income it doesn't just fit perfectly in there\nAnd that's why it's so important when you're looking to especially when you're looking to buy a house never mind if you're looking to refinance as well but if you're looking to purchase a home you want to know what income when when you can count and you know some people say to me bill which is an underwriter really do well\nEspecially with situations like that with the the uh the forgotten people I I sound like Trump talking to the forgotten people well you know\nSometimes you need an exception you know some most of the time I have to average two years but what if you've only been working this job for a year and three quarters can I make an exception of course I can make an exception that's what an underwriter does their guidelines\nAnd the guidelines say you should have about two years so that I can average it [noise] well what if you have two years but you don't have two years of tax returns can I use it sometimes I can sometimes I Can't you know every day when I go into work I have two or three loan officer standing at my door asking me\nCan I look at this this situation 'cause I look at that situation can we make an exception here can we use the income can we do this\nAnd most of the time I can figure out a way how we can make that work\nThat's where the one on one when you have a when you have a local person that you couldn't talk to so it's so important to have a loan officer even if you're just talking to them on the phone you want to have their cell phone number and that's why I have all of these loan officers right now but this one hour I promise you you don't get voicemail\nGive them a call the eight hundred number again is three two one\nFive five five they're all in there and they again they want nothing from you that and there's no obligation on your part just get yourself started give them a little give them permission to run your credit to run your credit for you they'll let you know what your credit score is it's free they'll do it\nIt started give them a little give them permission to run your credit to run your credit for you they'll let you know what your credit score as it's free they'll do it for free [noise]\nIf your credit need some some help\nThey'll tell you exactly what you need to do anybody can get their credit score up twenty thirty points you just have to know what to do\nOr maybe they'll say hey your credit is not great but it's only it's perfectly fine for an F ha or VA loan or they might say well you want to get a conventional loan you have to get your credit score up in the seven hundreds and your credit score a seven seven is six Seventy two [noise]\nHere's exactly what you can do pay down this visa a few hundred dollars and that'll make your credit score go up twenty points or whatever they tell you that you have to do and if you stumped them believe me they will be one of the loan officers I'll have tomorrow at my desk say and bill how do we do this\nAnd I'll be glad to tell them that horse sometimes at stumps me and I have to call the credit bureau for you and find out exactly what you need to do\nDon't want anybody tell you know\nThere's ways that you can do this you just have to know what to do and that's why it's so important when you're thinking about refinancing or purchasing a home that you have a local person that you couldn't talk to\nAnd that's why I have all the loan officers and they also take advantage of it I promise you you don't get voicemail and they want nothing from you they just want to get you started their eight hundred number again is three two one\nFive ... five five of those especially who have a you know a second mortgage and equity line he'll do the the equity lines have been terrific all adjustable loans have been had been terrific for the past ten years but some of them have even gone down\nBut you know they're going to start to go up and they have already started to go up last year in Seventeen or they went up about three quarters of a percent now I'll tell you something this year they've gone up about an eighth or a quarter but pretty much they've stayed the same for the whole year two thousand and Eighteen\nThat's about to drastically change come November\nThese ... you can see it you can see the economy how strong it is getting and depending on what happens after November ah this the sex that if it's a kind of make takes off even more than it is doing now\nThese interest rates are going to steadily already the feds are talking about you know they've raised it three times and they're talking about how many more times are going to raise it next year they're definitely going to go up\nThey're not gonna get better that's a hundred percent sure\nThey're going to go up so if you're sitting there with an adjustable loan\nThat God Forbid you have an adjustable on your first mortgage but a lot of people have that second mortgage the equity lines of this is the time to put the first mortgage and the second mortgage together [noise]\nAnd and eat meat I don't have to stay with a thirty alone you maybe you go down to twenty five year alone or a twenty year alone or maybe you've been in the house nine or ten years and you want to go down to a Fifteen year alone [noise] find out if it's worthwhile [noise]\nThey'll take about a minute and a half of your time on the phone and they can tell you what your payment would be if you put the first and the second together if you want to know about your credit score because the credit score has a lot to do with what interest rate you can get there'll be glad to get your credit report for you for free\nLet them tell you that your credit is okay or if it needs some help this is exactly what you need to do they're all in their give them a call their eight hundred number again is three two one\nFive five five five and you know one of the biggest things if you're buying a house and the reason why you need a loan officer because when you find a house it might be Saturday morning\nAnd where are you going to get a loan officer on a Saturday morning to tell you what your closing costs would be to give you your approval lettuce or you can put it on top of your contract or maybe it's Sunday afternoon or maybe it's a Wednesday night at seven PM\nYou need to be able to get a hold of a loan officer right then and there if you wait till tomorrow or the next day the house is going to be gone\nYou know right now there isn't or not there isn't enough I'm a inventory on the market right now so when a house comes on the market and you look at it you either have to make a decision to jump on it or you're not going to get it [noise]\nAh my son was just just bought a house and every time he went looking at a house that just came on the market the day before\nHe went after it and he said dad there's two other contracts already in on it\nYou have to be ready you have to get yourself altogether get your ducks in order to talk to a loan officer [noise]\nGet all of that ad of the way now so that if you happen to you know you're sitting on the Internet you're looking at houses you see an address you ride by and you think I like to see what that looks like inside that's just where I wanted the house\nAnd by the ... to all of a sudden you're in there with a realtor and the real just says well do you want to put all contracted on it [noise] well you have to have your approval letter\nAnd you know you don't want one of those quick application approval letters to say you're a proof of four hundred thousand dollars when you're buying this how's it going to negotiate with the cellar and you're trying to get it for three hundred and Seventeen thousand dollars why tell the cell that you were\nFour hundred thousand dollars when you're buying this house you're going to negotiate with the cellar and you're trying to get it for three hundred and Seventeen thousand dollars why tell the soda you approve of four hundred thousand you want your letter to say your proof of three Seventeen if that's what your offer is\nAnd then you try to negotiate with the cellar to pay your closing cost how much are you closing costs you just can't say pay all my closing cause again you need to pick up the phone and use the cell phone number and called the loan officer and say loan officer what will my closing costs beyond this house in this county with these taxes\nI Want to negotiate the seller can I ask a cello to pay them all [noise]\nWell again it depends on your loan program if you're doing a conventional loan and only putting down five percent no you can't get them you can only go up to three percent [noise]\nBut if you're putting down ten percent then you can get them to pay all of your closing cost or if you're getting an F ha you're a VA loan or USDA you can get them to pay all of your closing costs but you have to know how much to ask them for\nBut I have two hundred and five you could say the seller I Want you to pay ten thousand dollars of my closing costs and ...\nThat's the same as if you gave him one Ninety five but what you've done is you've put it in your loan you say well bill but by loan amount went up five thousand dollars a went up ten thousand dollars really from one Ninety five to two oh five [noise]\nYeah but when the rates are still is low that ten thousand dollars only changes your payment by about fifty two bucks a month\nAnd for fifty two bucks a month you don't have any closing costs to prepay to pay\nAnd then all you have is your down payment and you know how much the down payment is if you're a veteran zero [noise]\nSo if you buy that house for two oh five I'm going to give you the whole two oh five [noise]\nAnd you already have the seller in the contract paying your ten thousand dollars of closing costs on ... a veteran does it need a single penny out of their pocket [noise]\nOkay now you're all sitting back saying but I'm not a veteran bell how can I buy one well there is a program it has some restrictions that the VA doesn't have but if you're serious about buying a house and you want to try to get in for no money\nYou can do it and it it it's not for everybody here's the biggest one [noise] it's not for somebody making three hundred thousand dollars a year there is an income limit okay but they're pretty reasonable to pay goes by the the the number of people in your household\nAnd it goes by where you're buying the house in what county some counties if you're a family of let's say family of five you know to to adults and maybe three children [noise]\nYou're buying a house in a county and the limit there is a hundred and forty four thousand dollars for for a family of five\nMaybe for a family of three you know one one adult maybe in two children maybe it's only a hundred and ten thousand dollars in some counties if you're single or just two people they might be eighty nine thousand dollars but if as long as you're a you meet the income limits\nYou can use a program called USDA rural development\nThat will be a stereotype about rural fed doesn't mean you have to buy with us more cows than people there is a second restriction unlike the VA a veteran can buy a house anywhere near the water but with this USDA you can't buy within the city limits\nSo if you have a city in your county a large city you have to be one block outside of the city limits okay in some counties that's half the county some counties it's the whole county because I don't know how to study it at some counties that might be a very restrictive area of maybe five or six miles only\nSo find out you have all the loan officers in the office they can tell you you just tell them what county are thinking about buying a house and where would you have to you look to use the USDA rural development\nAnd what's so great about it is you can get the cellar to pay all of your closing costs in prepaid and just like the VA there is no downpayment [noise]\nSo you too can buy a house without a single penny out of your pocket now and you have to buy within your means so tell the loan officers loan officer run your credit for free [noise]\nTell them what your income is and let them tell you what your limit would be even under the USDA rural development and then if you tell them what county are you looking in\nThey can tell you where to look they can give you a there's a Web page there is a bad thing that you can look at and you can look how you can say yourself well I was looking right in that area but I have to look three blocks outside of that area in this area not bad areas just outside of the city limits\nAnd you too can buy a house just like the veteran and I'm telling you probably eighty percent of the people listening to me could fit into this program and you could buy a house the interest rates are the same\nAnd you can buy a house without a penny out of your pocket you just have to know what you're doing\nTo this program and you could buy a house the interest rates are the same and you can buy a house without a penny out of your pocket you just have to know what you're doing that's why it's so important to sit down with the loan officer even on the phone\nCall them up they're sitting in their office they won't get voicemail their eight hundred number is three two one five ... five five so whether you're a veteran or whether you hope to use this USDA rural development find out where you have to look I think most of you will be surprised at how much of an area you can buy in\nAnd some counties I'm telling you it's the whole county in some counties it's half the county and in most counties you there's a whole wide area that you can look in and not bad area as I say that again this is just right outside of the city limits\nFind out where are you looking to let them give you the Web page lead then there's a little map there that you can look in the whole county and find out exactly where you have to look and you'll be surprised\nMaybe you have to go six blocks that way and and in that area you and all of that area you can buy a house without a penny out of your pocket [noise]\nFind out and find out what your limit is let them run your credit tell them about your income and if there's any issues with your income believe me they'll come see me give them a call the eight hundred number\nThree two one five ... five don't let them leave there without getting their name and their cell phone number [noise] All right they're telling me that I take a quick break we'll be right back\nThere'll be extreme stores warehouse clearance
