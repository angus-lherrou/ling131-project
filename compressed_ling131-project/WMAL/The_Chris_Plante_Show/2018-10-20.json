things on the radio about winning the lottery and what do you deal with it and some of the suggestions that are coming out by these radio reporters is it put it in a trust\nAnd then the question came up for if you're trying to stay anonymous\nAh that apparently only seven states do that the question comes up what do you do with your house do you put can you create a trust that does not that put your ... your house in there but does not identify you and the title of it something that's not searchable in the land records\nWell you know the answer is yes you can you may have heard of something called the Illinois this isn't the only way to do it but a new annoying land trust\nWhich is which is the trust that are used to hold titled or real estate for instance and the trustees or uh some professional trustees of you know sometimes their lawyers sometimes it's a title company whatever [noise]\nUh so that the kids so that the name of the actual individual owner or individual owners is not on the public record hit there there's going to be a public record you want to make sure there's there's a chain of title that ah [noise]\nIt's gonna lead you ultimately but it does that's\nWhat I was thinking ... began to sound a little bit like the Panama Papers situation\n... ... what I mean I'm not familiar with the Panama Papers\nPanama Papers is a law office are actually several offices I suppose in Panama and these lawyers were I'm managing accounts out of the Cayman Islands that were numbered accounts\nA and it turns out that Vladimir Putin has a I think it's two billion dollars in it\nWho to Hooters black America and uh I K heads\nOf state have been swirling away money there I think um\nI think Iceland had a had a problem but they got themselves out of it before the before it um\nThe news broke but anyway Panama Papers was a scandal about three years ago three or four years ago because they it was a way of making anonymous the ownership\nOf atrocities yeah well they didn't look\nI I mean I wasn't familiar with the term but I don't read my I Do I remember something about ice went ... when he had a banking industry problem at one point I think it was an over extension with loans but anyway yeah and I and I I wouldn't be shocked to learn that some of the world leaders are squirrels away you know funds from one source and others\nThat overly shocking but yes it's it's ... there's nothing illegitimate about it it's a it's a it's a commonly used technique by people who have some reason or sometimes it's for a ... tax avoidance problems and I suppose sometimes it's for\nA political sensitivity as well but then you don't have to have in other words your own personal name on the uh\nUh I on the written in the recorders office so there's so you you can keep the ownership of the property anonymous the the thing you always want to be careful of is that you you can get access to it I mean you know I I'd be a little leery about a turning my\nProperty over to somebody this a fist in Panama that's working through the Cayman Islands or I'm sure there [laughter] you know I Know the Cayman Islands Cayman Islands uh have legitimate off shore banking laws

fit in Pentagon should\nRegularly I only have one of my lawyers call and ask them what their interpretation of the FDIC Riggs is you are to do the same thing or just talk to somebody at the bank and uh in in ... and see what their take on this is as I say my recollection is\nThat we were getting conflicting answers even from FDIC people themselves and so and I know I remember looking at the\nLanguage in the\nFDIC regulations and bullied me it was very ambiguous it was hard to track because it looked like it had been written by somebody\nWho frankly didn't really understand\nA trust very well and so they were borrowing terminology from a food you know sort of the area of joined tendency and things and it just didn't just didn't fit so uh uh\nWell that's my answer to that and if I I Will look into this this week and uh see if we can't come up with something because as I say I suspect this is going to be a topic of uh interest is the market ... around some people think it's ...

N. A. L. Washington comes to talk [noise]\nTo the gentleman show I told you to a couple of my clients here elements financial or a little unhappy with me and I'm going to share with you why\nBecause there's a lot of really important financial planning lessons regarding this that could help you [noise] uh\nBack in September or say back in September last month in my newsletter inside personal finance and we publish a among the newsletter sixteen pages it's one lots of awards are very proud of it I I wrote an article that was called a choice to critical to leave to children [noise]\nAnd it was about how allowing your child to select the wrong college major can lead to future financial stress what I said in that article is that twenty four percent of recent college graduates who are fully employed so we're talking about recent college grad to have a job\nOne out of four of them are getting financial help from their parents which is astonishing to me parents are helping their kids pay their cell phone bills car insurance car payments\nAnd so my message and the article was you can't allow Eighteen year olds to choose college majors based on their wins I wrote you need to help them choose colleges in majors wisely pursuing degrees that will be marketable when they graduate\nAnd allow them to earn a comfortable living and I cited a study revealing that ten worst\nCollege majors for getting hired and here are six of them\nGeneral social scientists anthropology philosophy liberal arts English and fine arts\nWhile that generated emails from two of our clients Judy wrote to me and she said wreck\nI majored in psychology and when I retired Eighteen years ago I was making two hundred and fifty thousand dollars and my daughter majored in art history and she ran an engineering firm before she retired\nThen I saw the obituary for Robert ... who is the chairman of the Federal Trade commission he majored in English\nSo how about serving your most financially successful clients to see what their undergraduate major was you might be surprised if there were many liberal arts majors that was Judy\nJak also wrote he wanted to voice their displeasure with the article to he was annoyed that the article made no mention of the other values of education regarding liberal arts and he felt that my article overvalued monetary gain in the educational pursuit\nRole I really do appreciate Judy's and Jack's comments and I say you may have similar feelings but you know what to ... for\nHer daughter is sixty\nJak is Seventy to the\nWorld was so totally different when they went to college Judy went to college sixty years ago\nJack is Seventy to the world was so totally different when they went to college Judy went to college sixty years ago back then a liberal arts degree was of great value not just individually but also to help securing an Exxon career she proved\nBut that's no longer the case today students spend a hundred and fifty thousand dollars or more plus six years on average to get a degree of thirty students drop out in their freshman year even after they might have spent thirty thousand dollars or forty thousand dollars less than half of students graduate even after six years\nBut they still walk away the student loans an average of thirty grand per student\nHalf of Americans today have student loan debt\nToday going to college is a huge financial commitment with an enormous implications on the lives of the students so yeah sure I'm willing to bet that if we pull our clients is Judy suggests\nWho went to college Thirty years ago forty fifty sixty years ago yeah liberal arts majors will in fact be revealed to have had successful careers but that's driving by looking through the rearview mirror\nThe fact that it worked in the Nineteen hundreds doesn't mean that those degrees are properly preparing students for the futures that they're going to have now look I'm a liberal arts graduate myself\nSo I Know the full value of that education but when I went to college in the Nineteen eighties I paid sixty eight bucks a month for housing tuition was twenty five hundred bucks a semester\nToday tuition room and board is routinely exceeding fifty thousand dollars and so yeah sociology psychology history poetry they're all very important but we've got to examine these majors for their economic viability due to their cost so yes get that knowledge\nBut we need to do it more cheaply get it on line through self study or other ways and we need to focus instead\nOn what college has unfortunately become a platform\nFor career preparation [noise]\nThe U.S economy according to the apartment of labor now has seven million jobs available\nWe only had six million unemployed workers they're supposed to make any sense first time this has ever happened according to the Labor Department how was it you've got six million people out of work but seven million jobs available there's only one reason for this\nThe people who are out of work are not trained for the jobs that are available that's the problem\nSo yeah I'm afraid that um\nThe cause might be lost you know the notion of going to school for personal enrichment and development might be lost and I say that with limitation because I shared Judy's concerns and they share jacks concern\nBut as a financial planner my duty is to help our clients get their kids off to a good start in life without jeopardizing the parents' own retirement future\nAnd so I simply can't endorse the decision to let an Eighteen year old decided to major in a career\nAt a private out of State University that will cost two hundred thousand dollars over six years that isn't going to lead to a job opportunity you know I'm Sorry when someone says to me that they're going to major in philosophy I'm like right you're going to go work for a philosophy company I\nMean it just it just doesn't seem to make any sense anymore higher ed is not what you and I fondly recall it to be it's a brave new world nowadays\nAnd so I've got no choice but to help our clients and their kids navigate it effectively I'm Sorry that that's the situation but I figure it's better to acknowledge it\nThan to ignore it and if you want any evidence of this just look at the announcement made this week\nBy the c._e._o. of bank of America he says that he has just finished cutting one hundred thousand jobs in less than a decade at bay and he said quote it was all caused\nBy the ability to apply technology to processes and capabilities unquote\nHe says they're twenty six million of the banks customers that are using mobile banking at\nTherefore they don't need any human interaction artificial intelligence on robotic process these have allowed the firm to cut out eighty four thousand work hours a year you only work two thousand hours a year they've just cut out eighty four thousand hours a year you do the math\nHe said the bank had too many managers about thirty thousand of them and so he fired a third of them over just the last couple of years is it any wonder though according to Gallup only forty eight percent of the American public has a lot of confidence in higher education\nAnd this is why it's so important that we apply a proper lens and the question of will my child go to college and if so what will be that major and what institution will the child attend to get that degree\nBecause spending two hundred thousand dollars on a degree that doesn't provide the economic reward\nSetting your child up for failure not success\nThink about it because your child's financial future depends on it [noise] of your child headed to college\nNot success\nThink about it because your child's financial future depends on it [noise]\nYour child's headed to college if

I'm not quite sure why psychologists would be recommending psychiatric help\nOr she should be recommending psychological help but anyway\nUh it gets to just chose to go you not everybody's a fan\nOf the record on the show so I don't know maybe I should have you know some regrets of how a man on the show why but I'll tell you who does have a regret\nSuzie Orman has a regret\nShe says that she has a major money related regret that back in Nineteen Ninety seven she bought five thousand dollars worth of Amazon's stock and sold that just a few years later is she still owns the shares it would be worth more than six million dollars [noise]\nSuzie says quote it makes me sick to even tabulate at unquote she says she purchased the Amazon shares because she liked the branding she said quote\nI thought it was such a cool name for a stock I could identify with the idea of me being a woman that wanted to be an Amazon\nThat was the due diligence that's Susie Orman did for choosing an investment but she also says quote\nYou should do lots of your own research before buying an investment unquote so let me get this straight she's telling us to do lots of research before picking and investment but she picks a stock\nBecause it was a cool name and she liked the idea of being an Amazon\nParrot who is on business center and the other night say whatever he sat and got him here too and I\nCan't

Benet\nMatter what you\nMight remember I told her when I was telling you about Don Bennett a couple of years ago she was a financial advisor who\nRadio show I'm Sorry to say and dawn's was nailed for

Washington comes to\n[noise] [laughter] well\nCome back to the gentleman show we talked often about the need for Americans\nWere times security clearly retirement accounts like four one K. plans and the other employer retirement plans or a key element of this Social Security\nPlays an important role as we've talked often here on the program and to help us further the conversation I'm happy to welcome to the show Lynn doubly she's senior vice president of global retirement and compensation policies for the American benefits council Lynn thanks so much for joining us on the show today\nPleasure thank you for having me\nSo as president four one K. plans around the country pretty much everything else for three D's for fifty seven for savings plans for federal employees all these retirement plans in the workplace they they tend to be filled with mutual funds that's pretty much the investment of choice so rebel ability for millions of American workers\nAnd it's up to you as the worker to figure out how to invest in the plan\nBut that's where a lot of the attention and focus goes with the real key\nIs when you're in retirement how'd you withdraw the money out\nHow do you generate income that's not only going to meet your needs today but income that will last an entire lifetime\nAnd and so it kind of makes sense doesn't it to offer lifetime income opportunities so talk about that Len\nThat's an area that policymakers happy and can't get their arms around for a long time that it had been on accumulating and that\nAnd I think it has the ... part of that because so many people are close to retirement lifetime income options as a form of distribution as a way of receiving your money\nSuch as a monthly income over the rest of your life has not been a common distribution option that was included in four oh one K. plans and so I think\nHas not been a common distribution option that was included in four O. one K. plans and so I think what is happening now is to figure out how would a house to have that kind of option in their plans\nAnd my experience was a financial advisor most of the training really advisors to Islam helping clients put money in\nOne of the contribution limits the investment options how do you build a portfolio relatively little training on how do you take the money out then how do you do so in a manner that will not only me precludes me today but her neighborhood him to sustain that over the course of the entire last time\nI mean even more to a point it's not just about retirement income it's really about overall financial well being and so I Know that the American benefits counsel was really focused on the broader more holistic motion of world being slim share with us we're that's all about\nThat is an area of of extreme importance to plan sponsors\nMany of them have adopted these very broad financial wellbeing programs that covered the gambit of how much should you save what our barriers that are keeping you from saving because many people do have barriers to save and such a student loans or\nA lack of emergency funds or just not great management skills not not a lot of budgeting management skills and then they want to help people understand what the different investment options are how to how to manage your money as your career progressed as\nAnd then how to manage your money in retirement including\nNot only how to make your money to laugh\nBut you need there there are other things that you need to consider as well things like what will the cost of health care bay a how will I manage a where I live uh how will I manage\nA you know the allocation of my money to uh investments versus income because even in retirement you're still going to want to be earning some money on the amount of money that is invested so these are all things that you have to think about\nWhat percentage of employers are engaging in these kinds of programs for their employees\nSo when you talk about the very large companies the fortune one hundred even the fortune five hundred it's growing exponentially so a very large the larger the company the more likely they are to have these programs\nOne of the problems of course is the most of America is employed by small companies small businesses\nYeah that's exactly right so one of the challenges for policymakers is how to help small employers do the same thing\nWhat would you give listeners is their employer isn't providing a wellness program for\nThe first thing you you want to do is ask them if the\nThe company offers some educational information I'm also I think asking yourself how are you planning to pay for health care and retirement and the other thing I Would tell people is that you should look at how much Social Security will pay you\nPay attention to Social Security\nThat a lot of folks are over estimate of how much money they're likely to get from Social Security especially higher income Americans because those maps that Social Security will provide the average Chuck\nBecause you know Lynn is about for two hundred dollars a month for Social Security retirees\nAnd of course the Social Security system is under threat right now because the trust fund is being depleted and that's why the American benefits also has joined the funding or future coalition talk about what your us versions are and why you decided to have the American benefits council joined the coalition\nFunding our future is in really incredibly important initiative across the country it's it's important for multiple reasons why it raises the profile of the issue to your listeners into the public so that the public is aware that they need to be thinking about these things\nWhile they're working not thinking about them at the end\nThough if you are close to retirement you should start thinking about them or even in retirement be you know think about them now so part of it is that part of it is also to create a momentum so that we as a country can engage on a ... in a discussion about\nA policy that uh you know as a country wide in this society wide policy of how we can help people in retirement and how we can address the gaps in retirement and work with policymakers to come up with very pragmatic practical\nSolutions that work\nUm for people and for the employers that are providing the plane\nIs to come up with very pragmatic practical solutions that work um for people and for the employers that are providing the plans [noise]\nSo I'm really glad you were able to spend the time with us on the program Lynn thank you so much for doing this I really appreciate it oh you're very welcome that flew into the senior vice president of global retirement and compensation policy of the American benefits council and a member of the funding or future coalition do can learn more about it at funding\nOur future us [noise] and work out um and we're here to help you trouble in your voice seven five to seven forty two year old boy when we're on law and it really don't [noise]\n\n\nWarm winter coming up on them and\nYou're thinking about retirement Social Security pension investments will you have enough income to enjoy yourself and your income last for the rest of your life ... now you can find out if your savings and investments can generate the retirement income you need the income you expect\nTo take any period you want since Nineteen twenty six [noise] any here as a starting point go Fifteen Years later the market was always higher so if you're telling me we've got Eighteen years maybe twenty four years to go\nThat gives us a very high degree of confidence of course I have to stress as you well know the past performance is no guarantee of future results any social the country's a federal sense right we know that\nBut it's the only thing we have to go on so we can with a pretty high degree of confidence say that if I got a Fifteen or Eighteen or twenty four year time horizon putting a hundred percent of the money into stocks makes a great deal of sense and so that's what I Would recommend for the account for your daughter\nNow your daughter's not allowed to own an account she's a minor minors can't own assets you as the parent has to create a custodial account on behalf of your daughter it's called a U. T. M. a uniform transfer to minors at\nUT amazing account it simply says you're going to set the money aside for your daughter\nUh the problem with it is number one you're going to pay taxes on that camera manual basis and number two when the child reaches the age of majority you have to turn the money over to the child and instead of using the money for college she might use the money to buy a Corvette\nSo or for that reason especially since you're targeting us for college we might instead recommend a five twenty nine college savings plans which are available and all states all around the country and in this way you were on the account not your daughter your daughters the beneficiary of the account\nBut you control it you determine how the money's invested you decide when the money is withdrawn for college and if you indeed\nUse the money for college then withdrawals are completely tax free no taxes at all it's fabulous and that's why the five twenty nine plan is the preferred way to save for college because you can use the money to any college in the country for any college expenses tuition room board books pretty much everything except travel\nOr if you don't use the money for college them withdrawals will be subject to taxes and a ten percent penalty but you could always transfer the money to another child if you've ever had another one or two cousins of your daughter you could even leave the money there for your daughter's children and another Thirty years so\nLots of fabulous flexibility associated with the five twenty nine plan so that's what we recommended the five twenty nine plan targeted for your daughter but I Want to emphasize one other very important point that might have slipped\nPast us without focus remember I said that in any Fifteen or twenty year time period stocks have never lost money on that basis you can go ahead and put a hundred percent of the money into stocks right now right by weight and your daughter\nTwelve\nShe's no longer going to have necessarily Fifteen Years before she uses the money which means as she ages we're going to want to ramp down\nThe allocation of stocks because the costs are she gets to college the less time the money will remain invested and the greater the risk of the stock market crash undoing all of the good effort we've tried for all those years\nSo a one hundred percent stock allocation makes sense now but it doesn't make sense when she's Fifteen\nFor Eighteen does that make sense yes so we want to create something called a glide path picture of the airplane you know with traveling at forty thousand feet but not when it gets near the airport\nAs it approaches the airport it alters that's glide path and as it gets closer it gets lower and lower so that by the time it reaches the airport it's really close to the ground same thing with your daughter as she gets closer to using the money\nWe have less and less of that money in stocks so that by the time she's sixteen if you're going to use the money at age Eighteen\nAs she gets closer to using the money we have less and less of that money in stocks so that by the time she's sixteen if you're going to use the money at age Eighteen she'll have virtually none of the money in stocks because we're so close to using the cash so that makes sense\nThat does is this something that we could do within the five twenty nine\nYes yes you can and there are two ways to do it one is to choose your own asset allocation and you control how much of it as in stocks you put a hundred percent stocks today but as she ages you declined that hundred percent down to Ninety eighty Seventy sixty forty et cetera overtime as she approaches the use of the money for\nBecause that's a nuisance that's a chore that's difficult a lot of parents don't know how to do it\nMany five twenty nine plans off or what are called target date funds where they'll do it for you and the target date fund you choose a fund that is targeted for when you think your daughter will use the money so you would choose for example a twenty year target date fund\nBy choosing a target date fund they will create the glide path\nFor you they will alter the allocation as your daughter ages automatically without you having a fuss with a\nBunch of stuff so either do it yourself or let them do it for you but either way do that\nExcellent I appreciate it thank you\nIt's my pleasure I'm Glad you called and I'm really excited that your daughter's getting off the such a great start in life and are you guys keep that up and a boy oh boy oh boy\nWill she be able to take care of you your\nThat's the last thing I think so much for the phone [noise]\nCongress got 'em and you're listening to the truth about money triple a plan rag on line at rice gentleman dot
