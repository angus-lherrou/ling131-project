I suppose they didn't technically accused him of being a pedophile because he was also under age at the time\nBut they say what he was a teenager maybe Fifteen Years old Georgetown Prep this is Julie sweating that can Michael I have an Audi the creepy porn lawyer\nWith the the uh you know gang banged girl um because her ex boyfriend the weatherman from Washington DC said that ah she told him when they were dating back she liked or the you know true to Charlie and and all of that stuff was an engineer that was one of our favorite things going back to high school according to her ex boyfriend\nWho was a member of the media and a Democrat who ran for Congress as a Democrat and he's the one who always got to be believed by the news media which is why they completely ignored him of course\nBut the Julie sweat next thing is now the Democrats believe what took it too far took it too far and it's all Michael ... fault they're blaming Michael lab and daddy the creepy porn lawyer for coming up with gang rape Julie\nAnd uh they're making an action figure now they're going to be the has bro is going to be so maybe Mattel\nSomebody's going to be coming up with an action figure I don't even want to describe but the uh the the Democrats are big tragic loss here horrible tragic loss and they believe that it's Kavanaugh's fault because\nThey were doing fine when you're just had Christian forward and then the ... guy at a which have all left out of their fake reporting now the ... at a at Yale you know the the woman at Yale who said that uh Deborah Ramirez\nSaid that somebody when she was a freshman I think I don't know I was really drunk\nBut there are very upset this morning that President Trump tweeted\nThat there were ... paid protesters and they're and they're expressing all kinds of outrage about this even this morning 'cause they don't follow the news this is one of the things I've learned I keep pointing it out these people in the news business don't actually follow the news they read the Washington Post and the New York times and then they figure they've they've consumed all the news they need\nA and that's why they end up knowing almost nothing\nBecause the most insidious power that has made it has the power to ignore and they ignore a locked stuff\nThat they're going crazy over this President Trump pointing out correctly and accurately\nThat there are many protesters organizers in the crowd or with their mailing lists ... the crowds and then instructing them what to do and are stepping in to the door of the elevator with Jeff Flake paid left wing Soros organization protesters\nAnd the news media presumably knows all this but they just pretend that they don't know it so they go on\nAnd a lesson learned for them I was talking lessons learned on friday lesson learned for them is next time they are going to have to be more ruthless more vicious\nMore acid throwing and uh that's just how it's going to be that's that's what they've done there's got to be President Trump's going to get at least one more Supreme Court pick I Would expect\nOr maybe even fairly soon\nAnd there is an I I don't I haven't asked a anybody about this but I hear the rumblings around town\nBack Clarence Thomas is considering retirement now he is right now the longest serving member of the Supreme Court Clarence Thomas and here's another fun fact get a get a lot of this there are nine members of the Supreme Court\nToday as a any school child can tell you nine members of the Supreme Court one was nominated by a one term president\nGeorge H W. Bush to were nominated by the two term president to follow him Bill Clinton huh [noise] to wear a nominated by two term President George W. Bush to were nominated by\nWere nominated by two term president Brock Obama\nAnd now two were nominated had been nominated by Donald John Trump in two years\nIn two years more to come but right now the balance of the court if you look at presidential elections since Ronald Reagan starting with George W. Bush he gets one as a one term president than two term president gets to two term president gets to two term president gets to Donald Trump gets to\nA so ... and he's going to get more he may get to more he could get three more but if one of them as Clarence Thomas then that's not really the same thing um because you'd be replacing a a solid rock rib conservative with hopefully another solid rock red conservative\nBut when the lesson that they believe they've learned is that they weren't vicious and ruthless enough that they that they weren't mean enough that they didn't make it crazy enough they didn't dial it up to a hundred enough\nIf that's the lesson that they've learned ended apparently is then we can expect the city to burn now on friday Michael peers you know when we're wrapping up and preparing to leave on friday\nWe were talking about whether there would be riots in the city over the weekend and uh we're making a joke you know when the when they elected a new pope at the Vatican\nA a that they take the ballots the votes the paper ballots and they toss them into a basically a wood burning fireplace and a and if the vote is no I haven't elected a new book than black smoke comes out of the out of the chimney at the Vatican\nAnd and if they have elected a new ... white smoke comes out and everybody out in St Peter's Square knows that that the election has selected a new pope and they stand by for the announcement of who that will be a we were thinking on friday that we may know that Kavanaugh has been voted in when we see\nSiri a series of columns of black smoke rising from the downtown Washington area\nBecause the leftist here and we know they're like burning things on the looting and ...\nAnd attacking people but again they uh they called off the violent dogs they're brown shirts they're black shirts\nTheir shock troops that storm the beer hall and beat people and mobs you know the antifa people and the and the whole rest of the the the lefty the violent lefty people a word called off again we were down there on Saturday\nThere were no antifa people at all why well because the high command ordered them to stand down\nBecause they wanted to manage the media image that are that people saw that I was there I had this crazy topless guy Fox woman Elizabeth Warren was speaking when we were there and then Ed Markey the other dim witted senator from Massachusetts was there speaking on and we're having a good time making fun of them\nYes where you were a and a ... and again lots and lots of pro cabin up people are and and the total number of people what a hundred thousand\nTwo hundred three hundred thousand I'm fifty thousand twenty thousand\nTen five thousand no no\nMore like Fifteen hundred\nAnd may be maxed out at two thousand and a lot of those where people like me who were not part of the left wing\nWere really angry demonstration a lot of people were pro American and uh one of the ... smallest so I Know that they have the ability to call up bigger more violent protest and that the party does\nBut they decided to dial it down because now the fight and there is a new stage and make no mistake they're not done\nThey're planning on winning the house next month because you're not going to show up and vote and they're going to win the house and then they're going to impeach Kavanaugh which won't happen of course and that but they just they're going to spread the hate and endanger people's lives\nBecause Hillary Clinton lost because she didn't go to Wisconsin and she's ... she's a horrible person\nShe's waking up this morning in a pool of dog vomit at home it's it's a different kind of on it every night\n[noise] the Washington Post on Saturday with say a ridiculous story about a sort of the after action review now the Democrats and the media but I repeat myself the media very upset I think this is probably got the strain the relationship between\nThe Democratic party and their activists a news media people [noise]\nBecause first of the media thought that they had won the election for the Democratic party for Hillary Clinton undefeated Donald John Trump and they were shocked shocked I say to find that Donald Trump won\nThey won the electoral college quite handily and the Democrats are very very upset about this and um and I mentioned on friday that they're not going to try to de legitimize the Supreme Court itself and they've been busy doing exactly that ever since\nThey legitimize into this ... this I Know there are two members of the Supreme Court who have been accused of sexual harassment sexual impropriety yeah you're right by Democrats like Bill Clinton who raped\nAnd uh and where does waiting in the face of Paula Jones that's fine but the Democrats will come on we're not getting that we've covered that that's what they say when you when you mentioned things like that 'cause then it's about the double standards and the hypocrisy and all of that good stuff\n[noise] um I I'm more of like ... like an editor so now there are two and and uh and they want to you know they want to impeach everybody they're they're just crazy they're really bad blizzards they really are like um you know more number do turn those machines back on at the end of trading places\nWe're not going to turn those machines back on you lost the election President Trump lives in the White House Hillary Clinton as drunk at home alone every night because no one likes her specially her husband knowing\nThe Washington Post on Saturday the initial Ford allegations mom who to blame momentarily sent the White House reeling as they scramble to assess her credibility and the veracity ever claims to the Democrats there and the news media they were really happy about this\nThe president was immediately advised including by Conway not to attack forward but to say that she deserved to be heard ally and he stuck to for several days he being the president United States\nIn the coming day stories of Kevin ... alleged ... as a high school and college students\nReally cold out from former classmates that this is the Winnie wagging thing and the New York or New Yorker magazine which the New York times wouldn't touch because she told a bunch of or college friends that she didn't remember who act the way but then she went and told\nThe New Yorker that it was definitely Kavanaugh even though she couldn't remember days early she took six days to think about it consulted with lawyers\nAnd then went to the New Yorker with her story which is completely unverified by everyone and anyone that has been asked about it [noise]\nBecause ah well as two additional classmates of sexual misconduct Deborah Ramirez claimed I'm a a New Yorker that Kevin ahead exposed himself to earn an undergraduate at Yale University and Julie sweat neck\nA Julie sweating it represented by attorney and potential democratic presidential candidate Michael ...\nSuggested that Kevin ... had been present at parties where women were gang raped he actually said she said a lot more than that the Washington Post just water that down for because they're on the team and they're spending at four she settled she said he\nAnd a and it has a pound mark judge\nWere there and then when she was interviewed by Kate so on uh what was it will obey on ... on NBC she said well I Can't say that I saw him

who vowed to take out judge Kevin up and then they haven't let's go to the telephones and then I got to get to a bunch of audio and a couple of minutes of the fake news media people right now let's go to let's go to our friend I even in Prince George's County\nOn that hey I'm good how are you oh always good to talk to your welcome\nHey listen to the good news out of out of the cabinet confirmations\nYeah is that we can be guaranteed that Hillary will never be ... will never be appointed to an office where she got to be confirmed as a sexual you know as a sexual and as an enabler rabbit for rape is that a sexual predator she won't have to go through that but what could you imagine the FBI investigating that\nYou know that is a really great point if Hillary Clinton were up for a had to go through a confirmation process like this is Bill Clinton had to go through a confirmation process likes us imagine\nThat they wouldn't know that'll never happen\nFor a while that's a that's a fun part have Hillary that\nYeah her with her record on women bimbo Russians and and the whole smear\nChris I never was ill on anybody but man I saw the um the interview or Ruth on the I'm Ruth\nGinsburg yeah the gator yeah Rudy theater binge bird yeah\nSmash it looks so frail it looked like she might not make it through Trump Trump's term but but you never was yelling an antibiotic anyway I heard them talking about\nAnd Brett Kavanaugh was named never came up and Donald Trump's name I think never came up never came up certainly Brett Kavanaugh's that never three hours with 'em to liberals and in between\nYesterday and it was kind of a you know I wasn't an uneasy a truce or anything but we just didn't talk about politics and it was nice people that have been friends with for twenty some odd years\nAnd in two out of the three cases and uh and the and the third person a Brazilian a a Brazilian national Brazilian citizen Brazilian passport holder\nOr who is now here in us for a long time been in the United states yesterday was election day and Brazil and here's a fun fact to know until\nThat the news media doesn't talk about\nFirst of all the bigger right winger there who's like Donald Trump of Brazil did so well yesterday and the elections that that the fake media here has shocked by all of this\nBut my uh my friend with whom we had a brunch yesterday informed us that I think I knew at one point saying in Brazil is mandatory\n\nIt's not voluntary it's mandatory to vote there is a penalty if you do not vote in Brazil\nAnd they set up polling places that Brazilian embassies around the world here in Washington there's a big Brazilian population so they set up a polling place I think it was at the Capitol Hill non sixteenth street near the White House\nAnd Brazilians came down with Brazilian soccer jerseys and Brazilian flags and cheering and having a great time and then a patriotic event going in voting and a and B that you know socialist ... mostly left he's in Brazil over the last ... who knows how many years\nAnd they run the place under the ground corruption former leaders in jail Lula and all of this stuff and the crime is out of control the corruption is out of control the economy's outta control so they're um they may be voting in this very Donald Trump like character\n[noise] one of the people at the table said yesterday a of the uh of the conservative type running in Brazil um oh yeah he is the anti gay anti LGBT ... anti immigration anti anti this and I'm always a Trump like\nThat might be the one time that Trump's

college\nI I you know it's I I like I say it's you know the old saying to black thing you wouldn't understand I had a counter to that I still have a counter to that it's a white thing I have a high level of confidence that with a brief explanation you'll understand fully\nSay and when I explained the electro college and they function the importance of the electro college balancing power for the little guy\nFor the little guy in the United states which is what the electro college does it takes power out of the hands of the powerful and puts it in the hands of the less powerful it shifts power to the little guy that's what the electro college does in short\nAnd and that's one of the many reasons that the electro college is so important it without the electro college the Democrats could forget about all the people the deplorable ...\nYou know the working people of America that the Democrats hate so much that they referred to as ear regime of all like Hillary Clinton dust and deplorable the people in flyover country that's that's the Democrats just you know flush the toilet and their gulfstream jets over a flyover country hoping they'll hit someone\nAnd uh and their
