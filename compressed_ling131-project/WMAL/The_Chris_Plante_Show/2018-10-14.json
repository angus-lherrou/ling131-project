N. A. L. more Washington comes to talk\n[noise] [noise]\nThis is a wise investors show on the wise investor network [noise]\nWalking back to the show\nAt one place you can keep up with us when things are going on mid week is our Twitter account\nWe share articles and thoughts on there you can find us would have\nWise I end the underscore R. W. Baird okay a for a couple of weeks now sorry for a couple of years now really\nA few years it's been almost ten years I guess I've been telling the story of Albany International civil a I had been in our seminars talking about the radio this really goes back to the early days of the recovery from the recession in two thousand eight and nine and this company was in pretty bad shape but had a roadmap\nTo unleash a lot of value at that time maybe still the stock was depressed down below ten bucks a share and their core business this legacy business that built the company was not in good shape\nThat side of the business is manufacturing these giant rollers that go into these giant pieces of machinery that basically manufacturers all types of paper and it has to be ... specifically engineer for the type of ... you want\nThis stuff has to be very detailed and the industry but down here it's not just because the global economy stumped back then\nUh but also the demand for paper kind of had this continuous decline maybe it's leveled off I don't watch ... too closely but it was not a good place to be right then however while the paper business wasn't decline\nThat part of the business deal turned out tons of cash each quarter ... that cash was diminishing but it's still produce a copious amounts of free cash flow and it was paying the bills as their new business\nCash each quarter ... that cash was diminishing but it's still produce a copious amounts of free cash flow and it was paying the bills as their new business was getting off the ground\nAnd that's their engineer composites business in which they are or have basically go to the leading technology and the contracts with aerospace companies primarily to build parts for Boeing fuselage does and parts that go into jeeze jet engines\nAnd these are much higher margin bits that allow aircraft to run reliably lighter that allows the interest to be lighter than if they were using metal and be more fuel efficient\nFlashForward almost a decade and that business is now about a third of their sales and still ramping up because it's kind of these new age new generation of engines that are now being released so which one third now it's accelerating\nAs part of the whole while the paper business actually kind of leveled off in his holding his own however this is not a story about Albany International hope you didn't tune out yet\nThe point is it's a comparison with another name that's far well better better well known [laughter]\nBut has similar attributes and I believe offers a similar value opportunity today I'm\nWhen I'm doing here so I'm making up with an old girlfriend and I don't mean to sound sexist because the c._e._o. happens to be a woman I'm referring to the stock is the old girlfriend because it's one that Bert may pretty badly before but I'm going in for another look\nThe company is IBM and I think that today I Hope a lot of people to make a terrible face out there\nIBM story has a lot of similar attributes to what I was just describing in Albany and you would have made that face if you looked at Albany International ten years ago trust me\nFirst and foremost IBM's dirt cheap IBM's trading at about ten times both earnings and true free cash flow cheap enough that their dividend yield is it about four and a half percent today and they're expected to continue to grow that dividend annually in the mid single digits\nIBM's also sitting on about twelve to Thirteen billion dollars in cash and generating that much more each year the problem though is that their legacy businesses have continued to produce lower revenues just like that paper business\nIt's just weird exercise where our guys to analyze it actually because normally they're focused on cargo companies and the different segments and figuring out how fast those segments micro um and this one they got to figure out how much ... that likes the business might decline at\nHow much will the old core business segments declined over the next few years to actually still have a very large mainframe hardware business and while they spun off their personal computing business years ago they they were there were many hardware businesses pretty long in the tooth\nSo they're generating revenue generating free cash flow but it's less every year additionally\nThey were kind of late comers to this big war over cloud computing there are tons of competitors new space it it's hard to go up against Amazon Microsoft Google in article but IBM was late to the game but they've carved out a very important and unique niche there that's working really well from them\nThis is part of the trouble we rented to four years ago with IBM for what it's worth the stock was about thirty percent higher than when we change our two and a valuation today is a big part of the story\nBut up to that point IBM's management team at preached at every quarterly call that they were executing on their vision to deliver twenty bucks a Sharon earnings and two thousand and Fifteen\nThey said it so often that it became the base case for everyone's model a back then when I come back from the break I'll return to IBM what happened and why we like it now I'll be back in a few moments\nSo why is it best to show chase interesting you're hanging you are listening while he's invested show for sound advice about your personal financial situation eight six six seven five eight ... online wise investor group\nSix thirty and now\nThis is Michael ... here with my ... from health markets helping folks find the

if you're feeling a bit uneasy about how fast seem to have unraveled on the free ride this week well\nCheck out our website WWW dot the wives investor group dot com and and the upper part of the front page you'll see a contact us button and that's a good starting place to start a conversation with us about managing the risk for your savings [noise]\nMeeting all moving on the last question from last week's market is if this was the start of something bigger or is it just a speed bump along the way maybe it's just a a simple chicanery the road [noise]\nI Do think it's the latter because so much of the information we receive that which is real that which we take the heart is that U.S companies are still poised to do very well in the coming quarters\n[noise] but just as we had a fire drill in our own building last week please use this last week as a drill to think about the future don't ever enter a downturn full of regrets of course this doesn't mean you shouldn't be smart enough to raise copious amounts of cash from your stock portfolio 'cause you don't know what's going to happen\nBut you don't want to be left with the regret of saying well why do I own that or I should have taken profits there earlier why was I so greedy\nThis week was a dry run perhaps [laughter]\nBut you know don't go into it saying oh man I I shouldn't have been so greedy I should have taken action sooner\nHere it is this is your opportunity take action because\nThe market will go up for ever doesn't mean it's going to give it all back either that's not how the market works it's not a zero sum game all up and all down but we will eventually it whether it's next week or next year or whatever you may believe\nIt's not always going to be easy despite mostly good news on their earnings front a bit of volatility can quickly spiral like it did last week because of the program trading quickly take hold and I think that's\nA big part of what did happen last week and that's evidence sometimes and the speed that the tips also resolved themselves there are tremendous amounts of capital that's being traded in the markets today that's tied to algorithm mia\nFormulas that have layers of inputs based on triggers in the markets and once a bit of momentum gets going it starts to snowball\nUltimately the fundamentals will bring reason back to the battlefield earnings means something dividends means something results means something\nBut in the short period of time little spikes in interest rates a dip in it and an index below the a trip wire this virtual trip wire an economic data point that ... percent below what was prescribed in the formula\nAll these creates cell programs to kick in\nAnd they come in and they say well if this happens then the portfolio must reduce equity exposure by X percent\nAnd then that leads to the next guy's a trip wire cause this formula said well market goes down X percent plus one well then that were there now and it starts to snowball and that fact\nThere's not ... there's nothing really intrinsically evil about this you just have to know what you're looking at I mean\nThere were blips along the way but over longer periods of time all this program trading actually kind of fills in volume and I think over a longer period of time reduces volatility my favorite example is the Friday after Thanksgiving\nThe market doesn't like to be closed more than a four days in a row because they want investors to have access to the markets and read it basis case there's some news well the Friday after Thanksgiving no one would report to work it's only half day in the markets and be very volatile well\nNow we have these programs to try to keep things going\n[noise] but\nThese programs do move things around quite a lot and given period of the next twenty four to forty eight hours\nThey're not worried about their portfolios these formulas are not worried about the next six Eighteen months there minute by minute similar layers and the formula can engage to start buying that's why we've seen these wild than today swings I don't know if you've seen it maybe you're just seeing the final prince of the day\nBut the Dow\nThe Dow dropped five hundred points that are close to these massive swings hundreds of points within an hour and hopefully most of your not sitting there watching\nThe Dow dropped five hundred points that are close to these massive swings hundreds of points within an hour\nAnd hopefully most of your not sitting there watching it because it could be nerve wracking especially if you don't have your processes in place to defend yourself against that\nThis isn't to say though that all went well and we should therefore just by five percent pulled back like crazy there were and continue to be real fundamental challenges that would provide evidence that there's a risk of a slow down sooner than I expect\nActually one of the big triggers this past week and they were quite a few including interest rates but one of the big ones was back on Monday Night than ... cheap pre announce their earnings and saying that the third quarter results for no good and they're likely going to miss their estimates for the fourth quarter projections as well so you got to bring those and and they're going to continue to disappoint\nWell not only that slam obviously ... pretty good on Tuesday\nAnd then hit all similar businesses and similar way but then it starts to spread to anything resembling a material sector company on and to the transport and so on and so forth through the whole industrial sector [noise]\nPG is one of the world's largest coating manufacturers however while a paint company like showing Williams focuses almost entirely an architectural ... that's the paint that use on your house\nAnd industrial coding for a quick and ... has a much larger focused on selling paint to the auto manufacturers and coating using packaging and in the aerospace sector well those last bits had been badly impaired by the trends in those industries lately\nAnd I don't know if you notice but Ford last week announced that terrorists have cost them a billion dollars this year and they've idled twenty five hundred workers and says factor in Missouri right now and they're making plans for re are going to next year that's expected to reduce the overall headcount by about twenty five thousand employees\nOverall global auto sales have been weak and layer on top of that currency issues related to a very strong dollar\nAnd the PG find yourself squarely in the bull's eye of what's challenging in today's climate\nMeanwhile sure when Williams is largely in North America eighty percent of their sales are in the U.S and most of the remaining cells are in Canada Mexico which will actually benefit from New trade agreement\n... sales though are much more globally oriented forty two percent of their cells are in the U.S and Canada Seventy percent in Asia and thirty percent and Europe in the middle east so people just announced that they're suffering\nFrom what's half are happening in these softer economies and also from a weaker currency conversion rate along with we ought to demand but it spreads to the likes of sure when and others that have no real connection whatsoever except that they trade and the same basket when the trip wires are triggered for the cell program\nThis is a great example of what happened in a much bigger way this week but also why we can't just dismiss it out of hand as we now begin to kick off the third quarter earnings announcements season the biggest two words you gotta look for is something that looks sounds like margin impact\nImpact to margins\nThere's going to be a lot of talk on conference calls about currency foreign demand there is also going to be important talk of higher input cost commodity cos\nI failed to mention this with the paint guys they also cited higher input costs as a headwind for P. B. gee yeah sure when his always told us that moderately higher input cost higher costs on the stuff they put in the paint to make it glistening can easily be passed on to the end user along with something had it for themselves there\nBut as companies from various sectors start talking about issues challenging them today despite record revenues and record earnings\nAny notion that margins have peaked and we'll trend lower in the next year is likely going to whack that stock pretty badly this earnings season there are two basic things that put a price on the stock at the end of the day [noise]\nWhat you think they're going to earn it then at or next year\nOr if you want to justify something more fantastical maybe what the earning three years and then how much does that future earnings amount worth to you today this week we saw the combination of all these events that coming together to impact margins\nAre they're going to impact margins are the future value that range dollar the strong consumer end economy may keep top line estimates intact for now but the margin challenges may lower the end result and then also how much is that future earnings worth to you today\nAs interest rates trend higher\nThey have various ways in pairing the economy right I mean a company is borrowing costs alone are going to go up and that'll inhibits away the company can grow and and have it their margins consumers are inhibited by higher mortgage and borrowing costs maybe credit card cost [noise]\nInterest rates also make whatever your assets are paying today and dividends and interest seem a bit less attractive versus the new higher rate\nI mean a lot of people are seeing cash paying close to two percent CDs so that the evidence is therefore less attractive than it was at lower competitive rates [noise]\nIf you're discounting what some fast growing cash burning darling of a stock is going to earn three years from now by almost nothing\nPresident of rates if you're discounting what some fast growing cash burning darling of stock is going to earn three years from now by almost nothing\nIf you think the earn that proverbial dollar in three years and it's worth almost a dollar to today will then when you you end up with these crazy multiples in the stock today as you apply a discount rate that's higher to that future dollar of earnings\nThen that two thousand and Twenty one dollar isn't worth close to a dollar today maybe it's only worth sixty cents teach today and that's why you have to whack that stocks valuation and a half and why you get those companies get treated quite a lot worse and what we see\nBags\nOwe me you are\nWhat you can do to keep the old people simply not are\nYou by the ... clean alliance and the I'd go\nInto these tough economy goodwill greener Washington's mission is more critical but it's been in a few years and they need your help\nWhen you donate your clothing household items computers or vehicles good will your contributions provide job training and employment services to people with disadvantages of disability right here in our nation's capital and goodwill mix the bosses easy and convenient just stop by any good will attend a donation side\nOr the D.C goodwill dot org location near you that's D.C goodwill\nDot org please don't eat the good will today\nDo you feel if it were rich W a male washing\nDishes [noise]\nYou I'm a ...

assets\nEvery day there are opportunities identified in the stock market identified the futures market identify the forest market identified and options for people that are able to implement income strategies and the various markets\nThere's also a a an opportunity to interact with students from all around the world as well as our instructors and orange truckers are all professional traders and they give people the opportunity to start thinking differently about their money\nAnd in this day and age when more and more people are looking for a second stream of income whether it's in renting out real estate whether it's super driving or you know\nIt's one more and more people are looking for a second stream of income whether it's in renting out real estate whether it's super driving or you know charging these motor scooters that you see all over the place you know people are looking for other ways to generate income\nAnd there really is no better way to generate income than in the financial markets because part of this as it's not about giving you another full time job a part of this is how do you fit this into your life\nHow do you fit to send to your schedule and generate income\nCommensurate with that commitment that you're willing to make and you know whatever whatever it is you know whenever you get paid if you go work a second job you're going to get paid by the hour so maybe you get ten dollars an hour maybe get Fifteen dollars an hour maybe twenty dollars an hour but you really have an upper limit\nThrough our process when people come in decided to become a student at the online training academy you work with education counselor and what they'll do is really\nUnderstand what it is you're trying to accomplish and why and they'll get to know you and figure out you know what time do you have available for this and certainly have some people come in who have a lot of time control if they work at night or they were tired where they're business owners so they have significant amount of time on a regular basis\nTo focus on generating income in the market I mean one of things we know that everybody needs more income today\nBut one of the benefits of this business is that you have access to markets like the for X market which is the twenty four hour market so basically from Sunday evening to friday evening\nThere's an opportunity for you to set up your trades in the market you can also do it when the markets are closed as well you know for your more longer term trades and so there's opportunities no matter what time of day you're available\nAnd the futures market dissimilar it's basically a twenty three hour market and you can identify how do you how do you want to be structuring your time towards this particular business and you know what we find is actually the more time you spend\nIt then they can actually work against you so part of what your education counseling will do is actually help you carve out\nThe most effective time for you you know one of things we know that some people are night owls some people are early morning people some people do great in the middle of the day and so based on what time you have available that'll dictate what type of opportunities or you're looking for\nAlso as you generate a building up your own best business in the world it also has to fit you and kind of your style and so if you're you know really hyper kind of short attention span yeah there's going to be a shorter term trading will probably makes sense for you\nIf you're more patient than live longer term investing opportunities will make sense for you and there's many markets that you can engage from the forest market to the futures market to the stock market\nAnd understanding how to use options to really leverage or knowledge and leverage your assets to generate income in a safer smarter way and looking at your money a little differently you know you've been conditioned\nTo their accumulation investing model\nIs that you know you just got to build up and build up and you know millions and millions of dollars is what it's going to take and you know we have students that will say oh I Need six million dollars to retire I Need ten million dollars to retire any Fifteen million dollars to retire and that's true if you can only get three four or five percent on your money\nWas also true is that most people aren't going to have millions of dollars when they retire you know Ninety eight percent of people that were tired of this year will not have a million dollars and so it's not that the accumulation model doesn't work it just doesn't work for you\nAnd what you need to do is be more active with that money and find better opportunities where you can get the probability on your side we can leverage those assets and the understand how to manage your risk effectively and\nManage the risk and such a way that the reward that you're targeting is greater than any risk that you'll ever take\nAnd those three pieces are critical for you as you start building up your do it yourself and best for business and you know through our half they clash will be introduced to those and the ability to get probability on your side\nIs critical for people and we have a lot of people come and say I know I Love the markets I just don't know when to get in there when they get out well that's kind of the whole thing [laughter] so what\nOne of the things that we have is what we call our core strategy and what that does is allow you to identify safer places to bind safer places to sell with any instrument whether you're going for a short term trades or mid term trades are longer term opportunities\nAnd so by introducing this idea of probability it allows you to basically reduce your risk if you're having a higher probability opportunity\nAnd some more frequently you're going to be successful that'll help you and your overall business strategy\nAnd another thing that will help us figure out now\nAnd the tea and some more frequently you're going to be successful that'll help you and your overall business strategy and another thing that will help you with his finger at not just how to fit this into your schedule but also make sure that your assets are working for you and being more productive when you need them to be productive\nAnd you know my cousin called me a couple of weeks ago and we're talking about strategies and one of the things I introduced him to is that you know being in cash not being exposed to the market is a valid position\nAnd I know in the accumulation model is this idea that you always have to be invested and they'll say well if you if you miss the top ten days in the market each year\nThen he returns will be a lot lower well if you're also missed the top ten band days in the market your attorneys will be a lot higher and so part of it is we want you to be able to make knowing intentional moves with your money\nAnd a big part of treating with like a business and treating your finances like a business is that if you were more intentional our expectation is you're gonna have more businesslike returns with your money\nAnd if the goal is to be generating current income the goal is to be generating future income to be preserving what you've got\nAnd so what we're going to help you do is develop your own business plan and we refer to that as your six success plan and your education your education provider will he'll work with you and help you develop that really figure out what your motivation and what we're really looking for people that are willing\nTo open their mind up to a new approach so you have to be comfortable you have to be willing to accept that there's ways that are different and better than what you're doing\nAnd so being coach football is real important also you know being disciplined not doing whatever you feel like\nBut giving yourself the opportunity to start like applying a systematic approach and think about every business you've ever been involved with whether you started at McDonald's or anywhere else everywhere you go has a system\nLike there's a system for every job function for every businesses operating\nAnd so with your money one of the things that will help you do is develop your system for managing your money\nAnd you know by having your own individualized system that's going to allow you more freedom and more flexibility to really take advantage of this best business in the world and that's where by having your own system that you've proven to yourself works in a safe environment\nThen you're going to have a lot more confidence as you look for opportunities as a key part of how we teach you to become a do it yourself investor is when you're getting started you're going to learn our core strategy but more importantly you're going to actually apply our core strategy live in the market\nAnd by doing that in a safe environment even be applying the core strategy with our money and so we're putting our money where our mouth is and part of that is it gives you if you're using someone else's asset we know you're going to be more careful with it\nWhen it comes to people in their own money we realize that people take enormous risks because they really don't care about their money\nAnd I know that sounds funny of course I care about my money but the reality is we've we've been doing this for over Twenty years and we've seen that people take more care of someone else's money than their own\nSo a key part of our learning experience a key part of becoming a do it yourself investor is learning how to take care of someone else's money when you learn those skills and develop your systematic approach to respecting capital\nThen when you start using your capital you're going to be a lot more systematic a lot more careful and a lot more measured as you're looking for opportunities\nAnd so you know our our system our education system is designed\nTo get you to accept and understand risk and understand how to take advantage of risk and do it at your own pace on your own speed and when you're ready after you build up your confidence to develop your optimism than to start putting it into action and start taking advantage of the opportunities that surround us every single day\nAnd that that's part of it what makes this such a great business is that once you have that approach no one can take it from you\nAnd one of the things we hear all the time here you know no one teaches this in high school known teaches us in college and that's what makes the online training academy such a special place because we're a school for people who want to learn how to make more money\nOr school for people that are looking for income strategies\nTo solve their current income needs as well as their future income needs and there really is no other place like us\nAnd so part about wanting to introduce you to how we help people like you start developing the skills develop and the confidence developing the attitude that you know you deserve to be able to generate income you need\nAnd you don't need to ask someone else permission to be successful\nIt's up to you to put in the time and energy and effort so you can be successful as they do it yourself investor [noise] and now one thing\nPermission to be successful it's up to you to put in the time energy and effort so you can be successful as you do it yourself investor\nAnd at one of the things people always talk about is you know time control and this work life balance well if you can make money you need an hour in the morning and then you have twenty three hours to do what you want that's pretty good time control\nAnd if you want to be successful at this you have to give yourself a opportunity to learn how does this fit into my current lifestyle and we have some students that are actively engaged every single day\nAnd they are they're totally all in their focus not a lot of those folks are tired or preparing for retirement most of our students don't do that you know we have some students that will do this you know twice a week\nSo ... in my classroom or hit the nail on the head because this was this was quite funny just they're just a couple of days ago I was telling a student I go you know there are there are four levels of competence\nMeaning for levels of understanding level number one is unconsciously incompetent\nWhere you don't know you don't know nobody knows knows therefore you have no idea\nNear circle of friends don't know so you'll never know yeah second level is unconsciously competent where you think you know but this is third party stories where you still have no idea but nobody you know still knows and so you really don't know and it's just their party stories [noise]\nThe third level is consciously incompetent and this is where this was a really good state for us as people to be especially when it comes to our finances and and these major life decisions because what a lot of people are starting to realize very quickly in our in our classes\nIs that this is a really good healthy place to be because again they'll they're able to connect the dots of why they're not achieving certain financial goals whatever it might be to this skill set as you know translates into ... and the different aspects of our life not just our finances but anyway it comes back to\nConsciously incompetent where people start to realize that yeah maybe I don't know as much as I thought I knew a but then also they get to see somebody with the the training and experience behind what it is that we're doing and that is the level of consciously competed and\nAnd when I was in a lot of the people listening a lot of our students they know that what they're doing isn't working you know they know that\nThey've been getting a cup you know three percent a year the market's going up ten percent they're getting three percent markets up three hundred percent they've gotten maybe a hundred percent\nAnd they know that what they're doing isn't working isn't going to get them to a hundred they just don't believe or realize that there is a path of education that will provide for them to get better results\nThat's right and most people are afraid to step through that door because we have all bought into the same system and leave it up to the professionals well once people do allow themselves the opportunity to do at least come in and see what we do and how we do it it's a much different story from there\nAnd they know how I got started in this business so I've been trading for\nAt the time about eight years and I haven't ... account with Charles Schwab ... and I got a call and Charles Schwab guy said oh we want to come in and we can review your finances and it's a great here's a guy who really knows what he's talking about life and I'm going to go in and I sit down and my wife comes in\nAnd I sit there and within five minutes so it was like this guy had no idea what I have done and has no idea how to actually make any money right and that was part of my motivation I was like\nThere is a huge opportunity to help people do this the right way\nYeah and I've had that happen before too and and even being in the industry myself having worked for a couple of different brokers out of Chicago\nAnd an uh an uh well actually both of them were based out of Chicago um you know what a lot of people don't realize is that those financial advisors broker dealer you know it's not a good person batters and conversations more so they have a job to do their job is to put them in the funds that their company need them to get rid of\nMan generally Hi fi higher expense and the thing that's changed over certainly in the last Fifteen Years right but they're the value that you're paying for isn't very high no and and basically you know if you're ... most of the most of what they're trying to give you some it's tracking the market\nBut he ended up not doing as well as the average because the fees and expenses and all these other timing things so they're putting you in a below average investment and you get to pay above average fees\nRight and that's not yeah most of them don't include a the rate of inflation too when you get when you ... that in a lot of people now start to realize\nWow this is where my money's going and no wonder why I'm not where I Need to\nClose just like cable t._v. right I mean if if you paid a hundred dollars a month for cable TV and you only got one channel would you keep paying for it not at all [laughter] right or a veil a once in a while and you would definitely cut the cord\nAnd you know if you're paying for a premium service you expect a premium result exactly and I think that's the fundamental problem is that you're paying for premium service and getting below average results that's right and what a lot of people don't realize\nExactly and I think that's the fundamental problem is that you're paying for premium service and getting below average results that's right and what a lot of people don't realize is the time commitment that the brokers have nowadays versus\nTwenty thirty forty years ago has been cut in in in third matter of fact they're spending a third of the time managing people's portfolio but still charging the same amount of money that they were way back when\nAnd but even let's get back to any other service like any other service that you are paying a premium for if you got bad service what would you do\nGet out when we turn it off yeah right an RV or if you went to a restaurant and they wanted to charge you a hundred bucks and you've got a hotdog what would you do for another on a whole bunch of hotdogs and so it's just part of the people have been bamboozled into thinking that they're it's okay to pay a premium\nAnd get below average results right and you know and\nAnd the lows long of it is is is one of the things that are students realize you know it it it's your money and you're going to make the decisions you want to you and so one of the things that I always tell my students is is you know if if you came here to change and then let let's show you how to do that because obviously um there is room to room for improvement and what a lot of people also realize is\nIs that in a lotta times they are doing a lot of things right\nEven if they're making some uh individual decisions but uh if if they are at their at least open minded to tweak a couple of things a little bit my goodness gracious to the the type of strategies that are open up formed a type of ah [noise]\nUm the opportunities are are are just endless and what a lot of people also realizes that ultimately they might not need that

out and shooting up so if you have a fixed mortgage that may not impact you however if you're ever plan to apply\nFor credit for a new car your credit cards will probably go up so interest rates going up have the potential to impact you but they really have a massive impact on the companies that have been borrowing like mad in the low interest rate environments in the last ten years\nAnd so as interest rates go up and there's some threat to these companies that have been borrowing borrowing and borrowing\nAnd the interest that basically they're increase interest bills will impact their

N. A. L. L. back to the underwriters quarter with Bill ...\nBack to the underwriters quarter while we were on the brake I got a call from a young lady no she didn't want to come on the radio she was to bash will but she had a question she said bill if it's so easy to qualify you for a a mortgage you know what what price range you should be in\nDo I really have to talk to a loan officer and let me give you there's a couple of reasons why you do but let me give you the basic one first is she said that her and her husband make about eighty five thousand dollars to gather a as their income so that's about seven thousand dollars a month\nAnd using that that ratio that I gave you thirty five percent so thirty five percent of seven grand is twenty four fifty\nAnd as long as she and her bills can't be more than about seven hundred dollars a month minimum payments on her bills or one of her bills were nine hundred dollars or what what uh what if the payment that she wanted to go to was instead of twenty four fifty was twenty six hundred [noise]\nWell then that's where you need the expertise civil loan officer and then maybe even the underwriter because you can push those ratios depending on the rest of your circumstances you know I might not be able to count your overtime because you haven't been working for two years\nBut maybe I can use it as a compensating factor to let you make a payment of twenty six hundred dollars instead of twenty four fifty or a there are there are so many other things to or maybe you're a second job\nOr you haven't been working a second job for two years but you are working it for the past year you have more income coming in I can use it as a compensating factor or maybe your rent is only Fifteen hundred dollars a month but you've been able to save a thousand dollars a month extra\nAnd ... and you can show me that you couldn't afford this kind of a payment so there are and if you if you stumped the loan officer they will bring your situation to me or one or the other underwriters just say can I push this thing instead of thirty five percent can I push it to forty percent [noise]\nCan I pushed aback ratio with the bills can I pushed that up a little bit they have a little bit more bills and they're supposed to happen again it depends on the whole case\nSo that's why you need a loan officer to put you in the right ballpark but the ratio of thirty five percent gives you a starting place\nAnd the reason I had the loan officers in the office is I Want you to get their their name and their cell phone number so that when you play now you know what like this lady here was qualified for about three hundred and fifty thousand dollar house\nOkay well maybe she finds a house with three twenty [noise] she wants to pick up the phone and called alone is I I Know what my payment would be three\nOkay well maybe she finds a house with three twenty [noise]\nShe wants to pick up the phone and call the loan officers I I Know what my payment would be a three fifty but I found a house for three twenty what would my payment be and this is how much the taxes are in the house but she has a direct line to the loan officer so that she can do that\nThat's why I have all the loan officers in the office for you and again no money from you know credit card and there's no obligation this is how you get started\nThere eight hundred number is three two one five three two one five five five give them a call get their name and cell phone number give them some basic information takes about a minute on the phone with them\nGive them permission to run your credit report so that they have your debts in front of them and they can say okay this is what your debts are this is what your monthly minimum payments are\nAnd tell me a little bit about your income and you know if you stumped them they'll bring me the case and say bill can I push this thing a little bit you know she's qualified for three fifty but they found a house that they really want to put a contract and on and it's going to be three sixty seven\nAnd St underwriting and getting approved for alone you know if I say you're you're approved for three fifty it doesn't mean that you can't buy a house for three fifty two or three fifty four or three sixty even it puts you in a ballpark just start then I'd have to look at everything else\nYou know maybe your credit is excellent maybe you have some assets left over after you go to a settlement maybe you have a second job maybe you get over time that I'm not using um any of these things here I can push you into a better position if you found a house that you wanted to go over the general\nThing of thirty five percent and that's why you need a loan officer if you're serious about looking at houses you know it's not black and white underwriting is an art\nLook at my whole situation you know I have I have something over here that's a compensating factor that would get me some more if I needed that that you stay under those ... those guidelines well then you're ... you're probably fine but at least it puts you in the ballpark of what you should be looking at on the Internet\nThat's how you go out and buy a house and then you have other than the second issue that I found out this past week\nBut concerned a lot of people well that was the first thing that was a major thing where do they start looking at houses\nBut the second thing is what about cash how much cash do I need and that's what's been stopping me well there are so many different programs that you can get into a house and I mean this literally you can get into a house and not need a penny out of your pocket\nNow you can't even rent an apartment and not need any money\nI mean what what our apartments twelve hundred bucks a month well you need the first month's rent you need another twelve hundred dollars with a security deposit if they let you have a pet they probably want to pet deposit so you need a good twenty five hundred dollars to rent even an apartment\nThey literally are programs where you can buy a house and not need a penny and everybody knows I think the uh for a veteran VA is the best program around but it's only for our veterans\nAs a veteran you can buy a house you can negotiate the cellar to pay your closing costs and ... what are your ... your ... page of the taxes that you pay for the year and your homeowner's insurance policy and then you have all your closing costs well let's say you're buying a a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar house\nAnd your closing costs in pre pays are going to be twelve grand\nOkay well you can negotiate the seller into paying the twelve grand how do you do that gives them more money for the house put it in your thirty year loan when you put it in your thirty year loan every thousand only changes your payments by five dollars in about twenty nine cents a month\nSo even if you add five thousand dollars to the sales price that's only going to change your payment by twenty six dollars did you know that\nDid you know that you could add five thousand dollars so many people have negotiated with the seller you know they're trying to buy this house and they come real close and they get within two thousand dollars and they walk away\nAnd I said did you realize that two thousand dollars I mean two thousand dollars a lot of money but when you're putting it in a thirty year alone\nTwo thousand dollars changes your payment by about ten dollars and fifty cents a month that's all I when I tell people that they say that I've seen I've seen the so wise look at the husband as I get lost by house for ten bucks a month\nFor ten bucks a month but they didn't realize that two thousand dollars men ten dollars a month\nAnd if you know that going in then you can have a better attitude of negotiating and you know if you are going to offer the seller five thousand dollars less than he was asking but instead of doing that you gave him five thousand dollars more\nOkay that's a swing of ten thousand dollars that's going to change your payment by about fifty one\nThousand dollars more okay that's a swing of ten thousand dollars that's going to change your payment by about fifty one bucks a month but now you don't have any closing cost a prepaid to pay and if you're a veteran there's no downpayment\nSo I'm going to talk about other programs to where you still don't you don't have to be a veteran and you're still don't need any money out of your pocket if you want to get started grab one of these loan offices you have them all in the office there eight hundred number is three two one\nFive ... five give them a call get their name and cell phone number and get yourself started we'll be right back after a quick\nBreak first preference mortgage is your local ... not a ... year low this process and underwritten in house for over twenty five years first preference mortgage has been helping first time homebuyers homeowners look at a refinance with their hands on approach officers are available when you are nights and weekends during the day\nOf course the option to me with a ... loan officer has its benefits especially for first time homebuyers big it actually all of your option slowly thirty year fixed rate is the most common program do take the time to go over other programs that could benefit your person leaves you alone process started today and learn more head first preference dot com that's first headlines\nThat you wouldn't be able to buy a house just like the veteran and not need a penny out of your pocket now who would rented apartment if I said to you you couldn't buy within your means that you find out what you qualify for\nAnd it won't cost you a penny to buy a house\nNow who would who would walk away from that and yet so many people don't even know about this program it's called USDA rural rural development style roar oh don't be a circle but roar oh it doesn't mean where there's more cows than people you have to the here's the restrictions that you don't have would be a [noise]\nYou can't buy within the big cities limits so you can't buy within the city limits but you can buy one block outside of that\nSo depending on what county you're in\nYou might be able to buy in half the county you might be able to buy in the whole county in another county or maybe you have to look and see where the city limits are and you have to buy one block outside of that so that's a restriction of the veteran doesn't have\nBut if you know where to look that doesn't mean you look in bad areas we're not talking bad areas here we're talking just outside the city limits\nSo if you're in a county that doesn't have a large city uh then then you could probably buy and the whole county\nIt's called USDA rural development why is it so great well just like the veteran you can negotiate with the cellar to pay all of your closing costs and your ... how do you do that same way the veteran does don't go down the price so much you know if the cells asking two hundred and you were going to offer one Ninety five\nDon't do that given two oh five\nBut then ask them to pay ten thousand dollars of your closing costs and ... that's the same as if you gave him one Ninety five you're giving them two oh five and saying but I Want you to pay ten grand\nOkay but you what you've done that is put it into a thirty year loan and that'll change your payment by fifty bucks but now you don't have closing costs in pre pays you've wiped out that ten thousand dollars\nAnd what do you need left only the down payment and with ... with a VA loan and with the USDA rural development there is no downpayment\nSo if you buy a house with two hundred and thirty thousand dollars I'm going to give you the whole two hundred and thirty thousand dollars you buy a house with three hundred and Seventy thousand I'm going to give you the whole three hundred and Seventy thousand [noise]\nSo I said that the you know the USDA has a little bit of restrictions the first major restriction is where you can buy an every county if you want to know where that is called the office talked to a loan officer again they're eight hundred number three two one\nFive five five five you say hey loan officer I'm interested in bill was talking on the radio about the USDA rural development where in the county this is where I'm looking at this county ... county\nWhere in this county would I have to look for houses that I can use the USDA rural development you might be surprised the loan officers anywhere in the county you want\nOr he might say well she might say only in half the county and here's the map of the county I'll give you the website for it this is the half of the county that you can look in or no there's a big city right in your county you have to buy outside of this line limit and you know now you know where to look\nAnd if you're looking to buy a house and say well I really like to buy a house if I get in for nothing okay well the only restriction is you might have to look at houses that are in you know a half a mile away from where you were looking\nAnd you could buy any house in that area\nAgain now there's a second restriction it's not for somebody making three hundred thousand dollars a year they figure if you're making that kinda money you can afford a small down payment but I'll tell you something the restrictions on income is pretty generous\nFigure if you're making that kinda money you can afford a small down payment\nBut I'll tell you something the restrictions on income is pretty generous it goes by how many people are in your household\nSo if you are to people and you have maybe three kids Europe is your family of five and you would qualify for a lot more income if you're just two people you'd qualify for too if you are to people in a child or one person and three children you'd qualify as four\nAnd every county has a little the little uh matrix and they tell you how much should qualify for some counties you can make up a hundred to a hundred and forty thousand dollars and still qualify if you're a family of five [noise]\nIn some counties you can go up to a hundred and eleven\nAnd some counties you could only go up to eighty nine thousand if you're just a a you know to people you can only go up to eighty nine thousand in some counties\nSo you need to find that out you have all of the loan officers in the office find out where you would have to look and you two could buy a house just like a veteran without a single penny out of your pocket\nGive them a call their eight hundred number three two one\nFive ... five five don't let them leave there without you getting their name and cell phone number even if this is not a good time to talk to them you can call them back later what tomorrow or when you have more time eight hundred three two one five ... five five they yelling at me take another break we'll be right back\nIn
