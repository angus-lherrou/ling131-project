uh Lindsey Graham ... and it's the it's full of liberals the audience is full of liberals sits in Atlanta convention Jeffrey Goldberg amount and they fight a bunch of left us some of them actually had a baby organs in their pockets and he says I think [noise]\nAnd Lindsey Graham decided to try it out the light about a hundred dollar bill through a trailer park and the audience responded very negatively and Jeffrey Goldberg jumped in and he didn't want to say oh don't worry about it that's what we said about all of the women accusing Bill Clinton of rape and sexual abuse\nThey didn't say that he kind of mumbled something oh it's somebody else's life or something but he didn't want the stupid audience who didn't know the line\nTo be told that it was James Carville a speaking on behalf of Bill Clinton smearing women that are have accused him very credibly\nA and consistently over the years of terrible sex or sexual abuses including out not rape not playing hop on pop has a Fifteen
