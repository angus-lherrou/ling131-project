basement [laughter] I Can't prove it [noise]\nBut the accusation is good enough right I Am not the standard that we go by one of the things that I'm hoping is that when all of this as over that uh and and that's not going to be impossible dream I think I'm tilting at windmills but that when all of this is over\nThat we will be allowed to return as a country to the western norms that had been in place and our civilization for eight centuries or so\nUh where you are innocent until proven guilty\nBy a court of law and a jury of your peers\nWhere you are innocent until proven guilty\nBy a court of law and a jury of your peers a presumption of innocence should be restored to our\nLegal system into our political process and our media is orderly and capable of shame of course but if they were capable they they should be horribly ashamed of themselves for their performance and they're not even going to pull it across the finish line for the Democrats\nYeah so that they got these ... and that was just about organizing that was about putting together the mailing lists and saying uh putting together the cannon fodder so they can flip a switch on\nInstagram or Facebook or whatever and get all these lose to travel across the country to stand in front of government buildings for the media and a look like idiots and they've got more than their share\nThere are some Seventy year old white guy with a grey beard standing behind the guy with the economy T shirt and he's got a T shirt on and says stand with black women or is a Seventy something year old white guy with a grey beard and he's got to stand with black women say he's got race and gender and there is a this racist and gender\nOr you know ... how do you get race and to this debate well just ask a liberal then we can go to ... powers from this morning who's a Democrat she's actually from Alaska a cure cure certain powers\nAnd she she seems a little trouble to these days I've got to say she seems\nStressed out to the point where the shoes trouble and I got to do this but they are confirming Brett Kavanaugh is going to break the spirits of so many on the left and so many of the Democratic party\nAnd I you know why don't you because they don't believe in getting laws passed through the legislature\nThey believe in suing and putting everything in the courts and they believe in stacking the Supreme Court\nTo their advantage in their favor now that you know getting Hillary Hillary what's going to do that she was going to put\nMost said tongue on the on the Supreme Court and forever after we would be dismantling the constitution of the United states America\nBut we had been looking to save the constitution and deny the left the Supreme Court and all we ask of our justices once they're seated is that they protect and defend the constitution of the United states America respect the laws of the United states America not legislate from the bench that's all we ask them the\nDemocrats' demand that they legislate from the bench this is of course while the Supreme Court is so important to them it's the ultimate prize for them not the president said because that comes and goes but the Supreme Court much more long lasting effects\nAnd because they choose not to look at Brock Obama highly avoided putting things through the the Congress through the legislature then instead did everything by executive order by executive the odd them through the departments and the agencies and a while his allies out here and crazy land\nPower filing lawsuits all over the place that they they spend their lives and their careers just filing lawsuits and following them up through the court system and getting the Supreme Court in ... the Supreme Court than uh than it's when when you know winter winter chicken dinner for them ding ding ding all over the place and that's why they're so upset about being denied\nThis fifth seat from the Supreme Court the swing vote on the Supreme Court and then Ruth Bader Ginsburg I Know is going to retire\nVery very soon I'm just I'm just a girlfriend on the Democrats here but she I think she's going to have to return she might have to retire and I think we should ever impeached I think we should start\nAn impeachment movement against Ruth Bader Ginsburg who must step down as a Supreme Court justice because there have been accusations of impropriety illegality even on her part now there's going to have to be an investigation and in the meantime she's going to have to step down from the court for the good of the court and the country [noise]\nMuch cure sitting powers this morning\nUm they've got this guy out here stand with black women to wear any black women accusers now they're just like to inject race and everything\nAnd they they like to polarize everything it's identity politics it's a year and this bucket and I'm In that bucket and we'll have to fight with each other [noise] ah the genders have to be at each other's throats all fifty eight of them apparently\nNow I'm we've got one gender and the Democrats or a ... a you know have a sixteen for mailed us then we have women and they've got another forty eight for that\nThey literally have on Facebook fifty eight genders fifty eight genders that you can choose from\nThis happened because of ... and and all that but there and say here's ... powers are very very for Lauren about all of this and she's pressuring Earl pressuring Senator Lisa Murkowski the Alaska Republican to vote against there's a lot of pressure a lot of pressure\nBut Democrats yesterday I flew in a team of absolute two women from Alaska Eskimo women if you will from Alaska\nAnd uh they are shamed Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska Republican into\nIf you will from Alaska and uh they are shamed Senator Lisa Murkowski the Alaska Republican into coming at a meeting with these native women from Alaska that were flown in by the Democrats they're not afraid of flying and they're\nHere to pressure Lisa Murkowski to fly her and do with her and took players are just like a a a Bette Midler said to two and flavor and to beat her and pull her and um and into voting with the Democrats than she may or may not\nJoe mentioned on the other hand from West Virginia the Democrat may vote in favor of Brett cabinet and the card count as looking very good for the Republicans very good Mike Pence may have to come in and break the tie up the Republicans can only get fifty Republicans only have fifty one votes if they lose they could lose one vote\nThey could lose one that can lose Lisa Murkowski as long as they hold on to Jeff Flake and Susan Collins silk puts them at fifty then the vice president who's the president of the Senate ten come in and be the deciding vote that gives it fifty one and then the Democrats pulled the\nDetonation chords on their suicide vests inside the Senate chamber and their splattered all over the ceiling and it's a and we can all laugh and clap from home and it'll be a real funny and all that stuff [noise] there's some powers\nTalking about this feels very strongly and and I just it's amazing how they can racialized anything the Democrats are the biggest racist in our country certainly outside our country racism has a lot worse\nContrary to what the Democrats would tell you a but here it is how do you racialized story that's about an all white people\nI totally understand somebody meaning that I think we all go back and watch Clarence Thomas a response or in a similar situation and who are currently at fat that he didn't act the way\nThat cabinet dad and I think that a lot of people look at that professionally women and people of color and pay for that hadn't been a white man doing that I think that people would have a very different reaction to it\nYeah that's a while but it was a white man so ah [laughter]\nI wouldn't go back and look at Clarence Thomas had see he behaved as he should have and and she's saying well we Democrats were going to call your child rapists and gang rape posts and serial rapists and\nSay that you're drug teenage girls and gang raped them uh and you shouldn't lose your cool otherwise you know that's a I I look for it they're going to be a lot of paid back\nFor this from me at dinner tables and things and in casual conversation with Democrats and with liberals there's going to be a lot of pay back for years over this\nFor years over the gang rape quail lewd thing years going on for two years a young Fifteen year old Brett Kavanaugh with his ... club striped tie\nWas apparently slipping quite loads to teenage girls and gang raping them at parties dozens of parties over the course of years it's been years and that was his Fifteen year old self and still he was valedictorian or whatever of as a class\nCalled them as they racial I said well you know Clarence Thomas really that's the way we want them to behave that's why we expected him to bed we didn't expect them to hit back where we are hitting back All right so you sit down and shut up about that one just to start with that you know on the sea cruise\nOr we have an annual sea cruise the ... we called the ... plant secrets and nice people come along\nAnd there was a a nice ... very nice couple I was talking to and I won't use any names the nice lady nice lady\nAre said to me you know Chris Shays said um why why Trump and why voted for Trump and why voted for Trump and and I said why and she said very pointedly because I was tired of being told to shut up\nAnd I think there are many millions of us that feel precisely like that I I think she articulated\nVery eloquently what millions of us are feeling and this whole exercise was an effort by the Democrats to shut everyone up\nBy bringing in gang rape and ... and attempted rape and one piece bathing suits and Nineteen eighty two or whatever you're it might have been and sleazy lawyers with spiky her cuts and\nCreepy lawyers with beards and Michael ... the creepy porn lawyer and stand and these women making outrageous ... outrageous and and you know\nThere's the the thing another lesson learned here and the media\nPeople still believe the media people still believe what they see an CNN people still believe what they see on MSNBC than when CNN and MSNBC tells people\nThat I you know this is a very real out gang rape and quail ... cents for years than this woman has very credible and when a evidence comes out that they're not credible them the news media just ignore that ends up on the cutting room\nFor years and this woman has very credible and when a evidence comes out that they're not credible do in the news media just ignore or is it that ends up on the cutting room floor [noise]\nUm they're one of the lessons is that the news media can still convince millions of people have a false it\nOr a series of fall surge in this case and there are people in this country that will go to their graves believing whatever it is that they were told over the course of the last couple of weeks getting rich sure I'll buy into that through a cup of ice on somebody yeah you bet\nOh I'm Sorry I'm On the other thing is that I'm now it it's our turn Mitch McConnell's done by a grass has gotten a fight and God Knows that our president has fought right\nLike crazy and take and how many slings and arrows twenty four seven so it is our turned to stand up and vote and court these people who fought for\nUs and we need to fight for them and show the Democrats what democracy looks like you that it was beautiful that\nWas just perfect boy that was

Republican a moderate middle of the road Republican from Maine a lot of pressure to vote against\nHad reviewed the FBI documents said she found the documents the FBI ... to be thorough\nI'm senator Collins and um and Fox News is now reporting that senator Collins is a yes and and uh that is good news that was that on this procedural vote or on the ah the final final I think it's on the final final\nAnd that's very important because you know the balance in the center is fifty one Republicans I'm forty nine Democrats\nOne of them as Bernie Sanders he's a communist he calls himself an independent he's really a Democrat what's the difference\nSusan Collins apparently now a yes according to Fox News and then we have Jeff Flake the aptly named Jeff Flake who caused the ah the delay and um I gotta tell ya if Jeff Flake votes against if he ends up being the deciding vote bringing down the cabinet nominations\nA he'd better learn to speak Spanish because uh this is going to be no country for him\nAfter that I Believe that Jeff Flake would vote yes that effectively wins the day because that would put them at fifty and then if\nFor some reason Lisa Murkowski the wishy washy Republican from Alaska who's being pressured by ...\nOr if she votes no then they still have fifty votes theoretically and\nUm then the vice president Mike Pence can come in and bring up the fifty one and when the day it's also possible that the Democrat from West Virginia Joe mansion who is not completely irrational like most Democrats these days may come in and also West Virginia President Trump won by thirty some points\nIn the presidential election so it's kind of approach trumped state and it might be good for his political a longevity of the vote in favor of President Trump in West Virginia Joe Manchin may come over a which would alleviate the need for Mike Pence to come in and break the tie and also that would be really good because it would make it a bipartisan vote\nThere would make it a bipartisan votes had Lisa Murkowski should vote in favor of a judge Kavanaugh she should she may not she should\nTheir flogging her they're whipping her they're bringing in ... women
