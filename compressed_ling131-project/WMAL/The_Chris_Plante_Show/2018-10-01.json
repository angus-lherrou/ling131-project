an attack and mock Brett Kavanaugh\nNow now and again they left out the actual funny stuff which is the idiot Democrats senators blather ring daughter ring a Patrick Leahy and Sheldon Whitehouse with deep and probing questions about booth failing view\nI don't know if it's a book or move how do you pronounce that yeah it's a really good question you've really elevated the the level of uh\nBut the level of a Senate debate with your son he's he's like a new star the Democrat Party because the dumber you are the faster you rise in the ranks of the Democratic party type So Matt Damon\nWas tapped by Saturday Night live to come on night before last and attack and mock\nUm just judge Kevin I Know mocking of the idiot Democrats of\nOf the dinosaur nature of the big lacerations on lay he's at the booth thing and drinking games and now it again if it were a Republican senators going after a Democrat nominee Senate live would have a field day mocking the idiot senators what they're idiots lines

coaches his daughters grammar school basketball team which\nUSA Today now says that you got to keep them away from the kids because he is is the Democrats are the cheers accused him of being a child rapist you have to keep in mind [noise]\nSo that's that's what they do USA Today does the unsinkable portrays Kavanaugh as possible pedophile who shouldn't coach that's the u._s._a. today a story\nAnd uh this one has actually written up a business pack review about the u._s._a. today story without citing a single piece of evidence USA Today ran a sensational column friday that suggested Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh is a pedophile who poses a danger to young girls\nNow um I you know the party of a of the list\nIs long [noise] uh I gotta Brett Kavanaugh testified the other day that he might never coach girls basketball again\nSports reporter Eric Brady typed he shouldn't at least not until further investigation has concluded the U.S Senate may yet confirmed Kevin under the Supreme

big the lies are here gigantic the White House is using the FBI the FBI was asked by the Democrats to investigate but they needed White House approval because the FBI is an executive branch agency and doesn't work for the Congress the Congress is already investigating I Know that\nAnd they lie about that being irrelevant because they live all the time\nAnd a and here's Matthew Miller and and it's yeah it's a big uh good he's housekeeping\nUm stamp of approval he says and this is so limited it's not limited there there are just they couldn't be more full of it and now they're starting conspiracy theories and this guy this Obama administration rancor Matthew Miller\nHe worked at the Justice Department which was so corrupt during Obama under\nHolder Michael Brown an\nDarren Wilson who's still in hiding because of the murderous threats of the Democrats and uh I let you know the Justice Department under Brock Obama Loretta Lynch and me and the phony dossier and uh this guy I I just smell corruption is he smells like corruption all over the place\nSo he's got conspiracies peddling conspiracies now and the White House was using the FBI now again you do what the Democrats ask you to do your call for a White House investigation and then they accuse you of you\nIt gives you of using the FBI to rubber stamp your investigation you can't deal with people like this in a
