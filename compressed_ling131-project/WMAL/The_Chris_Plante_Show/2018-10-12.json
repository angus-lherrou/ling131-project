...\nKind of fascinating the soldier amount to show you a story he's ... he's a Saudi citizen\nAnd uh say is a permanent us resident but he doesn't live here permanently and he's written a few things for the Washington Post so now they say that he's a reporter for the Washington Post he was never reporter there was a columnist on and on the news media is lying about it all over the place and apparently it's all Donald Trump's fault because Donald Trump\nJust wants that Saudi money so he's going to let them kill anybody they want just like broccoli Obama did kill American citizens overseas without due process but that was okay because it was also slowing the rise of the oceans and that made it\nBetter [noise] but that ... story has kind of a fast they're fascinating story and I got a couple\nOf a couple of thoughts on that a couple of articles on that didn't you know that ... has a link to some uh bin Laden not one links links to Osama bin Laden did you know that\nThere's you know that Jamal ... show has links to the Muslim Brotherhood that you know that long time links to the Muslim Brotherhood and that he has spoken out against ... and Saudi Arabia a strict form of of Islam a buddy only ... and the only reason he's done that is because the Muslim Brotherhood\nAnd the ... hobbies are in conflict with one another and he's a Brotherhood guy so it's probably a bronco Obama supported the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt over Arthur\nBrotherhood in Egypt over our thirty year ally Hosni Mubarak could kept the peace in the middle east for a generation a rock Obama betrayed him Mubarak ended up in prison and all of our allies in the region and around the world went running for cover\nWhen they saw rock bottom of doing that but never mind all that a couple of interesting things about this ... the whole law chop chop square a thing\nUm the interesting things that I Want to get into engineering ... anybody remember the famous arms dealer famous arms dealer not a lot of famous arms dealer but ah I ... was\nOne famous arms dealer a Saudi arms deal and the Nineteen eighties made a lot of news for a variety of reasons and it turns out ... is the cousin of a non ... and um and there are some interesting ties there a non\n... cousin is on it you know there's a lot of that going on over there are a lot of his cousins and uncles and nephews stuff going on in Saudi Arabia but is is a cousin of non ... who's now deceased [noise] um which means that um he's related to the ... the family\nYou know do the al ... who killed the Princess Diana so there is I think there's room for all kinds of Internet conspiracy stuff here and I'll get into well I'll get an ... not the Internet conspiracy stuff but some of that stuff\nA little bit later on this morning as well and in the meantime we we need you know next time a Democrat wins the White House I assume it'll happen some day\nIt remember when Obama was the end of the Democrats were saying the Republicans would never win the White House again\nThat's because that lie all the time because they they have a fertile imaginations says why they're run Hollywood and they do a lot of dress up and make believe sometimes just at home behind closed doors with the curtains close but sometimes in Hollywood and on TV and in the movies and stuff too\nAnd um they said that the Republicans would never owned the White House you got to never control Congress again and it's just because they lie about everything all the time but the next time there's a Democrat in the White House and and they are presumably will be\nUm and it will be a terrible day for humanity when that happens but it it's likely to happen anyway we need to form like Romney's raiders and ah you know the McCain resistance front and then whoever the Republican as that loses to the Democratic presidential race\nNeeds to form a resistance group pay cell group an underground network of operatives inside and outside the government\nTo do everything they can to disrupt\nA the agenda of the Democratic president and destroy them as a party and destroy their ah people their leaders their followers their family members destroy them all and all the while Brett Kavanaugh will be at a homeless shelter feeding the poor the indigent the needy\nBecause he's a good and decent man whereas Bill Clinton with a cigar in the White House it's like a colonel mustard and the and the library with a ranch but it's Bill Clinton and the oval office with a cigar and and I love all these fraudulent clown\nA left these yesterday that Kanye West says ... disgrace to the oval office and they're sitting there wearing Bill Clinton T shirts and they said they got Bill Clinton underwear on\nThese reporters when they said is and I love that you know they

we get to that Michael Eric Dyson who ah you know what what is the a white supremacist Ventura liquid seven assist\nOr whatever I ... like say things right and um and you may remember that Michael Eric Dyson awhile back you know Rachel dollars all the white black woman\nNow this is hilarious stuff these people are insane also I Want to play that currently be audio today I've heard talking about

tanning salons which is crazy anyway you remember Brock Obama under Obamacare they had the Caucasian tax remember that it was a real high tax at tanning salons never\nAs good as like putting a real high tax on hair extensions now it's a it's a it was a racist tax but it did But Rachel dollars all got to she was willing to pay the tax\nTo brown herself up a little bit like a crispy bacon and then she tried to black her hair up and a girl her fingernails long and then talk like you know a ... a you know say stuff like that and she say I'm black and uh and then her like Dutch parents from ...\nMontana or someplace came out and said uh uh well I don't know about our daughter but we're both Caucasians all aren't we June yes we are word and and uh and and so we're the nation found out she

gender is a boy says these are girls who are we to say that he's not a girl go ahead used my bathroom date my daughter whenever you want to do\nIt's a it's a good thing but Michael Eric Dyson on Rachel ... she was the head of the double ACP [laughter]\nNational Association for the advancement of confused people I think was her organization and Michael Eric Dyson or listen to those 'cause he's a racist er and he's filled with hatred Michael Eric Dyson said this\nAnd she may not be African American but she certainly could be black and then the cultural says she's taking on the ideals of the things the struggles she's identify with him I bet a lot more black people would support racial knows all then would support say Clarence Thomas\nYeah well that that would be that would be an IQ tests

... the Democrats have not spoken about in the last ten years talking about mixing the educational system with industry\nYou know having a conversation about stopping for federal black leaders are young black men can look up to build a factory built brings in the Midwest and on and on and on and yet they don't talk about that we don't want people do it that I've experienced\nOut I guess they're willing to fail so here my they want to do things that might not sound great it might not work\nBut that's the difference between what people are people who will never be successful they're willing to speak about a lot of things a lot of ideas and I think kind of anywhere is exactly with young African American food incredibly Al Sharpton is going to get to get the people like me were\nWell I think

about how far you're willing to go sacrificing a personal liberties and stretching the Fourth Amendment to save lives in neighborhoods where the killing us out of control there is a serious discussion to be had there but the Democrats as you said ... the Democrats\nAre never going to have that discussion there are just going to tell you to sit down and shut up and to not think for yourself that's

the Democrats took that the media took that they ran with it I\nI'm the hurricane in Puerto Rico how dare you throw paper towels to people don't you know that forty six times as many people were
