speaking and um [noise] had a call from a listener during the break happened to be my son James [noise] uh reminding me and and uh that and I I made this point because Barbara it made the point in her call\nYou know she was talking about dispersing the assets in her trust terminating the trust and I I did ask her and we didn't really dwell on it I did ask or uh what what\nIs the trust say and she said that the trust gives her as trustee has the authority to terminate the trust and distribute the assets to the beneficiaries in which case in in her case I guess it was she was the only beneficial your mom's trust [noise]\nBut it gave her the authority to do that after she reached age forty [noise]\nNow if the ... the ... they didn't so the fact that the instructions members trust is just a set of instructions the instructions gave her the authority is trust each attorney to trust one she the beneficiary and reached age forty and so she was allowed to do that\nShe couldn't have however if she were only thirty five it that juncture\nHave just gone ahead and tired of this trust stuff I'm just going to distribute it over here said to myself what difference does it make no no no no no that would be a breach of her fiduciary obligation as trustee\nBecause you see those trustee instructions would have gone on to a undoubtedly just say I have never saw her trust obviously or a mom's trust but probably what it said is if Barbara\n... just seized aged forty if she died before she reached age forty probably the trust assets would have been been held for the benefit of let's say barbers children\nSo Barbara Barbara if she had ignored or mothers instructions in just distributed the assets before she reached age forty she would've been breaching her duty to her children were contingent beneficiaries of the trust next in line as it were\nDo hope those assets for their benefit\nOkay so you can't just ignore the Igs instructions address now ... barber wasn't doing that has she been there would have been so potentially a unfortunate consequences to her for breaching her produce tree obligation including potentially\nSome income tax liability that gets rather complicated way beyond the scope of the discussion we hit with Barbara and frankly way beyond a far compress went out income tax advisors as such but but again\nI was talking about terminology and started with the fact that most basic you know that this is the football started the conversation [noise] this is just to set of instructions\nThe first duty of the trustee is too weird here's strict lead to the letter and spirit of those instructions [noise] and so the trustee can't just arbitrarily decide on their own how they're going to handle their duties is trustees have got to\nPay attention to what the original grand tour trust or in this case\nBarbers mom\nTold a trustee she ... to do with the assets\nThat were left in trust for her benefit [noise]\nOkay so which which has all kinds of ramifications down the road people sometimes you know just you know I don't think mom what would I don't think she would have cared or I don't really like this trust it\nKind of ties my hands and women smiles already are limits for the reasons for which I can use the money and so I'm just going to go ahead and ignore the instructions\nNo no no you you don't want to be you don't want to be in a in in ... in that position [noise]\nGo to the phones here down in the ... point John thanks for calling I'm I'm going to ask you to a state your question and then I'm afraid we're going to have to wait till after the news to try to answer it but when he got on your mind this morning\nSure across a lot of trust and we'll probably wouldn't want that one or the other\nStructure ... probably would have a wider one or the boat for instructions to one will ... to ... vote lead for\nSocial what's so what's the way so you've got to instructions in a will and then you've got instructions in a trust does the will call for the uh establishment of a trust after the death of the person who wrote the will\nUse either one it may make sense to have the crust rather than a will to deal with all these issues both with respect to the first family and the second family\nIn which case the crust instructions will almost undoubtedly supersede the instructions that were in the old will\nWhich means that one of the things that the the new uh state plan is going to do is this going to revoke the prior will so that it's clear that this new set of instructions that done is leaving in his new is state plan which isn't going to be embodied in a trust\nRevolt ... living trust in this case\nMakes clear that the the instructions that are to prevail so that there's no ambiguity\nAbout which set of instructions is going to apply if something happens to done okay and so he's going to he's going to want to think through planning is about in any field was about anticipating what if this happens what if that happens what if the other thing happens\nSo in ... case he's got a whole number of variables to consider both within the first family and within the second family and then how does it two plans we laid for those two families\nMaybe the ... the first family the children are older maybe they can manage their own money maybe they're adults in there and they're married already and maybe one of those marriages are Iraqi marriage and maybe he wants to make sure that\nHis estate or part of it doesn't wind up in the hands of a of a new daughter in law her son in law that he doesn't predict could week things deserves anything okay well we're going to handle that\nSo so the plan or to apply or ought to address the needs in his desires with respect to all of the people involved in his life\nAnd probably it just from what little I Know about a situation where we would probably if we were talking to him recommend using a trust\nTo address all these issues and as I say to make it clear who gets what when where how under what conditions how can we best protect whatever it is done is able to leave them\nHow who's going to manage the money is second family maybe the children are still minors chances are they are who's going to manage their money who's going to be their crusty\nWho's going to be responsible for raising them if something happens to both him and his new wife\nSo that's an issue that's got to be addressed for them probably doesn't apply to the first family anymore because their mother is still alive and besides which they're getting to the point they could raise themselves that they're already re see Sandra saying here\nA ... a comprehensive as state plan is going to try to address all of the situations and circumstances\nThat we can reasonably anticipate by thinking this situation through that's what estate planning is about ... about for everybody for that matter not just someone and Don situation was to families to race or to to to be concerned about\nSo I can if you look\nIf you haven't addressed your situation whatever it is this is what we're talking about when we say hey let's get your legal house in order\nWet start thinking about how can we best provide for all of the people that we care about in our lives if we're not here and by the way\nThe other major issue that we ought to be considering addressing in there to stay plan is what happens if the truck ... misses me doesn't run me over sides wipes me\nI'm incapacitated\nNot able to manage my own affairs still have responsibilities to others to my family\nObviously you've got to somebody's got to get me through this period of incapacity maybe it's a physical situation it's going to heal over time maybe it's not maybe it's a dementia situation is likely to deteriorate who's gonna managed\nOver time maybe it's not maybe it's a dementia situation it's likely to deteriorate who's going to manage my affairs who's going to make the these life decisions on my behalf\nThe last thing we want to do is leave this to the in the hands of sum total stranger appointed by a probate court's some place\nI Want to decide who's going to make all these critical decisions about my life this is what in capacity planning is about which is an integral part of everybody's estate plan\nOkay which I keep emphasizing and again I go off into the the situation not doesn't apply to die on but it applies to so many of our listeners and so many of the folks we deal with and that is\nThey're not married anymore maybe they're widows maybe their divorce maybe they've never been married they don't have any natural surrogate a spouse that sin titled by law to make many of these life decisions\nWho's going to make decisions for that person\nOnce again if they don't do anything there will be left to the ... of a court some boys who's going to do the best they can they're going to me they're going to try to find somebody that they can count on to help this person get through this period but it's going to be a total stranger to the person\nYou want to be in that position probably not\nThis is why this is why basic estate planning is so important to every one of those single married divorced whatever the situation is widowed\nOkay that's why we this is where we put such an emphasis on\nThinking about hey have I got my plan up to date do I have a plan to start with it if if I Do how long has it been since I put it in place if it's been a while if it's been several years a lot of things have changed in by the way not just in the tax laws [noise]\nGive me back to the first thing I talked about this morning which is this is what we do with our seminars\nSpend a couple of hours will go through all these issues with you and you can start making a list of what you want to be thinking about\nGetting some ideas so that you can when you sit down with your estate planner so you'll have some idea of the kind of questions you want to ask to say the kinds of situations you want to address [noise]\nGot a seminar coming up this coming Monday day after tomorrow in Frederick get the\nClarion you used to be the holiday inn right between two Seventy and that if

because the fed is raising interest rates as interest rates go up the value of bonds goes down so here's what I find rather ironic I'm almost comical people who are upset about the stock market saying oh my goodness I'm fearful of losing money in stocks I think I'll run the bombs for safety\nOnly to have the money go down in the bond market because rising rates are causing bond values to fall\nSo here's what you need to do beyond all else gentleman as you're thinking of how you ought to make changes in your investment portfolio you ready for this here it is I Want you to talk to your wives and girlfriends\nAnd do what ever they tell you to do why\nBecause according to research firm fidelity women consistently earn higher returns than men in their investment portfolios an average of almost half a point per year\nWhy because women trade less often women are more deliberative they're more methodical they are more considerate they evaluate more carefully they aren't quick to make a snap decision and that translates\nInto not jumping out of the market merely because the market went down one day\nSo men before you do something dumb [noise] and before you have\nTo pay for it when you explain to your spouse or a partner why you did what you did have that conversation\nHey honey I'm scared I'm thinking of getting out of the market what do you think\nAnd she'll tell you to go do something else for the afternoon okay it's really that simple but uh\nIf you really do want to know what you should be doing or want to be doing well here's just you know you're always looking for the latest and greatest investment opportunity well here it is I think I'm going to say this was targeted at women that's probably ridiculous is Texas thing I'll I'll narrowed down this was targeted to my wife or leave it at that okay [noise]\nOn friday a first of its kind ATF\nHas been launched\nNo ATF has ever been launched of this nature before and I got my wife's name all over it it's called the U.S vegan climate ATF [noise]\nI mean give me a break seriously an ATF that is investing in companies according to guidelines consistent with the game as um [noise] excluded our company says activity is quote directly contribute to animal suffering destruction of the natural environment and climate change\nExcluded our company says activities quote directly contribute to animal suffering destruction of the natural environment and climate change according to the prospect us\nAnd includes companies that engage in animal testing animal derived agriculture or products the use of animals for sport or entertainment or animal based research on genetic engineering\nIt says that they will select companies based on their environmental impact as well companies engaged in the production and refining a fossil fuels or even the use of fossil fuels for production or excluded\nSo too are companies that negatively impact the environment throughout high carbon footprint or habitat destruction and so on and most of the company take steps to mitigate or dresses impacts no tobacco stocks in the defense stocks in the military stocks no companies that contribute to human rights abuses were chowder forced labor\nNo financial firms accounting firms are business service providers to work with excluded companies as well in other words\nIt's not going to invest some anybody anywhere 'cause there's nothing\nLeft for nearly seriously the vegan each [noise] okay look here we we got we got serious when you're investing for your life savings to provide your own retirement security is really serious thing and it isn't for you know [noise]\nI really don't think they're going to be finding very many financial advisors recommending the vegan ATF [noise]\nHere's what I Do want to talk about though mentioning financial advisors do you have one I think that maybe perhaps you do and I want to ask you the question\nOld is your advice or what is your advisors age\nAnd is your advisor working in a solo practice or a very small shop in other words does your advisor work pretty much by himself or herself or part of a larger team\nBecause even if the big box workers from Maryland and whoever else uh you'd be asked them and wells and so on even though they might have tens of thousands of advisors in the from each one of them\nIs often working independently alone they got a cubicle and they're doing their thing and they're Cuban they're paying no regard having little contact with the folks in the cubes surrounding that\nNobody but that advisor you're dealing with knows anything about you or anything about your investment strategy or anything about the investments that you have in your portfolio only your advisor knows what you're doing and why you're doing it there's no continuity between your advisor and other advisors is that the case with the visor you work with\nHigh that's bad enough if you're working with an advisor\nBecause all by himself or herself\nWith no network no connection no colleague with whom\nThey share effort that's that's bad enough but it gets even worse if your advisor is say sixty years of age and why do I say that age because that's the average age of financial advisors in this country\nAccording to a new industry survey from practical perspectives more than half of the nation's advisors will be gone within ten years according to all the latest industry research the average advisors in their late fifties early sixties in fact there are more financial advisors in this country who are eighty then who are thirty\nThis is an aging industry\nA lot of young folks don't want to get into the investment management business because of its negative reputation and concerns over not being able to make a whole lot of money at it they're going into other businesses like investment banking or law or accounting where they think there's better career opportunities for them\nThere aren't a lot of young folks in this business so the average advisor in this industry is older so I Want to ask you a question as you're focusing on your retirement have you given any thought your your advisers retirement because according to some industry statistics\nHalf of all advisors in this nation will be gone within ten years they will have quit or retired\nIs that possibly your advisor and if so what happens to you and your account if\nYou retire you need to continue having your money managed right well not just a retirement but through your entire life\nIf your advisors not going to be around who do you turn to you want to make sure your advisor as part of a team part of an organization that has stability that it's going to be here long term to provide the continuity and consistency of the advice and services you've grown to expect\nFrom your advisor so one of the things we love best about are from here at home and financial we've got a hundred and sixty advisors and forty three officers nationwide we work collectively as a team so no one client is dependent on any one individual for the advice and services and quality that they're receiving\nAnd that's what we would recommend for you as well have a conversation with your advisor about their\nCareer expectations and plans and make sure their plan isn't your best interest I'm Rick Edelman you're listening to the truth about money\nA plane wreck online at ... dot

election at ... dot com\n... could your emotions be getting in your way when you're trying to make good investment decisions our brains are actually designed to trick us so you might unknowingly be making financial decisions that can cost you money and that can hurt your ability to achieve financial security come join us for our new fun and entertaining seminar mind over money\nAnd he would say the best thing to do is put it left high RA\nYes uh assuming you're eligible and in most cases you are you roll the money over to an IRA and then you begin making withdraws from that account whenever you're ready to start taking it if you want it right away you can start if you don't need it for a while you leave it there until you do need it\nAnd you go from there so in order to find out the answer for sure we need to do that math we need to do those calculations to evaluate how much money is your employer offering you and can you reasonably expect to generate a similar amount of income from an investment strategy crate on your own\nAs I said usually the answer's yes we can do that but not always\nAnd that's why we need to go through the exercise we actually have an office in Troy on in your neck of the woods and so happy to sit down with you and go through this in detail looking at the amount of pension benefit your being offered and contrast that to the lump sum they're willing to give us an alternative to the which strategy is best in your situation\nThat sounds good\nSo yeah but the news is like I said it's largely straight math that doesn't require a too much judgment will show you the spreadsheet analysis and say here's what you have this way and here's what yet that way which number it looks better to you and it'll be pretty self evident\nYeah if you sit down and see the growth uh especially I be taking it ten years before I ... for the fallout so there's a lot of room for growth of that money [noise] yeah that was ten years\nYes and so you have to calculate what you would expect as a reasonable rate of return over the next ten years and what kind of investment strategy is ideal in order to achieve that goal or as opposed to the promised pension that the employer is providing so the good news is that fact that the employers promise\nIs a guarantee the employer is saying we will give you this money every month\nFor as long as you live no matter what happens in the market\nBut on the other hand many employers many are both both state as well as private employers are struggling to honor those promises there's a huge pension shortfall in this country has many employer\nPension plans are underfunded then if the employer proves unable to honor its promises\nAnd then you could be discovering that eerie they're not getting a monthly check or you're getting a lower check the may hit originally promised millions of Americans are finding themselves in that situation so you've got to counterbalance the so called safety and guarantee of their check versus their genuine ability to pay that check as promised for the rest of your life\nFor all these reasons Paul I'd recommend that we sit down and go through this over a couple of hours what I'll do is put you on hold now get your phone number and I connected with my colleagues in our Troy office and a sit down and go through the numbers with you and go from there All right I really appreciate giving us a call here on the show that I\nThink he wrecked that fall from Troy if you're facing the pension question you don't want us to go it alone do appalled did call of professional financial advisor not your neighbor not your friend nothing in the cubicle next to you is this clueless as you you've never done it before but we've done it thousands of times and we can put our benefit of our experience and expertise to your advantage\nJust do it Paul did call us a triple eight plan wreck 'cause that's triple eight seven five to six the seven\nTwo you know I find Paul's um question really fascinating and really timely because limb road just came out with a study showing that fifty two percent of workers you know so we are talking half of all Americans say they don't know\nHow to translate their retirement savings into monthly income it's the very question Paul was asking about his case\nWhether to take a monthly pension or take the money out and turn it into monthly income on his own half of American workers say they don't know how to do that\nAll not at all surprised that you don't know how to do that because you've never tried to do it before none of us are any good at doing things we've never done before [noise] so have you given that any thought at all\nI Know you have given thought to you've given a lot of thought to putting money into your accounts contributing to your retirement plan at work adding to your savings you've been doing that for forty years\nPutting money into your accounts contributing to your retirement plan at work adding to your savings you've been doing that for forty years and you've gotten pretty good at it and that's why you've got as much money as you got\nBut very seldom do people turned upside down or inside out where they say okay I've got this bucket of money I've got these accumulated savings\nHow do I turn that into income and that's an entirely different question because we have to make sure that we're minimizing our taxes as we do is we need to make sure we're generating enough money\nTo meet our ability to maintain our lifestyle we have to keep pace with the cost of living because inflation makes everything more expensive over time and we want to make sure we don't ever run out of money before we die\nAnd not just our death but that of our spouse as well and ideally\nWe're going to have money left over to leaves a legacy an inheritance for our children and grandchildren that gets pretty complicated and if you don't know how to do it if you've never done it before don't go it alone call off the triple a plan wreck and let us help you through that\nIt's a big decision to make its massive calculation and you want to make sure you get it right and that's the expertise

study in the journal of personality and social psychology\nYeah there's apparently a journal called the journalist personality and social psychology they are just done research based on data from three million participants over a twenty five year period and they discovered that\nNice people are at greater risk of bankruptcy than people who aren't nice\nGo figure and the reason\nIsn't necessarily because people are nice it's because nice people according to study don't value money as much as people who are mean\nAgreeable mess was associated with financial hardship lower savings higher debt and higher default rates on loans\nSo being a nice guy means you're probably in an effort to be nice or just because you're nice you tend not to\nCare as much about money and therefore you are at higher risk of money mismanagement according to the study their data included following individuals over twenty five years and they discovered that when they measured agreeable mess in childhood\nIt predicted greater financial hardship later in life\nSo mom and dad look at your five year olds are they nice or\nThey not knife because if they're nice [noise] oh I\nDon't I don't even know what the vices that would give them so we are supposed to teach our children not to be nice\nI just I don't think so but maybe maybe maybe what we should be simply doing is saying look we know you're a nice person that's fabulous that's wonderful\nBut recognize that that could cause you buy your nature to make decisions that aren't helpful to you when it comes to your money management you might be willing to loan money to a friend\nAnd not care if they pay you back because you're nice don't do that you might\nBe willing to buy a bigger house than you can afford because it's the\nIt's nice if the fun thing to do and later you will discover that you've struggled to repay that loan and your default rate will rise so don't do that maybe you'll spend money that you shouldn't be spending on credit cards what have you leading to default on loans or ultimately bankruptcy\nCount maybe counts are kids that being nice is a handicap to effective money management as opposed\nTo

that money isn't going to have to last as long as it otherwise might have exactly\nRight but lose the only one other asset that's left that a lot of people I think more and that's the equity in their homes is that a potential resource for\n... just I I Love the house almost as much as I Love working longer um the ear right for many people their houses their largest asset outside of the wealth\nThat they have them in their Social Security benefits and\nA tapping home equity I think is actually going to be part of the answer and going forward or the difficulty here is the mechanism fair they're basically three ways to do it one you can sell your house and go buy a cheaper house\nAnd and it has to be a cheaper house not a smaller house because a lot of people sell their house in the ... suburbs moved to the city and the costs just as much if not more and so it has to be a cheaper house that's one way to go the other is a reverse mortgage but there are so complicated to many people you need to have\nCounseling before you get one um and so\nSomehow we have to make them simpler and better the alternative to a third way is in Massachusetts we're talking about property tax for all and so that\nWould be a program where by people sixty five and over could defer their property taxes for um the period until they sell the house or die and then\nThose property taxes would be repaid with interest at that\nTime you don't get as much out of\nThat approach is you could get in terms of fried up um money as you went out from a reverse mortgage but it could be a much simpler program\nSo the whole concept is that by not having to pay your property taxes annually that reduces your expenses and you present the cast you can use for other elements of your lifestyle\n... Massachusetts property taxes and we have ... there's a high property tax state so for the average household is about four thousand dollars a year but not having to fork out that four thousand dollars can make a a big\nDifference yeah so in some demonstration that there's no shortage of great ideas and strategies for people but they just need to learn what these are\nMost folks are financially illiterate as you well know and so they don't know what they don't know and why I'm a big fan of course being a financial advisor that people turn to a financial advisor for help in dealing with these kinds of issues\nAre and why it's so important for policymakers to pay attention to the environment going on right now because we're facing big problems with Social Security and the trust fund being depleted over the next decade or two and why it's important for Congress to act right now or what message would you give\nTo Congress should they be listening to this program about the current situation and the need for them to act\nSo I think it said three stage um\nProgram one we as you said we should fix Social Security this is the backbone of the retirement system ah\nTo make people scared that they're not going to have any retirement benefits because the trust fund this is Austin is just cause unnecessary Hangst the second thing we should do is make four one K. plants which is what most people have\nTo work as well as possible\nIt's just cause unnecessary anguished the second thing we should do is make four one K. plants which is what most people have\nWork as well as possible we my view would be that any four one K. plan would have to have automatic provisions that you'd be automatically in Boulder in the program um that either the\nDefault contribution rate for automatic enrollees would be sat at a reasonable level let's say six percent and then automatically increase teach 'em erupted let's say ten percent\n[noise] um I think that we need some kind of a way to transform that\nA pile of money into an income stream starts at Fayette providing income at let's say eighty five if you take a snapshot of the workforce at any moment in time half the workers don't get any type of retirement plan\nCoverage at work and so we have this huge coverage gap\nAnd that needs to be fixed gum the proposals that made been made it a federal level to have sort of an auto IRA program that is if your\nEmployer doesn't provide a retirement plan they have to automatically enroll you and I\nAre a um the federal government hasn't acted on that and so the states have really taken the lead and setting up these auto ... program so we need to fix a security make for one case work as well as possible addressed the coverage gap\nAnd then really try to educate people on the importance of considering their house as part of a retirement ...\nWell I Hope members of Congress are listening to the program right now and maybe we'll send them an audio clip and perhaps the
