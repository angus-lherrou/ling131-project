of months and even at the top of the show how narrows the leadership and the stock market has I mentioned how\nSome forty percent of ... five hundred stocks are still negative for the year and virtually all the games so far in two thousand Eighteen had been concentrated in just three sectors technology healthcare and consumer discretionary\nI mean at one point just a few weeks ago I think half the returns on the S. and P. five hundred came from three stocks\nThree and they were all tech stocks remembered the S. and P. five hundred is a market cap weighted index meaning the bigger the company the bigger influence seeking get that type of dominance if you look at things from sort of a technical perspective I think it was Monday or do caught me on that but I think it was Monday the Dow is on track to close it a new fifty two week high\nBut there were three times as many fifty two week lows as fifty two week ... when the New York stock exchange that's only happened to one another day since Nineteen sixty five\nPretty crazy dance and pay five hundred was also a whisker away from another all time high but only twenty seven stocks were were than one percent of their all time highs only twenty seven out of some five hundred meanwhile thirty eight worth thirty percent bolo their fifty two because\nThis is not you know super unusual we have seen this before but I got to tell you it's not\nThe sign of an overly healthy market and then really two things can happen you know the overall market can pull back or you could have some of those high flyers and sort of correct back towards the main I mean if you look at\nLike an ... chart that shows you the best performing markets sector ... year by year going back some twenty five years it's uncanny how some of the best performing sectors for a few years\nLike an ... chart that shows you the best performing markets sector ... year by year going back some twenty five years it's uncanny how some of the best performing sectors for a few years then become some of the worst performing sectors for a few years and and vice versa you see that money shift back and forth based on valuation best on investor assets lows\nIt would not be surprising again this is not a market production and we have technology and the portfolio\nBut it would not be surprising to see some of these big tech stocks stall out for a while maybe a couple of years I'm not saying that's tomorrow but I Would not be surprising over the next few years to see that leadership in the market be picked up by excuse me leadership in the market would be picked up by other sectors\nWhere we're seeing a lot of the divergence of course is and that sort of spread between growth stocks doing well and the cheaper stocks the quote unquote values stocks lagging\nWe're now and the biggest and why distant longest sort of spread and and and the performance that we've ever seen in market history\nBut just to back up a little bit before I get going what is value investing and he probably heard the name Benjamin Graham he was sort of the patron saint of value investing Warren Buffett's mentor\nWorn a what what Benjamin Graham always used to talk about is trying to find stocks that are temporarily trading below their intrinsic value\nAnd he would argue that temporary drag me persist for a while stock markets can remain oblivious to fundamentals for an extended stretches but ultimately that discount will dissipate so value investing in his mind was a play on that negative overreaction or maybe that neglect\nAnd for that reason value investors have to be in some ways contrary ends but also extremely patient particularly an environment like this where you have so much of the money being made like I said by so few growth companies\nAnd then sort of related to that is he would only buy stocks when they were trading with a margin of safety in other words enough of a discount too that the intrinsic value whereby\nHe thinks of so many of the risks and potential risk going forward already priced into the stock in terms of valuation\nAnd a number of studies have shown since then maybe not every study but there was a landmark paper back in Nineteen Ninety two from a couple of University of Chicago professors that\nFound that low price to book stocks consistently and convincingly outperformed high priced a book about stocks and that's something I believed in my heart of hearts for a number of years that over an extended period of time and I don't mean three years or five years I mean ten Fifteen Twenty years and this is why you have to be patient\nBuying future growth at fifty cents on the dollar Seventy cents on the dollar even Ninety cents on the dollar is how you're going to make money not by chasing momentum and just buying whatever and everyone else's by a next stick with me I really want to get into this point but first I Want to make sure that\nWe understand there are some real limitations and how the market defines growth and by the market the way the market to find it in terms of the baskets and indexes\nThat are set up is not necessarily the same way that Benjamin Graham thought about it and not

biggest waiting in the value index about twenty four percent of the value index\nThere were only five percent of the growth index information technology IT only seven percent of the value index one of the lower ratings but forty two percent of the growth index that's more than twice the second biggest a sector representation\nSo unfortunately the reigning methodology creates a major problem because shifts in their relative performance of growth in value indices\nAre completely dominated by sector performance\nWe know that financial they generally have higher debt they had their lower margin I mean there's no bank stock was sixty or Seventy percent profit margins like a software company\nAnd that depresses their multiples relative to non financial firms so financials will have according to this methodology sort of permanent residency and the value indexes meanwhile tax docks where they're bigger weight and their higher margins they're gonna always going to be in that growth index\nSo what basically and this is the the the key point value versus growth if you just follow the indexes boils down to a binary choice between between financials in tech that's what it is is that useful going forward I don't know\n\nWhat about if you look at things from sort of a macroeconomic perspective what what is conventional wisdom say again this is\nThis is drawn from a piece from VCA\nConventional wisdom is that in periods of higher inflation\nA value stocks tend to outperform grow stocks same thing goes for higher interest rates valued tends to do better than growth again this is conventional wisdom I'm not saying this is the case if you look at the business cycle it's believed that growth stocks ... performed by you stocks during recessions\nBut is that true well have you and again\nI'm not going to get too much into the weeds on the subway to death but if you look at ... work on this and they looked at multiple cycles going back some forty years\nYes there are some correspondence is over certain periods of time between rates inflation the business cycle and growth doing better than value and invites in and vice versa\nBut ultimately according to them the direction of the growth of of the\nGrowth in value indexes is much more about forecasting relative performance between technology stocks and financial stocks\nThan it is about identifying cheap stocks or being right on the economy\nReally look at what the shortcomings of the indexes are we know one they're using just trailing metrics okay trailing earnings and trailing multiples that's not particularly helpful they rely on simple price to book multiples which platters companies that make a lot of acquisitions there were ... rely entirely on reported earnings\nWhich you know we've said for years you can fake reported earnings all you want can't pay cash flow we place much more stock and cash flow than earnings and most significantly in my opinion they play they make no attempt to place relative metrics\nInto historical context without a mechanism to compare a particular segments valuation relative to its own history\nStructurally low multiple stocks like financials or like chemicals that you know trade it seven eight nine times earnings\nThere'll be over represented and structurally high multiple stocks like tech will be underrepresented in it and and the value index\nSo for example if if you know financial stocks as a group or trading at ten times earnings it will be much more instructive to know that you know a year ago they were twelve times earnings or a year ago that they were eight times earnings\nBank comparing them to ... you know twenty five times earnings if that makes sense right\nSo a ... you know one thing that we've always looked at and we've talked about this on the show is that when we look at individual stocks for example we're always paying paying a lot of attention to wear that stock has traded relative to its own history and it's peer group I'm not going to compare\nYou know again I ... a slow growth uh a chemical company for example\nTo accompany involved in cyber security that's you know trading at fifty times earnings just doesn't make any sense but the\nA chemical company for example to accompany involved in cyber security that's you know trading at fifty times earnings just doesn't make any sense but the indices don't really allow for that\nAgain going back to the macro picture for a second uh what ... found was there was no consistent relationship between value and growth\nAnd inflation interest rates or broad economic cycles again it had much more to do\nWas sector performance however what they did say which I found interesting was that the monetary policy I eat what the fed is doing does offer a bit of a path forward they found that the fed funds cycle of course the fed just raised rates you know last week\nOr two weeks ago I was just sitting there was that was last week offers a pretty consistent God\nTo equity in bond returns much more so than other um [noise] you know macro economic data that they followed\nAnd they break it down into various cycles am I going to get too much into that but suffice to say that when you consider value and growth stocks separately both perform extremely well in policy is easy like it has been over the last you know five six seven years\nBut growth stocks barely advance when policy is tight I eat getting more restrictive\nSo that strategy for investors might be to seek out value exposure one policy is tight while I'm at and and they just think about it logically we could be there over the course of the ... the next two years or so\nSo I think the conclusion to all this is this long slumping value may have led some investors to argue that value invest teams finished or killed by a combination of short term performance imperatives and momentum trading\nBut I don't think that's the case the difficulty lies in finding an indicator that reliably leads the values stocks um you know just leads to evaluate a stock out performance going forward most macro measures like we've talked about are somewhat unhelpful do consistent relationships there\nBut\nBroad market direction will offer some insight traditionally stocks with low price to book multiples have outperformed high priced appears by a wide margin during beer market so I Do think if you are worried about a significant market downturn\nThat value stocks or a logical place to be we certainly saw that in our portfolios and two thousand eight also back through that two thousand two thousand two period the monetary policy backdrop is probably the most promising guide as I mentioned\nAnd based on where things might go you would think that value might start out perform over the over the course of the next year to Eighteen months\n\nBut then I think just what it comes down to on an individual stock basis or a sector basis is really looking at the fundamentals on a relative bases relative to a company's own history looking at forward looking multiples forward looking earnings and looking at cash flow in other words\nDoing a much deeper dive and I think what you will find if you do that and we do this all the time\nIs that there are a lot of stocks that or maybe ... and the growth indices that are actually values um and they're you know some companies sitting in the in the value in diseases that are broken growth stocks that aren't worth investing in so there's a lot of cross pollination and that's why you really have to dig a little bit deeper on this thing but again\nI thought that would be helpful because\nYou know anytime one sector or one asked the class dominates for it is significant period of time people start to wonder if that's going to be a permanent condition I Would argue strongly that's not the case to the record I Will say that we're not overly dogmatic\nYou know and again you can see why after this ten minutes discussion of value versus grow stuck you know we bought you know visa symbol the trading at a hundred and forty seven dollars a share we bought alphabet formerly known as Google trading and\nCivil G O O G L A trading at just under twelve hundred dollars a share most people wouldn't traditionally considered those values stocks\nWe think they are we think they're trading at a significant discount to their long run intrinsic value so don't get too caught up in the labels make sure you do your homework I promise you that we will but I Do think from a general sense that invest a value investors can expect better

importance of a financial plan and you know if you have you know millions of dollars are several hundred thousand dollars a bill for producing financial plan for you for a thousand or two thousand dollars or more than that and then they'll charge you a fee to maintain that plan\nAnd invariably the financial services plans are passive investing plans so the idea\nCharge you a fee to maintain that plan and invariably the financial services plans are passive investing plans so the idea is you're going to pay us money and you got to keep paying us money for the privilege of not having to do anything and\nThat's okay and that that may be a valid choice for you and where you're at in life\nAt the same time what we know is for actively involved with our assets and we're actively involved with their income the likelihood of getting a better result is a lot better than if we're relying on some stranger and particularly in this environment this low growth environment\nWhat returns have you gotten over the last three six twelve month I don't know\nAnd most people you know the whole idea is out of sight out of mind and the financial services people love that because if you don't care about the results neither today\nAnd the people are going to be held accountable if you're on you know on the alert and saying I Need returns they're going to be a lot more paying attention then if someone doesn't care at all and the problem for huge following this I don't know retirement plan it's based on this financial plan of trusting that you're going to get a nice straight line return\nAnd if you look at the straight line to get in about three percent per year over the last Eighteen years and so for most people that's not enough to get them to a hundred years old it's really not enough to get you to Seventy for most people\nAnd so part of this as a starting to take a harder look at what you're doing and they were talking about building the success plan as kind of court to what we do for yourself investors and you know if you go to a financial advisor they're going to charge you know a thousand two thousand dollars\nAnd they're going to focus primarily on we referred to as preservation strategies and their peace of mind strategies these are in strategies allow you to sleep at night so that's okay\nBut for most people if that's all you've got\nThen you're not going to have the income you want to meet your current needs and you're certainly not going to have income for the future that's going to allow you to get to a hundred years old\nAnd so preservation is important and for a lot of people you know ... those are things that you can do yourself instead of paying the financial services folks to do and it does take a little bit of knowledge takes a little bit of education and what it really takes that you have to actually care about your money\nYou actually have to care about the results that your money or producing if you don't care than keep doing what you're doing if you do care\nIf you want to take control of your assets than you owe to yourself to get yourself educated and so if we're looking at some of the some of these basic living\nExpenses and most people have that covered if their Social Security through their job and then it's then it's getting onto like once you've accumulated some assets water some of the strategies you can use and do it in a way we can reduce your expenses and these are\nThe most straightforward one is using exchange traded funds or a T apps and ATF have been around for Thirty years and you say about ten years ago there was a big push to them\nAnd they're part of it is if they can be lower cost lower fee opportunities they're not always that so you do have to know what you're putting your money and\nBut the most basic approach if you'd barely care about your results and you're satisfied getting you know single digit returns on your money rather than paying someone else you know two three four percent a year and allowing your money to have expenses taken out of it and one of the things you can do is hold that in exchange traded fund\nAnd do what they call it sixty forty split so sixty percent exposed to the larger stock market\nForty percent exposed to a larger bond market\nAnd you can use an ATF called SP wide attract the larger market you can use a ... a ATF called TLC which tracks the long bond market tracks twenty year bonds and so if you use that sixty forty split and you're satisfied with single digit returns basically you know once a year once a quarter\nYou know you might rebalance that to make sure that you're sixty forty balances there but that's something you can do relatively easily and you get to keep the two or three percent that you're paying to the mutual fund you get to keep the two or three percent that you're paying your financial adviser and that way you're going to allow yourself to get better preservation returns\nAnd this is something that's a real simple strategy and it plays out you can do even rebounds as you add contributions but that's a real simple preservation strategy can use\nIf you get more sophisticated and recognize where you're at you might want to look at some other strategies so most people\nHave all their assets denominated in the U.S dollar and the U.S dollar has been the currency it's been a the global currency it's the reserve currency and most countries have it and so it's been able to maintain its significance\nRegardless of normal market forces because it is the dominant force but one of the things you have to recognize with the changes that are going on with America's relationship with the world\nThat impacts the value of the dollar\nAnd so in two thousand Seventeen the dollar was downtown\nInstead of going on with America's relationship with the world that impacts the value of the dollar and so in two thousand Seventeen the dollar was down ten percent\nSo you may not know it but the value of your assets last ten percent so if you made ten percent you also lost ten percent said basically broke even and most people didn't make ten percent last year so you probably lost some money you know this year has been interesting 'cause we've been you know down five percent up ... percent were basically at break even for the year basically\nAnd one of the things that we've seen this movie before you know the government is pursuing these pro oil policy pro producer policies that from two thousand one to two thousand eight the value of the u._s. dollars basically cut in half\nAgainst the Australian dollar and a number of other currencies and so one of the things you can get from a preservation strategy\nAnd what that means the dollar gets weaker and continues to get weaker that means you can buy less stuff or your dollars don't do as far that's one of the reasons why two thousand eight felt so bad you had money but that money could buy as much stuff as it used to\nAnd if we're if we're on the verge of doing that again we're kind of part way down this path\nThat you can use them for X strategies to protect your assets and so you know we've students that hold currency FDIC insured um us based bank where you're allowed to hold foreign currency\nUm had been ever bank and now it's TI a bank and so it ... it gives you some strategies where you can protect it in case of dollar goes down you can hold have exposure to other currencies you can also use the spot for X market\nWhich allows you to control large pieces of the market large pieces of of currency\nAnd do it in a way where you know you get the benefit of the dollar goes down and so these are strategies that you can use that again it it's outside the norm\nBut if and what what is the attraction to being average or below average I mean really what the financial services people are selling you is the opportunity for below average returns and if you want to be below average keeping below average that's fine\nIf you want to break free from being below average you need to start thinking about things differently\nAnd start understanding where the opportunities are in the market and how you can you know with a little bit of time a little bit of knowledge you can start doing things safer and smarter than what you're currently doing\nAnd so for preservation strategies we have some students that use the for X. market so they'll have buying power purchasing power parity is the fancy term for it but the idea is that if the dollar goes up you're making money anyway the dollar goes down you should have at least the strategy to protect yourself in that event\nAnd so another strategy understood Jews are using options and you know certainly for future income you know we have a program focused on using selling options to generate income and a safer smarter way in a way to get more consistent returns\nWell we can do the same thing in our preservation strategy and we can target a lower return sunset of targeting you know eight ten twelve percent\nWe can use similar strategies amusing cast secured puts using covered calls income asset allocation and use those four to generate you know three four five percent\nAnd by doing that you're taking less risk on to get the same or better return than what you're currently doing and from a financial perspective that's good financial management\nAnd so if you're interested in learning how to preserve what you've got but do it in a safer smarter way you know for a lot of our students options are great way to do that and then we have a program called the mastermind community\nWhere every day we're identifying safe places to sell your options across a number of each ts and some students do it every week some students do it every month it's depends on how involved you want to be with your money\nBut the idea is if you're involved in a safer smarter way then you have more say in the ... returns you're getting\nAnother great preservation strategy is real estate so we have a number of students that you know use the financial markets to generate current income they use the financial markets to generate their future income but then they use real estate\nAs a way of preserving their assets and real estate generally gets about a six percent return over time\nAnd as we'll Roger said you know they're not making any more so there's if you find yourself looking for the right type of market so part of what you have to do is look for\nMarkets that are projecting growth over the next ten twenty Thirty years and the bureau of Labor Statistics provides these population studies and so if you take a look at North Carolina\nTake a look at the Georgia Florida Texas you know these are areas that are slated to continue to grow Tennessee as opportunities there and then you have to take into account the whole hurricane risks that probably takes Texas and\nThat are slated to continue to grow Tennessee there's opportunities there and then you have to take into account the whole hurricane risks that probably takes Texas and North Carolina and Florida out but there's opportunities in Georgia Tennessee where you can basically I expose yourself to growing markets or you're going to have increased demand\nUsing some real estate strategies that are designed\nTo provide you with some tax benefits as well as preserve your money again is safer smarter way\nFor you to build your success plan on things that makes sense for you not for someone else and what we want is for people that really care about their assets really care about their income that want to achieve success if those are the people we can help\nOr a hundred and twenty professional instructors and in the back of their mind they say well if they're so good and why are they instructors what benefit do you get to be an online training academy in trucker yeah it's a it's a great\nQuestion it's a it's a common question and and there's there's a lot of answers and I'm sure there's a lot of a different answers depending on the instructor but um as you can tell I I Do have a great deal of energy I I Am very personable and try to be very personal so I enjoy the social aspect of this and\nYou know trading behind a screen is awesome but at the same time getting to go to a new city or be treated very well by people like you and and and and other centers throughout the world and they get to meet some really great people you know or like minded people good work ethic people\nAnd just some solid people get to meet them along the way on and then again I remember what it was like to be not knowing what I Know now and and just the way that I Would like to have you know be treated at that point you know with patients and kindness and and so I get the chance to do that with people now and actually just be patient with them watch the ... the progress that they're making\nYou know and it's like and it's like you know you say as far as the more you do it the better you understand it so it it does help me as well do you know doing these classes over and over and and the repetition it gives you a deeper understanding of what you're doing on a regular basis and it makes it better trader so it's a it's it's a win win win all around\nSo let's get down to brass tacks and makes you a better trade or how does being an instructor you know produce results for you in your regular trading irregular investing\nYeah and again in a great question I it it really fine tune your rules then it shows you the importance of\nUm of having a trade planned following the trade plan\nIt also keeps you expose your new ideas and new things that are going out there it's it's funny sometimes a student all ask a question and just in the way that they asked the question\nHelps you get a better understanding of of of what your answer actually is and how it how that application can be used in the classroom and in your own trading so uh it definitely keeps your shower and uh and it always gives you a better understanding of what you're what you're doing as a as a traitor yourself\nAnd Don Dawson is one of our local instructors and he's been trading on his own since Nineteen eighty seven and he's been instructor about ten years and he told me that every time he teaches a class he learn something from a student that helps them become a better trader\nWould agree with that yeah there's a number of\nStudents and we always talk about some of the great success stories and there's a number of them with with on like trade academy you know given the way that we teach our classes and the content and the and the you know the professionalism of the instructors so yeah there's a number of things that that go well there and uh yeah I'd say after\nListening to a lot of the traders and I've had a number of them come back this week which has been very rewarding but yeah they take what your show 'em and they they incorporate into their trade plans and to hear their success stories um time and time again it's it's very rewarding and again it's one of the benefits of getting to do what I Do\nSo to your students bring you an apple or what other rewards they get from your students so it's\nAlmost like he walked into the room today which I Know you didn't do but there are literally two apples on my desk as you speak so that is very very funny that you actually say that\nBut um you know I'll tell you what a really cool story on a on a on a on another level of that those fires gifts this I'm I'm not a I was never in the military but this gentleman and his name is pat and is from Arizona and like I say is a great guy but he's the guy that came into the Baltimore class you know a few months back and I met originally in Phoenix but\nHe pulled me aside in in the Baltimore class a few months ago when we were in a we're known\nAnd he he he literally I hate almost broke down and we're talking about a really tough guys like I said in special forces on military fantastic guy but he gave me I'm a metal on\nThat's representative of of the military and uh and taught me a couple of things about how to you know how to use it in some of the language that they use but that to me it was and I still have the course and I keep it with me and my in my bag and I travel with and that that was really cool thing to have 'em and like I said I have it all the time so that was one of the more memorable guessed that I have received from someone\nThat's great and in this area we have students that from all branches of the military we have enlisted way of officers and what we find is that they are the folks that can follow a standard operating procedure\nThe folks that care about their results the folks that can be disciplined enough to follow the things that you lay out are the ones that can do well and that's where\nThe military folks often our best students\nQuestion about it and I we see a lot of them as you say here in Washington DC a lot in Baltimore on actually I did a class in Kansas City a couple of weeks ago and almost the entire class was military or ex military and you're right the the language which was with which they speak the are the rules\nFor weeks ago and almost the entire class was military or ex military\nAnd you're right the the language which was with which they speak the are the rules the way they follow him the discipline uh it does it make it 'cause that's what trading is all about you got to be able to\nYou don't follow a plan um realize that it's not going to be perfect every time there's going to be losses but how you manage those losses and how you follow your plan is really going to determine whether or not you're successful in this business so yeah I'm a military ex military\nUh certainly great candidates for for high end successful level\nTraders you know we had we had a student from the ... member that he was wounded in Afghanistan severe pie TST could only focus for about Fifteen minutes at a time\nAnd he went through the course strategy class and they did the trading contest and sure enough at the end of the day and one wow that's awesome and instructor said well and you can only focus for Fifteen minutes how can you do this he said I just follow the rules\nThat great yeah it's phenomenal yeah love it and it's it's so true you know when the laser with the rules are laid out the right way and then they're followed I think that's the only thing we got to remember um yeah it's all it's all set up there for you to be successful and that's why people come to us the way they do which is which is great\nAnd part of it is transforming lives central tour mission how many lives have you transform does not want to trade academy instructor over your ten years while\nYeah great question I I I don't have an answer that but I Know the classes are are are bigger and bigger all the time and I as a result of the great work you do in the great work that then I my training academy does throughout the world and um boy it's it's it's a it's a huge number you know and it's being able to influence that many lives in a positive way

N. A. L. more Washington comes to talk back\nTo the underwriters quarter was\nWelcome back to the underwriters Carter I have a whole bunch of things I Want to tell you about a bud my producer tells me we have another\nCaller and I want to take your calls first but in the meantime if you want to call the office you have all of the loan officers in there they bought no money from you they don't want to credit cards they're they're just to get you started to answer your questions you have them all in their get their name and their cell phone number\nThere eight hundred number is three two one\nFive five five of us take our second call or very popular night I'm being told it's Christine Christine welcome to the underwriters corner\nHa ho\nQuestion about her renovations\nOh that's very popular today okay I've got to help you with that\nI had the phone and it's for about three hundred and thirty thousand [noise] but I Love that side and my bank at eighty per cent doesn't think that I saw a [noise]\nBut I Need him renovations I don't want to take it or anything I just want to get ... than a couple of appliances and just wondering what can I ask him get that renovation\nOkay that's fine that's great [noise] the um you see again you use the same as that caller that we had earlier they they will only give you up to eighty percent so if you if the houses were three thirty you said I'm ... eighty percent let's see three thirty\nTimes eighty percent is only two sixty four you said you owe to sixty five\nI think I don't really remember but I think that\nAl ... so that's why they're not giving you any money but with the renovation loan okay or you do is give me a contractor but now sometimes\nThe renovations that you do is not going to able to improve the value of your house I will give you a contractor bed to the appraiser and you know when you put a new roof on or kitchen appliances or like you want to do that might not increase the value of your house it's something that you need you need to get it done\nBut things like you know your hot water heater is no is not working or maybe you need a new furnace\nBut you know those kinds of things are not going to improve the value of your home but by using the renovation loan even if your house doesn't go up one dollar\nUnder the renovation loan I can go up to a hundred percent of the value that your house is going to be so if your house is not going to change in value I can still go if you will to sixty five\nI can still go from two sixty five to three thirty what your house is worth right now so when you're a case\nRight they made that\nWell they don't they might not do the renovation loan yet the renovation loan is a very special efforts\nSo in your case right they made that\nWell they don't they might not do the renovation loan the at the renovation alone is a very special F ha loan there's also a conventional loan and in your case you might be better off to use the conventional loan is called the Fannie Mae home style and if your credit is very good over seven hundred and twenty credit score\nI have a great credit\nOkay well if your credit scores over seven twenty\nIn your case you might be better off to go with the conventional loan because you're you're it might not have any mortgage insurance the F ha has mortgage insurance but the conventional loan if you can stay under eighty percent or if you even if you're an eighty five percent or Ninety\nYou or your we could either eliminate the mortgage insurance or it's a very small amount as opposed to F. ha so in your case you would probably be better off to go with the conventional Fannie Mae home style which is still a renovation loan\nAnd I can go up to a hundred percent of what your value is going to be a very simple loan it's just that you don't have enough equity to do with cash out ...\nBut you can do you know you can certainly put the new roof on new kitchen appliances and then anything else you want to do because you have plenty of room\nCalled the office and get a copy of the uh the book that I wrote it's written in plain English I promise you it says on the F ha renovation loan and also on the Fannie Mae home style\nAnd what that number\nAre given out to Christina it's a eight hundred number it's three two one five\nAnd when you call them Christine get them to throw a book in the mail you it's free [noise]\nUh and while you have them on the phone you can say to them you can give them some information let them for free they'll run your credit report to make sure your credit is strong like that\nAnd you tell them about your income and they'll they'll get you all started then they all all they have to do is get a contractor bed from you you have to have a contractor or something for like in your case the roof or\nA we'll give you a contract to bed and maybe it's ten thousand or twelve thousand already okay good and then and then a contract but you know maybe from Sears or some place for the new kitchen appliances soil you have to do is give them that\nAnd they will order an appraisal and you can settle in three weeks\nI'm perform link care\nOh yeah three weeks you can settled by the end of October\nI'm like oh\nYou can call them right now they're all in the office to make sure you get their name and their cell phone number when you call them so that if you have a question you can call them back so\nThank you Steve thank you for calling it's been a pleasure of All right\nWell see I guess I guess I talked to a lot last week about the renovation loan aid is a very unique low now it's only for those who want to do home improvement\nYou can't use any of the money to pay off a credit card or take that trip to Tahiti um but you can do any and all renovations some people like Christine there she only wants to put a new roof on and maybe some kitchen appliances so maybe ten thousand for the roof\nAnd maybe three or four thousand for the new kitchen appliances so she only wants to borrow Thirteen fourteen thousand okay so instead of two sixty five she'll have a two Seventy eight loan\nAnd the Thirteen thousand dollars that she needs will be there and she can go up to the three thirty or whatever it appraises for now he is somebody like in Christine's position [noise] probably the house is not going to go up that much and value but that first caller\nHe's going to put a fifty thousand dollar extension on the back of his house you know I'm a I'm sure unless he's over improving the house for the neighborhood [noise] I'm sure there maybe it doesn't go up fifty grand but I bet it goes up twenty or thirty thousand dollars and he can go up to a hundred percent of what it's going to be worth [noise]\nSo if you look at it do home improvement and you don't have enough equity that eighty percent stops here\nThe the F ha and Fannie Mae renovation loan is a terrific way to go call the office get a copy of the books will throw one of the male to you you can also go to our Web page the whole book is there on our Web page I like to get a copy of the book I make great bathroom reading\nBut if you want to go to our Web page the Web pages are name first preference dot com that's S. I. R. S. T. preferences P. R. E. F. E. R. E. N. C. first preference dot com or you can use the eight hundred number I could give it out you can go to W. W. W.\nEight hundred three two one five five five five dot com and that'll throw you into the Web page\nAnd he'd go to our Web page and you can read it all day or or get a copy of the book that telling me I've gone over my time I take a quick break call the office and grab one of these loan officers you won't get voicemail their eight hundred number again is three two one five ... five five we'll be right back after a quick\n[noise] first preference mortgage easier local and they're not a ... year alone is processed hand underwritten\nAnd his three two one five ... five five we'll be right back after a quick\nBreak first preference mortgage easier local and they're not a ... year alone is processed and under written in house for over twenty five years first preference mortgage has been helping first time homebuyers homeowners looking to refinance with their hands on approach the loan officers are available when you are nice weekend during the day\nOf course the option to me with a local loan officer has its benefits especially for first time homebuyers big it actually hold your option the thirty year picks rated the most common program do take the time to go over other programs that could benefit you're pursuing these long process started today and learn more first preference dot com that's first headlines\nAre as the preference dot com read your local office in D.C Maryland and Virginia had one eight hundred three two one five five five five\nThat one eight hundred three two one five five five five\nV a allows you to go up to a hundred percent of the value of your home now remember the renovation loan lets me go up to a hundred percent of what it's going to be worth\nBut with the VA loan you can go up to a hundred percent of the of the value right now but there's no restrictions on it you don't have to just use it for home improvement you can take the money and pay off a credit card or pay off a loan or take a trip anything you want to do with it up to a hundred percent there's nothing better than a VA loan\nNow let me talk about purchasing a house with purchasing the house all of the veterans listening to me first\nA VA is the best financing you could negotiate the cellar to pay all of your closing costs you put it in the price for instance\nLet's say the houses are they're asking two hundred thousand [noise]\nAnd you were going to offer one Ninety five and maybe you get it for one Ninety five [noise]\nInstead of doing that give them two oh five give them five grand more than they're asking you say well why would I Do that well because then you're going to turn around and asked them to pay all ten thousand dollars of your closing cost and pre paid your pre pays by the way all your taxes and your homeowner's insurance policy [noise]\nSo if if you if your closing costs and ... come out to ten thousand dollars\nYou've given them two oh five but in the contract you put I Want you to pay ten thousand dollars of my closing costs in prepaid and say well bill look at that I went up five thousand dollars more than they're asking yeah but when the interest rates are still is low [noise] every thousand is just over five dollars per month so\nIf you go up five grand to two oh five that's going to change your payment by about twenty seven dollars a month\nAnd now you don't have any closing costs to pre pace and the beauty of the VA loan no downpayment\nSo a veteran can literally buy a house without a single penny out of their pocket All right now I got a whole bunch of you listening to me saying but I'm not a veteran I Would buy a house if I didn't have to put out any money I have a job I have a reasonable credit\nBut I don't have the money to put down on a house and I'm not a veteran there is another program it has some restrictions that the VA doesn't\nBut a lot of you who are listening to me I Would say eighty to Ninety percent can probably use this program is called USDA rural development that don't get hysterical about the word roe R O it doesn't mean you have to buy a house where there's more cows than people\nIt's a program that in every state in every county the feds have laid out a little bit of an area that say this area of the county is not as populated as the rest of the county\nAnd they and you can use the program there\nIn some counties it's half the county\nSome counties it's the whole county doesn't have the basic rule is you can't be within a large cities a boundary\nIn in the in the boundary of the of a large city so you have to be one block outside of that well some counties don't have a very large city or it's a very small area that they have so doesn't mean you have to buy in a bad area you just have to buy outside of the city limits\nAnd you can use the USDA rural development why is it such a good thing well just like the VA loan you can negotiate to sell it to pay all of your closing cost them ... and there's no downpayment [noise]\nBut you have to know where to buy in the county that you're looking in\nYou have all of the loan officers in the office called them up tell them what county you're in and where you'd like to buy a house and find out where in this county maybe the whole county but find out where\nThat you can buy a house using this program where you can be just like the veteran and not need a penny out of your pocket cello pays all of your closing costs in prepaid and there is no downpayment\nNow there is one more restriction\nBesides way you have to buy the house [noise] it's not for somebody making three hundred thousand dollars a year they figure\nNow there is one more restriction\nBesides way you have to buy the house [noise] it's not for somebody making three hundred thousand dollars a year they figure if you're making three hundred thousand dollars a year you could afford a small down payment\nBut the I'll tell you something the income limits are very reasonable in some counties it depends on your family size in your household whether you have one kid with three kids whether you're a single parent or two people and you don't have to be married but if you go to people and you have one or two kids or three caged you're a family of five\nAnd that'll increase your your loan limit I mean your income limit some counties you can make up to a hundred and eleven thousand dollars\nAnd still qualify and some counties you can make up to a hundred and forty nine thousand and still qualify and then in other counties you can only make up to eighty nine thousand a year so again it depends on how many are in your family and in what county are you looking\nTo find out you have all of the loan officers in the office again they're eight hundred number three two one\nFive five a very easy number called them up and even if that's not the time and discuss it with you and you know you're not at a computer so you can look on the map and see where your account or you can buy get their name and their cell phone number and then you can call them back when you have more time and you're in front of your computer\nCalled them up their eight hundred number again three two one\nFive five five they tell me take another quick
