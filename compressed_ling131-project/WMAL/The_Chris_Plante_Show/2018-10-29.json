the mid term elections I worried about the destruction of the middle class in America and the fact that\nI think like neither party has any sense of how to rebuild it\nBut I also want to just point out that I I'm an independent I'm a patriot\nBut I got to tell you when it comes to the ice\nI tune into your show every so often and stuff that you say\nIf some of the most divisive stuff that I ever hear for example I think that at some point you gotta take it on the Chandler mhm\nTake some responsibility for\nThe way you talk to huh well I think I Do take responsibility for the way I talk and I think I open up the lines to people like yourself who uh\nWho offer suggestions like that one and uh I think that if you listen or cross the media universe you'll find a great deal of combat going on no I don't show up when I say this all the time\nI don't show up to a fight against CNN and the Washington Post the New York times and the rest of them with a a butter knife in my hand with a

to toe with them and we're the little guys send those fight may make no mistake about it now and I think you're probably even acknowledge that\nAnd when I show up first of all I Do a very entertaining show we take on the issues of the day and what I Do is not what CNN does not what MSNBC does at least it's not what they're supposed to do having you know worked at CNN for very long time myself\nThat's why they're Republican collaborators because it's like the national socialist German Workers Party movement you know when you stand up for the American constitution individual liberties\nThe socialist call you or not the kind of an interesting thing they harvest the organs of millions of children and they call you and not see that there are good to their grandparents so they feel good you know most Nazis didn't actually killed Jews themselves but but nevertheless\nAh the the the absurdity and the irony of all of this that that Nick was just peddling that I'm too aggressive and that really the problem is talk radio Bill Clinton after the Oklahoma City bombing or a hundred and sixty eight innocent people were murdered\nA Bill Clinton you may remember tried to blame Rush Limbaugh and conservative talk radio\nBecause it's always somebody else's rhetoric but it's never their own rhetoric is never you're the enemy of the people let's never Brock Obama saying get in ... in their faces it's it's a never Hillary Clinton and the entire Democratic Party and that means the news media to\nPainting every Republican as a racist or homophobic massaging us you know the party of the clan the party that exterminate forty percent of the black population in the womb the party of Bill Clinton you want to talk racism and sexism\nAh let's talk Jefferson Davis Sunday in Bedford Forrest on your boys horrible father son George Wallace and Lester Maddox send and Bull Connor you know Democrats you want to talk of anti Semitism let's talk Brock Obama with his pal the

meeting with President Obama and Brock Obama's personal spiritual guide posed for Twenty years\nThe man that presided over his wedding baptized as children bless the property that he bought with a

Chicago said you know the Jews aren't going to ... talk to me when I was\nReally excuse me you know them Jews ain't gonna let him talk to me just to turn it into a more lyrical sort of thing and and and then we've got Dan Rather I looked it up these eighty six years old Dan Rather God Bless him\nHe's eighty six years old and he's going after President Trump before the ... the the smoke cleared on Saturday the Senate got\nNot only after President Trump but going after every one that all who excuse a batch or a stand in silence while hate is still for political gain do you have James Hodgkinson untapped perhaps because James Hodgkinson\nAs a big fan of the Southern Poverty Law Center of MSNBC and Rachel Maddow and Bernie Sanders is a Bernie Sanders volunteer\nMost of the er the hated him but interestingly enough the news media didn't go on a day is lost I read about the about the rhetoric of the Democratic party creating a dangerous situation for members of Congress and the Southern Poverty Law Center which is America's number one have\n[noise] also demonize\nThe family Research Council in Washington DC a left wing terrorists showed up there with a gun and bags full of chick fillet sandwich just\nShot one man the man was a good strong men and beat the hell out of the little left wing I'm a would be mass murderer now I mean you guys want to protect you want to play games of make believe and this is what Nick is really upset about I think\nYou guys want to play these games of make believe we're only certain facts are introduced\nWhere we're only certain arguments are allowed to be made where countered points are are shouted down and ah and yelled over and and I play those all the time on CNN so you know Nick ... listen if you're actually an intelligent\nOn a serious person you're going to come around to my way of thinking because these people are lying all the time and I'm not and there is a very very important difference there and important difference is that I'm not out here lying to you every day I'm reading facts that are inconvenient to the left wing cause of the Democratic party costs\nAnd to the news media but I repeat myself [noise]\nUh but you know once again Nick you have no sense of irony I think I'm really not the problem here uh nobody uh you know Rachel Maddow had one of her fans show up at a baseball field and start blasting members\nI'm really not the problem here uh nobody a Rachel Maddow had one of her fans show up at a baseball field and start blasting members of Congress or I don't I don't have that problem the Southern Poverty Law Center\nHas launched at least two fanatics wonder the family Research Council and the second you know they demonized Congressman Steve Scalise\nSpeaking of which did you see the lefty over the weekend attack Congressman Steve skull lease because Congressman Steve skill lease\n[noise] sent out a tweet about how awful the Pittsburgh tragedy is was and a lefty from vox\nMrs he's a he's a journalist or don't you know and uh he was out there in a heartbeat attacking Steve's college calling him what was it David do he called him David Duke without the\nBaggage David Duke without the baggage this uh this journalists from vox some that's\nConsidered to be our mainstream news media they attack a guy who was shot nearly to death\nBy a left wing fanatic because he expressed his condolences for the people murdered and for the family members\nAnd as a party this anti Israel party which is the Democratic party this anti anti Israel pretty sixty seven borders the party of Jeremiah Wright you know the Jews won't let Brock meet with me\nThe party of the minister Louis Farrakhan I don't think those are a bunch of Trump voters in that room when Louis against the anti Semitism going\nAh so smell yourself Nick and your media allies as well let's go to um let's go to ed word in Virginia Edward you're on the ... plant show\nMorning Chris funding and were you know I'm

to John Kennedy\nThere was reports coming up from Texas to Walter Cronkite was reporting on its side there as right wing groups upset with Adelaide Stevenson who are confronting him and that they were worried about\nJohn F.

A. formally respected organization now just another adjunct to the Democratic party they know that they're getting their statement from an Obama administration official\nAnd I've got more Obama administration official this morning too but first let's go to ... highway been over here this is a Sigmund Harlem and I believe that ... name has friends call in sick\nIs a ... for short\nHair type is for the last ... got for jobs they pay millions of dollars on Showtime and NBC and he's a ... mouth content phase malevolent or his script his ... am words he was on the television this morning and he was talking about the president the United states\nAnd and they left there are still hung up on this the president says I'm a national so then he explained what he means by national is I Want our economy I Want our trade deals I Want our military I Want America to be first which is what the president of France the prime minister of France would say or anyplace else\nBut they said oh yeah oh Hitler called themselves on nationalist\nHitler called himself a socialist too but that doesn't seem to rub off on Bernie Sanders or on Alexandria Ocasio Cortez who didn't grow up in the Bronx\nHitler called himself a socialist too but that doesn't seem to rub off on Bernie Sanders or on Alexander ... al ... who didn't grow up in the Bronx but grew up in Westchester County and as lied about everything and she's as dumb as a stump she's almost as dumb as Mika Brzezinski but not quite\nSink Harlem and this morning summing up his view of the president of the United states\nThe president bothered that race is other to demagogue that they can do that is that there's some national a taker and all the stuff we said\nYeah he obviously condones anti Semitism and needs to accept\nNationalist hatred and it what is a nationalist hatred\nAnd what that is great people from other countries I guess is that what it is but I'm I'm not entirely sure\nI'm sick of him he's a he's on the team he's one of the boys they are the problem of course is it's not them they're not hate filled but they're not angry there not sowing the seeds of discontent\nAnd on MSNBC demo team named James Hodgkinson did not go to a baseball field to mow down the Republican Congress said none of that was inspired by them or or the Southern Poverty Law Center it's always the other guy hits the other number ... the other crap they remember that\nThis is is it's it's Trump and Fox News they're at war with Fox News because they don't scene from the party sheet music\nOut what happened at Fox here's what happened at Fox News out of the Republican Party what happened to it is they were both corrupt bankrupted that hollowed out and waiting to be taken over by Donald Trump\nSaid now been taken over by Donald Trump of course much worse uglier place and they were five years ago ten years ago ... years ago they were in pretty ugly places back that for much of a weird place now\nI don't I don't know why anybody would show up at a baseball field and start shooting republic if you're an MSNBC fan I don't know\nWhy the hostility see the jail pay the Republicans were corrupt and bankrupt institution before Trump came along but then he took the Republicans the entirety of the Republican sixty some odd million people\nTo a very dark and scary place and and then there's the Obama and the other but dehumanizing again I'm pretty much shocked\nThat some leftist doesn't literally shoot at President Trump every day of the week the way these people spread hatred and I got I don't know how many Republican members of Congress have to be made political assassination attempt all this stuff but white partners yet has treated us nothing and honestly the news media is\nPassive approach to all of the violence that we've written witnessed over the last two to three years\nHas field it and they're turning a blind eye to the white powder to James Hodgkinson to MSNBC Israel to Rachel Maddow Israel\nTo the political ... violence of antifa to to the political violence against the police which has inspired by the Democrat Party the news and Brock Obama specifically the news media turns a blind eye to all of that they tamped that down for the Democrats none of that becomes a part of the public discussion\nAnd only violence that is perceived to be coming from conservatives is is\nFocused on a embellished by the news media and so on saying Hi lament the dehumanization program\n... not even a question of whether it's presidential behavior not not\nOnly human behavior in these circumstances and the fact that it has on his followers on his ... his base of course [noise]\nCorrosive dangerous of course\nThat's right the ... to cause the followers and the devil to serve the\nReal problem and the big problem of course across America is a right wing terrorism now a moat Yarborough it used to be a A N is they love this white nationalist thing this is something that I've latched onto like a pit bull and they're not letting go and they've got like a job because of the sickness brought in by people from the caravan\nDog whistle here uh with Donald Trump these are there are a fog corn he's blaring it out [noise] he he wants the white nationalist to know that he's on their side\nHe's like a New York business billionaire white nationalists from queens white nationalist they they ... out of whole cloth\nAnd the pedal it every day and then they invited this miscreants on by the name of ... Miller who looks like a vampire like a transgender vampire actually\nAnd he's a strange kind of creepy little man that you wouldn't leave alone with the kids for a minute he's of course an Obama administration official who was there a propagandist\nAt Loretta Lynch is State Department when all of the corruption was going on spying on their political enemies and all that stuff so that's why NBC pay is this person Matt Miller again a Democrat Party apparatus chicken they bring 'em out and they treat him like he's an objective arbiter\nWhy NBC pays this\nPerson Matt Miller again a Democrat Party apparatus chicken they bring about and they treat him like he's an objective arbiter decided it was a former government official they don't ... mentioned that he's a Democrat Party\nSpokesman in ... they they say is like a Justice Department official for relief or who like a career person no he's a political rancor\nAnd the guy is unbelievable but he put his finger on the problem in America\nIt's clear now there is a serious for right wing domestic terrorism problem in this country\nShould I start playing the audio again Shai by the end ... audio do we have the police being shot audio in Texas in Baton Rouge or do we have the funerals from New York\nThen we have James Hodgkinson shooting up the ... the problem is well there there was be completely benign non lethal the so called bombs are which are a perfect parallel for the white envelopes", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Chris Plante Show", "city": "Washington", "day": "29"}
