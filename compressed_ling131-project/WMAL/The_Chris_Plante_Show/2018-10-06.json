and go right back to the phones I think we've got to my old buddy Steve from Potomac morning Steve thanks for calling\nGood morning my coauthor you I Am just trying\nIn ... my old buddy Steve from Potomac morning Steve thanks for calling\n... how are you I Am just fine how are you a missed you [laughter] yeah I get your um show though even when I'm On travel for a yard [laughter] um I can you hold\nOn a show\nYou you're talking about just claiming something yeah yeah that's\nOkay yes I can say oh I can try anyway you know what I'm\nLike [laughter] a lot to do\nA ... you know or see look what state are you asking about here is a technique called disclaimer which is sanctioned by the Internal Revenue code we usually talk about a qualified disclaimer [noise] the concept is is [noise]\nSomebody dies and they leave you\nShare of their state they ... they leave you an inheritance [noise]\nYou review the situation you say you know what I don't need any more money I don't need any I don't any more things in my life [noise]\nUm this is just going to add to my own planning problems and maybe increase my tax burden or my family's tax burden down the road and I I just don't I don't want this inheritance [noise]\nWhat uh I I Wish you could go to somebody else now [noise]\nIf you do it correctly\nWhat you do when you've got to exercise this option you have within nine months of the day to the person's death for this to be effective for tax purposes you this claim the inheritance you say I don't want what uncle Charlie left me [noise]\nWhen that happens\nThe law the way the system works is that whomever would be entitled to after you\nUnder uncle Charlie will or the intestines laws or however he directed the disposition of this particular asset [noise]\nWhoever would succeed you according to uncle Charlie's will was to send me had a will now gets\nThat inheritance that you just claimed\nNow couple of things to note here one you can't decide who is going to get it in other words vocal Charlie will says uh I leave my a family farm just so and so so and so renounce as the farm ... rejects it does claims it [noise]\nIt's going to go to whomever was next in line under Charlie's will you can't say I just climate I wanted to go to\nSomebody else that you name\nThe disclaimer operates to\nRestore order put put the estate in the position that would have been it would've been in if you had pre deceased uncle Charlie in this example\n[noise] [laughter] [noise]\nAnd so ... and if you do that\nThen it won't be considered a transfer from you it will be for for tax purposes in this case is if you had in fact pre deceased called Charlie and the property was distributed to say I say whoever uncle Charlie a designated\nIn your in his will now want to see what's often going on in the situation is that called Charlie will of left to family farms to you and if you preserve sees him to your children an equal shares which is where you wanted to go and that's fine so if you just claimed the farm\nBecause uncle Charlie will\nMaimed your children is next in line they're going to get on culturally from it won't be part of your state you will not be considered to have made a gift of the farm you'd just be out of the picture entirely [noise]\nThis is often a helpful device in many tax planning situations\nSometimes we will have a spouse for instance give her or give him the option to just claim something they'd been left under their deceased spouses will or trust [noise]\nIn that case\nWe can have a in the next in line a crust for the benefit of this spouse so rather than her or him\nInheriting whatever it was as an individual\nThat property that asset will go into trust for their benefit this can have important tax implications that can have some important asset protection in ...\nFor the surviving spouse who's disappointed in for the family who's gonna come after the death of the surviving spouse now look I Know that gets a little technical but the point isn't Steve raises\nOh who's disappointed in for the family who's going to come after the death of the surviving spouse to look into this gets a little technical but the point is Steve raises an important issue here\nIs the disclaimer hers are one of the tools the planners have in many cases to do some post mortem planning\nSo again I'm I'm Glad to or two of our favorite listeners Steve from Potomac and uh I received from Springfield calling in this warning love to talk to these guys they always have great questions and ah [noise]\nGlad they called them to go to a Ralph and ... says do good morning real things for you calling how can I Try to help you this morning\nI I ah my mother passed away quick fourteen I'm Sherry ... county state's like just about a million or a little bit under\nThe ... well a couple of months ago so I'm behind\nBut I keep hearing this I've got to do something with it nine month of their ethics\nBut they really don't go into a breeze or anything like that so I didn't know if I'm In trouble you know this this at fourteen so\nThat that is the will they sent me the packet list or ... the packet show highlighted everything could be a lot to be appointed a jacket or which which was named the will\nOnly thing I'm worried about this nine month requirement to be getting which I have not been years and years and years so I don't know where I'm standing right now\nYeah you're now you're you know if if the reward for turning in people like you I'd be over there with my hand cuts no no Ralph you're not in trouble um the nine months we are I was talking about nine months at a time limit earlier when when we were talking about a disclaimer just with Steve\nI'm certain tax options have to be\nExercised within nine months of the day to death and they're not just disclaimer is but the other options filing what are called portability returns et cetera et cetera\nBut the fact that you did your five years wait and there were what what'd you say she died your your your mom died four years ago did you say you you know you and you've just found the will no you're not you're not in trouble\nUm you you just go in fill out the forms as you say you've got the forms and or you can you can breathe easy you're not\nYou're not going to go to jail this time now this is the last warning we give you\nA actually though I Am with my wife so you know might be a divorce so that's why this kind of leave it everything in my ... have a well there's always more to it\nOkay ... new book you're you're you're okay you're okay right now I wouldn't delay any further in case\n... look there are bad things happen to good people so if something were to happen to you before you went through the probate process\nThen whomever came next in under your mom's will would be entitled to things and you know things might get more complicated so I'm not suggesting you do a lay any further but what I'm saying is you're not you're not in trouble at this juncture now\nHow that would affect any uh for divorce arrangement in what a divorce lawyer would say about your if you went through a divorce\nYour spouse is right to get any this cause your spouse wouldn't be entitled\nTo an inheritance anyway from your mom so I but but I don't I don't want to ... I don't want to comment on other potential ramifications there could be some asset protection I'm a implications of this the way maybe you would be charged in certain ... or ... were\nDeemed in certain context to already own these things just be because you are entitled to them but that's a whole different issue you're not in trouble at this point let me put it that way [noise]\nGood calls we take a little break here for a couple of announcements if you're not yet in the queue now's the time made it age six three oh nine six two five eight eighty six three oh nine six to ... this is my town's legally speaking on WMA hill right back after the break\nWouldn't it be awesome if instead of worrying land and for how much you're homeless out for you could call up a real estate agent to just write you a check for your homes guarantee you\nThis is Mary Walter and went had her and Chris became empty nesters they wanted to downsize what they didn't anticipate was finding their perfect home so quickly not wanting to lose their dream home but still leading to sell their current home they called they carry shell team true to her guarantee Carey wrote Heather and Chris a check for too\nTheir dream home but still leading to sell their current home they called they carry shell team true to her guaranteed Carey wrote Heather and Chris a check for two million dollars that's right two million dollars carry shell is so confident in her system for selling homes that she guarantee that if she can sell your home at a price in deadline you agreed to shell by it\nThey carry cell team has fought over ten million dollars worth of clients' homes backing up they're guaranteed\nSo take the worry at of selling your home and call the only agent that I Would call we're at a semi home called Cary shell at seven and a three nine five to sold that seven oh three nine five to sold or go on line to carry shell dot com that's K.

the yields on ten year treasuries is now at the highest level in seven years yeah we've exceeded the interest rate on ten year treasuries since two thousand eleven\nNow people would say ordinarily well gee golly isn't a ... you know higher yield better because that means I'm earning a higher rate of return on a mud bonds no because if the deal goes up that means the interest rate is up\nThat means the value of the bond is down so if we're at the highest interest rate since two thousand eleven innings we're at the lowest price since two thousand eleven uh and that is not good news if you own long term bonds and that is why uh you've got to be really careful about your investment strategy\nUh but uh you know there's another statistic that's that's really fascinating at the same time

due the interest rate increases\nDemonstrates that is as is usually the case in the world of investing if the tale of two cities and it's really important that you recognize this and maintain a highly diversified investment portfolio\nSeventy three percent say that they factor their finances into the decision of becoming a parent in the Nineteen eighties only thirty three percent of people in their twenties and thirties did that the average cost of raising a child today is now about a quarter of a million dollars\nNine out of ten parents say they're surprised at how much money they spent\nBy becoming a parent\nAnd nearly two thirds say they encounter financial difficulties associated with parents and\nEven children who are living independently are receiving financial support from their parents parents are contributing to school costs health insurance rent car expenses parents or even paying for food and for cell phone service for their adult children\nThe numbers are rather astonishing thirty one percent of Americans who are age of Eighteen to thirty four thirty one percent we're talking basically one at a free of\nPeople in their twenties and thirties or living with their parents we actually have more people in their twenties and thirties living with their parents than living with us spouse that\nThere's something new and different for the society\nParents are saying they're not going to be off the hook anytime soon fifty nine percent say they expect to help pay for their children's weddings okay nothing new about that mom and dad have been paying for their daughters weddings for pretty much forever\nBut twenty six percent say they're expecting to contribute to their children's first homes\nThirty three percent expect to contribute to their grandchildren's college costs so it's not just you're paying for the wedding for the kid you're paying for the house you're paying for their kids' education as well\nAnd here's what's really shocking an amazing about this the reason the parents are providing so much financial support to their kids is because the kids are unable to handle this on their own independently maybe it's because kids didn't grow up with any financial education they are financially illiterate\nAnd yet about sixty percent of parents say that they taught their children the benefits of investing or really\nOnly half of teenagers agree with that statement so mom and dad you might think that you have given your kids the information that they need to begin investing but\nChances are you're wrong about that changes are your kids don't agree that you have given them the information and education and device in counseling that in fact that they need is it any wonder\nThat three fourths of parents wish that they had help teaching their children about investing\nHello here I Am and so I'm really excited to remind you that we have a new book for children on money\nThe squirrels manifesto is being published by Simon and Schuster it's being released in November it's our first children's book Jean and I wrote it together\nWe collaborated with ... who is a fabulous artist he's a former animator for Disney he did such movies the lion king and beauty and the beast and others and\nIt's lavishly illustrator I'm not sure the contents great but they are is fabulous and we're really excited that this is our first children's book aimed at kids three to six years old\nSo it's designed to help you teach your children and grandchildren the basic fundamentals of what's most important about money in your children's lives we need to make sure that our kids are growing up correctly and parents you need to recognize\nThe old school notion that when you know the kids are out of college they're out of my life financially that is not likely to be true you need to recognize your financial support of your children is likely to continue for another decade or two\nAnd you need the fact that in to your financial planning\nAnd it's rather amazing I'm going to ask you this question do you know the meaning of the phrase savings account you know what that is I'm sure you do eighty eight percent in a recent survey knew the answer to a savings account Seventy six percent could explain what a credit union is\nSeventy two percent ... what a net worth is by the way\nSavings account Seventy six percent could explain what a credit union is\nSeventy two percent ... what a net worth is by the way network that you're not sure some thirty percent or not you'd take everything you do now and you subtract everything you oh so you take for example your house my miss the mortgage balance\nSo you take your investments your savings and used to track what you owe to credit cards and loans that's your net worth\nSixty seven percent are able to explain what a recession is are you able to do that you know what a recession is a recession is when the U.S economy has gone backwards\nFor two quarters in a row so instead of economic growth it receives picture the tide going out that's what a recession is and how about\nIt point can you explain to anybody with bitcoin is less than half of Americans know that is it any wonder\nThat only sixteen percent of Americans say they have a high level of financial literacy these kinds of issues and questions face that's every single day taxes insurance\nMortgages employee benefits at work\nBuying versus leasing automobiles signing up for credit cards understanding how to establish a bank account and how to balance that bank account estate planning\nAll of these issues regarding retirement planning in college planning affect us on a daily basis and yet most Americans are not able to answer a lot of these basic questions and we find now as a result of this that kids are growing up in sufficiently prepared for the personal finances\nForcing mom and dad to help them pay for the wedding pay for their houses pay for their kids' educations\nSeverely impacting the parent's ability to save for their own retirement according to the joy survey\nFive hundred billion dollars a year that parents are spending on their kids who are in their twenties and thirties even paying seriously for their cell phone\nOn top of this to our prices just come out with its annual parents kids and money survey\nTwenty seven percent of parents say they're losing sleep over college costs\nBy the way think about that only twenty seven percent you know why I say only twenty seven percent two years ago it was forty two percent two years ago nearly half of parents were losing sleep over college costs now about half of that number why is that\nBecause parents are far less willing to take on massive student loan debt\nOn behalf of their children so hey parents I ... I'm sleeping just fine 'cause I'm not borrowing the money to get you into college parents are now more willing to send their kids to less expensive schools\nIn order to avoid student loans and all of that is fabulous parents have been around the country are saying this student loan debt is ridiculous one point four trillion dollars in student loan debt in this country more than we owe to credit cards collectively\nAnd it's just damaging the child's ability to get a good start in life it's damaging the parents personal finances evade co signed those loans or outright paying for them\nAnd so it's a real crisis and yet\nMany parents are still not saving and the best way meaning in a college savings account one third of parents mistakenly believed that they'll lose any money they don't spend in a five twenty non account if the kid doesn't use that money for college that's not true the money isn't lost\nHalf of parents think they're contributing to a five twenty nine account will hurt their ability to get financial aid and that's not true either\nAnd here's the worst part you tell me\nYou had to choose one or the other which would you choose saving for your own retirement or saving for your kid's college\nSeventy four percent say that they would choose to save for their kids college instead of their own retirement that's a huge mistake why\nBecause your kid can pay for college while they're working for the rest of their career but you can't pay for retirement while you were in retirement you must have pre fund your retirement account you must save for retirement first even if it means that child has to find an alternative way to get the college degree\nIf you need help with all of these issues how do you adjust your personal finances to consider the fact that you're going to be spending money on your children for a decade or two longer than you thought if you're struggling to both pay for college and your own retirement\nGive us a call call us a triple eight plan wreck that's triple eight seven five to sixty seven forty two we can help you structure your income and expenses to take best advantage of the resources available to you\nLet us all the like we felt thousands of folks just like you Tripoli plan wreck poor visit us online at ... dot com that's ...\nLet us help you look we felt thousands of folks just like huge triple each plane wreck poor visit us online at ... dot com that's price film and [noise]\nArticles on personal point of sign up for the military\nYour ... your emotions be getting in your way when you're trying to make good investment decisions\nYou seemed a little bit surprised with a ... was listening to all sides of the U.S but I think your insurance because of course I don't pay much attention when they talk about four to one case Ross IRAs and stuff like that because the roads here are totally different but\nI Do find or opinion when it comes to principals\n[noise] like financial responsibility a diversification editor location dollar cost averaging or or in my case ... and my question is about one of those general principles budget\nIf I'm not mistaken you said here as the shows at budgeting is not a very good use of someone's type but wells take a look at my case for instance I have two daughters one is eight years old all the run this two years old the youngest one would go to a profit school next year just like the oldest [noise]\nSo far I've been able to save a little more literal above twenty percent of my income about was is that ... if I don't make adjustments or want to be able to save as much and I'm going to be saving about ... much of what I'm saving the health\nAnd allowed I'd like to avoid it [noise] was that in my\nI'm starting to work on my budget for two thousand Nineteen so I can see where it can cut the expense of my income is pretty much in ... I Can't do much about it [noise]\nI Know it was not enough just to promise to myself how much I'm going to spend every most but it isn't a place to start\nSome listeners may be facing a similar situation [noise] and it suggests for us make a budget turnout\nThat was cast or with a really good question about budgets ten had the very same question let's listen to him\nI wrecked this is Tim from Santa Barbara California\n[laughter] I Know you don't like budgets I've been listening to you for a long time to blanket statement that I don't agree with I'd been budgeting myself for Thirty years and it's worked very very well for me I understand your position is that most people just can't stick to budget [laughter] okay fair enough but most people can't say anything to tell you the truth [laughter] so\nTo me a budget is essential especially for retirement plan you have to do pro forma budgeting [laughter] maybe you could explain your position a little bit more in depth I Would really appreciate it\nFall I'm happy to reply to both ah both of you to amend the Castro thanks so much for your aspirin submission and yeah it's it's a big deal because we all are raised on the importance of a budget and frankly it's a waste of time I know that this is what you disagree with hearing me say but here's why I say\nA budget is a promise on how you're going to spend money\nAnd we all know that life gets in the way I'm sure you're not budgeting for the fact\nYour car might break down in six months you're not budgeting for a medical issue that you don't know you're going to incur you haven't budgeted\nFor a job loss you haven't budgeted for your sister announcing she's getting married and you not only have to buy address but you've got to buy an airline ticket to go to the wedding and you're going to have to buy a president and you're going to have to have to have to have to life gets in the way unexpectedly\nAnd that's why budgets rarely work out\nSo there are two things I Want you to do instead of budgeting that are far more effective\nFirst\nOf telling me how you're going to spend your money which is what a budget is you're telling me what you're going to do I want you to go backwards in your checkbook for the past six months or even better one year\nAnd show me how you did spend your money because I'm willing to bet that how you did spend your money over the past year is how you're pretty much going to spend your money over the next year it'll be a far more accurate analysis of what you can reasonably expect your expenses to look like\nSecond decide first and foremost up front how much money you are going to save for the future\nHow much you're going to save for retirement I'm going to say for college how much you're going to save for say home buying or buying a boat or whatever it is you want to save for you tell me how much money you're going to save and in fact more importantly you go ahead and do that once you're saving enough money to which\nIf for you tell me how much money you're going to save and in fact more importantly you go ahead and do that once you're saving enough money to achieve your goals I don't really care how you spend the rest of your money it doesn't matter anymore\nBecause you've already saved in other words pat yourself first ... once you save money\nYou can spend all the rest of your money and don't worry if you run out of it did you ever noticed that you run out of money in the ...\nThe problem is you run out of money before you've saved for your future so if you treat yourself as a bill if you treat yourself as a creditor you must pay by participating in your retirement plan at work or saving a mutual fund or who knows what then\nThe rest of it goes away and the need for budgeting disappears it's as simple as that know by the way to\nDo what you've been doing has been working for you\nGreat keep on doing it my concern is that people are engaged in behaviors that aren't working and all they do is feel badly that they are not sticking to their budget or that they haven't been able to show the discipline to do what they need to do\nAs you listen to the advice some information on this radio

N. A. L. more Washington comes to talk [noise]\nMuslim natural the rebels and show we often talk about the Social Security trust fund and the fact that is slowly being depleted well some would say not so slowly over the next\nTen to twelve years it's going to be wiped out that trust fund is at risk of being completely depleted and that's got implications not only for American retirees with American taxpayers who might be asked to foot the bill for restoring the trust fund to it's needed levels\nDon't talk about all this and more importantly what's going on in the retirement security marketplace and what is the field of behavioral finance got to do with all this\nI'm happy to bring on to the program Brigitte ...\nWho's professor of public policy in corporate management at Harvard University she's also Dina Brigham Young University of Maryland School of business Bridget thank you so much for joining us on the program\nIt's my pleasure being here so bridges also retirement commissioner of the bipartisan Policy Center she got her PHD in economics from MIT and it's a two time recipient of the ... award for scholarly research on lifelong financial security\nSo Bridget you're one of those experts that people like me love the quote love to talk about all the time so let me start with a little quiz near you're going to know the answer to this but I Want to see how well our listeners do in this cute little quiz you're ready for this\nI'm ready so if I were to give you a penny or a woman ten chance to win ten cents which would you choose the penny or the one in ten chance to win a dime\nMe I Would pick that one in ten chance to win a dime\nYeah I I think most of our listeners will agree with you on that now let me change the question will hear a little bit let's say I were to give you ten million dollars for a one in ten chance to get a hundred million now which would you pick\nNow I'd pick the ten million for sure\nAnd I think most folks would agree with you on that but here's the fascinating thing and of course you realize this in both cases the chances of success or one in ten they haven't changed and since the one in ten hasn't changed your answer shouldn't have changed either\nClassic economics says that both should result in the same attitude but you've demonstrated a very different attitude between the penny versus the ten million dollars and that's the core of behavioral economics isn't it\nYeah that's exactly the court now and I expect that psychology with which we approach financial decision making often result in different answers that actually work to be purely rational logical and consistently followed the financial choices we make\nAnd the crazy thing is that Richard Thaler won the Nobel Prize last year for his work and behavioral finance and also there was a Nobel one and two thousand two on the same subject but what took so long for the field of economics to figure this out\nThe fact that humans don't act rationally the markets aren't rational because humans are emotional creatures what took so long for everybody to figure that out why is it only just now finally becoming part of public policy\nA interesting thing is if you go back and read Adam Smith\nIs often cited as the father of modern economics you as a you know writing back in the Seventeen hundreds or he very much a behavioral economist\nIn the Nineteen thirties and an attempt to to be taken more seriously a as a as a science kind of started giving mathematical model with people being rational so\nMore seriously a as a as a science kind of started using mathematical models with people being rational\nSo it's only and I you know more recently that has caused economist to to rethink their model of how people do make decisions as opposed to as opposed to how maybe they should make decisions\nGive me one example of how that's translated into the marketplace affecting ordinary folk\nUh companies are now moving towards automatic enrollment you're automatically enrolled in a savings plan unless you opt out the U.S is encouraging this\nUm other countries that have gone and you know a step further so the u._k. several years ago a rolled out of pension for reform and they are requiring employers\nTo use automatic enrollment and they've seen the fraction of their workforce that's participating in a retirement savings plan\nIncrease by more than twenty five percentage points in the span of four or five years\nAnd in fact just really does the same thing they have a nine and a half percent mandatory were contribution for their retirement savings for every employee in the country and so their savings compared to other nations as huge tummy series of personal finance improve how we think about Social Security and the challenges it's facing\nI think they can so uh one interesting feature of Social Security is that you can start claiming it as early as age sixty two ah but if you wait and start claiming the benefits later your monthly check will be higher\nUm and that creates an incentive a financial incentive to delay claiming but if you can get people to start thinking about reasons why it might be beneficial for them to the lake claiming Social Security and to a later age you can get people to uh\nYou know move away from the mindset of oh it's available I ought to take it right away\nIt was a bit of a challenge I remember reading studies where they put a five year old in a room with a candy bar and they say that the trial if you don't eat the candy bar now leader will give you two almost every kid takes the candy bar immediately they don't wait\nThe notion of delayed gratification is really difficult to overcome compared to our desire for immediate gratification\nSo when you said or retiree how you can have eighty percent of your benefit right now sixty two but if you wait age Seventy you'll get a hundred and ten percent of the benefit it's really hard for that person to say okay I'll Wait eight more years we overcome that challenge\nAlso one way you can overcome it is it is to reframe the decision making and you frame it as if the normal thing to do the regular thing I think that most people do is to wait and we're very cute in to social norms\nSo you know the five year old if they were in a room where all of the other kids were waiting for the second candy bar it'd be much easier for them in a two way as well\nYeah and also when we were to say that\nIf you take the money and sixty two you'll be paralyzed in some form of losing some of the mummy would otherwise be entitled to receive yes\nIt's so exciting to see the signs of behavioral finance being applied in very fundamental material practical ways they can have a huge impact on people's lives and by extension the entire Social Security situation or the other changes of policymakers can look up to help us close the retirement savings shortfall\nYeah the only about half of the workforce is participating in a four O. one K. plan so\nWe have a number of states that are a setting up um state a programs\nThat will facilitate savings by workers at these companies that don't offer a four one K. plans and the U.S it's really easy to tap into your money well before retirement and some countries it's impossible or it's extremely costly to do so\nI'm about forty cents of every dollar that goes into the system is pulled out of their retirement system but for people even get to age fifty five so before they're anywhere close to retirement\nSo the the word that gets used to describe this in the industry is leakage we have a lot of leakage and we need to find ways to reduce the amount of leakage\nAnd that's going to leave a lot more money in the system uh for the long term which would be a good thing\nSo I'm really glad we've got this kind of thinking going on with the public policy arena and how can help people despite our own natural tendencies improve or likelihood for achieving the financial security that we've been looking for\nWe've been talking with Richard ... who's a professor of public policy in corporate management at Harvard University and do the Brigham Young university is Mary school of business Bridget thank you so much for joining us on the program today\nMy pleasure Andrea gentleman you're listening to the gentleman show if you want to learn more about the initiative were in danger union with\nAnd it's on the program today my pleasure Ira gentleman you're listening to the rebels and show if you want to learn more about the initiative were engaging in with our efforts to fix the Social Security system and more broadly improve retirement security for all Americans\nGo to funding our future dock us and you can learn more about what we're doing and how you can help\nThem recover and this is the truth about money Tripoli and rich\nIs with us on line at rice dome and\nOr two about\nComing up on the gentleman\nYou're thinking about retirement Social Security pension investments will you have enough income to enjoy yourself\nWe're taking telephone calls here on the Rick Edelman show we're talking with Donald Eason water Marilyn welcome to the show Donald how are you\nVery well thank you nice to talk to you too how can I help\nYou spoke recently of the many advantages of waiting until late Seventy to start collecting Social Security benefits right but\nYou didn't mention two of the biggest reasons that I uh favorite and a one way to eight Seventy to get your benefits or is it is true and it isn't very advantageous in the meantime uh after full retirement age at least your\nBenefits go eight percent tax free uh where where else can I get eight percent tax free\nVirtually guaranteed unless the government failed that's a good a good thing and even if you do not live long enough which seems to be a concern that many people\nTo receive is much accrued benefit as if you had taken Social Security at sixty two [noise] uh if you do wait until toward Seventy or at eight Seventy here surviving spouse will get a much larger monthly benefit after you're no longer able to collect them\nI think you're raising really too too very important point Donald I'm really glad you did you get it and that's great are a lot of folks really down\nThe one thing I Would stress is not nearly that you earn this extra eight percent for every year delay starting at your full retirement age of sixty six that begins started way back at age sixty two in other words if you begin to collect benefits at age sixty two you get eighty percent of what your benefit otherwise would be and if you wait\nA year it'll be eight percent higher you wait another year early another eight percent higher every year all the way the eight Seventy so you're absolutely right\nThere's tremendous value our caller delayed gratification many Americans are taking the money at sixty to simply because they don't realize that they don't know that there's a huge economic value to delaying\nAnd so uh it is really interesting now there are some caviar set that we have to recognize\nThat could impact the decision for folks\nAre not least of which of course some people just frankly need the money they don't have the luxury of waiting eight more years to get their Social Security benefits but assuming it's optional for you\nYou've got to take into consideration several things number one are you still working or are you still earning an income because if you earn too much then you could lose some of those Social Security benefits either by claw backs from SSI\nWar the Social Security administration or uh some of the benefits could be taxable so that's one factor another factor is that the benefit you receive could have an impact on what you pay for Medicare\nUh so we have to offset a the benefit you're getting versus the costs you might be otherwise incurring so there are complications that's a shame that the Social Security system is so crazily complicated\nBut fundamentally all of the factors being equal you're absolutely right download a great many Americans would be better off for so many years\nBy delaying their Social Security benefits this is like a double whammy it's a double benefit that I think you really can't match anywhere else so I'm really glad that you brought this up because uh you you you've been thinking about it a lot you you're right on the money\nAnd I wish everybody else is doing a good his job as you are and we'll pay close attention to what you're saying messages real simple\nBe really careful about when you begin your Social Security benefits do not assume you should take them as soon as you're eligible the longer you wait in many cases the better off you're going to be\nDonald thanks so much for that phone call\nLet me share with you now changing the subject\nUh I'm here in San Francisco as I mentioned to you that's why I'm broadcasting here from a from the bay area\nIt's the San Francisco block

how bitcoin gee you know what that is they ask people on the streets of San Francisco what is the point\nI've heard of it and I know it did just trying to get rid of that [noise]\nThat um cash flow
