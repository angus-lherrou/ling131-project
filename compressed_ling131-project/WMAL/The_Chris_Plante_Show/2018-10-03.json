the news media does\nIf the FBI doesn't interview that everybody that the news media wants to be interviewed them they will deem the FBI investigation to be less than legitimate and it will validate

it is\nI'm not all of the establishment but the Democratic party and the establishment news media which is corrupt to its core\nAnd I was thinking about the uh the great American novel to kill a

a I'm a black man in a southern town\nWho was accused of raping a white woman and it was effectively and orderly Lynch mob that was taking place they had the trappings of the courts and everything else but uh what was his name Tom Robinson was accused of rape and and he was innocent\nAnd Atticus Finch stepped forward to defend him because he recognized that what was happening was wrong it was a Lynch mob and the court was being used in the town's people rallied to destroy this man Tom Robinson who had been accused but not convicted\nAnd so they attempted to hold the kangaroo court to Lynch in effect legally Tom Robinson for a crime but he did not commit\n[noise] and I was wondering\nWhere is Atticus Finch today I don't maybe Lindsey Graham is Atticus Finch who is the Atticus Finch Chavez story\nWho's the hero of our story who's the good guy because Brett Kavanaugh is Tom Robinson and uh gosh I don't know we're gonna have to settle for a Lindsey Graham playing the role of Atticus Finch\nAnd the story [noise] this is a this is a Lynch mob and there are two kinds of people in the world\nKinda seal a Lynch mob forming and want to join a another kind of see a Lynch mob

instructions to the news media vendors media takes it from there it's good to be a Democrat with extremely corrupt people in the news media carrying your water for you\nNow an amazing story came out last night there are a couple of stories updating on the so called accusers involved and all of this\nAnd there are three accusers right we have Dr Christine Ford right and then we have the Yale a woman who said somebody but she's not sure who ... her face when she was a freshman in college I\nDon't know what she was majoring in but nevertheless that's what she\nBut she's not sure who ... in her face when she was a freshman in college I don't know what she was majoring in but nevertheless that's what she says but she didn't tell her friends according to the New York times at least if you can believe them in the weeks leading up to these bomb shell reports\nThat she didn't remember who it was ... interface at a party while she was drunk 'cause a freshman at Yale all those decades ago she really doesn't know for sure\nAnd I know it was case now and I'm In\nThis interview she didn't say that she saw a gang rape she said that she saw guys standing around the door and talking\nShe didn't say that she saw Brett Kavanaugh dropping quaint loads into the punch\nShe said she saw Brett Kavanaugh Brett Kavanaugh handing out red solo cups of people I looked up red solo cups to see if they're around in the early Nineteen eighties\nIt's iffy iffy they that they were invented the inventor of the rent so low cut from Northfield, Illinois I researched it red solo cello cup company has saw their credit the company credit in the late Nineteen seventies apparently the solo cups\nAnd they do different colors and clear and all that stuff\nBut when the red cell ... really caught on her popularity has a little unclear I wasn't able to establish that completely but it's not clear that that's even real\nShe's that Kevin who is president the party's Julie never said anything about being sexually assaulted raped gang raped her having sex against her will ... said she never mentioned Brett Kavanaugh in any capacity\nHe said that when he was running for Congress in Nineteen Ninety six he called Julie sweat Nick's father to try to get back in contact with Julie to ask or help\nWith the campaign quote when I talk to him\nJulie sweating ex father when I talked to him about possibly bringing Julie on to help with my campaign he told me she had psychological and other problems at the time ... said\n... submitted a statement to the committee under penalty of felony if he's lying\nMichael ... the creepy porn lawyer representing Julie sweat and they\nSaid the letter from Canada is desperate and called on the FBI to interview both cat her and sweat neck and they just want to keep expanding and more people to the list haven't had a here's the gritty porn lawyer said don't let her from Dennis ... is garbage that G O P is desperate yeah it's the GOP that's desperate\nThe allegations he makes are false and without any basis as opposed to her allegations of gang rapes going on for years that little suburban parties in Washington and nobody came for\nWhere he demanded that the FBI interview my clients and him and that anyone found submitted false info can be prosecuted to the full extent of the law\nWell I think that's a good idea I'm all in favor of that I've already talked about that and that would include your clients and it might include you creepy porn lawyer [noise] speaking of which Alan Dershowitz says that if Julie sweating to glide she should be tried for perjury\nAnd sent to prison that's what he said [noise] Alan Dershowitz\nA law professor emeritus at Harvard University professor to all of the like half the players and miss this grand stage play\nHe was a law professor at all of them let's go to a ... ... yeah and he's the one who famously Dershowitz had Ted Cruz as a student and he said he was one of the most brilliant students he's ever had in his entire many decades long career teaching law at Harvard\nAnd um and also bronco bottle went to Harvard law school and he was asked well what about Rocco bought up and he said

pleasure to speak with you welcome I enjoy your show very much thank you figure hyperbole is hilarious [laughter] I Would like to address serious allergy and using Harper Lee is excellent novel [laughter]\n[noise] I think it will center I'm Sorry I was just ... I think it's rather ironic that um he would use that Lynch mob analogy when it seems just that is what's being done to Dr Ford\nIt does look rather a full impartial investigation\nI think we've already had it in your eyes you we've already there and I don't know how many full and in order to listen to this is now a ... you're suggesting that the Lynch mob is in reality and not the Democrats going after Brett Kavanaugh\nNo I think the Lynch mob is being led by our president who is mocking someone who is only a few days ago he called credible\nAnd and that it and attempts to push this nominee through yet is honestly if if you're if you're trying to dispute the kangaroo court yes we shouldn't have an impartial investigation we should have the\nYeah it is honestly if if you're if you're trying to just ... the kangaroo court yes we shouldn't have an impartial investigation we should have the FBI do a whole\nUnrestricted investigation\nI think you're a few days behind aren't shy as not taking place now or is that inadequate to ask\nIf there are questions on whether or not it's restricted there are people who haven't even been interviewed yet and there's report said that\nYou've been watching MSNBC completed maybe even today yeah that was that he had to leave that doesn't do that really aren't\nBeing rather restricted if they haven't interviewed all the people who were you know in question\nYou are faithfully agree Lee are faithfully parroting the party line which I saw faithfully turn it on her\nOn faithfully parroting the truth\nTruth is that seem to be sticking to your narrative button on record I dance here think no sense of irony about the kangaroo court against judge\nKavanaugh none of them have an essence of higher they what's happening there against Dr Ford they don't listen to what we\nKnow let me ask you this that you think he committed perjury he should be charged and going to prison\nSure well yea or whatever they may have lied wasn't there is evidence that there are only applied to the Senate do you think there's a lot about about drinking in college\nWell about legally drinking with not Seventeen now let me point there's even a kitten when kids Eighteen\nAgain you're you're a faithful Democrat and you're trying to be reasonable so Lenny where I'm just faithful to the truth and you're ... you're no longer no you're not that you know that's not the fact\nNow that's beautiful I don't know that's not indisputable watch any dispute it didn't just the other day called Dr phil ... you're not you're repeating yourself you're you're like Dr asking you know you don't understand you don't understand that you just said that a minute ago\nYou're not going to answer the question because you're ... ... what's the question you I I you're you're incoherent and it sounds like you're having some kind of unravel you're adding a heart attack combination because you can't answer the question I listen to these ... what's the credibility of the jail he ... that\nCan stop talking stop ... stop but the brakes on okay what's here ... shut up what's your question\nMy question to you is Brett Kavanaugh allied\nTo the Senate already answered that it'd be jailed like you just said already answered that one should be already answered that and your answer\nYou know if we're getting rid of cat then you're done you're gotta tie this is the problem with you guys you know you're you're nuts Ken you've been made nuts by your party um that that she has since I answered the obviously if he broke the law I Believe in enforcing the law that applies to judge us back to the magna Carter\nA can a it applies to kings and judges and presidents and everyone else\nAnd um you know can I I'm I I I Wish that you were coherent enough to have a conversation with but you're not\nUm Bill Clinton I assume needs to be charged with rape and the rape of Juanita Broderick and the context of pound me too and women must be believed and\nYeah judge Kavanaugh lied under oath about what about whether he had a night in college that he couldn't remember because the Democrats were trying to build a case that maybe he didn't remember groping\n\nFor good old doctor blah blah blah [laughter] not too many doctors involved stature Ford [noise] um\nI you know Ken ... first of all you're breathing I'm a little concerned for you might be having a heart attack so let's let's let's focus on that for a minute your health could be in question here\nThey they and and the idea that they try to turn everything around well having a panic attack I guess\nTry to turn everything around no we're not trying to Lynch Kevin all we're trying to get to the truth really did she tried to get to the truth and the hearing with Brett Kavanaugh where everybody had hours and hours and hours to discuss it with them\nThat did ... did a Senator Dianne Feinstein with the Chinese spy in her office for Twenty years that she tried to get to the truth by sitting on\nDr Christine forwards letter all through the hearings and through the entire process through the FBI background process was that was that her trying to get to the truth is that was that all about the truth and can you believe\nThat as a Fifteen year old that this Georgetown Prep boy with the ... was drug getting girls with buckets full of quite loads and running cereal gang

... what kind of beer\nNobody asked did she recovered this memory and a repressed memory therapy session with one of her many many psychologist\nWhy do her family members not stand by her side and defender why did she fleet east coast and go to the west coast and move in with the Ford family which she married into later on a it has been suggested very strongly that it's because she had a lot of issues when she was a teenager around here and she wasn't getting along very well\nHad to send your someplace where nutty people fit right in so California is obviously the pick their\n[noise] and ah and I'm I'm modeling at at at this how does it oh well we all know this is perfectly normal for people to for decades and this is and then they report in decades later is that what happens 'cause they like a really really cold case that was it was that was that these people are so full of it\nNow let's go then they brought up in this person who claimed to be a a former prosecutor name was Laura coats she looked very angry and bitter she looked like a bitter and and I want to know what it is with the the bitterness and anger of black women in America today we had to look into that don't you think\n[noise] I'm just kidding but I'm\nReferencing the new narrative from the phony below the news media which is that white men are angry about all of this it's racist and that's missing dressed but never mind all of that in fact uh we were contacted today this is kind of funny where do they come to your today or yesterday\nNPR today\nNPR national panhandler radio called today and it's very funny they reached Victoria a producer of our humble radio show and this shows produced by its Victoria and Michael and myself the three of us\nIf we're at NPR there'd be twenty two of us because it's not their money it's taxpayer money cycling at the taxpayer Keats day and night and they have a staff of twenty two people for a three hour show we've got three people that got taxpayer money we have to make her own money pay the ... electric bill to keep the lights on around here and all that stuff\nNPR called said that and there was some confusion that apparently they want to interview me they want to give me you know you know what about\nHow about uh the anger of white men in America today the anger of white men to uh so I blew up their cars I uh what do you mean anger so and then it was it was kind of strange that their cars blew up just as the ...\nAnd it was funny because the person calling from national panhandler said well a who's who does you're booking\nAnd Victoria was a little confused 'cause it's not like we have a booking department for our show [laughter] you know we have three people\nAnd the proper response is you know listen kitten let's say an NPR we don't have thirty people do in a three hour show we have three people because this is the free market not the taxpayer teach just or just by the way\nThat now we're still debating whether to do the interview with ah with NPR oh they're the angry white man this is so they called me I miss ... my name is ... call somebody else\nAnd uh and I'm black parts mere black so uh you know what do you I\nAs I was so like if I Do an interview with him I'd have to I'd have to do my NPR voice well I don't think there is a lot of anger among white males Tiffany I um I think that perhaps you should look at and Kiefer if you're looking for angry white males Tiffany\nNow back to you would you like some peanut butter\n[laughter] and a spoon maybe we could [noise]\nSo let's go to Laura ... she seemed quite angry she was on CNN Today they say she's a former prosecutor but she looks like she's twenty six so I don't know where they find these twenty six year old former prosecutors for cable news all over the place apparently they got fired the first day and then go to work for cable or something like that\nBut she was very angry that President Trump dared to a raise an eyebrow at Dr forwards many many variations and or at least so she came to her defense and I love her defense that made me laugh\nProbably won't like at the data for car share a common\nAnd ah and also so she came to her defense and I love her defense that made me laugh\nThey probably thinking like out of the dating Patrick off here called the ... the people who were in at the party to name a person who is the end it me by the FBI or in jail and\n... all of whom\nHave said nothing like this ever happened as far as they know all of them legal and said I don't know what she's talking about I've never met Brett Kavanaugh but a a a lord I coats and and CNN they leave that out because the most insidious power the news media has the power to ignore and what they leave out\nIs often more important than what they put in and this was a good example of that\nFits well here's what she did remember remember the names of the people that write the party um\nShe didn't remember who's house it was that what year it was what month was what day it was what neighborhood it was uh how many\nPeople were there changed again and again what the gender composition of the number of people there changed again and again one beer but she didn't know how she got there she didn't know how she got home a and did she recovered there's some repressed memory therapy\nAnd if you're going to cite the names that she was able to conjure up your mind also point out that PJ has said none of this happened this just didn't happen that's PJ Smith where the why\nThen there's Leland legal and what we went in Kaiser and she said uh she's the one woman that apparently a Christian bossy she wasn't a doctor then skills and performing brain surgery then\nShe left her friend lived there to be raped by these violent drunks\nAnd ran out of the house like Jamie Lee Curtis and Halloween uh and uh there's just no evidence doesn't support Russia there was this little thing called the evidence\nAnd and I believe that evidence because I'm from western civilization I was raised here I Believe in it I Believe in the law I Believe in the protections of the law\nIf not the constitution of the United states at least the magna Carter let's just use the magna car to get let's go to twelve Fifteen and see if the Democrats and live with that code I don't think they can they can't\nThey are your ... there ... All right let's go to let's go to the phones [noise] I've grown\nTired of these people they're tiresome and and let me say that the Republicans are winning you know why they're winning because they're fighting\nThey're winning because they're fighting normally they don't fight because the news media is all against them and the Democrats are all against them and that's hard to tell the difference [noise] and this time\nLindsey Graham as a as a as a house on fire\nAnd Donald Trump is not their President Trump is out there and he's you know hey it was very passive but very well she seemed very credible\nAnd now he's you know kind of the gloves they're starting to come off because we've had enough of this stuff and again the every story they put out there as B. S.\nOr the the second and the third stories when the when the wagging the gang rapes with the quaint loads total joke outrageous filthy disgusting scam that the Democratic party played on the American

sounds alarm\nIn a written declaration released Tuesday and obtained by Fox News an ex boyfriend of Christine Blasey Ford the California professor cues and Brett Kavanaugh sexual assault directly contradicts her testimony under oath last week that she had never helped anyone prepare for a polygraph examination\nFormer boyfriend whose name was rejected\nAnd the declaration also said forward neither mentioned the Kavanaugh nor mentioned she was a victim of sexual misconduct during the time they were dating Nineteen Ninety two to Nineteen Ninety eight so this is yet another boyfriend can't hold on to win I guess [noise]\nHe said he saw for ... for going to great lengths to help a a a woman he believed was her lifelong best friend prepare for a potential polygraph test\nHe added that the woman Monica McLean had been interviewing for jobs with the FBI and the U.S attorney's office for the claim that for never voice study fear of flying\nOr their aboard a propeller airplane and seemingly had no problem living in a very small five hundred square foot apartment with one door I don't know any of this would be a problem with any of this be a problem [laughter] [noise]\nYeah [noise] yeah All right now let's go to number fourteen this is willy guys of ah MSNBC\nHe is the least dishonest which is like being the tallest ... in the room on the circle fast notice morning joke and Willie guys this morning and they were all talking to their kicking around there already laying the ... they're they're shifting the ground this is willy guys\nOn MS DNC this morning on MORNING Joe quit the pitching sisters\nI'm there he's telegraphing because these are the Democrats you don't have to wait for the Democrats on the hill these are the Democrats\nAnd what they're arguing now is well this FBI investigation will be declared inadequate and we will declare Nolan void and it will not affect our thinking or votes or rhetoric or anything else we're going to continue the blood drenched jihad against this innocent man there's good and decent man\nWho has been slime by filthy is gang of gangsters fly balls\nIn the history of American politics I think well I guess and this and my best girl sitting there this morning and we're listening to it and I a lean forward a little bit and I think my best girl said oh here it is here it is the ground is shifting here it comes time you ever had\nPulled up the idea that investigation Jeff Flake and Chris Coons and others without was give\nHer perhaps to Republicans say look we looked into this but independent third party investigative body [noise]\nGive them coverage to vote yet they say they clear judge Kavanaugh\nWill now by not interviewing doctor for it and not healing judge Kavanaugh as part of the FBI inquiry as Dan Goldman that it's not really a full FBI investigation they worry\nNow you're giving opening to Democrats and other people to say well this wasn't a real investigation so how can you possibly though yet but I'm certainly not going to change my vote for him no faith than anything that comes out of it\n[noise] what are you saying he speaks for the entirety of the Democratic party as well as anyone else [noise] um is that they've already declared the FBI investigation to be a inadequate they're going to want to extend it until next year some time special counsel two and a half years later\nA it's not about getting to the truth I'm it's just not about getting to the truth\nThen they have an interview Kevin on Fort they're pretending it's over and they haven't done in the news media is insisting that the FBI do with the news media wants them to do otherwise the news media won't tell them that they've done an adequate job now it's a Lynch mob a and unfortunately Lindsey Graham is Atticus Finch willy ...\nThe whole week long pause as opposed to get some clarity to it yesterday I'm afraid by leaving out the two key witness because although they did testify under oath before then it only clouded further and makes it more controversial when the vote finally comes up later this week\nNow they're talking about jumping the gun and uh you know a little learning is a dangerous thing\nUm they declared I guess the FBI investigation to be over because they read something that said that it might have ended as soon as Tuesday Afternoon or Tuesday evening\nThe FBI is not indicated that it's over and I'm ... and they're just saying what they're they're ... they're muddying\nThe FBI investigation ahead of time\nAnd uh that's what they're doing a Lindsey Graham let's go to a ... they are\nThey are laying down the credit here to oppose whatever the FBI comes up with them to dismiss it and say well that doesn't change we need more investigation and more investigation and it is at that point that you will know that they are a lot of you have an wised up yet you're probably hopeless but at that\nOr investigation and more investigation and it is at that point but you'll know that they are largely I mean if you haven't wised up yeah you're probably hopeless but at that point you should know that you're just being hoodwinked you're there fraudsters right number seven Lindsey Graham\nLindsey Graham yesterday he might be the Atticus Finch this Lynch mob story\nPeople can look at it and then we're going\nUh I keep telling my colleague that this is the new normal that hit the ball\nWould want to be a judge and the environment and uh\nWe've got to turn this around forests too late\nTaking Kevin down\nWhat unleashed forces\nFrom the darkest side\nAnd he think only one sided capable of doing\n[noise]\nHe's warning the Democrat and this is this is true and uh you know millions of us are going to feel the same way if they're successful in
