me up the side window that's bad policy I can assure you a President Trump to sign an apology would be the appropriate thing to offer\nPlenty half of our nation I Want to apologize [noise] to Brett and the entire Kavanaugh family for the terrible pain and suffering you have been forced to endure [noise]\nThose who stepped forward to serve our country deserve a fair and dignified evaluation [noise] not a campaign of political and personal destruction based on lies and deception\nThe front page of the Washington Post today has the headline Trump stokes tensions of court with apology\nSay they think that he shouldn't have apologized but there should be no apology that you should just get used to being called a serial child gang rapists\nAnd uh that you should sit out and shut up take it like a Clarence Thomas took it that was one of the idiots last week\nA said that it was that curious to know what's your name you know\nI'm the one who used to be at Fox powers yeah ... yeah Well Clarence Thomas behaved better\nIt's just because he's a white man who's a white man they they they're really angry about white people they've got a real problem I guess it's because we are so cool and invent so many amazing things I guess it must be kinda tough to look at white men and thank\nGosh I Wish I were more like them is probably what's going on here\nI Wish I could travel through space and cure cancer\nAnd ... devices with rich I can talk to people on a mountainside in Mongolia in real time huh [noise] gosh if only our more like white man's President Trump\nWhat happened to the Kavanaugh family violates every notion of fairness decency and due process hey man or woman must always be presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty used\nUnder historic scrutiny for proven innocent\n[noise]\nSee that's what a normal and do some person would do that on the other hand Hillary Clinton sat down with Chris John I'm On poor at CNN wink wink nod nod know what I mean and uh they had a little a love fest\nWhere Christian I'm a poor who was married to a Clinton Administration official by the way Jared Jamie Ruben they recently split up a mostly because uh I guess because they're both gay I think it was probably the explanation\nThat it held together for a while but a Hillary went on CNN where she was outraged that Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed and that they had a ceremony at the White House and the ... it's Hillary she's very bitter you should ask her about this Hillary how does it feel not being president for yet another day\nWhat went down last night in the White House with a political rally\nFurther undermined the image and integrity of the court and\nTroubles me greatly uh pardon me because I ... and ... has been viewed as one of the main pillar of our constitutional government tell [noise]\nI don't know how people are going to react to it I think we are now divide that were pretty much fall predictably between those who are for and those who are again [noise] but the president's been trying to think he has insulted attacked\nDemeaned winning big bowl ruptured ask campaign really for many years leading up to the campaign hundred dollar bill through a trailer park at a inside the White House\nYeah throwing ashtrays throwing lamps that was a political rally kind of like Paul Wellstone's funeral a little bit like Paul Wellstone's I'm Wondering if when Hillary and bill go on this tour that they're going on or will they be going to a Wisconsin and Michigan this time [laughter]\nI don't think they will they won't [noise]\nUh the uh the president also went down to\nFlorida to Orlando yesterday we spoke to a convention of police officers leaders and the police community or around\nBlaze communities around the United states of America and unlike Brock Obama who threatened to them and accused them of being horrible racist murderers of innocent black children across the country President Trump and said said this we promise\nYou that we will always have you back now and forever we will have you with\n[noise] wow and the crowd went wild not heard here but the crowd went wild because they love what they're hearing from President Trump\nThink you understand one thing how much our country loves you and the job you do you don't hear it from them\nFrom President Trump guilt thinking understand one thing how much our country loves you and the job you do you don't hear it\nFrom them [noise] you don't hear it from them [noise] they don't tell you the real feeling you don't hear it from the media but I can tell you I Know the feeling of these people the people of our country love you\nWow people are and and I do I think police officers all the time and then there's bronco about my he didn't like him so much the Cambridge police acted stupidly [laughter]\nThat was he said I don't have all the facts but I went to Harvard law school and I know that the police acted stupidly because my friend is black and the police officers white therefore we could have a beer summit but I'm going to sit over here and are not close that guy", "show_name": "The Chris Plante Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Washington",
