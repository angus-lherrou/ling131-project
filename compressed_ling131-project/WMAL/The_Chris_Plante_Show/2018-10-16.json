at least one a politically correct anachronism so because uh well they're just ridiculous liberals there just left these and they can't help themselves they have to build and they're left wing lunacy to everything absolutely everything must be sick with a\nDemocratic Party lunacy President Trump I've got some great audio I've got good stuff on on this topic has a series of remarkable stories that honestly she should never show her face again in public shed\nAny self respect at all she would just disappear from public life and never sharp face again after this this was going to be a big win big splash big win against President Trump and President Trump's got ... million dollars now ... always been money grabbing left ... what is what these people\nAre like they don't work you know ... this is how money grabbing socialist or you know that you know that I'm Elizabeth Warren because she's not an Indian and wave now proved it uh and it's just amazing bed sheets\nOf this proves that my Paul ball on her cheek bones where oh proof old Indian edge a my pop on had high cheekbones\n[laughter]\nOh proved to be a niche uh my path on had high cheekbones [laughter] and now she wants a billion

means Senator Warren has statistically less Indian DNA than the average white American\nHumiliating self own here\nA little turn of phrase by about ... Johnson there uh and the President Trump's tweet adjusts just hilarious just hilarious stuff very very funny and in fact the the Cherokee Nation didn't come forward and they're having none of this there they want nothing to do with Elizabeth Warren the headline\nAnd this is from a local station in Oklahoma I Believe ... J. R. H. a out of ah what does that tell a co-op I'm going to go at ... ...\nThe Cherokee Nation issued a statement Monday on mass shoot sets senator guys wouldn't take a listen both Warren's DNA test result Senator Warren released or DNA report to the news media with the phony help but some funny academic at a phony college\nOr in response to president Donald Trump's taunting her for her saying she was part Native American you know I Will I Will have it be known President Trump did not start this this was well underway I was calling her focus on us before\nPresident Trump even came down the escalator running for president so and and us up to like say I invented it because I just want to point out that the news media is saying that President Trump invented this\nThis taunted this mockery of a of a Senator Warren with her phony Indian thing and that's not true this has been going on for a long time this mockery of of her of her ridiculous claim\nSenator Warren blister and says the report and it said that the great majority of Warren's identifiable ancestry as European\nHowever the report adds the analysis also identified five genetic segments as Native American in origin at high confidence and this is what Elizabeth Warren put out now this is a a joke of course\nHowever yesterday afternoon Cherokee Nation released a statement saying\nIn part that DNA tests are useless in determining tribal citizenship and people are using DNA to connect themselves to Cherokee Nation is inappropriate\nAnd uh that was a a a gentle right on what they said because there were a little more direct the statement itself says\nFrom the Cherokee Nation\nMay DNA test is useless to determine tribal citizenship current DNA tests do not even distinguish\nListen to this whether a person's ancestors were indigenous to North or South America\nSovereign tribal nations set their own legal requirements for citizenship and wild DNA tests can be used to determine lineage such as paternity to an individual it is not evidence for tribal affiliation\nUsing a DNA test to lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation even vaguely\nIs inappropriate and wrong I senator or you're going to you racist ... are you going to stop offending Native Americans now it makes a mockery out of DNA tests\nAnd it's legitimate ... says while also dishonor ring legitimate tribal governments and their citizens whose ancestors are well documented and who's heritage is proven\nSenator Warren is undermining tribal interests with her continued claims of tribal heritage that is from the Cherokee Nation secretary of state\nWho is named Chuck ... junior Chuck ... junior who is the secretary of state of the Cherokee Nation they're independent nations was also on the television last night on Fox News channel it was on CNN surprise surprise where he didn't help or Elizabeth Warren's cause either\nThe problem with a DNA test is that it proves nothing of relevance to whether a person is a citizen of the Indian nation and member of an Indian nation\nDNA and best can give me some indicators of some markers that to indicate that you're related to somebody live long ago that may have lived in North and South America may have been a native peoples of those continents um it's irrelevant to what it means\nIn into somebody live long ago that may have Linder north and South America maybe in a native peoples of those continents\nIt's irrelevant to what it means to be a Native American in this country\nIt is irrelevant to what it means to be innate emerge so this whole thing was just won't want wrong it's Emily la tele it's never mind my DNA test doesn't say anything in fact I've it indicates anything it indicates that I Am less Native American than the average Whitey\nOn the moon okay [laughter]\nI'm going to get to Whitey on the moon a little later on why is Whitey on the moon in the show today well you might be surprised but it's another reason to get to it in a little bit another reason they're a crazy people now let's go to Elizabeth Warren she's out there saying that the president does or a million dollars that's got to number four\nBecause this is what President Trump actually said when he made this ah the news media and and and Elizabeth Warren not smart people not the really you can't take them seriously\n[noise] saying no President Trump owns or a million dollars because she fulfilled all\nOf the requirements that President Trump laid out if she gets a DNA test and it proves that she is in fact part Paul Paul than President Trump owes or a million dollars this is the phony arguing that they just lie about\nEverything they live right by Brett Kavanaugh there are a lot about Bill Clinton Hillary Clinton lodged about everybody they lie about everything and a President Trump actually said these words in July about the DNA test\nYou know those little kids they saw it on television for two dollars\nAnd first of all the little kids and\n[laughter] she claims that she's of Indian heritage because her mother says she has hiking thoughts that's her only up to her mother says yet I have a\nExactly that cat I say I won't give me a million dollars to your favorite charity\nIf you take the test of their shows here and there\nYou know [noise] [noise]\nNo the test does not show she's an Indian me a debate has not happened she is not the Democratic nominee for the presidency of the United states has not given her the uh the uh DNA tests on a stage during the presidential debate [noise] ah and ah and and I didn't\nHear him call her mother a liar which is another life not what she said that she she keeps calling my mother a liar President Trump keeps going my mother a liar that he didn't call a Elizabeth Warren's mother mall pall a liar didn't call anybody a liar\nWill call my mom a liar\nYeah he didn't do that so she just lied there in calling a saying that President Trump was lying about her mother being a liar there's a lot of lying going on here it's a circle festive lives a tangled train wreck of laws stupidity but there it is um he didn't say that your mother is alarm\nOr he did say that you have to become the nominee beyond a debate stage she gives you the DNA kid you don't get to pick your own DNA person who is a\nYou know a corrupt Democrat fellow travelers from a college campus\nBut then when a CNN listen to that or watch that video this morning Alison Schmidt Allison ... who used to be a reporter listen to it and said huh\nMaybe everything that I've been saying all my wife is a giant lie and President Trump is in fact the most truthful president in modern history\nOkay he didn't mean it was just there and that if it ever he said he just he just and I said he\nHe just won me over maybe it didn't really mean it was during the debate now he ... okay well I actually listen to what he said no and there wouldn't be over not winning you over it's just you you should listen to what you should pretend to be a reporter for five seconds that day and see what happens instead of a Democratic Party hack\nOn a cable TV station advancing the cause of the Bolshevik Revolution\nWhich you pretty much

ridiculous back and forth over the million dollar one thing too because she wants relevant now\nShe wants it because she wants relevance no no she just wants to fight in fact she's a let's go live now to the White House world listen to this one has gathered her force\nWas my mother to be a lie or is it is and they didn't say your mother is a liar and it's completely ridiculous people and then the

Anthony winners are targets and\nThat means that it wasn't an abuse of power and there's nothing that she'd\nBe done about it and then of course the ah the guy on CBS didn't say well now that we're in
