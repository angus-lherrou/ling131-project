would make this claim controversial is if\nTrump actually meant racial nationalist court white nationalist maybe it would have said that if that's what I mean let's go ahead and\nThey do I go by the study is an American not a Nazi American but you can add the word Nazi in front of it and say well what would be really controversial as if what he meant to say was that he's not see American because the slaughter as babies by the millions and rips out their guts and they flush says with them\nNow now I could add words to all kinds of speeches that Hillary Clinton has made over the years\nAnd then he says and then Greg search him because he knows I'm tapping my right temple with my index finger this was ... they can see people on TV and they know what they mean like just like George Zimmerman and Trayvon Martin Trayvon Martin was an angel never mind the burglary tools the weapons jewelry in his backpack to\nFight club stuff from his brother hanging out to beat up the gay guy because he was going to go home and rape his little brother he's a hero destroy George Zimmerman the neighborhood watch guy who's got the black foster children in the day or a black grandparent\nTeams the villain of

close enough\nAnd they're they're not coming from Central America well they are but ah originally from Bangladesh\nAnd all that stuff so he knows what they meant he knows the un and they they know that there are no criminals in that crowd they can look at an aerial picture and say you know criminals sanitized for your protection no terrorists no middle Easterners know murderers nevermind Honduras has the highest murder rate on the planet of any country\nYou know where they have nationalism down there and there are a lot of murder so they have all these murderers but none of them left they all say they're all the murderers state in Honduras with the highest rate that means the rate's gonna get even higher because there'll be fewer people but all the same murders are still there\nSo they're going to be more if the Democrats relating to an increase in the murder rate in Honduras which has already number one in the ...\nWhich is of course exactly what he did mean sergeant

anything at a Jeffrey to them and even he was like you know ... how are you people\nIf you you and your nationalist and then at that point the definition that weren't they are using what'd you say your one probably not what you know I Would I mean I don't I I you know I Am someone who believes in it\nWould you say your one probably not what\nYou know I Would I mean I don't I you know I Am someone who believes in in the United states and the important thing I said I'm not in the national out please come on I mean that term has not become like Hitler I saw that and why not use the word national\nAudience while you do not use the word nationalist how about social as soon as the socialist you all you more arms are you're you're you're using the word socialist to describe yourselves ...\nYou know the socialist have murdered a hundred million people more than any group of people in the history of humankind since Nineteen Seventeen of the October Revolution in St Petersburg the Bolshevik Revolution\nYou socialist have murdered a hundred million people in the name of utopia the suicide rate and in Venezuela skyrocketing you fifty five million abortions you harvest the organs and you literally have black tie dinners think about awards for it and then you say you can't\nUse the word nationalist because Hitler was he was a socialist or or just imagine what you want to go to

confusion country\nHas taken a second\nKnows is better than me I'm not you know some of the worst feels as ever see that we're hearing all about well money other countries and then they don't treat us\nSo he said that says ah so he gets his definition I Love our country I'm tired of are are are playing second fiddle to other countries getting bad deals I'm straightening out the deal that's his definition of nationalism\nNow did he clear up the ... the confusion that Jim Acosta was suffering in in in the damage to brain buddy carts around with him every day I don't know Jim Acosta and here comes they love this stuff this or that they are all about dog whistles certain codes I\nThey're they're the dumbest people they seem intelligent they clean up the hundred dollar haircuts and two hundred dollar ties they stand in front of the White House and they're more on their their dangerously stupid people Acosta just\nAround and do something with her and\nHer that I cannot imagine that I mean I'm a nationalist I never heard that theory\nThat says CNN's theory and they're sticking to it they're ah they're going with it that's their theory and these are really really filthy filthy people filthy dishonest people um you know they wipe out forty percent of the black population by way of Planned Parenthood that public funding and they they love that so they literally have\nFormal dinners and give out awards for that\nThe ghoulish bastards that they are the murder is white nationalist I mean honestly I make jokes around the time of the ... whatever the you know white people marching oh no\nI don't know what next and and uh and the news media what a completely crazy and I made a joke as these guys have ... if you really affect your what the KKK or your what nationalist whatever you shouldn't be\nBut if you're going to do that set up a banquet table at your next event and raise money for Planned Parenthood because it would confuse the snot out of the gym a cost of the world were too stupid to get the joke\nYou know first of all the you know most of the people that hate or probably pro life but if you're really hated black people if you really were devoted

Washington comes to talking\nAnd [noise]\n\n\nAll kinds of man going on in America today [noise]\nHowever Victoria just walked in with a wonderful story\nAnd uh and you know that the news media didn't really make a big deal out of that they're going to make a big deal out of this and it's better for the news media if one didn't go to the White House because then it says oh look at these terrible it's either going to give it more coverage than they did states least being shot by the Bernie Sanders volunteer\nBut the secret service put out a statement I'm minutes ago\nLate on October twenty third two thousand Eighteen that's yesterday the secret service recovered a single package address to the former first lady Hillary Clinton noticed the secret service doesn't call her the former secretary of state you know why\nBecause she gets her Secret Service protection predicated on her status as former first lady Secret Service doesn't protect secretaries of state or former secretaries of state diplomatic security does that's a different organization altogether\n[noise] so they describe her as the former first lady Hillary Clinton in in Westchester County New York rich people mansions you know ... o'clock in the name that cultural appropriation by the way\nEarly this morning October twenty four two thousand Eighteen of second packages addressed to former president Barack Obama was intercepted by Secret Service personnel in Washington DC\nThe packages were immediately identified during routine male screening procedures see there it is as potentially explosive devices and we're appropriately handled as such\nThey protect tease that has Obama and Clinton did not receive the packages nor were they at risk of receiving them\nThe secret service has initiated a full scope of criminal investigation that real leverage all available federal state and local resources to determine the source of the packages and identify those responsible\nNow that's the role that the secret service has in this um and protecting protect tease as they're called the secret service would also be putting out a statement if one was in fact received at the remote mail facility for the White House they would be a responsible likely for putting out a statement on that as well um\nThe White House ah put out a statement also president Donald Trump has been briefed on the packages White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders released a statement condemning the attempted violent acts she said we condemn the attempted violent attacks\nRecently made against President Obama\nPresident Clinton Secretary Clinton and other public figure that they've got a phrase that a little differently they're talking about Bill Clinton of course cause Hillary's never going to be president and she's not now which is really great news for humanity\nMeans terrorizing acts are despicable and anyone responsible will be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law just like people crossing our border right and breaking all the various laws there\nThe United states Secret Service and other law enforcement agencies are investigating and we'll take all appropriate actions to protect anyone threatened by these cowards\nSanders said\nSo uh we've got that and now again adding to that CNN the secret service was not responsible for CNN but they may want to look at the packages to see if they are the same check the characteristics say if you're dealing with a single person look for a a you know the usual evidence sort of you all watch CSI or something right [noise]\nSo it got that ... suspicious packages flying all over the place so it's like a [noise]\nParty at Harvey Weinstein's house got let's let's go to um we have audio on the subject of the care of him and we have callers on the subject of the character who's behind the caravan this is a great when the news media says nobody nobody's behind the caravan\nExcept there are a big problems with that story now there are lots of people behind the care of and they're all left days and we have Mike Pence we have Mike Pence on this let's go to a soundbite number six I think is the first Mike Pence on this\nVice president Mike Pence at the White House yesterday in the oval office with the president of the United states taking lots and lots of questions from miscreants like Jim Acosta of that\nAt the White House yesterday in the oval office with the president of the United states taking lots and lots of questions from miscreants like Jim Acosta of the cable Nazi network I that's what the un stance whereas the\n... and and uh and he said well he spoke to vice president Pence spoke to president Hernandez of Honduras and asked them hey what's going on with this whole a caravan thing where did it come from\nDifferent direction of president Hernandez of ...\nTold me that the care of in the snow making its way through Mexico headed for the southern border was organized by left is organizations and financed\nBy Venezuelan\nWell organized by leftist organizations and financed by Venezuela because they're left days there you know their county types down there and this is what they do they mess with the United states and with freedom loving people and they still all your stuff\nAnd um and again I mentioned there is a story today\nThe suicide rate in Venezuela skyrocketing in one town where they did the story they um doctors in the hospital overwhelmed and fatigue and psychologically tortured by all of the suicide cases they're dealing with because Bernie Sanders plans have been implemented there\nAnd now everyone wants to die or they're fleeing\nA vice president Pence number a number of said hey what but the president said there are terrorists sitting there vice president Pence and he didn't actually said there are terrorists in there I I don't think\nBut that there could likely be given might know criminals in the care of him and not all the murderers in Honduras\nHighest murder rate in the world for any country they're all staying behind\nBecause they know because the CNN says there no criminals so there's no we can't go because CNN said there are no criminals\nAnd Mr Cain said we can't go 'cause MSNBC said there are no criminals that they all said well is that there are no ... days so there are no drug traffickers are human traffickers so they all stay at home that's that's how they got him to Sam vice president Pence\nUnited States of America intervenes then prevents them terrorists or suspected terrorists from coming into our country every day so it's just inconceivable\nThat there would not be individuals from the middle east as a part of this growing\n... with the president's determined to do is put the safety and security the American people first\nWell that's the news media doesn't do that and the Democrats don't do the [noise]\nUh and and he's not saying in the care of everybody saying people just trying to sneak into the country people coming in illegally um terrorist suspects ten a day that's an average over the course of the year it's three sixty five times ten what does that no thirty six fifty an hour and a that many\nSuspected terrorists every day so it's inconceivable it's just a it's I I don't think that we're means what you think it means\nIt's inconceivable that are in a crowd of ... whatever the number is ten thousand twelve thousand that there wouldn't be criminals that there was that there wouldn't be ... and uh so on and by the way they uh organizer for a an organization called ... below scene from us\nWhich is a people Without Borders said this is like liberals left he's there or they think they can just move into your house and puts you off the couch and and the Democrats are supporting that they're good\nAt like ... men sing and organizer he's a community organizer for what seemed frontier us an immigration rights group that organized a similar smaller caravan an April\nTold USA Today it's a mass exodus what we're trying to stop the mass exodus but lost in front terrorists is an organizing for some hardcore left wing hers who want to dismantle the United states of America that's the short version but it's true in the final analysis\nAnd see what the scene frontiers I went to their website this morning to see what they are all about they're raising money for the Palestinians I this is a hardcore left wing organization further more there is a Honduran politician who is that the epicenter of this\nWhose name is ... total of ... a former Honduran opposition lawmaker long time migrant advocate as the caravans ringleader he is the ringleader now he tweeted a a one of those things started hey we're gathering up a caravan to go to the United states\nAnd then he got some friends in the local news media down there to say a caravan as gathering\nIt started on October twelve with about a hundred and twenty migrants gathered in San Pedro Sula Honduras\nNear the Guatemalan border and uh that night started gaming gaining steam and ... told the television station in Honduras you and he unique\nUh that uh they're going and that's what started so he's a hardcore left wing a guy and and vice president Pence talk to the president of Honduras\nAre going and that's what started so he's a hardcore left wing a guy and and vice president Pence talk to\nThe president of Honduras and a Hernandez and he says that the president Honduras told him that Venezuela was financing this and was behind him so we've got that going for us\nSo let's go to let's go to the telephones so areas in the news media is telling us just BS they just they they can't stop line they everything they're saying is is a untrue to varying degrees shades of gray let's go to a Rick in Fairfax, Virginia Rick you're on the crust plant show\nYeah Hi my wife is from Honduras legally it worked for a fortune five hundred company had paid at all that good stuff\nI Want to say um you know part of the rings and you know people they say well why don't the people in Honduras and everything you know fight back but you know they've been settled down by socialism\nApart CNN has

where of different ethnicities\nThat Democrats see it as an opportunity to drive a wedge between us to hit us against one another this is this all let's play but it's the left playbook everywhere in
