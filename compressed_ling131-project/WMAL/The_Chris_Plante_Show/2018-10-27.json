radio show which I'm not sure their second but anyway [laughter] they may be the one\nA founders are losing their their season for their part gift is coming up starting this Tuesday the thirtieth Tobar who have you gone to some of the guests coming up in in this season I Know there's going to be several of them but a couple of names\nA Robin Ficre who's running for office in the gallery did Rob ... people don't know we've done the money you're right we are we ... we were releasing them on ... they were they're released on Tuesdays and Thursdays of each week\nThey began a we began our season for October thirtieth as we mentioned uh the real housewives of what kind of kept up with the season with Monique Samuels and we've talked to ... an al ... grade\nAnd not about so much about about their their sports butter butter impact on our town there's more of those guys who do the announcing there are a lot bigger than just a sports announcers they do things in a community they're involved in their neighborhoods and we try to get that out and make them more than ...\nYear old you everybody's fascinated by the story behind celebrities him all these announcers are celebrities the most of us so\nAnd these two gentlemen are the hardest working people\nUh in showbiz because they are on the road and they're uh they're they're pulled up on for so many things but they they was incredible I I tend to uh Steve when he walked out of ...\nYou know I've never listened to you have a conversation a real life conversation I've heard you called about games and everything but I've never understood or new you the person behind it yeah well\nIt and we're going to talk about their life and the other they were there from what they develop how why did they get this job where where do they contribute to the community and they got down so great that ... that's when president may\n... the the the interesting thing about the podcast is if\nTribute to the community and then they go down so great that ... that's when president may\n... the the the interesting thing about the pod cast is you've got a hundred and fifty names or so in the bank fear and once you get on a park here you can scroll down and and you could always act that any any any interviews so one more time or how do you get on the part that is true that\nHow's it going to work is each kid going to get a a third\nIs that what's going to happen here will there probably is not a good idea\n... never a good idea first of all if unless they're over Eighteen years old they can manage their own money from a legal perspective even if they are over Eighteen we probably won't attorneys substantial sums over to a Nineteen year old they're not equipped\nTo manage money [noise] but far more importantly\nThan that in this particular example for instance is the fact that if we split the state equally among those three children they're being treated on equally because\nOne of them by definition or two of them are older than the youngest one of them is older than the other\nTwo so even if they had identical needs growing up it wouldn't really be fair to give them each a third of the state because the older ones have has had more years of your support than the youngest ones\nAre the younger ones so we want we want to arrange that situation from a financial standpoint\nThat so that will approximate it's closely as we can to what will happen if at least one of the parents do survive which is that the parent is going to use commonsense\nIf there's if there's enough resources available and it's not going to be a problem sending them through college yeah they can go in the eighth grade trip to Disney Land or Disney World\nOf course but if times are really tough maybe they can't do that\nOldest isn't going to take the grand tour of Europe when they graduate from high school if there's not enough money left to get the other two kids through school so again\nSo that would be a sprinkling trust now that's not a whole separate document that's going to be part of your basic if you used to trust revoke ... trust so again when we get into terminology the other one that comes up all the time and I know the ears perk up whenever we give a seminar\nFor something called a Q tip crust which has all kinds of uses tax wise and otherwise but [noise]\nIt's used so often in second marriage situations you know if you look at the statistics roughly half of the first marriages in this country wind up in the divorce court sad but true\nIs when a couple comes in is they do on a regular basis and one or many cases both of them had been married before and they've got children from those prior marriages what are their goals well they got a whole bunch of goals\nIn most cases almost always I can predict the first goal which is they want to make sure that whichever spouse passes away first that she or he is the other one is not out on the street homeless so we're going to provide some financial support\nFor the surviving spouse but goal one eighty is we also want to make sure that when she dies or when he dies both families when the prior marriages are quote fairly treated what does that mean we're predicted a couple of well may mean a lot of different things\nMaybe one set of the kids as much older and they're already a practicing neurosurgeons and they don't really need any help okay that's fine if the couple agrees on that [noise]\nMaybe you want to treat them all as common children in other words if one parent has three kids another one was got two kids we treat them all the same and each get a fifth who knows this is up to the couple\nBut the point is in that context in that situation here lawyer your estate planner is probably going to\nRecommend the use of what's called a Q tip trust cute T. I. T. that's an acronym for qualified trauma nimble interest property\nSo that Q tip crust is going to be part of you revoke ... trust document\nAnd again so it's it's it's all part of the same matrix\nOf of elements that we use to address a given family situation like I say there's a bunch of them if what if one or both spouses or non citizens we got some additional tax planning challenges so maybe we want to use what's called the cue dot\nCute deal tea that's a qualified domestic trust [noise] it\nAnd so maybe we want to use what's called the cue dot cute deal tea that's a qualified domestic trust [noise] it I could go on and on about the\nDifferent possible a suggestion options you might have okay so [noise]\nTo one of the things we try to do with these seminars is work you through this amazing terminology which just far too often\nParalyzes people from acting they they just throw up their hands and say oh my gosh I never get my arms around do this I'm\nDon't let that inhibit you from getting a good basic state plan in place okay okay ah\nGive us a couple of hours of your time walk through this stuff\nYou can get this done you can won't take that long cost that much really which is got to be done it's got to be done you don't want to leave a mess behind for your loved ones after you've gone and you know what else while you're still\nHear the older we get the more likely it is we being being capacity to for some period before we do pastime [noise]\nThat's something every one of us needs to address to address in our state planning\nAnd this is particularly true way of\nPeople that aren't Mary [noise]\nOkay you take a break for a couple of announcements and then go right to the phones this is Mike Collins legally speaking on WMA zone so don't go anywhere on the right to the phones if you if we can manage to get into cue if you'd call now eight eight eight six three oh nine six two five eight eight eight six\nSix to ... okay let me write back at the\nCrust plant and I have something that's just incredible to share with you today what you believe more than four hundred and fifty of view generous station listeners donated your cars parked cars for kids this year that's a whole lot of charitable giving and I have to say it's great to hear how easy it is to donate your car and make a difference in the community\nCars for kids makes the donation process simple and can bring it with free pick up your vehicle at any condition that any time that works for you they take care of the paperwork so it's hassle free for you and your you even get a tax deduction and\nA voucher for tonight hotel stay column today you have a pick up dates scheduled by tomorrow eight seven seven cars for kids who are sort of why that cars for kids dot com bats cars were the ...\nIt just takes a couple of minutes about the impact last forever whether you're looking to get rid of a car truck boat or any kind of real estate\nCars for kids will take care of you remember that say seven seven cars for kids on line that cars for kids dot com\n[noise] Hi I'm Patrick single stone or new accounts on you know what\nMaking a snowman with my kids\nI just get a big brown spot on the ceiling actually because Patrick singles would jump on\nThe radio talking about new account designs later half never\nReplaced my roof paid for later I got a big old\nTalk of the time to replace your roof\nFifty percent off the price of ripping materials\nPayments no interest for twelve might make a big old Brown's five hundred to seven nine fifty three hundred\nHundred to seven nine sixty three hundred come designed dot com\nOctober with half later\nDiabetes high blood pressure anxiety med everyone's on them have you on a fifty year old male maybe a bit Porgy and you may even have type two diabetes a million dollars of term insurance my only cost you about two hundred bucks a month called term providers speak with the big blue wet eight hundred to three oh twenty seven Seventy seven\nBig little will find a term life policy for you even if you have type ... diabetes are overweight or have high blood pressure term providers helped thousands of people like you would think they can afford term life insurance\nTo buy a million dollars of affordable term life for you all you need to do is called the big Lu at eight hundred to three oh twenty seven Seventy seven ... will make sure the scales are tipped in your favor\nGall eight hundred to three oh twenty seven Seventy seven ... we'll answer your call and worked to fit you into a term life policy that you can afford for a member may lose IQ he's on meds to call it a hundred to three oh twenty seven Seventy seven eight hundred and two or three oh twenty seven Seventy seven\nOne oh five point not F ... am\nBritain to three oh twenty seven Seventy seven eight hundred and two or three oh twenty seven Seventy\nSeven one oh five point not F ... am to W.

we go bowling message from America's by pharmaceutical companies visit go boldly down ...\nWashington Mall heavily and a hell of Washington comes to\nCome back to the program you're listening to the red cattle and show it's the truth about money I'm very happy very excited to welcome forty new affiliate radio stations to the ... show we're now broadcasting this program to eighty five\nRadio stations across the country uh this program is the longest running national personal finance radio show in the nation are talkers magazine has ranks me one of the top one hundred talk radio show host in the country\nAnd the number to talk show hosts that airs weekends only uh so we're very excited to be welcoming all of you who are listening to the Rick Edelman show for the first time\nAnd uh we're going to be talking about the stock market right now and and the reason that this is such a a big deal conversation\nA is because you've got money invested and that's what we do for a living or at our organization uh we manage a lot of money for a lot of folks all across the country a Barron says ranked hour from the number one independent investment advisory firm in the nation\nAre and we're very honored by the barons ranking and we want to share with you the advice and information that we provide to our own clients and I'm sure you've been acutely aware of what's been going on in the stock market\nThis past week volatility has returned but regardless of that we do have to acknowledge the facts and the fact is that as a result of the volatility this week year today\nThe Dow Jones industrial average is down one percent the S. and P. five hundred stock index is down one percent leafy index which is the index of foreign stocks that the Europe Australia and far eastern index is down twelve percent for the year\nIt's not just that the down the U.S in pay and the ISI are down one percent one percent twelve percent it's actually even worse than that [noise]\nThere are thirty stocks and the Dow Jones industrial average sixty percent of them\nAre down ten percent or more from their hives civil though the overall Dow is only down one sixty percent of those thirty socks\nEighteen of them are down ten percent or more in the U.S and the five hundred the self is down one percent for the year but eighty percent of the S. and P. five hundred\nFor talking four hundred of the five hundred stocks\nAre down ten percent or more from their hives ... Ninety percent are down ... percent or more from their hives and the NASDAQ eighty seven percent of the stocks and the NASDAQ are down ten percent or more from their eyes so if you look at your market performance\nRecently you see some pretty substantial declines year to date it means that we have had\nAll the profits accumulated so far this year from January one for the end of September\nThose gains have been largely wiped out the Dow down one do you have some ... if you'd down twelve and it's not just limited to that goal\nThose gains have been largely wiped out the Dow down one the U.S and the down one iffy down twelve and it's not just limited to that gold is down six percent ear today\nThe real estate market as measured by the ... real estate index down four percent for the year the bond market as measured by the Barclays aggregate bond index down four percent\nFor the year pretty much everything everywhere is down oh not everything oil is up all of them ... percent\nDemonstrating the critical importance of diversification not everything always goes down simultaneously some stuff goes up while other stuff is going down the problem is you can't predict what that'll be\nWe don't know what's going to go up next we don't know what's going to go down next so instead of making a big bet\nWe diversify we diversifying two ways we diversify among classes yes you want stocks but yes you should also and bonds and you should also known for insecurities and you should also on commodities and oil and gas and natural resources and precious metals\nAn exponential technologies we should have a highly diversified portfolio because their safety in numbers instead of having twelve eggs in one basket have one egg in each of twelve baskets this way if you break one you gotta love and left that's the first point of diversification the second point\nIs that when you do decide you're going to invest some of your money into stocks that you buy as many stocks as you can notice I said that in the S. and P. five hundred index itself is down one percent for the year\nWhat eighty percent of the stocks have lost ten percent or more in the recent weeks eighty percent of them are down ten percent in just a few weeks even though the index itself is only done one person for the year and that's the point Senate trying to pick individual stocks and hoping that they do better than the index you're better off\nOwning a market instead of trying to beat the market because the academic data is very clear\nActively managed mutual funds\nMeaning neutral funds that hire a professional manager whose job it is is to pick stocks that will beat the market\nThey have a dismal track record the overwhelming majority of active managers fail to beat their index they fail to beat the benchmark\nAnd it doesn't matter what stock sector we're talking about big stocks midsize stocks are small stocks growth stocks are value stocks us stocks versus foreign stocks doesn't matter it also doesn't matter what time period you look at you could look an ear to date you could look at the past year three year five years seven year ten year it doesn't matter what time period you look at\nThose data is consistent\nFund managers are notoriously unable to beat the market and here's what makes it even worse even when you find a manager that does succeed at feeding the market that manager is unable to duplicate their success so while there will be some managers who do beat the market they aren't the same managers year after year after year so if you pick\nThis year the manager that did best last year\nThey're not going to be able to repeat their success it's a different manager that does it and that's why instead of trying to beat the market it's better to be the market\nThird\nA long term perspective focusing on not the market not politics not policy not the fed\nBut focusing instead on your goals why are you investing in the first place what are you trying to accomplish visit to get a kid in the colleges that to prepare for your own retirement isn't take care of aging parents wire you investing that determines for us\nHow much money you're going to need how much money do need to achieve those goals how much will college cost how much will your retirement costs how much will cost of care for mom\nOnce we know how much those things will cost and when we're going to encourage those bills now we could work backwards do some calculations to say\nHere so much money you need to be saving and here's the rate of return you need to be earning and in order to get that return at a reasonable expectation here's the investment strategy here's the mix of investments the asset allocation necessary so that makes sense\nIf you're not approaching your investment strategy in that way you might be doing it wrong and that's why we encourage you to focus on it in that way if we can help call us a triple a plan wreck\nFetch

than we have people looking for jobs which doesn't seem to make any sense right and if everybody was looking for a job and there are jobs out there how come we don't have a hundred percent full employment\nMaybe it's because the people who are looking for jobs don't have the skills that are required for the jobs that are available in other words we're talking about career development\nIs it possible\nThat despite the fact the economy is strong your job might be threatened due to exponential technologies particularly robotics and artificial intelligence is it possible your job might be wiped out by technology the most common example that everyone is aware of\nTaxi drivers not\nJust because of over and left which are examples but the coming self driving vehicles which will wipe out

your medallion if you felt like it\nBecame a market where people were buying and selling medallions the value of the ... rose really fast in New York medallions hit one point three million dollars in

they're virtually worthless seven hundred drivers bought those medallions the city generated sixty three million dollars in revenue\nA hundred and fifty of those drivers of now the fault it on the loans that they took out to get those medallions\nAnd in New York City seven cab drivers have committed suicide over their financial strife\nYou've got to ask yourself is it possible\nThat my job

there that haven't existed in the past few years and you might now have the opportunity to go get yourself a bigger better job promotion of raise\nWashington Mall W. N. A. L. on Washington comes to talk\nAbout the Rick I'm up and show triple late plan wreck is our phone number that's AAA seven five to sixty seven forty two and online at ... dot com that's why the element dot com but set right after the questions okay we're talking to Mike He sent in the question to ask Rick Rick at all then dot com\nPirate this is Mike from Evanston, Illinois I've learnt to things from listening to you over the last Twenty years number one I can retire and the custom I'm used to win a proxy three percent of my savings will cover my annual expenses number two\nThanks to exponential technology we live longer than ever and probably should plan on having my retirement money last until I'm at least a hundred and Twenty years old [noise]\nSo my question is how do I count for inflation in my annual expenses and the calculation of retirement cost I found a a inflation calculator on the Internet\nShe told me if my current monthly expenses in three thousand fifty years from now when I'm only a hundred and ten my monthly cost will be ten thousand dollars\nAnd this is after I've been withdrawing from my savings for fifty years [noise]\nSo do I need three percent of my savings to cover ten thousand dollars given a high likelihood of inflation when it's costing me three thousand dollars now or how do I very this over time do I need to work longer save more keep my investments in a more aggressive\nMode to cover the costs of inflation is is how we're going to compensate for potentially up to sixty years of inflation\nMike your right to all three in other words your ear over complicating\nThis a little bit Ah yes inflation will take it's toll overtime but there is nothing new about that inflation is taking them taking its toll overtime for as long as there's been times we all know that everything is more expensive today than it was fifty years ago and everything will be more expensive than it is today fifty years from now so there's nothing new there so\nDon't worry about it in other words history tells us that a diversified investment portfolio\nEarns more over long periods of time then the inflation rate now there's no assurance that that'll be true in the future but that's the basis on which all investment strategies are built there's no reason to believe it won't be true in the future although we can't promise that are guaranteed hit so on that assumption which is what it is\nYou can assume that your investments will grow over time at a rate faster than the rate of inflation which is how your nest egg in the future will be big enough\nThat when you withdraw three percent or four percent a year from the portfolio it'll produce the income you need even if your income as a whopping ten grand imam which by the way is the amount of income some people need even today so\nDon't worry about it you were ever complicating but let's shift over to the second half your question how do you make sure you have enough money so that you can withdraw three percent a year to pay your bills no matter how hard those bills have might happen to the\nUS do you work longer do you have more to earn higher returns yes yes yes we have to recognize as I've been talking with you about on this program for the past several years and is the basis of my book the truth about your future\nWhich they view of the New York times business so it was the number four we have to recognize that the future ain't what it used to be as Yogi Berra said\nYou're not going to live to eighty five or Ninety or Ninety five chances are you're going to live to one of five one Fifteen one twenty five but you have to recognize that life is going to be much longer due to medical advances and technological innovations that are extending longevity and on that basis\nWe have to recognize that a retirement at age sixty five is probably not realistic for an awful lot of folks you're going to probably have to work longer that doesn't mean you're going to necessarily have to work sixty hours a week making a hundred and fifty grand a year it might be working a few hours a week making ten or twenty grand a year you're going to need to save more than\nHave to work sixty hours a week making a hundred and fifty grand a year they might be working a few hours a week making ten or twenty grand a year they're going to need to save more than you probably are right now so I Would encourage you if you're not already maximizing your contributions to your retirement plan at work too so I had an extra one percent of your savings rate at work\nAnd make sure you're earning a competitive rate of return make sure that your investment returns are exceeding the inflation rate so your money is actually growing and real economic terms if inflation is two percent and your bank account as paying one\nYou're losing one percent in real economic terms\nSo we need to make sure that your investments are growing with the pace of the cost of living and that means you need to make sure that your investments are growing on average over long periods of time not necessarily every single day or week or month or quarter year but over long periods of time on average your overall portfolio is earning a return exceeding that\nOf inflation and if you will do those three things work a little longer maybe save a little more maybe are a little bit more maybe then yes you can expect your future retirement your future lifestyle to be everything that you want us to be and if you're not sure how to do all of the above\nHow do you design your career structures that you can generate income either on a part time basis how do you figure out how to lower your expenses in order to free up extra cash to save and how do you structure your investments so that you can achieve your goals these got questions with any of those three\nCall us AAA plan wreck\nThat triple eight seven five to sixty seven forty two which are more than thirty seven thousand clients across the country and we've been doing this for Thirty years\nAnd we're happy to do it for you as well you don't have to go it alone you don't have to do what is on familiar to you must be the first
