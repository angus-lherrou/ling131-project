knew that the news media was so in love with the fourteenth amendment\nThey're pennies in a wedge they got they got something stuck and uh they're really upset\nWho knew who knew that the news media was so in love with the fourteenth amendment this is an extraordinary thing they hadn't mentioned anything about the fourteenth amendment and years and years and then President Trump mentioned that he's in favor of an executive order ... says to modify the fourteenth amendment to the constitution\nOkay well I mean I grew up in Puerto Rico and you know and I you know like the American friends are

no I think you're right and\nLook the president kind of throw it out there are other good came out of the blue I think the president was asked the question he wasn't planning on saying anything about it he said what he said he got the ball rolling now it's a now as soon as you look at the NBC News if that'd be no NBC News is not going to do the same story they did when Obama was president\nPresident Trump said this yesterday so the news media is dead set against any change to the fourteenth amendment any any look at the fourteenth amendment that's like you know they're special guitar and spinal tap don't even look at this guitar you you are you're not allowed to talk about the fourteenth amendment\nYou know the left Sylvie loves to say oh it's the browning of

Virginia ... you're on the crust plant Cher\nHi good morning at how well we want to thank you Andre\n... listed I based on the election discussion and we've been having a ... two days don't touch on a nationalism in the ... but I Want to make a prediction that the Republicans will hold the house or your wife and I I kind of made a similar production which ... back in twenty sixteen\nAnd and now the term nationalism is apparently in debate whether you know the definition of each should be changed but if you think about what Obama needs to say he'd say quite often that's not who we are that's who you are but\nThat that's an embodiment of nationalism and if you think about so I left trying to defend the fourteenth amendment suddenly you know there there are ... basically their arguments in a very strong nationalistic footprint and even like you think about the British and the ... vote\nThat's a very strong national yeah you've got to do that you buy and sell anyway just some type of theory that you know I listen to your show almost daily and I I Love it and I just want to get my two cents to the theme in theory about voting a here's one thing we do know is that Democrats are typically more extreme\nThick mind it whereas Republicans are more intrinsic and that's why you see a lot more bumper stickers on Democrats cars there need to conform or be part of a larger group there their identity comes from relating to a larger group\nAnd uh so conformity typically happens when a society puts out ... issues that are hard to understand or a detailed enough that you know the average person can't get there are a threat it so they look for others to give them a passport and understand it\nThat's right and a hundred percent right about it and and they also deliberately make simple issues very complicated because they know that people will eventually glaze over and then they'll just take the bumper sticker explanation\nThey'll just go the bumper sticker approach exactly yeah and I think we can see that phenomena anywhere you go I mean not up on bumper stickers are typically you did this for a living huh I you know I Do and I have and that that caller ship on the issue a ... on these issues and it's just I'm retired now you know we've talked before I'm On a retired military journalist or to years\nYeah you're right I think you're right on the money I think everything he says is a thoughtful and a serious and intelligent and I think you're I think you're a hundred percent right I Am you know why are the polls wrong well there is this sort of a variation on the Bradley effect that might even be the Trump effect after a few years\nTo update the old a Bradley effect but but I think you're absolutely right and why the polls\nSo far off on election day in two thousand six team that was our last election seems like longer ago than Twenty one months or whatever it is\nA ... and I'm I'm twenty four months now for the elections anyway the president's been in for Twenty one month but I think you're I think you're absolutely right and and you believe that the that the polls are going to be wrong enough that the Republicans hold the house\nI I think so and especially with this new fourteenth amendment debate I think on its face I think most people know and understand\nThat birthright citizenship outside of the uh how it was written or the intended yours is wrong and there's nothing that Democrats can say to make it right they know what's wrong if you look at a bell curve of it is you know it's only been kind of a thing in the sixties yeah so it fits into the narrative that the Democrats are only driving for voter\nYeah as exactly right wrong yeah you're you're a hundred percent right you're you're very wise men Andrea and I know that you're wise because I agree with you on everything [laughter] and that's what that's how you can tell if a person is really smart is they say all the things that you believe you want to hear that you agree with a person with a really great sense of humor is a person that last year jokes\n[laughter] that's how that works those are Ho Chi Minh ... I Love it Andre thank you thanks very much shit right call\n'em yeah great self and listen my uh my Palin a seat in ... getting famous I heard ... mentioned on national radio yesterday my friend ... who lives here in the area and follows these things and writes in his or on a variety of issues very smart guy\nAnd he points out that the author of the fourteenth amendment was a a Michigan senator by the name of Jacob powered and Jacob our the author of the amount of uh said unless there's what he said he said every person born within the limits of the u._s. and subject to their jurisdiction\nHe continued this will not of course include persons born in the U.S who are foreigners\nComma aliens come up who belong to the families of ambassador doors\nRight so you're a foreign ... year the ambassador from France or from the court of St James and Britain still living in the United states uh you your your family has a children's\nThe families of ambassadors having children here they're here in an official capacity certainly legally and the frame or the writer the author of the fourteenth amendment said that it would\nAnd children here they're here in an official capacity certainly legally and the frame or the writer the author of the fourteenth amendment said that it would not apply said quite explicitly not in the amendment but in the writings that we're a tandem writings that went along with the creation of the fourteenth amendment\nSo if you're if you're an ambassador and your wife assuming the ambassador when this was written as a man and the ambassador's wife gives birth\nThat the ambassador of child is not a U.S is not a U.S citizen\nThe fourteenth amendment the language and the un and he says also very explicitly and this is what the court the Supreme Court would have to consider this is what the Ninth Circuit court of appeals will ignore and then the Supreme Court will take into account appropriately and and the way to appropriately\nAnd I don't want them to come up with my favorite solution I mean I sort of do\nBut only if the constitution only if it's the correct interpretation\nAnd what the court to come to the correct legal interpretation keeping in mind that countries all over the world that used to have birthright citizenship have done away with perks birthright citizenship [noise]\nThere's not a country and Western Europe or in Eastern Europe that has birthright citizenship many used to have birthright citizenship but it ... the last country to get rid of ... birthright citizenship was Ireland and before that I Believe it was France\nAnd they were the last two in Europe to allow for birthright citizenship [noise]\nThey've done away with not a single country on that you're Asian continent from from ... to a a a Portugal there is not a single country that has\nBirthright citizenship on that you're Asian continent there's not a single country on the African continent what fifty countries that has birthright citizenship\nBut the news media wants to ... all the president's wrong thirty countries that have birthright citizenship\nI Would like to see what the rules are for birthright citizenship and places like Brazil and and ... by and see what sort of restrictions they haven't birthright citizenship I can assure you that ... times as busy right now not looking into that\nThey are not going to report on that because they're corrupt and they're not journalists they're Democrats\n[noise] also I'm\nJacob Howard the author writes stuff from him saying that it shall not included persons born in the U.S who are foreigners\nWell that takes him pretty much everybody is not an American comma aliens that would include illegal aliens in addition to legal aliens so that speaks to the intent and then if you read the amendment over again with that in mind and by the way the amendment does it begins\nAccording to out from the fourteenth amendment all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction bearer of\nThat's a key phrase right there that it's subject to some interpretation\nAre citizens of the United states and other states where they reside keep in mind this is about the Democrats and slaves okay this is and and it's a it's that I like to include the Democrats because they deserve to be included in all of this\nThis is about a freed slaves and the Democrats fighting against rights for ... for the children and the descendants of freed slaves now I haven't gotten to the President Trump was asked about this yesterday in an interview with ...

information pack it on the ten ten IRA delivered to you call or text to eight eight four one one forty one thirty that's eight eight eight four one one forty one thirty call or text to eight eight eight four one one forty one thirty\nBreaking new on the inside\nStory on Washington Mall W A L\nWashington comes to\nAnd there's been confusion and debate from the very beginning\nAnd they the immediate post civil war era and he said we have to look at the purpose of the original intent\nWas intended to get full rights to free the slaves of full rights of citizenship and and he said you're from Mr glee that there were those in certain states they were Democrats in southern states\nThat didn't want to grant full right so that's the purpose of the fact and and then later and I'm really not to a hundred years later in the Nineteen sixties\nDid we start to expand the meaning the interpretation\nOf the language contained in the fourteenth amendment and now President Trump is causing us to take another look at the language and it will be sorted out and I would put to you\nThat first of all legislation should be passed so you know liberals love being in sync with European countries it would put us in sync with European countries to\nDo away with our current birthright citizenship status you know not a lot of people go to ... to take advantage of their birthright citizenship\nUh Ireland's done away with England's on her with her friends have done it with their journey has done or they've uh they've all done away with it all the places liberals go on vacation they've done away with birthright citizenship Jonathan Turley what what did the authors of the fourteenth amendment\nIn ten what were they talking about and I was reading earlier from some of the uh the language from\nFrom the the author of the actual amendment who is a Michigan Republican senator and quite explicitly said in his writings what it was intended to include and what what is not intended to include\nSenator Jacob powered of Michigan uh every person born within the U.S one that's the subject jurisdiction this will not he said of course include persons born in the U.S who are foreigners\nOkay aliens or\nWho belong to the families of ambassadors that should give you a clue as to what the intent of the fourteenth amendment was Jonathan Turley\nSome of the draft or as of the fourteenth amendment indicated that they did not believe that this language was unlimited birthright protections are guaranteed by some of them actually put in legislation limiting a birthright citizenship to children of citizens or legal residents\nNow as a calm cool and collected scholarly type of person\nHey uh Jonathan Turley this morning he said like I don't like the executive order approach that President Trump is taking but at the same time you know if you turn the channel look at CNN all this insanity and the range they love the rage that's ridiculous to say there is a reasonable measured legal scholar Jonathan Turley\nYeah I don't understand all the hyperbole and anger about this this has been a long standing debate there's good faith arguments on both sides the natural reading of this amendment would seem to support unlimited birthright citizenship but the history\nThe tax some of the draft or tend to go the other way and courts view clauses like this is having meaning they don't just\nTense them so the question is why was this clause put in what was referencing and you can make as either certainly make a good faith arguments that it limit\nBirth racism birthright citizenship the United states has something of an outlier there's only about thirty country they recognize unlimited birthright citizenship or that doesn't mean that you can use the executive order you know I testified against President Obama using executive orders I think it was wrong that I think it's wrong now\nYeah but it starts the conversation that gets the ball rolling\nA anyway a size and he said it's hilarious you go to CNN MSNBC the Washington Post that said Trump ... outrageous lawyer enough fraud and are racist on the phone\nAnd they said no other country has birthright citizenship when thirty or thirty three other countries have birthright citizenship yeah look at which countries first of all now the president may have gotten that wrong or misspoken\nHe may have a button\nThis isn't you know look at which countries first of all now the president may have gotten that wrong or misspoken he may have a button and the news media is trying to make it sound like we're the outlier it truly used the word outlier there that were the outlier because there are thirty three other countries rather about two hundred countries in the world\nAnd of those approximately two hundred countries and its approximate because it depends on whether you account in Dora and and the Vatican and the Palestinian territories and so different people different ways\nAbout two hundred is a good and fair number and we're not the outlier in fact uh the thirty or so that have birthright citizenship they're kind of the outliers at this point now the other way around also Jonathan Turley points out that Lindsey Graham is now proposing legislation in the Senate\nAnd he prefers that approach but I think\nLindsey Graham's proposed legislation could have a stronger case to make in court\nNow at us for the president's executive order a which hasn't happened yet but it's been suggested\n[noise] can't hate change\nThe fourteenth amendment with an executive order or I Would I based on my reading of this and the way I was brought up I\nWould say no you can't change it but here's the question have we changed the interpretation of the fourteenth amendment overtime to the point where the president wouldn't really be changing it he would be restoring the status quo ante restoring its in its original intent\nI'm John Burnett has the CNN a finger he's a finger on uh the cable news network in the morning he's a he's an angry little Democrat and he hates President Trump and any is not a legal scholar or anything but they play one on TV\nHe's also claim that he can to fire the U.S constitution and birthright citizenship they're fires Republican lawyers they say no\nSay that they say they they go and Republican lawyers\nConstitutional scholars on Republican lawyers they said no ... I just had Jonathan Turley on saying then so they say why there's universal agreement that is a lie\nHe's a lion little sack a Jew we're All right and I and he lies all the time because he hates Trump so much now\nYou can debate it but these ... these these fingers coming on here defy the U.S constitution is not looking to defy the U.S constitution he's challenging the conventional wisdom on a\nOn the fourteenth amendment stunned birthright citizenship and by the way the words birthright citizenship do not appear on the fourteenth amendment\nSo when these people like Jennifer Rubin at the Washington Post\nPretend that this is settled because it's enshrined in the fourteenth amendment show me where it's been tried in the for it to the point where it's not subject to where it hasn't been hotly debated over the years\nAnd then I just love this thing Maggie Haberman tired haggard in New York Times type posed for the\nDemocratic Party who doesn't know what ... who is four she was on the television this morning and this short one this little thing just made me laugh it's about how exhausted that they are\nFrom President Trump they're they're just they're exhausted he has exhausted them that they they think they're into fabric ... but they're not he has he has a defective ... here's here's exhausted them they're completely worn down to knobs and she looks like it to\nAn attorney in politics in general let alone and the Trump era I feel like\nI just liked that part you know election day the mid term elections those ... to get the electric the midterm elections are six days away like what is this going to play into the midterm elections and she's like I have no idea there are six days away on and it's like dog years or something\nAnd turning politics in general let alone and the Trump era I feel like\n[noise] yeah well you know every day's a year to you\nA ... with the New York times or the caravan the president has made the caravan of ... the media's all upset about this there are thousands of people stumbling toward our country carrying the flags of foreign nations and they have a list of demands and the news media it's like oh that's great isn't that wonderful that's the best thing ever\nBut they're upset the news media the New York times on ... on CNN that the president has successfully made the caravan into a political issue I think the Democrats created the caravan to some degree or another and then birthright citizenship\nI won't say there there's ten different wind that will ... talking about birthright and shaking aligned with American\nAll I stepped on it I said she here it is big caravan that's taking aim at migrants not illegal that people looking that come into the country really just migrants and the birthright citizenship I Love this part I stepped on it I got to play it again is taking aim at Americans I\nWon't say their their chests\nAnd the birthright citizenship I Love this part I stepped on it I got to play it again is taking aim at Americans I won't\nSay there there's a difference at one of the caravan of ... talking about birthright citizenship and taking aim at American\nTalking about birthright citizenship is taking aim at Americans\nI just don't know how one tortured mind\nArrives at that destination I just ... what what Americans and ... and these idiots they sit there with their mouths hanging up and there is dumb as me and and and they just don't know what to say how is birthright citizenship ship taking aim at Americans\nHow is that the whole point is you have to be a foreigner to", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Chris Plante Show", "city": "Washington", "day": "31"}
