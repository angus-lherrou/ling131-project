that are right I don't\nLike that and take all the help they need you know do a song thing I mean we can't you got to pressure the precedent\nYeah man and look the other thing is that it's not just about this group of people because if you and where do you hear this audio have from St Louis is one of the organizers down there with a with the caravan\nHe's a he makes no bones about it they're just coming here for a jobs in for a better life and so they can send money back home and it's not not political refugees regret the United nations involved they've never done anybody any good and they're going to set up tents and spend our money and\nProbably a engage the services of child prostitutes which seems to be what always happens in these un missions in far flung places\nAnd and uh I I'm just looking at the situation the Democrats are rubbing their hands together hoping that something really bad happens maybe people will get hurt and then the Democrats can blame Trump for it just like they're blaming Trump for\n... she and all of this or do they blame him for everything it's completely ridiculous stable thank you thank you for checking in a you know God Bless you I appreciate

would they'd been promises that eh forget all the political rhetoric when you get here uh here's the ... the crib sheet here's what you tell a border protection that you want political asylum and because you fear for your life\nAnd then you're thrown into the process and they they put you through the process and then they let you go and they give you a court date and then you never show up and it's a it's quite an arrangement or we've come to\nAn end the last Tara man that came in you remember the Democrats and the media but I repeat myself made all kinds of\nPolitical hay out of the separation of children which Obama did too and it was fine when he did it\nAnd and bronco by most asinine that American citizens overseas kind of like a prince sold on a cell non rather but he uh you know he he wasn't the bad guy for the double standards are really quite extraordinary but in any event the last ... van came in and because the Democrats and their friends and the media\nMade a the whole family separation thing into a political issue\nAnd they had the pictures from the Obama administration of children sleeping in cages and they claimed that they were from the Trump Administration because they lie all the time I'm the president was forced by the court of public opinion because of public pressure\nAnd political pressure and media pressure to basically allow the last care about it and that that message that reality was not lost on this caravan and Luis the guy who was audio I'm going to play in a little bit\nHe said yeah President Trump says he's going to close the border but last time they open it up at everybody got in and that's the lesson so now let's go again and if these seven ... seven thousand two hundred and now they're still have to go all

Honduras has\nThe highest murder rate in the world Honduras has the highest homicide rate in the world outside the door has the fourth highest murder rate in the world go off my law has the I Do that kind of like ... um has the fifth highest homicide rate in the world\nYou should probably um work on that should see what you can do about that\nTo decrease the homicide rate just in Tallahassee also you know Gillum as his name right the Democrat running for a Senate in or for governor rather in uh in Florida\nAnd um hid under his watch under his to clinch under his leadership Tallahassee now has a the highest murder rates\nIn the states and they've they've shattered the record for for Tallahassee um and and I guess that's a point of pride or something um [noise]\nBut if you're a Democrat it's not really a big story or I suppose because\nYou get promoted it's like round the manual it's like Morocco bummer Brock Obama organized the south side of Chicago good job there and I was elected to the Senate from the state house the U.S Senate from the state house in Illinois\nAnd then to present the United states because he's fixed the south side of Chicago\nWhich is like Aleppo right what's Aleppo or let's go to William ...\nDone along the border and um it it's true though this Gillum guy at the the the homicide rate in Tallahassee has shattered all records and that's not even something that reflects on him at\nAll right why would that be a problem [noise]\nThen uh credits really not a problem All right let's go because William washing us with Fox News yesterday I was watching this live yesterday afternoon and William ... was speaking to one of the organizers of the caravan\nWashing us with Fox News yesterday I was watching this live yesterday afternoon and William ... was speaking to one of the organizers of the caravan [noise]\nHis name he said was Luis and Louis was wearing a vast like he's a crossing guard you know as with the reflective orange stuff on the vest and\nWilliam watching us spoke to him because he was at ... at it as a spokesman and one of the organizers of the thing and I said what you know when these people get to the United states what what did these people want why are they fleeing their homes in Central America what are these people going to say when they get\nThe United states [laughter]\nFriday or something I don't know they were probably as\nThey they gave him something while they can say I have all the kids they can go to school so they can apartment and they can go to work\n[noise] so they can get but their their kids aren't with them so they want to bring their kids and after they get here 'cause it's mostly adult men that are that are coming in but yeah I didn't hear him say anything about a living in fear about uh the crime the gangs the\nCartels I didn't hear anything about that probably has to give them something so they can have stuff so they can stay so they can get an apartment so they can get a job so their kids can go to school\nYeah\nHuh well okay I understand that I I genuinely do I understand that and for that we have something that we called the immigration system and you go to the embassy in your country and you apply and you know don't let me let me ask this sort of any halfway to live out their\nLet's say somebody gets on an airplane in Aleppo\nAnd flies to Cairo and then flies to London and then flies to New York and gets off the plane and says I'm here to stay I Want to live here I I I got on a plane and I came to the United states because now I'm here and I'm not leaving\nIs that how our immigration system works is that our immigration system should work is that how the immigration system of any country works or should work\nThe answer is obviously know Luis\nWas asked by William ... they said well look the president said he's going to um\nHe's going to shut down the border as you bring this caravan up toward the United states the president said he may call it the military and he's going to shut down the border but listen Louis knows she paid attention last time around the Democrats ginned up that whole fake news story completely fake huge lie\nThat's like the red solo cups story\nThat from\nBecause of a zero tolerance policy in a part of that was true separating families like never before none of that was true\nObama separated them all the pictures that they use word from the Obama administration but listen Louis learn and then because of the media slash Democrat but I repeat myself pressure\nOr the president was forced to basically left the caravan and they were processed they were let loose and the country catch and release because the Democrats were and their allies and the media were able to manipulate\nPublic opinion with fake pictures they are real pictures but they were from Obama putting children in cages then Obama literally did turn people over to caregivers some of whom used them as slave labor including sex slave\nLabor children handed over by Obama personally\nJust getting it wasn't personally but it was his administration\nIf it were Trump handing kids over to people that use them as slaves on a chicken ranch in Ohio which is what happened during Obama with kids living in a in a chicken shack with a bucket as a bathroom because the Obama people handed him over to the flavors\nAnd there are literally slave labor\nIn Ohio the children that were handed over by Obama and that story just got nothing nothing because I don't care about children and don't care about human life they don't care about slavery and our care about the sexual abuse of children and their documented cases of\nThe Obama people handing children over to people who are not their guardians who than us just cereal a sexually abused them but you know let's not get all caught up in that so that we used was watching the news and he knows last time around President Trump said he wasn't going to let them in but then they got him so what did Lewis said yesterday\nThat I found a lot less time and we we take over there by the borders and all that people will say voter Neal radio in the United states\nSay he said that last time but he open the border for them in all the people that went up there already in the United states so this is a success story for the Democrats below sea and Schumer high fiving in front of it\nPeople that went up there already in the United states so this is a success story for the Democrats below sea and Schumer high fiving in front of the TV when they're sitting there watching Fox News yesterday and ah\nAnd then Louis said well I mean you know and and William lodging assassin so if a year to port if you get turned back then what\nThey do and back in the way they send them back our country we're coming back\nWe're coming back we're just come back well you know um [laughter]\nThat's not acceptable and then once again just in case it wasn't clear enough what are you coming for you coming because you're fleeing the horrors of ah go walk him out or why are you coming\nThey called the leader of the anti Christ and insist we're not criminals well I Do speak for all shut them thousand W\nBecause

then what was brought forth during the cabinet debacle ms villain the lawyer responded to me with respect full immediacy offering candid advice and compassion tempered with pragmatism\nAnd then a refreshingly rare act of bipartisanship she recommended eye contact Ronan Farrow the father of the modern pound me too movement him self\nHe then goes on to tell a story about how he's been playing phone tag and emailed tagged with Ronan Farrow who doesn't seem to have a lot of interest in his story and the New York New Yorker doesn't seem to have a lot of interest in the story and I'm sure the New York times and the Washington Post and CNN they don't have a lot of interest in a story\nBut keep in mind that Cory Booker was one of the people that was very quick\nTo condemn without corroborating evidence without any substantiated evidence claims made at first anonymously against then judge Brett Kavanaugh now justice Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd as a loop said to me earlier when we're talking about this it's just a fair that Cory Booker get a taste of his own medicine\nYou see the movie deliverance [laughter]\n\nSo ah so there is a there is that speaking of Kevin and all these are all related stories I think to the Washington Post ran a Kavanaugh story with knowingly false information the Daily Caller I Believe broke the story the Washington Post\nAnd post ran a Kavanaugh story with knowingly false information the Daily Caller I Believe broke the story\nBut Washington Post falsely suggested that Georgetown preparatory school Georgetown Prep where Brett Kavanaugh went to high school year to year book there he wrote something about ... and about a nice lady that they have accused of being a slut because that's what they do\nThe Washington Post falsely suggests at Georgetown Prep was hiring a new employees to deal with the fallout from the Kavanaugh hearings despite the fact that the school had directly contradicted the Washington Post report\nEmily hostile have you noticed a lot of them have high all in their names carrying on the tradition I guess Emily hostile a leftist typist for the Democratic party who is Charlotte ten when it comes to being a journalist\nReported on October Eighteen foot Georgetown Prep was hiring a director of alumni relations wrote that the school posted the advertisement for the position this week\nThe article further suggested that the school was adding that position because of the new surrounding the confirmation of justice Brett Kavanaugh a Georgetown Prep alum to the Supreme Court\nHowever Emily hostile was informed prior to publication of her article a buy a spokesperson person for Georgetown Prep that the position had in fact been posted back in July before Brett Kavanaugh had even been\nChosen by President Trump nominated by President Trump now Emily high all it's just another type posed for the party there is nothing surprising about any of this\nShe went back and now after everybody publicly humiliated her for being a fraud and a hack\nAnd Charlotte ... and ... and a fraud did I say fraud twice that's okay and uh it was it was pointed out not only did she publish something that was untrue and uh and then I add to it said the suggesting that it's all because of Brett Kavanaugh\nUp but the school had in fact pointed out there that um that this was all\nUm posted months ago but em Lehigh all in the frauds at the Washington Post went ahead and did it and they even had the emails posted right here back and forth between Emily hostile and the spokesmen at Georgetown Prep Patrick coil\nUm who said uh you know and only as noted in my message below that our director of alumni relations position was posted in July of two thousand Eighteen your article says the listing went up after Georgetown alumni were very much in the news\nAnd that's not true Patrick coil at Georgetown Prep said this is not true and I in fact gave you the month\nIn which the position was posted prior to the publication of the article plays ... correct your a story immediately please cc everyone on this distribution and she's like oh yeah okay I knew that uh but she lives all the time and she's a frog so\nCorrection a previous version of the story incorrectly state of the Georgetown Prep posted or job listening this week for director of alumni relations this cool began advertising for the position in July\nShe corrected that but she was told that I have a hurt typing up the article on behalf of the party healer fake news [laughter]\n[noise] uh\nYes that's right the Democrats are very upset with those two this is a this is pretty funny\nUm transgender the New York times that are very upset about this they've got transgender in quotation marks transgender could be defined out of existence under Trump Administration they have three typists era to Al Green Katie bender and rubber pair\nThe Trump Administration is considering narrowly defining gender as a biological immutable condition determined by genitalia at birth\nHitting the most drastic move yet in a government wide effort to roll back recognition and protections of dread transgender people under federal civil rights law\nA series of decisions by the Obama administration loosened the legal concept of gender in federal programs including an education and healthcare recognizing gender largely as an individual choice and not determined by sex assigned at birth sure sure\nAnd there's another publication that's almost hilarious\nWhere they say that the Trump Administration is considering throwing out the definition of gender\nThrowing up the definition of gender that sort of throwing out the definition of gender because they would say that a male is born with the pain is a female is not and ah you know we know
