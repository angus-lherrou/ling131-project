bought the holy\nSix three zero nine to five eight eight eight\nSix three zero nine six June five\n\nAbsolutely free to\nYou're used to ride\nWith each passing day perhaps ever so subway but\nAs the conflict between the news media and President Trump and I think that that's the central conflict to the United states of America what effect I think that the actual conflict you know you've got it with laughter is that your dinner table at Thanksgiving who want to ruin the family because they goose step along with the\nThe party you've got a our problems at work and your neighbors and all of this\nBut I honestly think that perhaps the root of all of that at this moment in time is the conflict between the news media and the president and the news media is so hell bent on getting Trump\nThat they have expanded their search and destroy area to include all of a President Trump's voters and Republicans in general and conservatives and all that talk about the constitution and all these things that annoy\nLeft days or so terribly and the quest to get Trump has gone so crazy that people like Jake Tapper who used to be a news reporter and are now is sort of a tragic burned out shell of its former self\nHe's got a a TV show on a cable station called some drawing and uh he um\nFormer herself he's got a a TV show on a cable station called some things and he invited this woman I we talked about this woman Julia Ioffe\nAre the big bang theory that TV show decided to get involved in politics and uh and and all of these Hollywood people they're just\nYou know ... of course the problem is news media people if you can call them that asks the Hollywood people for their lunatic idiot uninformed\nOpinions and then naturally since they're uninformed ... offered they're idiotic opinions and then the news media due to flee prints them as do we care what James Cromwell has to say about politics\n... okay perfectly fine actor now shut up and you just play dress up and make believe as the good lord intended\nHawks has a news organization as well\nAnd again all of these things to to get to today there there are many things as is often the case president was on Laura Ingraham last night on the Fox news channel where he had a couple of good candidates and talked about the fake news media and\nAnd uh they say and I love the president tweeted out yesterday about the fake news media being the enemy of the people and it's very specifically saying the fake news media\nBut I Do ah like I said from the beginning that this whole enemy of the people thing is not language that I Would use or advised that my president or anybody's president years\nThe president continues to use it he he now has narrowed it a little bit and says it's the fake news media that is the enemy of the people and that is good and ... and as opposed to just the news media that's fine you\nKnow the news media than people like Jim Acosta they latch onto it and they say hey wait a minute I'm the fake news media you're talking about me and they proudly wrap themselves and the cloak of the fake news media that President Trump is referring to\nAnd and they say you can't call me the enemy of the people and and you got to stop and say how do you do do you actually read this thing that I saw even anchors on Fox News or saying well he says the news media is the enemy of the people\nUh and and it's right in front of you it's on the screen that says the fake news media that that said he could probably know retire that particular phrase and no one would hold it against him

and he has struck can incredibly reasonable tone at tone a remarkable a tone of um of calm and uh he's the adults in the conversation and as a result of course he's being slaughtered he's being attacked\nBecause now he's the bad guy by the way I'm over the weekend and I noticed is I was with my best girl\nOver the weekend it was Sunday we were driving down to congressional cemetery in in Washington DC and southeast Washington\nAnd to go visit the historic cemetery and driving down north Capitol street there were banners up for prep for Georgetown Prep for a big football game it turns out it was holding coming over the weekend and the New York times decided vets the school that justice Brett Kavanaugh went two\nAnd a and the New York times noted to be the homecoming and they're very excited about it back at Georgetown Prep the headline reads cabinet is hailed as a hero because it's they hate everything that the Democrats and the New York times\nWell that's the Democrats during halftime at a Georgetown preparatory\nSchool's homecoming football game on Saturday a group of students swipe through photos on their phones as they waited in a long line for burgers and fries one Sandy haired boy\nSandy haired boy tapped his latest image a selfie with the justice Brett Kavanaugh the newest member of the Supreme Court and an alumnus of Georgetown Prep class of Nineteen eighty three now\nWhy are they doing a story on this it's all about the hey there's still after Kevin up they really wanted to get Kevin on the New York times then they're damned us to bring down Kevin ... light jak holes going after a baby antelope\nThey tried to peel Kavanaugh away from the herd latch onto his Achilles' heels drag 'em to the ground and then seven gym in mob form there's that n word again in my form which is what they always do\nJustice cabinet and the New York times writes who's here is that this prestigious Catholic boys' school\nAnd I just decided to stop there for a minute when they mentioned Brock Obama going to the ... school did they do they always refer to it as the exclusive\nA and prestigious\n... a a boon to host school when they talk about Al Gore going to St all buttons at the national cathedral isn't always the prestigious exclusive\nCaucasian St all done school little less so now perhaps but certainly when he went there sit well friends where they all send their kids to you know meet and greet so they're going to have sex between the Democratic party and then the news media but I repeat myself\nAnd that's how they're raised them\nAnd this story goes on for pages and pages and the New York times\nOr about how awful it is that the Georgetown Prep people actually seek Kavanaugh as being sort of a hero in all of this because they know none of this stuff is true because they went to school with him they went to the same parties they heard about the parties they didn't go to\nAnd all the people at Georgetown Prep know that all of it was a lie that it was all just a horrible smear a slander I'll lie for political purposes to take down an enemy of the Democratic party in the end because they love abortion so much\nHow much do they love abortion\nI think more than life itself there like al ... at this point\nThey love death more than we love life\n... and this to a very large extent was about that too a very large extent and they're still calling her doctor ... and they still don't called Dr Sebastian Gorka Dr Sebastian Gorka\nThey don't even call Dr Ben Carson a world renowned pediatric neurosurgeon Dr curse him but they call ... doctor blond see on every reference\nBecause she's never left campus so after like fifty\nYears on campus now you get a PHD eventually it's in nothing I think not really it's in psychology or

filmmaker who according to Dr ...\nWitnessed the alleged assault was a no show oh no but that's because he minds his own business and he knows that you ... are going to be lurking around the hot dog

associated with\nThe young justice cabinet appearing regularly an entries in his personal calendar in the summer of Nineteen eighty two\nThat they become of became part of a Saturday Night live skit about the Senate confirmation hearings oh it's all part of the circle fast it's all Saturday Night live is just another tool in the Democratic party's shed\nAnd says this is what it's all about so the New York times went there to do a big story on on a on this and then it's really just about to hate it's ... it's all about the [noise] uh\n[noise] I'm In New York times was there to record to record the issues\nHave view I don't know if it's a book or be how do you pronounce [laughter]\nRefers to flash when we were sixteen [noise] okay\nMore on what was that was that Sheldon Whitehouse Sheldon Whitehouse he's got a truck stripe suit and he's got a great politician hair and he is as dumb as Mika Brzezinski\nAnd that's not easy that's pretty hard I've got to say I still of the fat shaming story how this is all Trump's fault I Love it racial slurs and fat shaming insults keep popping up on receipts as Trump we're sending the trend that's probably a Wendy's customer found a receipt with the word should be on it\nHe's far from alone then he ordered the chubby meal\nBecause when I go to Wendy's I Love to get the ... so to double cheeseburgers and ... and you get a coke and a frosty because you've got all of those ... don't you [noise]\nThere is no dairy and there but they're tasty anyway earlier this month a man named Jimmy Shoe\nJimmy shoot that then they make like five hundred dollar women's issues for it or to sandwiches from a North Carolina Wendy's he gave a worker oh they they like they call American workers the left us\nHe gave a worker as name and plays the order about what he went to pick it up you notice the receipt identified him as chubby rather than Jimmy his story went viral it really it went viral that hasn't that has been banned yet\n[noise] and when the press picked it up the press picked it up\nAnd Wendy's fire the staffer I thought he was a worker responsible for the demeaning comment but what happened a shoe isn't on income and\nThere was the Missouri man who saw big black printed on his Pizza Hut receipts\nAnd California businessman who Franklin frequent tend landmark steakhouse in orange county\nHad no idea that the staff had repeatedly called him the N. word on receipts I'm I'm thinking of that one probably didn't happened really is that what's happened to get in and Latin California repeatedly they kept calling them the N word I I'm I'm thinking that's a lawsuit in the in the making there are a try anyway\nThey also referred to him as Mick cotton wood on one sales slip now this is all Trump's fault you understand this is the point of the story\nI'm over the past decade over the past decade now because Trump is responsible for things that predates his emergence on the political scene\nOver the past decade dozens of news stories that appeared about customers finding fat shaming comments racial slurs\nAnd anti Semitic remarks on receipts from restaurants dry cleaners and other establishment printed reminders of the bias marginalized customers face wild patronizing businesses they shouldn't patronize those businesses let me just say then and then the question comes up that's it\nIt's Trump's fault that's right but all of this as Trump's fault and that you don't even need to get into the details to because it's a mental illness that's just what it is\nTo mental illness they're crazy people I have the audio of the rabbi I have the ah from yesterday\nWhich got in trouble with the left and then today talking about how the left is threatening him and calling them all kinds of slurs and things but uh I I Know this is how you get uninvited from coming back on CNN too\nSo I don't think we're going to see a lot more of the rabbi on CNN [noise]\nMeans that let's go the phones we haven't gotten to the
