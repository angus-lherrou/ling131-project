riding his own history and you're living through this history it's remarkable history ladies and gentlemen\nAnd they will try and write the history there will try and write the books about Trump how he was like Hitler and his supporters were like killer how was a low point in American history it's a high point in American history\nIt's a leading point in American history\nAnd\nWhat's going on now is that the media want to cut short or the advances that have been made they\nThey want to create chaos they want to create hatred and jealousies and so forth but on their terms which is why they are not only rooting for the Democrats to win the house and the Senate\nThey are the propagandist for the Democrats\nThere the propagandist for the Democrats\nThat's why you see them not dare to take

emissions\nUnderstanding their enemies do not respect\nWeakness they only respect strength we can't be silent not because we want more but because you want to prevent it we have right now a president any national security team behind them\nAs ensuring that American exceptionalism is nothing to apologize for we are respected again and I love it\nWe have to continue going the right direction and the president needs people in Congress who are going to support him when he has a backbone standing up to threats to our country that is how we protect ourselves a next generation that's how we protect our freedoms and liberties and I'll tell you as an army reservist\nI Know that if I was ever sent into harm's way I Would be sent to win or not sent that all\nWhere we've had conflicts in the past where we send our troops out of harm's way and we set them up to fail\nSo I feel good as as a U.S citizen and ... with where we are a national security as a member of Congress and also someone who

animals they are animals he's come up to Long Island multiple times\nWe've had members of and missed his administration all in working with local law enforcement\nAnd it's not just about combating MS Thirteen it's the it's the sex trafficking the drug trafficking human trafficking so it's protecting public safety not just the high profile murder that everyone in the country will hear about it's also this administration rescuing\n... that the women who are stuck in that sex brothel in that town within my district where they're being used as as slaves having sex all day long so the administration is\nIt's protecting all these people who are who are being victimized by the crimes and the way that MS Thirteen supports itself my opponent is one of those people who said we need to
