and put my DVD friends in a camp\nI Am all for it and put that right ... ... right wing guy in there and do that\nBecause if this point I feel that I have a better chance of converting them over to my crew value booming quicker everything we can go to get everything I death bed because they think well who Democratic Party\nAnd what they I mean he only had found them meaning to their why it may have ... the way that makes me in on the ball and my idea my idea is that I Believe than\nLetting you why you raise a number of interesting points and it sounds like you have been very much\nPolitically involved in the ... over a long window of time that you're not a typical from a lot of likely Trump\nVoters and even the ... is typical because I'm not sure\nIf the delineation between conservatives versus Republicans versus moderate it's really hard anymore with labels but what I Will say and I see there's a lot with especially younger Republican ask voters\nWhen you're basically describing is that you are a social liberal but fiscally conservative and ultimately is how do you want your government to be run in the grand scheme of things if we're talking about the values that you just represented as Donald Trump\nLikely to strip any of those potential rights\n... from any of the the aforementioned no is Donald Trump going to be the guy to to try to to push for the elimination of of gay marriage now he's on a for that matter he's even told justice to stand down when it comes to marijuana enforcement you know\nThe elimination of of gay marriage no he's not or for that matter he is even told justice to stand down when it comes to marijuana enforcement there he's not the most conservative guy I mean take a look at his own personal life it tells you as much so you do have a lot of fiscal conservatives I'll give you an idea you know I'm I'm a little bit of a quandary\nPolitically myself I you know don't generally talk about it quite this way but I personally am quite conservative and when it comes to social values I live my life\nAs kind of like a half assed Catholic and I said I was a good Catholic wouldn't be throw so I Want to be honest [laughter] so I got to have as Catholic but I you know I it here too that that kind of value system so for example you know personally I'm pro life\nBut I Believe in a libertarian form of government so when it comes to social issues I Am more inclined to get the government out of the way for example I don't think the government should be involved at all in marriage why is it is a government dictates marriage why is it that the tax code has ever delineated\nBased upon one marital status we've created so many issues so many issues that way\nThey didn't have to be created because we've put government into the mix\nSo I Am inclined or you know it's like with marijuana a lot of people think that uh you know because I I Will rail against it like we have ... you know medical marijuana legalized in Florida which a lot of states do and you have the recreational use and several more states oh rail against it and and people are just anti marijuana what no I'm not\nI don't care about your crap as long as you keep it away from me and don't hurt anybody my issue is that it's not legal you know I I Believe again and the premise and so in that case it was like they like marijuana as well\nAnd needs to be either legalize whereas a minimum decriminalize by the federal government otherwise all we're doing and all these states\nLike mine is I mean our nose at the United States Constitution it doesn't work that way and that's the reason that we get all this kind of horse craft stuff going on where you can use the financial system and it creates a whole host of problems under that and you have doctors that will go\nYou know given like a wink and a nod because you can't actually issue a prescription because oh by the way you're trying to issue guidance on a schedule one drug\nSo again that is I I think where you're coming from more\nOf a position that is prevalent within a Trump supporter but even maybe even a young younger\nUh is the Republican ask again voters for the lack of a better label and certainly I think people who are constitutional is so anyway ah my my heart goes out to you for having been the victim best to you and your family or and may God Bless\nHim by the way for a high camp in North Dakota I mean come on\nThe high camp in North Dakota ... you're you're talking about a state that Trump won by thirty six points and her she's voted with Donald Trump approximately forty percent of the time I I mean it doesn't exactly line up with the north Dakota and values\nI mean I I don't know what Taylor Swift per se but\nJust like ... mud and for the great one month\nWashington

I'm a practicing Roman Catholic I Believe that he is a a he's a reflection of God himself despite all the ... and problems of the Roman Catholic Church of what she might have some\nBut it is terribly greatly this afternoon when I learned that Pope Francis says huddled with film director ... Michael Moore\nDuring his weekly general audience and the St Patrick's square now I don't know the pope who doesn't read current events doesn't read newspapers\nMaybe didn't know Michael Moore was and Michael Moore simply worked his way to the front and huddled with the pope as if he was having a meeting with Michael Moore is left wing radical extremist he's a a contributor Planned Parenthood that\nKills about three thousand developing babies every day\nHe's a ah certainly an individual that does not reflect American values hard work perseverance fear of God love of country\nSo if the pope knowingly and wittingly met with Michael Moore I got a problem with that because especially as abortion feelings but nonetheless until I find out if the pope knew who he was and it's hard to criticize him and secondly and lastly\nBig fight with a couple of weeks ago with Kevin always largely over\nBut I did some statistical work on\nWhat was one with a cabin all Brett Kavanaugh and what lies ahead the Supreme Court which I've not had the honor of appearing before takes about eighty cases a year\nAnd the nation's highest court decides another fifty cases without oral arguments general unanimously\nAnd they normally take cases where there's a conflict between the Thirteen circuits that is if the second circuit as a conflict with the sex or the night with the seven they'll take a case to resolve the conflict but just keeping your mind eighty cases a year they take for oral arguments eighty cases here\nBy contrast the U.S circuit court of appeals handled fifty one thousand eight hundred and thirty two cases in a twelve month spirit fifty one thousand eight hundred and thirty two compared to eighty\nSo if you throw on top of that the millions of cases and the lower district courts you're talking about maybe a million cases below the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court and handles eighty cases\nSo whether it's a hot button issues of immigration or gun control or or crime abortion whatever it might be\nThe the ... Ninety nine point nine nine nine percent of those cases are decided at the ... circuit her district court level Ninety nine above nine nine nine nine percent so to break it down even further there's Thirteen U.S Circuit court of appeals\nOf Thirteen eight are controlled by democratic appointed judges only four by Republican one district is split\nAnd so the most important one is the U.S court of appeals for the district of Columbia which is the one Brett Kavanaugh came off of the Democratic appointees there have a seven to three majority seven three one vacancy is now available but that can be one of the stray so it was gonna say seven to three\nSo Ninety nine point nine nine percent of the federal cases are resolved before the Supreme Court level\nAnd all those about Seventy percent are controlled by democratically appointed judges so before you get to fired up about Brett Kavanaugh I Want you to all those figures in your mind Supreme Court takes eighty cases the U.S circuit court of appeals handled fifty two thousand cases\nDistrict courts about a million and so the great majority of the action is well below the U.S Supreme Court even with Brett Kavanaugh they're the only hope we have is normal God fearing Americans as for Trump to be in office another six years\nAnd if he stays in office six more years what's a Republican Senate for all six years he may get as high as Fifteen Percent of those appointed by Republican judges so that is the mountain ahead of us don't get too high don't get too low\nSo what I'm saying is if Ninety nine point nine nine nine percent of the case it never gets U.S Supreme court\nAnd those that do generally deal with the conflicts whether Brett Kavanaugh Neil Gorsuch are there or not it's certainly a great thing encourage more of it but it would take years and years of Republicans controlling the Senate and Trump controlling\nThe White House or parents after Trump to make any dent and the fact that about Seventy percent of the federal judges or appointed by Democrats and only about thirty percent by the Republicans and the reason is the last two or three years of Bush forty three Chuck Schumer refused to do anything in the Senate\nDemocrats and only about thirty percent bother Republicans and the reason is the last two or three years of Bush forty three Chuck Schumer refused to do anything in the Senate has shut down completely and should two weeks from Tuesday the\nDemocrat to win the U.S Senate which appears to be a pill at this point but should that happen there's going to shut down again and they won't be any

Reno are saying that because I've been looking at al Jazeera English and they've been reporting from day one that us and tell us I don't know if they\nFail league that they had conversations with authority print and his entourage around their range and getting that doesn't guy though and if you look at recently I'm John Brennan the laugh test today and they said confirmed that the CIA operative so I think [noise]\nUm yeah we are complex and even though we didn't have involvement in the murder and we did not warn him and that's what a big issue in the bottom point\nOut on on that point do you believe al Jazeera any more than you believe CBS bliss\nWhy why do you rely on al Jazeera which is an arm of the extreme Muslim Palestinian Authority why do you believe al Jazeera how to cut her why do you believe them I wouldn't believe one word they said\nOkay I hear what you're saying but whether they're right there at the end of the thing\nAbout twenty four seven you fail the factual information and doing a report from ... book the cloud though I don't\nHave no heroism against them because they're they're on the ground there there when the member blowout you cannot get what you see what your own eyes are going\nTo hold on Cape assuming things happen and and I certainly except that they're true his not not nearly as bad as a few hundred Americans killed every year by legal aliens how come we're focusing on that awful murder and not what's happening inside of our own\nCountry because red Fox articles and from what I voted for case planet down he's trying to change the narrative\nCars\nThat when I'm Jeff Jeff came out that the Saudis five hundred dollars worth of weapons that they bought it from the\nGreat what a lot of people that worked in a cave\nThere's ten thousand Americans killed every year inside of America do care about any of them went to investigate cage timely once investigated about seven hundred murders who is outside of Chicago not sold some don't invest in those murders but they don't fit the political diatribe against Trump right\nNo I'm actually I'm not sure that that's the corruption other media whenever we investigate some but not just like so I just got killed about an hour ago and Kurdish hiking I Will not require that in the U.S when you talk about one hundred and fifty percent on your side we just need to get\nWhat to say how come a murder of Assad citizen in Turkey is such a big deal here why\nBecause when man complicit with bamboo knocked on the planes that were not complicit with crap we're not complicit with anything come on man come on we're not come\nHere you are you one of those characters whatever bad\nHappens in the world America's complicit what the hell does that mean complicit what does that mean how stupid it was it for the sides to kill them in that fashion almost on videotape that was stupid that was real stupid and I hope we're not stupid but even if\nIt happened the way we think it happened\nFrankly my dear I don't give a damn compared to what's happening in this country every year how many times are killed two hundred times or murdered every year in this country there's CNN go into the murder of police officers and why that's a horrible thing how can CNN will not cover the murder cops but they're covering some side citizen in Turkey why\nI totally agree with you just like we have three hundred and Seventy five thousand horses every year I don't you I'm totally rich you\nKnow big deal and what they're just using this as a country will there be trumping the head with his if we care and I don't care compared to the murder of cops\nThe murder of the innocence ten thousand murders cage timely hundreds of Americans killed by legal aliens rapes and robberies how about investing in those things that make sense\nIt makes the weight while still investigating the Saudis are blowing up innocent children and that's very good for us made weapons saying we're not going to investigate that don't work and\nYou you mean in Yemen\nAnd that's what you may say that don't work and\nYou you mean in Yemen\nBug just got killed this guy and he has weapons with Saudi Arabia\nOr wait a minute hey they're saying we're complicit in that too because we sold a weapon as somebody Smith Wesson complicit in one of their weapons kill somebody\nThey know they're not coming up the\nBombing of course country in the middle east what weapons\nComplex than in any of that sporadic complicit of one of their weapons is used the wrong fully kill somebody sporadic complicit [noise]\nA lot of money is the root of all evil\nBad case here out of here thanks for your call hope the Dodgers lose this afternoon but let's continue is more aware of let's go to Chris in Atlanta Georgia Chris in Atlanta Welcome to the ... show and Chris please go ahead Chris how are you how are you great day to being an American please go ahead\nAmen to that so just a quick question you mentioned earlier about um I I don't I Can't paraphrase but you said about the pope specifically about him in\nA crisis or what have you on earth would you have a problem with that many but Michael Moore hell yeah okay well I mean just just I mean I'm just some sort of playing devil's advocate with us so [noise] um because I have an issue with it too but\nUm if if we believe 'cause I'm I'm Catholic so I Believe him being the vicar cries justice Christ man with with centers um [noise] what what is your what is your\nTown and I agree with that to Chris but the difficulty I don't think Michael Moore went there to get the pope on video talking to him as if he was a center wanting to be confessing to Henry saving grace from the pope I think Michael Moore went there has this huge to capture the pope\nIn a moment that he could use for his own political purposes against Trump and if Michael Moore is that some ... sources like\nPaul and the road to Damascus and said okay I've seen the era my waves I've seen the damage that cause the police officers in American Soldiers I see the damages caused by three thousand innocent babies killed every day in this country and I'm going to the pope for forgiveness for what I've done I'm with you\nBut I think Michael Moore probably went there with the pope today in order to get a photo op to use politically against him that's what I think\nI I I agree with you with that now that just actor I said do you not feel that um maybe he'd already knows the Michael Moore is maybe a personal agenda background um\nWell you know Chris a pope is given interviews which he says he does not read newspapers and it's not watch TV and he came from Argentina now in Rome\nAnd we'd like to think in America we're the only country that matters but I guess if you spend your life in Argentina Brazil and Central America South America and now you live in Rome you probably don't read newspapers or watch TV count how would you know Michael Morris and so I you know I guess I could work my way to the front of the line and get a picture with the pope\nBut I Would like to think that Michael Moore is not one of those characters and pope would be familiar with and if he was I Would hope Michael Moore was there to convince to confess as many sense\nSure not absolutely I I think the pope knows more about people and maybe get credit for\nUm just 'cause I I there there's a little bit about him that strikes me as odd and um you know I like to be supportive of the pope a follower of Catholicism however there's there are there are a lot of things that that really struck me about him and that's to me it's not it's not surprising when when\nHe has left us into I mean there is this is fairly harsh\nThan no question he's he's not the last pope now he's not Benedict he's France's and he's a socialist he's left wing er and er\nAnd this whole uh previously scandal or something that I Hope it's not up to his eyeballs in it from uh South America and I hope he's clean but do what he did was make care and what he did with world didn't excite me too much and um\nAnd I I just hope there is no there there were Chris we gotta go thanks for your call

New York city or the cops in Dallas in Baton Rouge advocate the murder welcome to the White House a group that advocates the killing of cops advocate get them into the White House get the pictures taken with the president\n[laughter] how's that possible so when the media obsesses over Jamal could show ... it's done not because his life had more value that officers rained most in lieu\nWhen the mania obsesses over Jamal could choking it's done not because his life had more value that officers rained most in lieu\nIt's done because they can use that as the question is America complicit did the sides by some condominiums from Trump\nDecides go to a hotel near the White House to get Trump money it's all this crap in their heads losing out horse manure coming out of their ears as if this murder has so much more important than the unsolved murder of police officers inside of America\nAnd it's sick and see photos continuous more as we continue [noise] my producer rich cement is going to play the interview I had with the president a couple of days ago about national international issues and mow the lawn becomes available eight seven seven three one three a one one\nSmell when I'm cooking field counting end the great American and for the great when he was living\nHow can we take from the United states\nSo the European Union they formed and they uh they're very unfair to us they have barriers where we can sell into their into into their countries\nThey have tremendous tariffs that make it impossible\nAnd yet they still Mercedes Benz and BMWs by the millions they come in there and it ends and we charge him essentially no tax it's two and a half percent but for the most part they don't even know liked it\nSo we charge them virtually nothing and they send millions and millions of cars if we want to send a a piece of grain okay if we want to send a piece of grain we can't do it and to the European Union so it's unfair uh we met with them I told them I'm going to start\nTaxing because because Obama they wouldn't even talk to them right they said we're very happy the way we are and that's that was that Obama just went away and then ah with us I said look we want to talk I didn't hear from I said we want to talk I didn't hear third time I said listen we're not call me back but\nI'm going to give you one more chance and it has said that's okay I'm going to tax the cars at twenty five percent coming in which is frankly more money right it's devastating to them but it's more money and they immediately have to plan and came over and talk to and now they want to make a deal I I don't know that we're going to make a deal with him I can tell you they want to sure but we're going to make it one way or the rebuilding\nWhereby hundred billion a year five trillion over ten we've built Shanghai we felt Beijing at some point we got to start building America they got the new airport we don't have the new airports they got the new bridges we don't have the bridges at some point in our money's got to come back to America\nYou're so right so China's been taken out of five hundred billion dollars you know people have no idea what that is five hundred billion we have rebuilt China can't do it and I have a very good relationship with President Xi but I said we can't do it very simple we can't do it anymore we're not going to do it anymore\nSo we've put on two hundred and fifty billion dollars worth of tariffs\nAnd by the way there's been no impact has been fact not what people don't say is that we're taking in billions of dollars in our treasury because there's a twenty five percent\nSo it will take it in billions of dollars and we have we're going to create jobs now some of these things that we're not buying from China or they become expensive because of the terrorists they're going to start building these plants here to make the product here which is the old fashioned way that's the way we used to do it so China\nHas been look China's the biggest of them all by far it's probably sixty percent of our trade lost we lost over the last few years an average of eight hundred billion dollars a year on trade ... with everybody those days are over the\nLast ... wherever the midterms coming up one of my favorite movies is Jimmy Stewart and it's a wonderful life I look at Bedford Falls below sea takes the house humor takes the Senate here like becomes miserable the last two years what do you say the middle class Americans all over the country that say you know what\nWe don't want Bedford Falls away it looks we want the New Bedford falls what do you say to those who say the midterms relax take it easy not important Renee see whether it's black burner Heller we don't have to worry about that what do you say to motivate the base\nWell I Hope we're nation is going to do well first of all he's a great guy but I I just say just country what just forget it ...\nYou have to go out and vote my poll numbers are so good but a lot of people say I'm not running so we're not going to vote one percent Rasmussen fit and we know we're doing great and and then they say you can add a lot to it because what people hang up and they say we don't want to talk to you that means it's a Trump voter I don't know if that's good or bad but that's what it means a we have to\nDo well I Will say I think we're going to do very well on the Senate that a lot of things have happened since justice now justice cabin on Fifteen which I was at her Fifteen new judge many many judges\nAnd we're going to have a hundred and forty five judges fairly soon when you think about it I mean a hundred and forty five it will be close to fifty percent of the whole judiciary not only to Supreme Court justices so\nBut that was a very big thing happened over the last couple of weeks with justice cabin or because I've rarely\nYou're just you're not only to Supreme Court justices so but that was a very big thing happened over the last couple of weeks with justice Kevin or because\nI've rarely seen a person treated so badly the man of great distinction a great life and the way they treated him was horrible and since that happened Republicans are looking so is everybody they see what's going\nOn under the law of unintended consequences because I've had many women were spurred my air ville I with Kevin they don't want to say publicly but if you said in a weird sense Kevin all as motivated the Republican base or otherwise it wouldn't have happened been a great\nFriend of mine and I appreciate it give it a very terrific guy it's also a terrific talent you know a lot of people can't do what you do you know this is talk well there's Russian about a ... not too many and Sean is you know showing it was great\nBut these are great people and great talents and I appreciate it do we have to do well I think we're going to do well in the Senate I think we could pick up some seats in the Senate and the polls if you look three weeks ago and you look now\nIt's like especially black or for his shoes on planes down now she's four or five points up Marcia from Tennessee that\nAlmost all of them\nNow I don't know how you doing here I Know it's a tough race but uh it's unfortunate because he's such a good\nMan I mean I don't know Sherrod Brown is a socialist but you know he sees us a lot of Trump voters are voting for sure what he's going around and a lot of people think he's my best friend and the world the ads are like Trump pads he talks about you know it's amazing except there's only during this period of time at six weeks after it's over so it's one of those things but\nI Hope it does well and uh\nI Hope that Steve does well I think he's doing well for example to when I hear is doing so I think that's very important and I'm here for him\nBut I just want to thank you for everything you've done and and hopefully people are going to realize that just a very important election Mitt terms I think frankly I think people are viewing this is very important or usually midterms are like sleepers people that they are energized and for those that say that the\nThat the blue is energy as manning the Democrats and we're not ... I think well I personally I think we're more energized you're not going to believe the energy but we had it in Erie, Pennsylvania the other night with twenty five thousand people outside of a twelve thousand them around and it's been amazing\nAnd if that kind of you know action shows up\nIn three weeks and you imagine it's just a little more than three we got the energy\nFor the next three weeks because you're like Elvis lower\nBut you could only move this big equipment so often Renee and Secret Service and all of that but they were very very busy and we're going to the races that are close or slightly ahead or slightly behind and we'll make it a lot of stops because\nThe president you're the best you're a great American out all the time you but you're a great America keep doing what you're doing for the voices you don't hear in the face as you don't see those people you're the hero I was with Reagan an eighty four when he came here I thought Reagan was a star he was the Rolling Stones or the Vidocq Society here on the Ed Sullivan show I'm Serious about\nBut I really do appreciate your support for just such an important voice and you've been with us and uh\nThen I'll just say hello to all you've paid a lot of them are a great America thank you thank you very much for thank you\nNot only counting them as the president thank you very much I'm sure we'll do it again I'm very honored to have you an office and we're so much better off than we would have been of Hillary Clinton and one so it's getting tenure with more built counting and the great American in for the great one mark Levin\nHim Washington Mall W.
