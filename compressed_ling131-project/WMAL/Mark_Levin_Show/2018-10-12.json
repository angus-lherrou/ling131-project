MSNBC not just Kanye West not just an assault on our White House now when when Bill Clinton was getting or ... turn in the oval office ... that was not an assault on our White House\nOh we're not a

between the residents Kanye West your browser by the way it was said or blacks really like to get caught up in the idea of racism over the idea of industry is comment to a white police brutality is to release the love\nAnd he said that there should be in Chicago easy id Asian centers that's for\nMe which is a man named think of his or Adidas sneakers he said that the law that sentiment is what

and to find a scale morality uh I think you're dealing with some very amoral individuals I Would say that if we're talking about the scale of one to tend the folks that you are dealing with probably starting out around the a three and so I don't like your chances of ever getting very far with those folks but uh hey uh you know if for now\nWe're going to try to find those folks who are at least at least you know five six is on our overall sliding scale morality by the way if you missed it at the onto the show it's kind of my theme that I'm tying things into today\nI like to say there are two sides to stories one side effects and you have the premise of the premise of anything is faltering thing built upon it will fail to but they're also it was a sliding scale of morality and so we're on it\nWe exist and where we're at or best maybe we're good people when we're at our worst maybe we're not quite as good but the differences are we've somebody who will end up hurting others what we see in today's world we got a lot of folks that are willing to hurt others so we have a whole political party right now that is willing to do that as well and\nA lot of that happen through misinformation\nSo let's talk about\nThe employment situation again for a second record low unemployment for minorities\nBlack unemployment rate at all time lapse\nAnd somewhere along the way you have Donald Trump that brings out the best and many of these minority communities you have somebody who actually sat down with Kim ... which many of us were skeptical about at the onset and something constructive came out of it\nNow you have gone yet west who goes into the oval office and\nSomething constructive might come out of it\nBut more to the point the more open minds we have in this country the better the employment picture for minorities the more opportunity not only politically that comes with it\nBut the better the opportunity for the entire country open minds\nEqual better opportunities and a better chance for a more moral nation because if we had here to pull politics and the people that start out on that sliding scale of morality from a really negative place\nWhere are we going to be taken for the people who wanted to believe for example Christine Ford and Chuck Schumer who said he believed her Dianne Feinstein who believes her people believe them\nSo you had people that started out in that sliding scale morality and an amoral place\nAnd have taken their politics and those folks left with though\nThat's not good Donald Trump taken whole minority communities including black adults women Hispanics\nEven Native Americans to new heights economically that they had never seen before bats that shade and change it and that's the difference and that's the irony of Donald Trump who in his own personal life maybe not the most moral man fine and the grand scheme of sliding scale morality\nOne politician has kept more promises inside of two years than Batman that always told me that there are two kinds of people you got people who will tell you something and you can't believe it and you got people who will tell you something and you can take it to the bank\nWhen Donald Trump says something you can pretty much take it to the bank I'm Brian mud in for the gray one\nWashington Mall W.

going you know what the president said I can speak for many time ... that could be entertaining and has a ...\nWe'll see where that story ends now a a story that I\nCan't believe it is still being discussed one that has been long perpetuated as a fraud not as significant as the Medicare fraud the Medicare for all idea that we were just talking about the minimum wage\nThe the greatest fraud perpetuated over decades of time has been the need for the minimum wage to be maintained by your federal government now recently we had the Amazon dot com increased to Fifteen dollars per hour which in and of itself and don't get me wrong\nAmazon they built to a better mouse trap but I mean the puck proceed on talking about the ... the on the left and knows no bounds remember a once upon a time\nWal Mart was the greatest have full in the country because they were coming to your neighborhood and and killing ... they were taking them out there taking their businesses and then they were putting a bunch of people on yes minimum wage right a plus a Walmart\nThere from uh from Republican place aren't they have their those people so I mean for all those reasons I mean Wal Mart was just a evil\nBut here you go you've got a you've got Amazon dot com they happen to be brighter than three times the size of Wal Mart yes yes the Amazon is three hundred percent the size and market capitalization of Walmart and loved by the left\nBut again you know I I began begrudge them nothing happened to be a capitalist they built the better mouse trap\nBut anyway I digress so Amazon goes to Fifteen dollars per hour and then you hear the the folks go\nEverybody should take Amazon model now I Will point out some of the obvious here\nFor people actually understand economics there are many other businesses that operate in retail which happens to be a low margin business there are getting crushed by Amazon study ironically enough are going to have a harder time increasing wages because Amazon at their size scale and ability to deliver the way they're delivering\nOn that they are killing their profits or take a look at any number of you'll retail companies that you grew up with that are dead and dying as we speak now\nThan not withstanding\nThe number of people that actually earned minimum wage I went back and actually check my research on this and\nIronically enough the last time it was a really big issue it kinda like coming off the Occupy crowd and the twenty fourteen mid term elections I happen to be about four years ago that we had the debate minimum wage conversation and hey you know what are the folks in the country had a point because they did kind of ...\nYou know for eight years of Obama we average one point eight percent economic growth\nWe never even got close to an average US Economy so yeah okay fine\nEven then what percentage of people earned\nMinimum wage yeah number in your head\nHow many people back in twenty fourteen you think earned minimum wage or any one point eight percent even ... Obama's economy it was only one point eight percent what's more is the average age of somebody who earned minimum wage happened to be twenty two and a half but it'd be working part time\nJob I mean you know that the people that were heads of households that were you know trying to raise a family and uh you know they needed a living wage right\nBut that was him and we got the best economy and a generation we've got the lowest unemployment rate in forty nine years weve got record low unemployment rates for everybody but pretty much why the white people\nAnd how many people actually earned the minimum wage\nYou're ready according to the bureau of Labor Statistics point six percent point six percent that zero zero point six percent now what's the horrors that Ninety nine percent\nOf those people be point six percent are under the age of twenty five\nAnd what happened as soon as Amazon raise those wages we got the minimum wage\nCome up again I'm One of the great frauds perpetuated that's out there is still living wage is funny what actually happened a good economy economics Amazon dot com props prospering and they had the financial wherewithal to be able to increase wages\nJust like what we're seeing because here's another little factoid oh by the way\nWe take a look at the average amount of money that a person can not only our we finally\nOh by the way we take a look at the average amount of money that a person's banking not only are we finally\nJust about a three percent towards the wage growth by the time you Adam bonus just goes over that by the time you add in your tax cuts churns out to be about another Eighteen hundred bucks for the average person working this year is what\nThe average net take home pay now a six point seven percent year over year you have to go back thirty two years to find the last time your income growth\nThat good [noise]\nFunny what happens we actually have a good economy you want to let me ... and the minimum wage\nIt's just a bunch of BS\nMedicare for all\nSuicides authorities one set of facts will continue to do a lot more\nFactual stuff right here I Am Brian ... and for the great one Marshall that\nThe share buybacks right is horrible shareholders of what you probably are one\nActually the employees get this hoarding to the CFO council CNBC is now thirty five percent thirty five percent\nOf all tax cuts savings has gone through a combination of bonuses and employ you raise is\nThirty five percent twenty percent has gone to a debt reduction which makes sense we've seen interest rates rise companies that have dead they should pay it off that helps the company become more stable essence their debt burden with rights rising\nFifteen Percent Fifteen Percent on share buybacks ten percent upgrading software five percent upgrading ... uh upgrading equipment and five percent have increased evidence to all in the combination of sheer about buybacks in David in payouts twenty percent that's it\nAnd even then you probably benefit because once again something that is not perpetuated informational lead by our friends and media generally\nFifty two percent of Americans own stocks and by the way despite the volatility of the past few days way with the greatest wealth creation machine the history of the world is your United States stock market so I don't apologize for that anyway but the biggest beneficiary is you\nEmploy but [noise] you know\nI I guess conveniently bad bet message has just been missed I Am sure that any day now it's going to be a big story that will be reported on\nAnd again CNBC they're the ones with that story interesting how even NBC what other news outlets hasn't decided to actually run with their own story from their own CFO council\nOne of these days I'm sure it's just oversight All right let's go to Ross in South Dakota Russ go\nProbably doing all good\n[laughter] I see it as kind of a two part problem really I mean you get a single payer healthcare system and you're going to basically just keep these big hospital in the smaller ones they're not going to survive you know they're not going to make the money that these bigger wants to make it out there because they can't cut the costs that the government wants to cut them down to for\nA lot of this stuff that the first part I see\nThe second part I see is we need to adjust something in the hospitals do you know what it costs the manufacture of one thousand feet of sea bag of fluids\nI Would think not much I'm guessing you know\nA dollar I Do research for my call just to make sure I had the numbers right and you know what they charge you for it in the hospital\nAnd a lot more memory hundred dollars\nAnd and so Ross and I appreciate the ... you have a in a a good point by day a couple of things in it that we should discuss when we're talking about insurance generally the biggest problem and affordability and health care is health insurance\nProblem is we have been raised the idea that health insurance equals health care\nThat's not the case one of the more remarkable statistics in the wake of Obamacare\nHas been the lack of people that can afford health care with health insurance is was according to the Kaiser Family foundation hardly a conservative organization base still to this day are proponents of Obamacare I mean after all the kind of have a vested interest\nBut here's what they found in their research there are forty two million Americans forty two million have health insurance they can't afford healthcare you think about that for a moment\nThe average health insurance plan eighty five hundred dollars now if you don't pay all that it might be because your employer sponsoring it but that's the only the average cost of health insurance right now\nSo would you be better off if you had\nYou are sponsoring it but that's the only the average cost of health insurance right now so would you be better off if you had eighty five hundred dollars you could use on health care or when you'd be better off if eighty five hundred dollars went for health insurance\nAnd then after that you got to see how much you had to pay out of pocket before you hit a deductible which often happens to be a high deductible plan which that and you can't hit which is why people can't afford healthcare it's all part of the financial fraud so the number one way\nTo get to more affordable health care is to break the back of the insurance first model having embrace it was the first thing that we did that was a big time mistake\nOnce you do that you are going to get to the crux of what you were talking about there which is consumer price transparency but most back crap crazy thing I'd ever seen in my life\nIs walking into a medical facility being handed a piece of paper that says in so many words that whatever happens in that facility\nWhich you have no clue and generally yet what that's going to be in whatever it happens to cost which they generally can't even tell you\nAnd whatever your insurance company doesn't pay for which they also can tell you you'll pay for\nHow crazy is that you will Magid walking into a store building a car with stuff not having a clue what any of it costs and signing that piece of paper that says some point later we're going to tell you how much you're going to pay us for this is back\nCrazy but that's what we have with our insurance first model right now\nSo you break the back of it we get to weigh the way we use the sure it's for everything else in her life how was that well what we do if we have a mechanical problem with our car well we we do pay and have it fixed\nIf we get in a big time accident we fall on insurance claim or already at the point with health insurance to where it's essentially catastrophic care for tens of millions of Americans right can't afford to use health care the rest of the time\nOkay so why don't we go to that place to where we use health insurance as a catastrophic plan which by the way is what the president's new plans the ones that are called skinny and bad plans and but the Democrats are are sitting there you know what I'm saying it's the worst thing that's essentially what they are is catastrophic care\nWhich is cheaper and better for people who otherwise wouldn't be able to afford to use the other more expensive policies anyway\nBut at that point you're able to do what you're able to be a consumer we are incredibly good consumers when we have an opportunity to shop oh we got to find the best deal in the world on MTV or whatever else it is will sit there and we'll take a look at best deal boom done\nBut was health care we never have a shot we never have a shot at doing it on the things I Do somewhat routinely I'll take a look anytime we have research that will show the cost of a procedure from one place to the next\nUm I had a I had a minor surgery years ago that had I gone through my insurance would have cost a thousand bucks\nDecided to shop around\nPaid cash and it was five hundred dollars down to the point there\nWe never know because we sign pieces of paper those as something's gonna happen here and we'll pay you for whatever the insurance company doesn't so they'd be if you really want to get to the crux of it not only is Medicare for all financial fraud but frankly the\nBiggest lie of Obamacare is not the you know it's going to be cheaper and you can keep your doctor and all that\nIs that insurance equals healthcare insurance doesn't equal healthcare insurance is the antithesis of healthcare for tens of millions of Americans will continue the
