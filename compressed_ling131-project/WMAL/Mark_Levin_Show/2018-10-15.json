N. A. L. Washington comes to talk\nToday you\nBack again now with our special show that\nAll about getting into real estate investing in a\nYoung age building wealth and income along the way [noise] so what if you're interested in real estate investor\nTo ask someone who specializes in exactly the guiding people through the process of becoming a bona fide real estate investor joining us\nNow is Christopher clerk real tour and investment specialist with century Twenty one signature real estate in Des Moines Iowa\n... is a national dirty under thirty on hurry and is currently serving as any ours commercial and business specialties liaison for president Elizabeth mend and whole course welcome back to real estate today\nThanks so much for having me back\nWe are so glad you're here so of course the first of all how business\nIt's fantastic business is always good that's all I can\nSay that's wonderful so Christa your now thirty three years old twelve years ago you bought your first investment property\nBut I Know that even though you are a real estate investor your heart is really with your clients helping them grow a portfolio that will generate income and wealth overtime\nAbsolutely absolutely I you know I was lucky enough to have that opportunity tend to be an aid and getting that opportunity the other is really why is that for me\nOf course when you are young real estate investor get started first of all how young is young who is your youngest investor ever\nYou know what I actually had a young kid from my home town actually that bought\nHis first home which actually wasn't investment because they needed some work it was a foreclosure that he had found and he was willing to put to work at it and he had just graduated high school so he was Eighteen so\nYes I think he bought the property and like June and he had just graduated in may and parents help them you know with a little bit of a down here because it was not that they would be financed graphic gay or anything like that\nBut he got the financing on it though and he held a job through high school that show that good enough income to cover the payment and it was crazy by far the youngest\nThat is awesome and so when people come to you and they're very young and they say I Want to invest in real estate what did they tell you about the reasons why\nHonestly most young investors are looking to build a stable future which I think it's so encouraging right now because I you know our generation is is really good at only wanting to do the things that they find fun and so I Love the fact that they actually\nEat you know investing in real estate of it and then ... ... ... and the hard work themselves as something that's a fun activity for them so I it's really encouraging me\nTo want to invest in real estate and by my very first property am I going to need you know a great credit be really solid reserves like money in the bank and be a really high income or not so much\nWell you know obviously life an easier one of those things are are there but it's certainly not something that should stop you from investing actually you know one of my my biggest investors I've been working with that that first got my licence eleven years now he's built a very impressive feat got\nHundreds of units across the state of Iowa a little bit you know across the border and Illinois and the guy and he bought his very first property on contract he ended up buying the property on contract from a landlord that was just tired of having to every model every time it can it without\nYou know you're paying your carpet things like that plan to rent it out and then felt like you know I put all of this however is good I think as ...\nThey are to having to every model every time they had it without you know you're paying your carpet things like that plan to rent it out and then felt like you know but all of this however good I think that's how we try to sell it and you know it's sold right away so that's where he got his\nVery first and that's a good start going so he by his very first event that property on contract with I think if I remember right it was something like\nThree or four thousand dollar down with the owner financing situation and you just built from there so it's crazy what you can do it a little bit of resourcefulness\nThat is awesome and among your clients are a lot of them young\nI was saying that you know I feel pretty diverse client base which I'm very proud of it at this point\nBut a lot of money that they're that the one that I was just telling you about that I've been working with for over eleven years you know he had been investing in the ... in his\nEarly twenties he's now forty nine and ... built something that and I can do that or forty nine young especially that he felt he felt and you know he started in their early twenties and he had the ... so I think good chunk of mine that they're they're definitely what I think they're young\nSo let's look at the big picture a person comes to you in their twenties and they start investing in real estate tell me how is that going to change their life as the years pass\nI'm sure you've heard that the million times and I and they get right contacts on on the show here but the wind beautiful thing about real estate and you make or lose money only one yourself so if you can buy into something early if you can start building that portfolio of rental especially and how you're paying your mortgage for you and building equity for you\nIf you can do that at a young age this guy's a limit on what you can do because that person that said that second it back to that third in the back but it's something that you can continuously snowball and room in the down payment option for a bigger and that's and then you just keep going and it grow exponentially in a way that you would never imagine on paper\nThat is great advice will ... I really appreciate you coming on the show today in talking about investing in real estate at a young age thank you\nAbsolutely thanks for having me anytime\nYou're very welcome Christopher clerk real tour and investment specialist with century Twenty one signature real estate in Des Moines Iowa\nOf course is a recipient of any ours thirty under thirty award and she's currently serving as liaison for president Elizabeth men and haul it in a are for commercial and business specialties and of course Chris to herself is a real estate investor in America's Heartland\nComing up on real estate today staying on track when you were building well\nWe have to set up barriers that prevent us from advertising are financial success that's\nOn our special show for life\nWashington comes to talk but first it's time for our smart home technology report\nWe're going to look at some fascinating trends involving smart speakers you\nKnow you might not have an Amazon Echo or the Google Home where the apple home pot but according to an article on slate the data suggests that some day you might\nBe side of the survey from adobe which says in January of this year Eighteen percent of American households owned some type of smart speaker\nPut it in the months since then that number has jumped exponentially and now thirty two percent of American households have a smart speaker nearly a third of all American homes and by the end of this year it's estimated that half the homes in America will have a smart speaker\nAnd forty percent of those we'll have more than one [noise]\nSo what everyone doing with their echo their Google Home or their apple home part\nOver that there were some really interesting and surprising results\nOkay the number one activity that American Jews with their smart speaker at home according to a survey from Nielsen Ninety percent of the people were smart speakers use them to stream music and or a spot by Google music Amazon Music or apple music\nNext up eighty one percent report using their smart speaker to get real time information traffic and whether\nNext according to Nielsen Seventy five percent use them to get factual information like trivia or history and sixty eight percent use them to listen to the news but in a tie with news and this is fascinating sixty eight percent also say they use their smart speakers\nFor something completely different they're using them to have fun just to have fun hey Google tell me a joke\nWhy did the pilot ladder during our profile to reach the high no\nI did the pilot ladder during our final to reach the high notes [noise]\nIt's so true we're all paying for something that we really don't need a we're not using the gym memberships lacking in subscriptions when you're not reading them they're all kinds of things that companies are smart and he said they're moving over to subscription models\nBecause they know we tend to forget that we're paying for these services or even what we're not using them to reevaluate what you're paying for cut back on the things that you're not using\nWonderful and the last one on that list plan your meals\nYeah this may sound kind of basic but we really can tend to overpay for not only food the dining out when we just don't have a plan for our meals and so I'm a big believer in thinking about it on a weekly basis making sure that you've got enough to make multiple meal\nSo to save time if you make a lot of once and then maybe put it in the freezer and make a lunch at the time and that you can prepare ahead of time it's probably going to have you money and definitely going to take your time so it just went one way to simplify your life so that you can focus on the big things big wins in your life\nGreat advice Laura and you know following you on Twitter is a great experience because sometimes you are presenting articles that you have written but if you see something interesting that has to do with personal finance you pulled out right into two of one of our listeners would like to join in its\nAct Laura Adams on Twitter correct that or I really appreciate your coming on the show today I'm Talking about how them find your life can save you time and money thank you thanks so much for having me you're very welcome more Adams host of the top rated money girl podcasts\nComing up on real estate today keeping your property as valuable as possible with\nRegular maintenance as they come out in the fall and they check your furnace they come back out on the spring of check your air conditioners that's next on our special show that more\nWashington Mall W.

inspectors ... is the oldest and most respected non profit professional organization of home inspectors in North America and has more than eight thousand members Tim welcome to real estate today\nThank you glad to be here we're delighted to hear So Tim here we are getting into the fall season what should I Do first if I Want to make sure that my home is in tip top shape\nFirst thing I Would do is check your gutters and down stops because the biggest issue with the homeless water and in the fall the gutters get clogged up with leaves and other debris and need to make sure you keep those ... down spouts clean so the water gets removed away from the house you don't have any moisture intrusion\nYou know that's a really good point okay so the gutters and down spouse bats where to start now what about the windows and doors what am I looking for their Tam\nWhat do you want to make sure your windows and doors or car concealed properly so the cold air doesn't get into the house [noise] make sure your windows function\nA lot of times people leave their screens in the windows and wake up people take your screens out storm for the winter because the ice and snow and sleet and hard cold weather can really take its toll on screen so we suggest people to take their screens out\nSame thing with screen door's take your screen door screen out and put in your storm door\nSo what about the roof now how can I really know if my roof is in trouble or not what do I need a pair of binoculars\nAnd you could use that that's true but I Would recommend contracting a qualified roofing contractor and have them come out and inspect your rough they can let you know if there's any damage shingles they can also let you know how long you refer last what the estimated life as but again that's another place of water can get into the home\nThat's absolutely right now a lot of us think about getting the air conditioning system service before summer but is that another area that you should have inspected prior to the winner\nAbsolutely a lot of HVAC contractors have maintenance contracts for they charge you a nominal fee\nIf you have both of those checked and so what they do is they come out in the fall and they check your furnace and they come back out in the spring and check your air conditioner so that's a good thing to do every year and again it's a big safety issue\nAnd make sure that friend is functioning properly it efficiently also helps to reduce your heating bills gas or electric\nInteresting another area in the house that I Know is really important especially in the cold weather months is the insulation but Kim how does a homeowner inspect back\nSometimes that's difficult to ... in the walls but at the addict people can get up there and they can now measure the insulation see how much they have in specific areas of the country\nMore insulation or less insulation so if you're up in Minnesota or main you probably have more insulation and the addict than you would\nMaybe in in Washington DC Virginia where the Carolinas because they don't get the cold weather like they do in the north so I Would strongly recommend having an installation contractor come out and expect that have all the investments you can make an insulation is one of the best\nBecause even though you spend dollars it's already know how you will get that back in lower air conditioning and heating bells\nInteresting Tim obviously are shows on all over the United states some parts of the states are going to be warm and sunny all winter long well of course others\nBe covered with snow so are these fall prep strategies appropriate for your house no matter where it is\nAbsolutely fall if you're in a southern climate South Florida Arizona you may want to have your air conditioner checked again because during the summer months it really works hard almost twenty four seven so it's best to do that\nAre both in the spring and fall and and these warm weather climate by having your furnace center air conditioners service in the fall or the winter no matter where you live I can see the homeowner money on it\nAnd these warm weather climate by having your furniture center air conditioners service during the fall or the winter so matter where you live a chicken or motor money on their utility bills\nThat's very interesting because in the southern states people are going into a season in which they're going to continue to need their air conditioning even after\nRunning all year\nDown that scary right right right in the outset trans Allegheny lunatic asylum

rich are not paying their fair share their pain and unfair share\nThey're paying too much\nSake and everybody should say it\n\nTop one percent of earners pay seven percentage points more of the income tax load and the\nBottom Ninety wiped out how is it fair share if that's not you know what I'm ... there's more of a isn't just that\nThere's more of these comparisons in this this isn't\nBloomberg peace again not or something right\nWing website here I mean your son and a negative way but I'm sure the liberals listening will be like nah you got that from uh some right wing slanted website there there was just trying to manipulate the fact this is from ... okay the top one percent pay thirty\nWing slanted website there there was just trying to manipulate the fact this is from ...\nOkay the top one percent pay thirty seven cents of every thirty seven percent of the ... the bottom line the only pay thirty\nWhy is it is so sensitive to make us liberals are frauds they keep talking about this fair share some as John Kerry doctors boat in Rhode Island to avoid paying taxes what if we had Al Sharpton is tax debacle we're ... or you know Bernie Sanders what do we find out he pays less than twenty percent of his income in taxes\nTo lead by example lead by example if you believe in what you're saying see there's no hypocrisy here for Republicans we think taxes suck because we think outside of our military\nAnd our courts you flush somebody down the toilet bowl you don't know anything about the economy and you waste it which you prove us right all the time\nWe would rather donate it to charity and let the free market and an charities handle it who can actually help people locally but no you suck up all our money you get a big tidy bowl flush and you flush it down to ... and I'm Glad we got a president who doesn't accept this premise at all\nFair share no no they don't they already paid to us cut their taxes let them put their money to work in the economy grow jobs in the economy yeah why do you like them apples how do they taste\n\nI got some more numbers we may be asked where does this come from well obviously I'm Talking about the authenticity component with Trump didn't apologize but if I can be candid with you folks for a moment [noise]\nThis is the first year in my life that my wife and I really have done well um my show the book things just did well they did thanks to a lot of ... by the way things just said well I mean they'll need to go into the details [noise]\nTalking to my account and I was absolutely floored I could really couldn't believe it when we found out how much money the government\nI was astonished I really was that will be fine I mean we you know we keep money aside to pay for we don't we don't live a frugal lifestyle at all I mean excuse me a spendthrift lifestyle the opposite we actually kinda cheap or anything but we just that we work a lot so we don't get to go out [noise]\nI'm telling you I was floored I thought he had a decimal point wrong\n\nAnd I play it straight you know because I I'm like you know a lot of liberals like John Kerry report their boats in Rhode Island play straight so whatever my bill is I don't like the law change it but if the law steaks you still got I got to pay\nAnd I was floored this is the first time my life I thought to myself\nI'm Serious folks and my wife is probably going to kill me for talking about this but it's okay I made it because I think this needs to get out there I grew up at the low end at best the middle class and I'm being generous 'cause I'm not I'm not a sob story\nThe low end of middle class at best okay like at one point the bologna for dinner kind of you know what I'm ... years they weren't getting other middle class like yeah we believe me steak was not it was a hot commodity mind when it was it was ... we were not eating rabbis okay McDonald's was like the restaurant to go to\n\nI worked my butt off where there was that the police department and the cemetery in the supermarket and the secret service and you finally get to a point in your life and for the first time you make what could be legitimately life changing amount of money right and you want to do so many things I'm telling you we had so many ideas and some of them were so\nYeah I mean we're going to be able to do I don't want to be traumatic about this [noise] but you think to yourself\nI got to give it to these guys these idiots in D.C to do was to do with these\n... are you serious to do what I don't mind if I can I Swear to you on my life the constitutional role of government I military guys take my money [laughter] is\nWe need courts I get it that's why we have a constitution but you weren't flushing your money down the toilet bowl the people who have no idea what to do with it\nWe need we ... we need seriously some constitutional controls on their ability to take our money they are they're just burning it\n\nIs the first time in my life I thought I could I could have bought my mother in law house and it said I'm giving it to some bow tie wearing bureaucrats in the the two flushed down the toilet bowl\n\nSo worst unbelievable and I I think it's because I grew up\nAt the lower and middle class and then in the secret service middle class and upper middle class later on I guess I mean I don't know I don't know what the categories Arnold care again I'm not trying to make the story more dramatic than it needs to be [noise]\nI guess is that I genuinely respected dollar because I Know what it's like\nAnd then when you finally get help other people right you're like gosh I could do so much with this and you're forced to turn it over\nBecause I Know what it's like and then when you finally get help other people right you're like gosh I could do so much with this and you're forced to turn it over and they just mega amounts to the government for me at least probably not for anyone else who's really rich which I'm not\nBut I just I'm paid by every ounce of it it just sucks so bad\nBuild my business everything we could hire new people to write for the website ... and we can't because I've got to give it to these guys and ladies in D.C\nTo burn All right sorry I get off track you could tell them kind of hard on this topic here's another number about the fair share that liberals don't say we pay\nThe top fifty percent of taxpayers top fifty percent pay Ninety\nSeven percent of all income taxes ... percent the top fifty percent of earners pay Ninety seven percent Ninety seven cents of every dollar of taxes\nNinety seven Ninety nine point seven Ninety seven percent why does that matter it matters folks\nBecause the bottom fifty percent of taxpayers total logically then pay three percent if the top fifty pay Ninety seven percent the top fifty percent of earners than about fifty three percent of the tax code so\nThis Bloomberg peace they did an interesting analysis they said well let's figure out what percentage of the highest end or is this will make sense of the second I promise what percentage or number of the highest and earners also\nPay and equivalent three percent of the tax will like the bottom fifty percent of the earners in the country\n[noise] ladies and gentlemen the evil rich that the less talks about the Bernie Sanders types\nI'm using their terminology show how this pure stupidity of their comments you're never going to believe this the top zero zero one percent of income taxpayers in other words just fourteen hundred people\nFourteen hundred not fourteen thousand one comment for zero zero for the lips fourteen hundred the fourteen hundred top earners in the United states\nPay the same percentage of the tax load as the bottom fifty percent of income taxpayers in the country\nTell me again please with a straight face\nWith a straight face how they're not paying their fair share fourteen hundred people pay the same equivalent percentage of the income tax or as the bottom fifty percent of earners in the country and he got Bernie Sanders a one percent or um so you're not paying their fair share really berny do you even know these numbers\nThat is insane fourteen hundred people pay the same percentage of the tax code as the fifty percent the bottom fifty percent of income tax payers in this country that's amazing\nNow you understand why we got to just break the narratives completely\nYou read it for the rich no no no no no no no I'm In it for the economy and you have no idea what the numbers are fair share you don't even know what a fair share his\nFair share what you mean it was to make up just doping stupid talking point rich still beta fish or they don't pay pay as much as the bottom fifty percent of the country are you crazy\nA man of fired up about to say are

she's the best I'm\nNot thinking about your stuff dude I don't care what liberals why are you so obsessed with other people success why does it bother you so much why is it so off putting that you

why\nI don't get it like why do we owe you anything anymore why\nWhy why do we owe you\nKept these call could not have been more illuminating [noise]\n\nReally I Am thankful she called I usually don't take a to blow up the first call her there's so much liberal he was kind of a moderate got a cat that was one of the greatest calls ever\nBecause that really sums up liberalism in a nutshell they have no idea what the numbers are they don't understand the facts they don't understand the economic data about tax policy they don't even know what marginal tax rates are they have no idea\nThere convince other people have taken their stuff but when you ask them how exactly they took their stuff they can't tell you how exactly did rich people take yourself Willie talking well how what stuff that they take they took my money what really where where was it worth a billion dollars how did they get that money from you\nKnow I don't know I don't just sounded good Bernie Sanders told me it was true\n\nThey're ... they're total front I remember running for office in Maryland I Can't tell the story you know I used to go there there's a the the Maryland the Montgomery County fair and I'd sit Montgomery County or a very very liberal County Maryland\n[noise] I Would sit there at the fair in front of the G O P booth and shake hands of people and one day this staffer for Chris Van Hollen used to be represented and now he's a senator from Maryland [noise] he stops and he's you know he knows who I Am so he's given me kind of the smart smart guy attitude\nAnd he starts getting it to me about tax policy has no idea what he's talking about he doesn't have any grasp of the numbers at all he's completely clueless so I got tired of listening to it so I said listen I have a really simple question for you\nSince you believe government is is that good right and we should all transfer of wealth to a bunch of bow tie wary bureaucrats in DC you don't give a crap about your money or anything else for that matter please explain to me that you think this is a net good for society and you should ask this of all you're liberal friends\nHow much money argued donating involuntarily higher tax payments to the government go how much\nThe answer I can almost assured you with me or certainty is Ciro matter of fact not only are they not turning over extra money they are hiring accountants to avoid paying the money they owe themselves to the government\nConservatives this is not a problem we are\nHypocrites we know that government is full of waste we know the government can't spend money with any degree of efficiency so we do everything in our power to legally avoid giving the government any more money that we need to liberals make the exact opposite argument now the government it's such a force for good\nThe rich people should get more money to why why please explain to me how we have been\nPaying into these anti poverty programs since the great society and sixty five in sixty six and a percentage of people not working in households with an eligible member to work has gone up knocked down\nWe have not moved the poverty rate in any significant way at all it was actually going down before the great society and government intervention Phil Gramm had a great piece of the wall Street Journal about this last week it is now almost completely stabilized\nWe are transferring on average something like thirty thousand dollars in equivalent transfer payments over to people in lower income categories and the number of people working that of eligible family members that number percentage of people working has gone down\nFor payments over to people in lower income categories and the number of people working that are eligible family members that number percentage of people are working has gone down in some of these households\nThe percentage of household with someone else would've worked that don't have anyone working has gone up dramatically foot please explain to me how this is evidence of government compassion effectiveness and efficiency pleased with a straight face try not to laugh\nWhile you simultaneously hire accountants like John Kerry said Hillary Clinton remember our real estate thing where they hired accountants to avoid paying extra taxes for the government why did you do that why\nIf the government is a source for net good things in society turn your money over to them don't pay a phony but you can't if you're a liberal listening to the show doesn't that anger you that you're such a fake\nNo serious that you're a fraud when you look in the mirror aren't you like wow I'm a real phony I Love the government do everything in my power to pay accountants to avoid giving the government money doesn't that make you a fake how do you live like that\nNo one serious I don't have that issue\nI look in the mirror ago yeah the government really sucks patch I don't want to give them any more my tax money I'm telling you outside of our military courts and the constitutional role of government where there is mass consensus based spent they waste money like no tomorrow government it's thanks it's a disaster\nI have no issue with that\nI look in the mirror know yep I Do everything legally I can to pay as few tax dollars as possible but not you frauds you don't pay extra you want me to pay more you don't do anything because you might say well\nThan a couple of people do voluntarily Patrick I read a report and if the numbers are wrong tweed me I'm happy to hear\nBut I read the report a few years ago that the record amount of money the government and brought in up until that time involuntary tax payments voluntary meeting people just donate extra money the government you're never going to believe this number [noise]\nTwelve million dollars million\nBillion certainly not trillion twelve million dollars\nWe have three hundred and thirty million people in this country\nAre you telling me if I say let's be generous I'll play down the number for the sake of making it easy on the liberal say there are thirty million liberals there's probably more than that probably closer forty or fifty who would classify themselves as liberals say there's twenty five million if each of those liberals just donated a dollar to the government\nThe government they worship that they send you fly in front of that that they they almost consider an act of religion and faith if you just donated a dollar they would\nDouble the amount that voluntarily paid to the government a paltry twelve million dollars\nThat's it so lives step up stop being such frauds stop being such inauthentic fakes and frauds wake up tomorrow morning call\nYour account did do the right thing air quotes right thing because it's the wrong thing but you say it's the right thing\nTo write a big fat juicy check to the G\nGo do it call your account and come on five thousand ten thousand the government is a force for good baddie took things take things take lots to change the\nGo had knock yourself out setting example for the conservatives out there you think are Neanderthals focus labs we donated an astonishing hundred billion dollars involuntary tax payments [noise]\nNice job liberals dumb move but nice job at least you guys have is fine we she stood for something your big frauds\nSony's phone ease fakes\nLook yourself in the mirror and say I'm a big fake because you are I don't want to pay extra pill everybody\nElse does why why I give to charity I don't need someone else to do it\nI give that we we my wife and I give to charity\nWe sell short T shirts on our website we donate the money why I don't need anyone else to do and I don't look for other T shirt bakers because we think we're helping somebody I don't need you to do what you say the government is helping people out to you not why do you need someone else to do it just don't give a", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show", "city": "Washington",
