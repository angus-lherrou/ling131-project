go wow [noise]\nIssues that we're we're going to talk about that word tonight it is a favorite of All right and is loaded with native is and racial undertones and global as well global is having uses a slur\nOf sorts sometimes even against ... ministers so often with anti Semitic overkill\nOkay now keep in mind he's or media figures\nThese are hosts\nSome claimed to be reporters\nAnd listen to how they talk is this cooling down the rhetoric\nIs bringing the country to get is this news isn't even news at all\n\nThen there's Peter Alexander White House correspondent on MSNBC um getting somewhere with this folks please stick with me I Can't do this stuff and quick soundbite cut Twenty one go\nAnd ask you also about hazing that word nationalist saying out loud I Am national and how does the

campaign has a lot of the president's opponents tried to pay them that you get the draft and there's many others\nSo yesterday\nTrump is compared to Hitler he's a racist he's ...\nHe's all these things\nAll these this is the media\nOr the media using selectively guests to say these things they know what they're going to say\nThe media\nAnd tonight they're out there saying toned down politics
