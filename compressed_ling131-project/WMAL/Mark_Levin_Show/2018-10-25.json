hundred and sixty percent at the border nine hundred and sixty percent\nThere are a lot more than roughly fourteen thousand people seeking to invade our border he writes the American people are rightfully concerned about the brazen caravan quote unquote invaders headed for our southern border and fully expect that it will be stopped at all costs before it reaches our border not in our courtrooms however\nNot lose sight of the likely eight hundred thousand strong quiet invasion at a less public level that is crossing our border this year\nBrand new data from customs and border protection should mobilized Trump and Republicans cannot just focus on the caravan baton finally stopping the broader invasion in its entirety\nAccording to customs and border protection that she be P roughly four hundred thousand illegals were caught sneaking in between our point of entry in fiscal year twenty Eighteen and it's not even over\nAnother roughly one hundred and twenty five thousand presenting themselves at the port of entry into ... twenty Eighteen were deemed in admissible\nThat fact that the overall numbers increase by one hundred and six thousand per met by twenty Seventeen is enough of a concern but several other data points or even more concerning that trajectory and the nature of the border crossings or what should really worry us\nFirst it's important to remember the border agents will tell you that the u._s. typically apprehend only about fifty percent of those who are legally cross the border\nThat means that they were likely close to eight hundred thousand people who cross the border last year not at our point of entry\nNow as such it's not just the several hundred thousand illegals that were released into our population after being apprehended bet you concerned those who care about their communities in schools much more concerning or the people we never apprehend who most likely are more dangerous than the ones we did at re hand\nWho most likely
