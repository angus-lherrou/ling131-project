index conversation now with the international real estate expert last hour she talked about bringing foreign buyers your open house\nAnd know how you can buy your dream home faraway lands joining us now is Patricia real poor and international film director with the\nYour global agents team at Caldwell banker residential real estate in Sarasota, Florida Patricia thanks for being back with us all unrealistic today absolutely\nSo now let's change the conversation to Americans who want to buy either across the sea or over the border where are we looking for home\nA lot of Americans are buying in\nRetirement ... an hour outside of our own country\nBut we think people are going to Costa Rica to Panama to Mexico does with three big over the last\nUm we see them going to tax that was like the Bahamas and some of the Caribbean or spring but we have ... areas that we refer them to take good care of them\nSo watch that process like Patricia what's the first step\nIt really is on the situation generally if I'm wrong thing can't find you know they didn't know the area I'm not always but I Would say most people you know and it worked in an area that friend that has been on holiday all cash\nSo they know where they are looking\nFor an eye out what what exactly are you looking forward to that story in the eighties here from how long were you living during the year you want to rent it when you're not using it so you know a lot of people by federal vacation homes and want to work for them while they not using them\nAnd that will help me understand what they're trying to a chain I typically I Can't\nPicture that is the national ... partner in the right location and it's probably part of\nIt could be more than one location I had a British gentleman recently who wants to buy something in America but Easter you know like they want to look at how long he wanted to Costa Rica but we spend ten to ... in both countries and he decided to take a job where they find it on common law\nBut he felt confident with the introduction sleep is getting so our partners in those countries that don't really have to prove themselves as much as they would have done it just called up freelance\nDo most Americans who buy in foreign countries do they also go all cash by say either taking equity out of their properties here or cashing out stock or something along those lines\nYes that deal because it's very hard for Americans to qualify for a mortgage and other kinds of trade but usually they are cash fire but you're right and that the leveraging what my cricket line here selling and we'll get yeah all that stuff don't spoil to buy it but they will typically the cash by it and the country\nBecause of the exchange rates and how they fluctuate if I put a contract to own a house for one million dollars in another country is it possible by the time I get to closing is going to be one million two hundred thousand [noise]\nCould be one or two hundred thousand or the ... the eight hundred [laughter] my my advice\nWith it and\nIt could be one or two hundred thousand ... the eight hundred number I my on my\nOwn with it and and the goal\nWhen you when you buy in a foreign country or where foreign and by the end there early Chip Cravaack so they're trying to actually know failing purchase property but there's also the currency turn park show and that made it very carefully\nSo you need to understand what's happening in their car I think part of your head\nAnd there are special companies right now that you can work with to help here without burning situation so they offering it to\nThe left them want to hear well educated ear about things and so it's kind of the exchange rate for a key indicator that it couldn't be published that might not an impact story X chairs and you know how your quarter\nHow and when it changed your money to the current state\nNo I understand there are companies that will walk in your exchange rate so if it changes you won't get stuck at the settlement table is that real\nAbsolutely it's real and care current tax candidate for a period of time and all I did it by a heightened status of trade in my own and not look said I'd say look the exchange it for up to yeah\nSo it's something for customers to think about not just playing that finding all selling but also when they're looking at cost about is you know when they're paying insurance premiums back home do face that property taxes\nIf they can go into a year or whether they know they're all going to achieve that particular currency way back very reassuring for that\nI see in last question for you Patricia is one of our listeners wants to buy a house overseas with all your experience what's the number one piece of advice they must know before they go forward with it\nBeing used a local economy love love love that they should not be in any way for the aged with all introduced by a builder and he's got a problem that real estate at\nThe sound of that property that need to find an independent attorney to work with\nGreat advice Patricia ... thank you so much\nWell thank you for and I can't help it let me know\nPatricia tan real chore

about things you need to know about and right now we've all heard the economy of the United states is chugging along strongly I mean after all the GDP is up\nEmployment is up and we all know the stock market is way up\nAnd that's apparently causing the Federal Reserve to look closely at whether they should continue to raise interest rates if they do and you're in the market to buy a house how can that affect you look to ask a professional\nJoining us now is more into the chief economist of the national association of real tours Lawrence welcome to real estate today\nI've always Stephen and as you alluded to a communist went quite terrific guy in terms of GDP Growth in terms of job gangs away just following rising stock market is still way up there\nSo there are brought signed up the very positive economic picture a yet home sales because of a deal limiting inventory is being held back oh compared to what it could be\nOf course Lawrence for all those positive reasons of the economy is so good the fed is raising interest rates do you think that's going to have any impact on buyers' market in the months ahead\nThe Federal Reserve raises interest rate first we have to understand they are raising short term\nInterest rates and not long term most consumers have thirty year fixed rate mortgage so or the mortgage rate may not move\nDirect relation with what the Federal Reserve maybe doing a less or some of the homeowners have the adjustable rate mortgages Danny could change but fortunately over Ninety percent of recent homebuyers are taking on those long term dirty\nThat's double rate mortgages and it could change but fortunately over Ninety percent of ... who sent home buyers are taking on those long term thirty year fixed rate mortgage so they would not\nAs well as making sure that those countries that represent the best or any are so that they're getting the most from us just as much as we're getting the most from them\nSo we're we're hoping to raise the bar on an

I'm confused there was a ... who was the last conservative president you tell you I I I don't remember one of those George Bush ...\nListen I ... I I appreciate your opening and I promise I'll give you the chance to respond by trying to be a jerk but\nI don't know if it's that you're a liberal and you don't or you aren't really reading on conservatism I Love George W. Bush I worked for the man I Would have literally given my life for him I was a secret service agents I'm up being hyperbolic I made it that was my job he was a good and decent human being\nGeorge W. Bush was not exactly a conservative president okay the spending levels of the government spending was out of control we had Medicare part D I like George W. Bush there were some great things that happened the tax cuts package but I think\nInsisting he was a conservative president is a little bit of a stretch so let let me just stop you right he was more of a moderate Republican establishment type I think that's more fair analysis that's like saying that's like me coming out and saying to you\nHey bronco bomb it was a moderate he wasn't he wasn't moderate on any issue at all and I think you know that um so so go back to your your point is that the economy went south under George W Bush because of conservatism now let me ask you a question if you don't mind\nWhat conservative ideal\nWhether it be limited government limited government spending limited government intervention the economy cause that recession\nOne work the regulation\nUp how how exactly do you figure that when deregulation or the repeal of Glass Steagall happened under Bill Clinton\nThe bank where all the regulator of ...
