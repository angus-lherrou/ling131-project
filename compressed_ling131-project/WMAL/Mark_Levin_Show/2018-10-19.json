Institute\nWith right is what I Love about life liberty and live in these these long form really in depth really intelligent interviews that only mark king conduct which really smart people a Dr Patrick Michaels was one of those guys Kato Institute of course one of those think tanks here in Washington\nThat focuses on libertarian issues free market issues or as a ... government regulation issues getting government out of every aspect of our life and letting our economy's store you know basically one of the great things we've seen under the Trump economy\nIn the last year and nine ten months now are looking forward to that a brand new life liberty and lived in this Sunday on Fox News ten pm eastern I'd make sure you tune in for that you can get your mark living fix I Know I Will I'll why there's so much to to touch on right now you realize\nThat the election is now is at Eighteen days away Nineteen days away I Know tied to dredge has been doing the can down over there and I'm In this is it's a big one anybody who's saying this is the most important election of our lifetimes\nOr is it just blowing it up your you know or you know what it's a ... they say that every time\nAnd it it starts to sound ridiculous and people on television in Manhattan and inside the beltway here in DC they start to sound history on it or is it and it's all a reason to sort of try to inspire\nTheir base I supposed to step forward it's not the most important election of your lifetime uh but but\nThat sort of try to inspire their base I suppose to step forward it's not the most important election of your lifetime\nUh but but it's important for the next two years because of the Democrats do when the majority in the house we're looking at obstruction even more so than what you've seen we're looking at the resistance movement holding the gamble\nIn the speaker's chair and in ... chairman share of every single committee [noise]\nYou're looking at impeachment you're looking at investigations [noise]\nMaxine Waters chairwoman of the financial services committee you want that for the next two years 'cause that's what you get they need to show Joaquin Castro heck he could be the next chairperson chairman of the intelligence committee\nYou want that is that what you want for the next two years President Trump had a great line in his rally last night here it is\nIt's not the more clear\nDemocrats mom [noise]\nRepublican is for the job [noise]\nThat's\nRight and it's a great way to put it and uh and it rhymes and they do like their rhymes [laughter] uh and and I think that that has residents but I think it goes beyond that listen it's true that we produce jobs it's true that we've seen the mobs from the Democrats but let's take it a little further\nI mean I I'd like to defer to you on this eight seven seven three one three eight one one I like the Democrats produced mobs\nRepublicans produce jobs but let's look at this thing in a uh entire holistic way\nShall we let's look at exactly what the next two years are going to be like with investigations with impeachment with the impeachment of Kavanaugh that they're promising with the obstruction with the resistance with the impossible task of this president this administration getting anything done at all\nWith Nancy Pelosi the speaker of the house if you are ... Republicans right now if you were advising your local congressman right now to come up with some kind of message to flip those votes to people who still aren't sure how they're going to go\nTo warn them off of what our next two years will be with a Democratic majority in the house how would you make that argument if you were sitting across from your brother in law who isn't sure how to vote if you're sitting in the cubicle next to your co worker and they're not sure how to vote if you're exchanging ideas on your Facebook right now\nAnd you're trying to persuade them one argument are you making right now is that there must produce moms Republicans produce jobs is that is that\nThe good approach [noise] uh what are you doing right now eight seven seven three one three eight one one let's hear from you on this I'm Larry O'Connor and you're listening to the mark Levin show\nHim Washington Mall W.

M. A. L. O. U. R. next up on the ... show as it should we\nBeing tied to scare them I think it's actually the Mike in Frederick also listening on W. M. A. L. O. U. R. next up on the ... show I should we should we be reduced to scaring voters from voting for Democrats\nOh absolutely not and you know I my comment has a lot to do it that's the whole thing the Castros\nDoing against Jared Kushner the same thing that the FBI did with the ... Carter Page is a good analogy about it\nOr something like the father does the sun and found out what you to marry this woman in the song says no and then there's the dad says well it's Bill Gates disorder and then the dad calls up Bill Gates says I watched her daughter to marry my son and they'll get says no and the dad says well he's a CEO world thing\nI was wondering what you thought about Trump announcing to the department heads he'd like them to cut five percent across the board I Wonder how much money that will say the U.S taxpayer and why no one's talking about it\nSo you think Republicans should be a a touting that they should say look you keep us in power we're going to help the president reduce the budget across the board\nOh absolutely and not only that as we should be eliminating multiple federal departments\nThere's a lot of state departments that are doing the same thing that the federal departments are doing everything has a department of education department of agriculture and the the way that the federal level is incredible and no one's talking about downsizing the federal government and reducing the cost to operate the federal government\nAnd he announced that the other day and it's getting no play and I'd just like to know why\nThanks skates well it's not getting a lot of play because of all the way in terms of the news coverage is because the news focuses on what they choose to focus about all of the great news in the economy with regard to jobs with regard to Wall Street with regard to profit with regard to manufacturing they're not paying any attention to that either\nKey thank you for the call and and the other beauty or of of what the president has done here is that he is bypassing Congress lives in Congress\nCan ... the law they can set their budget they can appropriate funding but the executive branch actually does uh do the spending right they do the hiring they do the actual operation of these federal agencies just because Congress appropriated some money that's not incumbent on the executive branch to actually spend that money\nAre now the problem is Congress can't go back to their voters and say hey we've reduced the federal budget we've reduced the federal deficit we've reduced the size of the government because they haven't\nThey haven't uh because they're terrified of a government shutdown they're terrified that the a handful of Democrats in the Senate that will halt the process and not let a budget or any appropriations go through unless they have their way and they decided in the leadership of the house in the Senate that it's better to keep things going\nAnd it's been the president who was set I find find you you say I'm going to spend that much guess what I'm not gonna and I went out my departments to figure out how to cut\nOr however we also need to see the president come through with those cuts we need to see is departments actually deliver a that's yet to happen how 'bout Josh over in ... Wisconsin Josh here next up on the mark within show I'm Larry O'Connor\nIowa aerial I'm good I I'm concerned\nThough because if the Democrats do get the majority in the house this is going to be a rough two years\nAnd I have an idea I'm a ... year string color and I said that a good idea that they should do is they could show Detroit when it's ran by businessmen like Donald Trump say in Henry Ford and the strength that Detroit once had\nAnd then once Democrat liberal takeover and alec just falls into corruption in squalor and just show them side by side and then even better for my own state I think they don't tell their enough\nWe let politician and take over you get your choice if you let Republicans take over and have ideas we get Foxconn and he'd do look for jobs that we're getting a little shocked and I yeah I Wish they were told that more and more and more and they don't\n[noise] yeah and you know Josh I'm Glad you brought this up because I I Love Wisconsin and I think that a year Governor Scott Walker has done some great jobs and it is an incredible turnaround what he's been able to achieve in that state and of course they all said that people would be fired and people would be starving in the streets and no one would get an education and it's been phenomenal\nYeah at least some in this council member and Madison there were all yes matter and that took on our capital and we fought right short and look at what we've been able to accomplish that strikes is second half of the tournament Donald Trump is said if we fight the good fight and vote on November ...\nThank you Josh thank you for the call appreciate it thanks for coming into the market within show ya I'd vividly remember those mobs taking over the capital occupying the capital of Madison during the early years of the Scott Walker or the governorship a ... that was back when I was working with Andrew Breitbart and Andrew Andrew got on a plane\nThe next day he sent us all a text message I'm going to Madison\nIn the winter in Southern California guy Andrew why are you going in Madison\nAnd the plane the next day he sent us all a text message I'm going to Madison in the winter\nIn Southern California guy who asked her why are you going in Madison looked at what's going on there look at the mobs look at the riots look at the ... look at Scott Walker needs us Republicans need us\nConservatives who are trying to bring sane rational governance to the state of Wisconsin need us and he sure did go there by the way right next door to you there uh Josh over in Michigan [noise]\nThis is a remarkable thing\nYou know everywhere you go right now on cable news broadcast news all over the Internet who do you hear about running for Senate this young upstart appealing good looking guy who's who's a defy the odds and has a real chance to win all you're hearing about is this guy Beto O'Rourke\nBitter rug doesn't have a chance to win and Texas\n... work is not going to win the Senate seat in Texas [noise] and\nIt's all made for TV we've seen this game before every\nTwo years every election they tell us about the new rising star in Texas was finally going to take paint Texas blue you know when Hillary Clinton was a deciding not to do any sort of polling or appearances in Wisconsin Pennsylvania well not Pennsylvania she did appears in Wisconsin or Michigan\nOr is it and she was actually at that time\nContemplating spending more money in Texas because she was so sure she was going to win Texas and Georgia and Arizona and she ... she wanted to to this was going to be a transformative election with Hillary Clinton and the remaking of the map\nWe hear this all the time the ... but it's not true\nAnd meanwhile in Michigan there's this guy John James the last poll\nThere showed him in single digits now this guy a running against Debbie Stabenow I mean he is he's a former military uh did combat in Iraq\nUh this guy is African American this guy is conservative this guy is right on all the issues here I Want to play a little bit of of him because because this tells you exactly how the media so corrupt\nBecause all they care about with federal Rourke it has to do with two things it has to do with forcing this fake narrative\nThat the Democrats are really ... the Texas is moving blue Texas is going to be a democratic state taxes is not the same Texas because the Democratic demographic changes because uh because of all of the radical conservative policies that have heard that they would say I haven't I mean\nPeople are flocking to Texas people are flocking to Texas because of the economy there is one of the only state that persevere through the eight ... years of ... because they had Republicans in charge of that state there's no way that people have Texas would reverse that trend but also because they hate Ted Cruz\nThe media hates Ted Cruz because he's so good so smart and so conservative so they're they're they're puffing this beta will work guy up and meanwhile listen I got a little bit of a John James this a really impressive guy in Michigan\nWe only use of what's needed Washington in order to ensure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity American exceptionalism is not entitled\nAmerican exceptionalism his Hern\nThere was a time in America we stood out what was right without any sort of political motivation reservation we waste wars on he will not on each other we service before so we dared greatly wisely laws deeply in a man's world was on this is what I'm president when he talked about making America great are you\nKidding me about bringing I mean do you hear this guy doing the African American young handsome\nOdd articulate as as a perfect on the issues perfect on his love for this country full support of the president I mean I come on if he if he were running against Ted Cruz you think we'd hear more about John James\nIf he were a Democrat do you think we'd be hearing a little bit more ... why is everyone obsessed with ... or work when he was basically running the justice far behind Ted Cruz and the latest polls then John James is running behind Debbie Stabenow and you know the answer to that question\nYou know very well the answer to that question [noise]\nHow about GM down in uh Fernando Florida I'm Larry O'Connor you're listening to the mark within show what is a gym\nI just want to tell you what the Democrats or Republicans should be talking about yeah\nIs what the Democrats are not talking about\nGun control the economy jobs on I'm going to the people in that case the media is driving the narrative and they're doing that in the pocket of the Democrats [noise]\nYet Jim you're right all the Republicans need to know what they should be talking about in the next to the two and a half weeks you're absolutely\nBut the Democrats yet Jim you're right all the Republicans need to know what they should be talking about in the next to the two and a half weeks you're absolutely right all the things that the Democrats are avoiding and that includes the fight over judge Kavanaugh now justice cabin on notice how no one talks about that anymore it's completely disappeared why do you think that is Jim\nOh gee I Wonder if the media is driving it there are saying okay well that's not important anymore that might make the conservatives rushed to the polls and you know [noise] disregard they're what they're what they're trying to do\nThank you Jim appreciate the call thanks for calling the ...

is that the way it was five and I I cannot believe that there are people out there that felt for ...\nThank you Jan ... you made a great point and coming from your perspective as a feminist from ... or ... you know growing up in the feminist movement as a baby boomer of this whole thing is the opposite of empowering women it's painting all women as victims Larry O'Connor the market within show\nAnd so they're terrified and so they want they they put the lie out there they put the lives out there that this is hate radio that it's nothing but a bunch of angry old white men shouting and so when we have the opportunity to say hey ladies love to hear from you [noise]\nExplodes [noise] ah the the the best gift you can give to a young person in your life who are just getting out of

change\nSo ladies thank you but I Am lifting the or the gender ban here I Want to talk about\nThis they're calling it a caravan [noise] what what is that a caravan a caravan sounds like it's some sort of a fun little vacation\nWhere all you and you and your mate soul you know you you do you all take your separate cars and you follow each other down the expressway to get to the campsite okay\nWe're going to Canada and at the beach that's all ... and up to the mountains will go fishing it's going to be a care of that it's terrific have you seen these pictures have you seen the video [noise]\nAre they all have by the way everyone in this uh this migration this this is the ... invasion\nThis reprehensible international crisis they make no mistake is absolutely organized these things don't spontaneously happened it's impossible\nAnd if you if you go to your favorites search engine and type in Honduran caravan organizers they'll give you a list of several names couple of them just got arrested in Guatemala the Guatemalan government arrested them and send them back to Honduras but there's still people organizing\nThis of course that have you noticed that all the people in this they all have brand new backpacks\nWeird odd the brand\nNew backpacks full of all their personal belongings and they're all waving the flag of their nation our Salvador Guatemala and Honduras and they're demanding entry into Mexico and they are saying to whatever reporter will talk to them we are going to the United states of America and you can't stop\nUs [noise] and if you listen to most of our elected officials guess what their rights we camp stops\nThem what are we going to do [noise]\nYou know the Democrats and sadly many Republicans on Capitol Hill [noise] don't hesitate to criticize president\nTrump for his policy of securing our border enforcing immigration laws as they are written prosecuting criminals who break our immigration laws deporting criminals in this country for violating our immigration laws\nIt's a very clear cut policy by the way one that believe it or not used to be embraced by Democrats too\nAnd Republicans [noise]\nUntil they figured out that they could get votes and or campaign donations respectively\nFor being an international list for being all about open borders for being compassionate [noise] ah you know what's compassionate compassionate as not enabling people to continue to follow the same broken\nDestructive patterns that they have a year after year after decade after decade\nYou know what's compassionate wanting the Honduran people to be empowered to alter and change the Honduran government or the Mexican government\nTerrified for your life in Honduras I get it gets what we were terrified for our lives hundreds of years ago here in America we made a change [noise] what's that ... and remember when we all love the Arab Spring where we had people rise up against their governments\nThe middle east because they were set up and they were done I is it time maybe first\nRise up against their governments\nAcross the middle east because they were set up and they were done I is it time maybe for a Central American spring why is the default obligation\nFor America and for the mainstream media to be all things are awful in these countries\nCome when we got shipped back why is that suddenly the definition\nOf compassion why is that suddenly the definition of being a real American if you don't open up your borders and allow anyone into this country you're anti American you're not really upholding American ideals are values\nAre you kidding me since when and how many by the way this is a caravan of four thousand if we let them in do you think that'll stop it hasn't for the last five years it hasn't they keep\nComing why because we left that man [noise]\nI said earlier today I actually got to speak with a Democrat Senator Ben Cardin\nOr he is a senator in Maryland here in the greater Washington area is running for reelection and I asked him that I said you know what what should we do to stop these people from coming into the country led listen 'cause this is very this is very indicative of of how they think and how they talk what should we do to stop that should we stop that\n[noise] when one of the reasons we've had a program to try to improve the living conditions in Central America\nOh it's been supportive bipartisan Democrats or Republicans it's rooted in President Trump's budget we want to improve the living conditions for those of our neighbors who live in Central America\nThey hit and he goes on on this and and think about what she's saying here and this is this is considered to be the the the highest level of statesmanship in Washington DC\nWe've got thousands and thousands of people who make no Bones Are secretive about the fact that they are a demanding entry into our country because they hate the country they're living in\nAnd the politically correct acceptable wise old man on Capitol Hill response is well how many billions can we get to that government down there to improve conditions\nAnd by the way we've sent billions and billions and billions and billions already and somehow it hasn't solved the problem\nAnd and think about what the basis of this argument is to stop people from invading our borders we must throw billions of dollars to their countries it's extortion\n[noise]\nThey were driving them we're bribing the government's down there to get control of their own citizenship and then you get the Mexican government leadership and for that matter Honduran that all of these countries in Central America where their citizenship is leaving in droves to go to another country [noise]\nAnd they're angry at us for saying no they can't come in let's say about that for a minute you weren't elected official you've been elected by your population in El Salvador in in Guatemala in Mexico you've been elected to represent them\nYou've been elected to run the affairs of the country\nAnd the people who elected you are fleeing your country\nTo go elsewhere and your responses not gee maybe we're doing something wrong maybe we need to fix our country no your response is how dare you America not allow my citizens to fully my end after corrupt government to come into your country\nThese countries spend more time focusing on our policies then fixing their own and then you got a Democrat like Ben Carson who enables at who enabled by throwing more money at it [noise]\nSo I came back we went back and forth on this earlier today and if you want you\nCan get the whole interview over at a my radio station W male\nDot com but I came back around and said All right let them I Know you want to throw a bunch of money at this government and you want to do all of these things on the ground to keep them from going but that's not going to stop these four thousand okay there on the way\nAnd frankly whatever money you send down there you've already sent plenty and that hasn't fix the problem I don't know how much more money you got to spend\nBut let's focus on what's happening right now 'cause you have a lot of criticism for President Trump for saying he's going to send the military down there for saying he's going to cut funding if these countries don't stop their own citizens from playing yeah you have all this criticism of him for actually trying to protect our borders so what would you do your senator for crying out loud\nWhat's the solution how do you stop these people from coming into our country when they reach our border what are we supposed to do\n[noise] but I don't know if I'll agree with you on on that statement I I I've been in bed with the FBI they ought to Central America I\nWhat are we supposed to do\n[noise] I don't know if I'll agree with you on on that statement I I I I've been embedded with the FBI down to Central America I I Know how dangerous the\nBirds are by the way I real fast let me just ... I had just said that there's a criminal element that there are dangerous gang members who are coming along with the than we know that to be true he's telling me that it's not true\nI find you did you you were you reach your own conclusion I report you decide do you think maybe there was a violent criminal element over the last several years the came along and cross the border\nWith these unaccompanied minors don't or they were all seven year old children really they all had tattoos\n... we quibble\nA I have interviewed a gang member who actually came to the United states to set up sister gangs including in Maryland so I I understand the danger factor for those relate to these gang activities\nI think most of the of the families that show up on our border or people who are see themselves as desperate they're trying to escape Central America in some cases they have a legitimate fear of their lives should be able to seek asylum", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Washington", "day": "19"}
