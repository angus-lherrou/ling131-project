I'm sure they connect the dots you've heard that since you were a kid had been to any ... thanks for joining has\nGotten a lot of mileage out of that song over the years he was somebody who I I bet your stories about Freddie Mercury did did you had no idea he had you in mind when he wrote that while\nNot really that you know it's coming out of every second they've ... the ... and and let me tell you about this ... the first page of that book he was filled with the gift of laughter and an understanding that the world was bad that's what ... you also have the TV set\nHey see and that you know it's funny 'cause the first thing I Want to compliment you on on your book it's the blue collar president it's out today a Trump the blue collar president is this is a funny book you are actually a pretty funny guy\nI'm pretty sure that I tried to write a with a sense of humor because at the end of the day what happened to be with half are fine but also have you ... it\nCould have come out of the sitcoms veep right\nAnd and listen I uh you you painted a very vivid off the record picture as Steve Bannon a day in case you know a certain activity I just wanted to know I don't know you don't know me\nA Anthony but I worked with the band and years ago I used to work with Andrew Breitbart before Bannon took over the place I'm I've known him for a long time I don't disagree with your assessment of 'em except physically I don't think he's capable of doing that let's say well I mean if\nYou did a little bit more hot yoga anything can happen you know like ...\nLike here's what's fascinating to me you are a high finance guy you you know you're a Harvard law dude you made a huge money on Wall street and and Trump is a billionaire he started with a ton of money in real estate but you describe them here as the blue color president connect those dots for me how was he the voice of the blue collar working then and\nWell while I tried to come up with it in setting dairy title I knew that liberals go absolutely crazy over that title because he had a golden toilet seat you know he's grown up with the golden ... in his mouth\nAnd you know if you ever been to the park and it looks like Louis the fourteenth smoke crystal bad side of the art so liberals that goes so crazy about it but it's really less about the president and more about his attachment\nTo the blue collar voters I mean why do people in the neighborhood that I grew up in what my cousin or gays in order blast my cousin Bobby clamor out and always stir bay on Long Island why are these guys love them so much why they go for and I try to I Try to explain given my life experience what the attraction is the President Trump\nOr the book by Anthony Scaramucci as Trump's of blue collar president and you know you really do hit on something there that I think the mainstream media still doesn't get a for all during the primary election season here on WMA else so many people would call in so many people would stop me at advanced unsafe finally\nThis diet speaking for me finally there's someone who I can relate to that that goes a long way in American politics so\nIt it it goes so law that they'll let him do it and say whatever he wants I mean he's basically they're human racket ball\nOr if you watch that movie racket Ralph yeah he's there to destroy the machine and so that's where they like that because they feel that they haven't been listening to and I chronicle that you know I I grew up in an aspirational working class family or my dad has a high wage but he was in late ...\nUh we did very well uh you know there was one bathroom the five of us were fighting over to we were taken advantage of that ad out of the head of the house that I Would never dishonor my dad's ... by telling you I grew up poor but the flipside of that same workers going to get it at thirty two percent less in real wages forty short years later\nAnd that's that's the reason why these people like him they want to see a change and they want to see if they get out by it\n[laughter] I've been jokingly saying Anthony Scaramucci did when you work for the president for ten days and you can still get a book out of bed that must have been a hell of a ten days or what was I mean\nFirst of all the main reason why I was able to get the book is that it was actually eleven days ... only the CEO Larry if you if you get hired on the twenty first and you're\nFirst of all the main reason why I was able to get the book is that it was actually eleven days like living in the ... if you if you're hired on the twenty

cycle present some unusual risks\nFor pollsters not in the mainstream media does this every election cycle where was this down for the last six months the last six months there was going to be a blue wave there was no doubt about it it was going to sweep the Democrats do massive control of the house of representatives and the Senate and it was by by Trump\nAnd that's been the the soap operas script for at least nine months\nDrive buys assuring everybody every day Democrats are going to crush it\nYeah it's gotta be curtains for Trump curtains for the Republicans now polls could be missing

had this mob of people storming the American border there's no reasonable Americans wants to just open the floodgates in let those people in for whatever else is going to follow behind this is not one of the American people are right now\nThe only common sense a cool thing to do is to oppose of this but because Trump opposes that the Democrats instinctively have to say they're in favor of it they

now than argues electing Democrats not in mass maybe individual race here district based on local things but in math\nThere is no reason to vote Democrat even giving people resist the vote for the

Missouri and the person that show so she's\nMy first question to Elizabeth was are you scared\nAlways always Colleen is it is always a scary scary than\nBut also one of the most ... in front of into the air too\n[noise] so what happens in Columbia, Missouri on Halloween Night\nTrick or treating you know trick or treating happens it's also the last day of October so like many communities the last day of the month is very popular day for closings with ... home ownership and and so as people get ready to wrap up those mortgage payments and they move into a new home\nAwesome [noise] some people across America thought about buying a home but it's a little bit scary to them should it be\nAnd before I bought a home I got home ownership was scary to me any repair or anything that might have to happen to how it was always two thousand dollars no matter what I was if it was a roof for it so it was a leaky faucet I thought it was going to cost two thousand dollars\nBut that's not the truth and certainly you know sometimes homeownership is scary because you realize not only are you going to now be responsible for your monthly payment to live you're going to be responsible for some of those ongoing payments\nAnd you know realtors that's a great place where you can use your local realtor who can connect you with those experts in the neighborhood the plumbers electricians it takes away a little bit of that fear because sometimes not everybody has those connections and they need to I took it out make\nThose we make a really good point because you're not only paying the mortgage also paying for maintenance but it's your house and you can maintain it so you can make sure it's done right\nAbsolutely in and maintain it the way you want to I think that's another one of the great benefits and now it's your home and you can do what you want to do with it and you can add on a deck if you want or you can put that picture in a while or you can decorate the outside for all those trick or treaters\nAnother scary thing is borrowing hundreds of thousands of dollars to buy that house for some people that just terrified I'm\nSure and that's one of the very first things is going to happen when you meet with a realtor you're going to have a conversation about the mortgage process and you know in in a row of trees are gonna recommends lenders in the area who you can talk to about what that payment means how you pay it back what happens is\nYou know you feel you can't afford it or you or you can't pay meant and how\nTo manage that process but it's their long term payments and if you're investing in you\nKnow you're not investing and someone else and with interest rates being lower rent from being higher it's a very good thing to chicken too because it's very likely that you might be able to pay less in a home and invest in yourself in someone else\nAnother thing we hear some mostly young people are afraid to get tied down they don't want to put down roots they want to stay free and that's why they don't buy a house how about that\nPart of one of the values of this country is freedom and being able to move and do what you want to do but in order to do that it does require resources and many times those are financial resources the best way to build wealth to have the freedom to do what you want to do is to own that home\nIt's an investment in yourself and your future and so um it's a great way to really establish your financial portfolio for life\nAs a matter of fact as one young person told me the other day they're going to buy a house but they still want to live in different places all across America so at one point do rented out and they'll move somewhere else solid\nI mean certainly want to check with your local realtor find out about the communities there are communities that rent better than others and so but it becomes an investment portfolio for you and we are seeing that you know people want to continue to move and\nHome owners today also become travelers and a ...\nSeeing that you know people want to continue to move and home owners to day also become travelers and or ranchers and property for vacation days though you get to have the benefit of both\nThere is a tough one ten years ago the financial markets crashed some people are afraid to buy a house because they're afraid that's going to happen again I'm\nSure that's where your local realtor really is important to have a conversation 'cause every market is different and every market has recovered differently from that financial crash certainly there's been different changes in lending\nThat are going to help mitigate that for the future so there have been some rules and regulations that have been put in place to try to avoid that which will help bar homebuyers in that but you want to talk to your local real chore about the conditions of\nThe area where you're considering the by whether it's a first home or a second home you know our prices increasing the inventory low or high you know that will give you more of a sense of a long term investment picture\nSo finally if someone gets passed all those scary things and they buy their own house [noise] we need to remind them that one of the most comforting things ever to sleeping in the home you know\nIt's what everybody wants to do at the end of the day when you're tired when you're excited you want to go home but it's also the place you get to celebrate so many memories get to celebrate birthdays and dinners\nAnd you certainly get to celebrate hopefully all those trick or treaters who come to your door and and the costumes and the fun and the interaction with the neighborhoods and that's a great fun thing about this week\nWell happy Halloween was the only other men and
