what should we do about this year my candidate you want to be in Congress ... what's your plan what's your idea of what should we do if they begin by saying well first of all are believed in a comprehensive immigration solution stopped them mid sentence if you get the opportunity I watch\nThe comprehensive immigration means we're gonna throw all of this garbage into one giant bill that everyone has to vote on\nAnd it'll include border protection and it'll include asylum and it'll clue to amnesty into clued path to citizenship and will clue you know the ... visas to bring in some a computer nerd from India and all of these\nThings and you stop and say well why why\nWhy why does all of that other stuff\nWhy does that need to be part of this solution this is a very cut and dry standalone problem\nThere are people from another country who are crossing our border illegally and demanding to stay here it has nothing to do with path to citizenship for people who are already here it has nothing to do with visas it has nothing to do with comprehensive anything\nAnd if you and if your solution\nFor these people who are crossing our country illegally and want to stay here in demand to be in our country\nIf your solution is tied to all these other things that you want voted on an approved then it means your part of the problem you're using this to get other things that you want\nI Am so against the idea of comprehensive anything reform in Congress I think every individual items should be voted on standalone\nDo you want a wall or not well okay well go ahead and fun to

initiate on my friend Dan bungee often sits in this chair as well and I've known down since I first they actually before I even came to Washington and he's been so great on this issue with Spygate and with the FBI and the doors and\nAh all that jazz and I've been doing a quite a bit on that story as well\nAh I recently this week to interview Carter Page and a quarter page is a central figure of the uh Spygate scandal right uh\nAnd and the the uh he hasn't done a whole lot of media but I was able to have a quite an extensive conversation he's in the news this week and I don't know if you saw this but Carter Page has filed a defamation lawsuit against the Democratic National Committee\nAnd against a Perkins ... which is a a high powered D.C law firm that represented the DNC and by extension the Hillary Clinton campaign you know in a presidential campaign when a person gets the nomination for a party they are the de facto head of that party\n... and especially I Am ... Brazil's book is called hacked\nAnd it's a double entendre it's partly about the Russian thing but it's also about what happens\nHer experience taking over the DNC after Debbie Wasserman Schultz who was a mess was completely mess and she she tells a lot of troops in this book about how awful Debbie Wasserman Schultz was and how terrible the Hillary Clinton campaign was to her personally and to the DNC\nHow the Hillary Clinton campaign absolutely ran roughshod over them a bill to them for whatever money that was coming in\nAnd they were in charge of all of it All right so so when you hear that the DNC hired a farm through a lawyer to create fusion GPS to to create the Russian dot CA\nThat apparently you know ... Carter Page uh that really means that Hillary Clinton campaign\nBecause they call the shots so not Carter Page this week prior to ... filed a defamation lawsuit against them against the DNC and against a ... now why did he go after those people would be I think it's because they have deep pockets frankly [laughter] that's where the money is\nAnd and and had it not been for those two entities that wouldn't have been a Russian dot CA there wouldn't have been stories saying that Carter Page is an agent of the Russian government there wouldn't have been a a FIC to warrant\nA petition for and prove to the FBI petition for by the FBI unapproved through the feisty records for them to survey on him\nTo look into every little or if is of his electronic footprints via email text messages phone calls and the people who associate with him for over a year they kept getting this incredibly intrusive\nSpy warrants vet that without a fight the war and it is against the law for a federal agency to spy on an American citizen the only way they can do it it's real Pfizer worn and they're supposed to be a very high bar to get a five to warrant\nAnd to get this vice weren't they had to use the the Russian dot CA the claims Carter Page was and they in fact if you look at the applications for the warrant for the ... weren't the FBI said we believe Carter Page isn't agents of the Russian government it's right there in black and white\nAnd we believe that he was working on behalf of the Russian government to alter American foreign policy through his meddling in the presidential campaign of twenty six tape on behalf of Donald Trump that's what they said that's what they claim that's what they maintained under oath to the court [noise]\nTo Carter Page filed a defamation lawsuit this week [noise]\nSuing the DNC and ... this law firm for defamation\nNow think about this from it [noise] Carter Page\nIs either an agent with the Russian government and basically participated in a subversive if not outright treasonous acts against our nation [noise]\nDuring the twenty sixteen presidential election or he\nVersus if not outright treasonous acts against our nation [noise]\nDuring the twenty sixteen presidential election\nOr he is an innocent American citizen who has been signed and slandered into famed and used as a tool for political purposes not just by the DNC and the Hillary Clinton campaign but ultimately by the Justice Department and the Obama administration [noise]\nYou've got to be one or the other\nFreight ... there's no in between here there's no if and\nOr certainly no but I mean if there was a button hero it'd be a car Daschle and proportions [noise]\nCarter Page is either as stool or a a sorry a stew dj of the prudent Kremlin\nFor he is completely innocent\nAnd and you know I don't know if you know a lot about Carter Page I guess it hasn't been a lot of a media he's a Naval Academy graduate\nHe was a navy officer as all Naval Academy graduates are unless they're you know pro athletes\n[noise] he was in intelligence\nIn the navy and an officer\nIn the intelligence division which you know usually you've got some hurdles that you have to cross to get into military intelligence in the United States Navy as an officer [noise] um and after serving his time well beyond his obligated time as an officer after he got his a Naval Academy education he then went into private business\nAnd did we went into the energy sector he got his doctorate by the way he is about the ever noticed that you can't say Christine Blasey Ford's name without saying Dr Ford but what was the last time they said Dr Carter Page he's a doctor he got his doctorate [noise]\nAnd he didn't do dealings with energy sectors out of Russia you can argue with that if you want but understand most of his dealings were in the house in days when Hillary Clinton had a reset button when Bill Clinton was pulling down six figures for giving a speech in Moscow\nAnd when a bronco bomber was promising his counterpart there that he'd have more flexibility after he got rid of this uh this Mitt Romney guy and won reelection\nSo it was a different time it was a different era it was okay to do business with Moscow now he's still thinks that's a good idea to do business with Moscow he actually doesn't think the government is as bad as everyone says\nThat's what that's not a legal he can do that in fact it's not illegal for a business to do business with Moscow as right now as we speak\nAnd sanctions and in a in a huge way against that government their individual sanctions against individuals but uh businesses can still do\nBut we we still do business with Moscow\nYou may disagree but guess what he has a right to do that that doesn't make them a spy it doesn't make them a Russian agent now he could be don't misunderstand my point here Carter Page\nCould very well be\nAn Asian or the Russian government as the FBI maintained based on the Russian dot CA paid for\nBy the DNC and this law firm that Carter Page is now suing but ask yourself something as you evaluate the story as you use your cognitive skills\nYour reasoning the brain that the good lord gave you as you evaluate the story that has presented to you that\nThe FBI and the Obama administration said Carter Page was an agent of the Russian government and has been for years and worked on behalf of the Kremlin and bled um are prudent to colluded with Donald Trump to meddle in the twenties sixteen presidential election as they say that [noise] understand to facts number one\nTo this day\nHas charged Carter Page with anything\nNot James Comey\nNot Loretta Lynch\nNot Jeff Sessions not Rod Rosenstein\nNo one at the federal level no one at the local level no one at the state level Carter Page has not been charged with a crime of any kind and they have sort of veiled every inch of his whole life\nFor almost two years they've got everything on him\nNo charges number one so so think about that for a minute and then think about this if you're Carter Page\nAnd you are an agent of the Russian government and you did commit near treasonous acts\nBy colluding with the Trump campaign and a vitamin pollutants Kremlin to alter our presidential election and twenty sixteen if\nIf that were true why would you file a lawsuit\nWhy would you file a defamation lawsuit against the DNC because you see the perfect affect the DNC\nCan defend themselves and get out of this lawsuit\nWith one very simple strategy [noise]\nIt's only defamation if it isn't true\nSo all they got to do is proof that Carter Page\nIs in fact an agent of the Russian government and if you're Carter Page why would you invite that why would you open yourself up to discovery\nIs in fact an agent of the Russian government and if you're Carter Page why would you invite that\nWhy would you open yourself up to discovery why would you open yourself up to a full court

borders or at least de facto orders they want to eliminate ice they want century city so you're miserable lunacy they want to protect illegal alien dangerous illegal aliens who are already here but they don't want to wall to keep them out\nThe city so you're missing the lunacy they want to protect illegal aliens dangerous illegal aliens who are already here but they don't want to wall to keep them out in the first place I mean think of that twisted\nLogic that what we lack a lot I guess I should say\nOn the part of the Democrats so I think it's a it's a very stark\nReal reminder for the American people what's at stake and if they vote for the Democrats in November and give them the keys to the house of representatives unfortunately weren't getting nothing done in the wall in twenty Nineteen I don't want that to happen I don't think America wants that to happen so I'm encouraged and all the listeners\nAlmost all the time the victim has an Hispanic name right why because they live in those communities where they live and work and and you know and operate in general\nThey're not going and causing problems in Greenwich, Connecticut where you know they don't live and work they're causing problems in Hispanic community so Hispanics disproportionally\nAre the victims Hispanic American citizens are disproportionately the victims of lunacy or the left wing policies and I think Spanish I wake up to that reality um and realizing that that's what the Democratic party wants for them even though I'm not good for our communities\nAnd uh and I I think that's also part of what's turning the tide and the Democrats better be careful they take minority voters for granted for decades that starts to change it and they're going to be a lot of hurt and I hope that we're going to see that in a few weeks in November\nMe to now well let me just say in letting you go thank you for\nA sticking up for a one soon to be old white guy I guess\nUh I remember there was a segment on CNN I

interesting I mean from Pat Buchanan and Sam Nunberg and Steve Cortez we've had a lot of interesting stuff today I have to tell you but this issue this issue of what what they did to um to to Kanye West\nI mean ... to have to have Don Lemon and another black contributor on on CNN\nBasically rip them apart that that's what happened when negroes read in other words I don't know that he read something too much I mean that's a that it's so racist I don't even want to repeat it but that's what they said um and you know that token negro and this and that it's like ... a vial vicious disgusting race just\nCrap but it's okay\nIt's okay if it's aimed at a at a at a black conservative because they're not really black\nDidn't you know that or ... did a Hispanic conservative\nBecause they're not really Hispanic wasn't it Harry Reid implied or set out right that that Rubio really as an Hispanic that's that's you know he wasn't the first one to come up with that but that's what they do it's who they are\nAnd the same thing for gays\nIf you're conservative gay yeah really count as\nA conservative woman may be the worst\nToday's if you're conservative gay you don't really count and\nA conservative woman may be the worst because when John McCain\nShows Sarah pale in\nThe head of the national organization of women reacted immediately and said he might as well or picked a white male which is the worst day but because Sarah Palin so conservative woman\nSo she's not really a woman\nSo don't you understand how bigoted and sexist and racist\nThe left is\nAround the country who say yeah it's a booming economy but I my biggest problem now I Can't find the workers to fill the orders if they can't find them here\nOr Steve we're going to have a problem where those factories will go to India or Mexico or China or some other countries that do have surplus labor so you know I I'm very much in favor of allowing people to come into this country legally as you said Steve they have to come in legally\nThrough our a lawful system of immigration or and then when they come they can't go on welfare they have to you know they have to work and and then by the way there'll be no shortage of people want to come here most the vast majority of people come here want economic opportunity not to go on in the welfare system\nAh and then we have to we have to build the wall Steve we have to I don't think the American people will accept a reform in the legal immigration system until they feel that the the ... the you know the border is secure Trump is\nMoving in that direction but how about the Democrats did I mean they basically threatening to shut down the government of a you know they will not find the wall they'll fund everything else everything else from Washington the only thing that will not fun to the wall\nIt is amazing um when you hear Trump Steve or say and it says seems like the new slogan for the midterms right now I'm the Republicans create jobs Democrats create mobs a that's a winning message\n\nDid we lose the yeah I Know that guy I heard you say that you know that that line that Trump's used about you know Republicans create jobs and Democrats ... and you know CNN has you know I'm with a fake news now with CNN and they were just were asking about that yesterday all day that Trump\nHad said you know made this made that comment but at today as well and and I'm like well look\nAs running for president in modern times who created jobs at the pace that that Donald Trump parents I mean and and lower the unemployment rate so rapidly you know so\nIt's true I mean this guy who creates jobs he's a ... that's one of the themes of our book trumping mix as\nYou know why is that the Trump has been so successful or other presidents have failed in terms of rebuilding our economy\nAnd I think the answer is that Donald Trump it's really simple Stevie the map [laughter] you know how to meet payroll she knows how to make businesses succeed\nHe knows what it takes you know what this is just needs\nTo expand their operations in the past year and and that means lower taxes less regulation get the government the hell out of the way\nAnd when you do that I mean it's it's really remarkable the resilience of our economy and our our it's a real tribute by the way I have to say they're twenty eight million small businessmen and women you know people who start their own businesses or the American dream that's how you get rich start your own business\nTwenty eight million people do that there was a major employers in this country and if you just let them do their thing Steve they will make America prosperous place and that's what Trump is shown\nAbsolutely we are talking to Stephen Moore here on the WMA yell with the ... were live on this Saturday ah let me ask you a a question I'm ... and that is the idea that spoke about what Sam Nunberg earlier um do\nYou believe it would benefit and it's something that should the president should do between now and the uh the midterms and there's not a lot of times\nTo do it but it's like kind of an Oval Office address in prime time\nAnd and lay out all the accomplishments that he's made and he could certainly lead with the economy or he he you know and I think that's what he should lead with 'em and spell out just because you know not everybody Stevens you know not everybody watches the news and when they get the news certainly for they don't get to the truth or the important story so\nLay out the economic gains lay out the Supreme Court gains lay on the foreign policy ... gains and and have this Oval Office address and tell the people\nWhat is at stake if they hand over Congress to the Democrats\n[noise] but I think that's you know that's what Trump is doing now I mean he's going out on the campaign trail and saying look this this of this recovery the boom didn't happened by accident that happened because of you know the the the policies that he's put in place that\nThat the Republican Congress have enacted and you know I'm listening to what the Democrats are saying on the campaign trail and like I'm not a huge uh\nIf he's put in place that that the Republican Congress enacted and you know I'm listening to what the Democrats are saying on the campaign trail and like I'm not a huge apologize for Republicans I don't like the way they're spending money Steve you and I talked about that they're spending way too much money in Washington and Republicans deserve a lot of the blame for that\nBut Democrats are running on repealing the Trump tax cut\nI mean how stupid it was that was caught we pass the tax cuts the economy has grown faster than we are going to get four percent growth for the third quarter we have for for ... percent growth for the second quarter of a bomb on an eight years never came anywhere near those numbers and the first thing the Democrats want to do is reversed the policies\nI mean it would be one thing if the policies weren't working but\nBut they clearly our you know and that I just don't understand the Democratic logic and then of course the running on Medicaid for Medicare for all\nAnd I have a a peace out in the Washington Times I'm just going to do a little highlight of that on Monday that that shows that under that plant and Steve a hundred and fifty seven million one hundred and fifty seven million Americans will lose their private sector or the private employment health care if you if you're ... by your employer\nThose plans are made illegal under the Bernie Sanders Medicare for all and and I don't you don't even have that system of you know if you like your healthcare you can keep it\nUm they're not even saying that they're pushing everybody into a into Medicare which will mean a hundred and fifty seven million Americans will involuntarily lose their private health insurance\nThat is frightening and that's got to be that friday night and talked about and and gotten out there certainly seems let me let me just ask you and I'm sure we'll have opportunity to talk again before but but I'm looking ahead um how optimistic are you that ah that the president can\nAccomplish more you know once the midterms are done and once the new Congress is sworn in whatever that make up might be Kenny accomplish more economically\nI think this that I think there's boomers just getting started Steve I think that's because last another two or three years\nI I'm really bullish on the stock market I'm not saying that in the next couple of weeks it's going to be strong but I think over the next six months and urine to as we continue to expand I mean Trump shut it very well the United states is now the envy of the world\nAnd the only thing that's out there that is you know an uncertainty right now is this trade situation with China but I tell you if he wins this trade war with China and I believe he will use this economy has got its ... for the moon it really is I mean there's nothing that hold us back\nAll right so how could people a pre order ... feet on the on the inside\nStory of Donald Trump's\nAmerica First policy it will be out on October twenty nights and a Steve I've already uh I just got the orders then today already such an autographed copy so uh I you know you you ah have been such a good friend of mine over the years that Larry Kudlow examine our laugh or so we wanted to make sure you were one of the first people to get a copy\nWell I appreciate that and I will see what the er at the book party I'm thrilled about that so thank you for inviting me to that and maybe we'll speak again on these very same airwaves before that I Do it even more always a pleasure and an honor sir\nYou two of my friends have a great wakeup\nDaycare Stephen Moore ladies and gentlemen wow um I mean that's\nThat's it it is amazing and it it does every so many things that Steven just said that he feels that\nDoes this boom is just getting started it could sustain itself for the next two or three years that's very encouraging because there's so many naysayers out there who predict doom and gloom uh constantly especially as it relates to the stock market um\nAnd this this nightmare scenario of the the the socialist plan a Bernie Sanders in the left to just destroy but but the finishing touches on destroying what Obama's started\nOr finishing with Obama started which is the destruction of uh our health care system as we know it\nYou won't have your doctor you didn't have your doctor with Obama in many many many cases\nDespite his uh promises to the contrary\nHis allies but this is a\nDisaster waiting to happen and people don't get it if health care is the main topic of concern that the top of the list of voters as I've seen claimed over and over again heading into the midterms\nWell then then then maybe that's what Donald Trump does his ah his his his Oval Office address in prime\nThe chaos this will create for everybody\nBut it's even say a hundred and fifty seven million people\nI mean this has to get out there it's all well and good and I hope everybody in you know in the country reads the Washington\nOr I think he said times Washington Times piece that's coming out next week on this but they want\nThe president has to reach the people in and and the rallies are great\nI'm just Washington Times piece that's coming out next week on this but they want\nThe president has to reach the people and and and the rallies or great they're fantastic I Love watching them\nOr you know I Wish there was more you know I'm a live TV\nCoverage of them and even Fox has a decided not to go live they just monitor it for news as they say which you know I understand to an extent\nBut that's that's great for the people there and it's great for allowing the news media to pick and choose the stories but they're not going to criticize Bernie Sanders plan they're not going to tell you what Trump spells out at those rallies Trump needs to do this at a in a in an Oval Office address\nThe congressional leaders every candidate running every congressional candidate running in senatorial candidate running and in the house it's all of
