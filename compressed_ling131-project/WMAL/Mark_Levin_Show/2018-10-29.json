show scary thing\nBut first it's time for our smart home technology report\nSingle one of his does every single\nDay right there in our very own homes charging our smartphone it's an important topic because after all so much of our lives and our real estate happens on our phones these days so you need to keep that phone or charged up\nBut you know how phones keep getting better and better well part of those improvements involve charging improvements that can help make that daily chores easier and faster than ever\nThere are two types of new charging check you need to know about one is high speed charging the other is wireless charging we'll talk about both of them starting with high speed\nThe company Qualcomm came out with what it calls quick charge a few years ago and many of the more recent phones habit\nBasically a charges your phone from zero to eighty percent in about a half hour now that's really fast and then this beep slows down to protect the battery and the rest of the charge takes about sixty minutes\nNow not all phones have it but you can find a list of the ones that do that the Qualcomm quick charge website just search quick charge\nOkay so quick charge is great but you still have to plug it in right well right but that's another area where the tech has gotten better\nThe old us be many conductors word the industry standard but you had to put them in right side up or they wouldn't go in\nToday's us be seeking actors can be plugged in right side up poor upside down and they work just fine same goes for the very latest thunder both connection called thunder ... three\nOkay so that's high speed charging now wireless charging wireless chargers don't plug into your phone at all rather there cradle or desks or square blocks and when you get home\nUrging wireless chargers don't plug into your phone at all rather there cradle or desks or square blocks and when you get home just put your phone on it done no plugs no cable just put the phone down and let the charging began\n[laughter] knowing yourself going into the transaction could shine some light or those dark little corners of mortgage lending a scary thing to come out to make you uncomfortable you know if you know who you are as a bar or no or your finances are no what you want do what you can borrow\nYou can go on with confidence and that won't scare anybody wife\nThat's

N. A. L. real estate K your home Nineteen your biggest investment\nThat with our special show scary thing our annual tribute to Halloween which is this coming Wednesday\nAnd of course one of the scariest things in real estate is coming up with it down\nYou know which is this coming Wednesday\nAnd of course one of the scariest things in real estate is coming up with a down payment\nIn our first hour we talked about new research from the Urban Institute about barriers to homeownership and how coming up with that down payment is so frightening to some people\nThey don't even try to buy a house but those fears are largely unfounded because sure some people are not ready to buy but many who are\nThey think they need more money than they really do and amazing as it may seem most people don't know that their state or county or city probably has down payment assistance programs ready willing and able to help homebuyers get into that house\nLet's talk about that now joining us once again is Rob ... with the organization down payment resource Rob launched downpayment resource to connect eligible home buyers and eligible properties where it's hard to find a down payment programs Rob thanks for coming back on real estate today\nIt's great to be with you again okay so Rob let's talk about those down payment assistance programs\nFirst of all it's not just for first time buyers every time correct\nCorrect and I say that for two reasons one is that\nPart of that is because the definition that's normally used for first time homebuyer as an older home the last three years so you could have a lot over the past and not own a home for three years\nFor these purposes is still ate the first time homebuyer requirement also there are in our database probably about thirty six percent of the programs do at any first time homebuyer requirement\nInteresting and another thing Rob a down payment assistance programs [noise] you don't have to necessarily heavy starter wage to qualify I understand that people can actually be making a really good amount of money and still get the assistance\nThat's absolutely correct a lot of it has to do with\nWhere you live because they are ... household income limits on these programs they not only Barry from program the program but they vary from state to state city to city region to region so if you live in high cost areas the area median income\nIs going to be higher than low cost areas so depending on where you live you might be able to make over a hundred thousand dollars in your household and still qualify for one of these programs\nThat is amazing so Rob how to our listeners learn more about down payment resource and the down payment help that might be available to them\nBut they can go down payment resource dot com and\nButton that says find programs and to her about six or eight pieces of information about their\nHousehold\nAnd then that says civil tell how many programs they're eligible for and\nTell us about those programs where to find that money most importantly right that if I die you're eligible for money or a pass to get there at that and it's just that it will tell them that they'll tell them not only where the where where to find the money where the participating lenders participating education spiders and so forth\nI see so let me back up just for one minute if I learned that I Am eligible for down payment assistance [noise] they don't just write me ... all that happens\nDuring the mortgage application process\nExactly exactly so it's really important when you were\nLooking for a home to find a lender as a lender before you go out looking for all actually that's that's the first step because you don't want to get excited about trying to figure out if you go for Ford it or not but when you're talking to different lenders\nThing that you are they sure do is ask what downpayment assistance programs they participate in that letter participates I think that the lenders that don't necessarily participate in every program\nFor the most large metro areas have dozens of programs so really find out first when you talk to the lenders that can help it with these programs\nBut is great advice and Rob I really appreciate you coming on the show today and talking about\nThe latest report barriers to homeownership by the Urban Institute and also the ways the down payment resource can help people find the money they need to put down in the house thank you for being here\nThank you Steve and it's always great to be with you I appreciate the opportunity\nYou're very welcome Rob

I think it's important for your authorities to see what they can do to prevent\nThe next attack and uses armed guards at many of your senator yeah that's\nThat's a reality but unfortunately Jews face around the world if you go to London and offend a God you are more likely than not to see actually a policeman\nOr police car outside same thing in Paris same thing in Brussels and other places around the world that you don't want to see that happen in America I Do think that on high holidays well Shawn and you'll keep port many synagogues you do have a local law enforcement authorities at least since nine eleven\nBut this is just choose going about their business praying\nAnd in a synagogue on a on a Saturday morning and to think that every single synagogue and America needs that type of protection protection is\nIs sad but unfortunately at least for the foreseeable future it might it might be necessary not only to protect the population a but to give them a sense of security one thing that's important is for political leaders to speak out very very strongly against that I was very pleased to hear\nFrom President Trump I thought he had you know what the strongest combinations frankly I have ever heard I've never heard of non Israeli non Jewish leader to say that those who try to destroy the Jews we will destroy them I've never heard that from any leader\nAnd not only was it that I did uh did was I heartened to hear the president of United States say that but I was heartened to hear the calls he got from the people who were at that rally in Illinois when he said that\nUh and it's important for people on the right to spit out the extremists among them to David Dukes it's important for people on the left to spit out the extremists like Louis Farrakhan and others and to say that there's no place for this type of hatred in the United states\nPlano mainstream conservatives of never consider themselves for writer embrace David do we repudiate people like that but we do have a growing bbs movement in this country it's growing in our college campuses quite frankly it's growing in the left and there's haters everywhere every breed of every stripe and so forth and so on\nBut in some ways it's getting more and more mainstream the the UN is rabidly anti Semitic the bbs movement which is in mainstream did many with many corporations and many organizations and and political organizations in Europe and even somewhat in the United states\nThis again this is this is intended as an anti Semitic anti ... anti Israel movement do you see this growing to\nNo question about it I mean for many years to the un has been ground zero Francis Semitism and holding Israel up to standard holds no other nation on earth when you have you know two thirds of the journal recently general assembly U.N General assembly resolutions against Israel\nThat's got to tell you something when you have more resolutions passed against Israel and the un human rights council that all the countries of the world combined\nUm that's got to tell you something and this is a deep problem people thought it was a thing of the past it's not a it's a very serious and it's growing and that's why it's so important you know there there's a an old saying that you know it starts with the Jews but it never end\nIf not a it's a very serious and it's growing and that's why it's so important you know there there's a an old saying that you know it starts with the Jews but it never ends with ... we have always been seen as the canary of the ... in the coal mine in of civilization so when you have those noxious fumes that are directed at the Jews\nIt's not going to end there it's going to spread and that's why it's very important for people to frankly mark put politics aside and stand together whether you're on the right a conservative or liberal whether you're a Republican or Democrat\nAnd and they noted this kind of hate and and the lead by showing that this type of bigotry this type of hatred will have no sanctions and the United states of America\nYou know I agree completely with putting politics aside but I've been watching as I'm sure you have in the United states\nIt's our media and its politics first second and third it's politics morning noon and night it's politics trumped responsible for this is Trump is a Trump this is Trump this and this killer this mass murder there's this Jew hater he hated Trump\nHe didn't like Trump decided to many Jews around now you have in President Donald Trump made my view the the greatest supporter of Israel any American president\nHe's knowledge that Jerusalem is the capital the president did that before he's moved our embassy to Jerusalem they all promised they never did it before he took this Iran deal which was passed by Congress\nAnd the prior administration which gave tens of billions of dollars to the terrorists regime which has the United states in Israel and its sights he said no more to that\nI mean from my perspective as an American as a conservative who's who's been watching this stuff for a long long time this president has been the best friend of the Jewish state certainly during my lifetime [noise]\nYeah I mean I I I've said this before or we've never had a strong supporter of Israel with President Trump\nA and frankly it hasn't even been close in terms of what he's done I mean you look at some of those things that he's gone you have a a Nikki Haley ambassador Haley at the un pushing back against all this anti Israel sentiment obviously the decision of Jerusalem and the case to be looking round the most anti Semitic regime and the\nPlanet they call for the annihilation of one and only two state and you have Hezbollah\nUh care proxy of Iran did actually one of his ... leaders said a few years ago that he hoped all the dreams will come to Israel so we can wipe them out there so the president of the United states stood up to the entire world and withdrew from the nuclear deal with Iran\nHas restored sanctions and against Iran and\nDoing so he started this anti Semitic terrorist regime of hundreds of billions of dollars that would be used to pick your dreams\nAnd promoter uh Israelis are and and also to putting all of our Arab neighbors and everything else one good thing that came out of that that nuclear deal it's brought Israel and the Arab world closer together but we we appreciate very much in a very grateful for that support and like I said I'm very grateful that the president so forcefully\nA condemned or the anti Semitic attack and I I think it is very very important I think if people think that all of these things happen\nOr because of President Trump's election ... they're just cutting themselves they don't understand the history of anti Semitism it's not only the world's longest hatred older sacred it's the most malleable hatred I mean Jews or [noise] or\nHad been attacked and read all for being a capital for being a communist for being the biggest stars for being the biggest hawks for being called for being cold you know ethnic separatists\nHaters can always find a reason to hate things and it's been going on for a long time and I hope one positive thing that can come out of this horrific a act is that people will stand together against anti Semitism ... President Trump is not the reason why you have like Jeremy Corbyn\nIn Europe or the head of the British Labour Party who's an anti Semite it's not the reason why you have all these attacks and a half for many years in Europe against Jews unfortunately this thing is\nThey've come here to the United states and ... and has now killed eleven uh worshipers in in school he'll uh Pittsburgh but if anything can come out of it hopefully people can stand together and put politics aside understand that there are people who were anti Semite sides\nAnd people should stand together against his and call out the anti Semite on the side of the political ...\nNot just calling it when it's on the other side but calling it on your own side whether it's David Duke whether it was fair con wherever comes whether it's on a college campus with people trying to single out Israel and the same and demonize Israel and make all these wild charges that Israel's in apartheid state of racist state a perpetrator of tennis thought\nWhich I think triggers a lot of people put a level of hatred towards Israel the kids don't see of any other country just demonization wherever it is people have to stand up to it and I think in protecting the cruise I think they're going to be protecting everybody\nAlready ... Israeli appreciate your time God Bless them think\nPeople have to stand up to it I think in protecting because I think they're going to be protecting everybody\nAll right and bass around armor of Israel we appreciate your time God Bless them thank you sir thank you [noise] he's really good okay I've laid out he's laid it out any objective news organization\nShould be laying this house but

... the media's focus\nThose health care exchanges that is the national average things a hundred and two percent which is terrible but in Missouri it's a hundred and forty five percent families just can't afford their insurance that's because of Obamacare it's because of Claire McCaskill she won't support any plan that isn't Obamacare because she's a she's a big government liberal\n[laughter] now she going on about Medicare for all or is she duct that won\n... seats she tries to duck because he says he's open to it you know she's open to it of course we all know that that\nWe're this is headed and we all know that that this she'll never vote against her party I mean she never does on ... any major issue an issue consequences and you know my worry is look they cut seven hundred and sixteen

that the polished all private insurance and basically turn us into one ... right\nExactly exactly and you know the fact is Senator McCaskill has voted already to cut that seven hundred and sixteen billion dollars out of Medicare that's money that goes to hospitals\nThat goes to home health services money that was supposed to go to hospice they cut all of that\nTo pay for Obamacare which of course is driven prices up through the ceiling here\nAnd now they now they want to cut further and that and take it all away and it's just part of their plan they all just like they want to throw the borders are just like they want to go back to uh allowing trade cheaters to take away our jobs are this is the wrong agenda for this country and I tell you mark all at stake here in Missouri because
