for everything you do have a bad heart but you you keep a company\nOh goodness [laughter]\nAnd looking for this book coming out my husband's a cop so I Can't wait to this particular that's great\nI wanted to ask you a question you were just talking about um people you know ... with the last two eleven and women and supporting women and all that good stuff and I don't think the doctor for its\nLawyers really care about her care about women because I thought um I just kind of thought with general on a former marine cells I just kinda with um General Flynn lying to the FBI maybe or didn't lie to the FBI not sure\nKind of thought he was maybe getting in trouble going to jail and I thought with Martha Stewart maybe not inside of training but I'm going to maybe going to jail for maybe lying to the FBI\nUm if if the left cares about her including the Democrats and all these people I mean it says right here Christine Ford's attorney said they haven't heard from an FBI cabinet investigation why would they want the FBI to ask one question\nIf the FBI ask one question just something like hey do you fly on airplanes she's done she's the only job\nBut none of them but here's here's the thing to the FBI right oh I agree with you but they're not doing a criminal investigation\n... this is what judge the pollen tunnel doesn't understand or many other people all they're doing this is not a criminal investigation where people you know plead the ... and that sort of saying what it is is they're trying to ask people about the various allegations that were made and that's it\nRight now under title Eighteen\nWhat title Eighteen is a big title you mean a section of thousand and one false statements yes\nYeah I mean that's ... that's possible but again they're not doing a criminal investigation they're doing a background investigation of people have different opinions and so forth [noise] they're doing a criminal investigation they would have to be issuing letters they would have to go through a completely different formalized process\nUh then they're going to know if they want to do search they get warrants probable cause it's none of that was\nOnly understand but if that's what they want because obviously they want to watch the terms they don't care about the client is what I'm saying because they want to think of course we all know to drag it out but they don't care about the victim is what I was getting at we know what they want but they don't want this state and when Kavanaugh which ones so happy for him but um\nI get out but they don't care about the victim that's what I was getting at we know what they want ... they don't want this they don't want ... know which one ... but I'm happy for what's going on but I mean I Am just the sky for that we know they don't want ... but for them for a one justice they dragged this out\n... the way as you want justice for the victim you go into the Montgomery County police department and you make out ... complaint and see where that goes and they won't do it All right I'm Jed do get your point I Hope you feel well or given your week hard I Know they're showing I've got one myself but you hang in there\nLet us go to Steve Los Angeles California [noise] eight Seventy the answer ... right ahead\n... first of all thank you for all that you do you and your partner and crime are Sean Hannity I don't know what we would you would ...\nBut are you kind of touched on what I was going to bring up and maybe I Need a little more understanding common sense would dictate ... they don't need the FBI does not need to talk to the judge or doctor forward but why not for the sake of appearing ...\nNot about appearances they had unlimited amount of time listen the parents is not is not going to assuage the left it's just not\nIn so we on the right we have to start to understand there's ... constitutional ... it's not about um a past time the media ... pacify the Democrats don't you understand they wanna destroy what we believe in yes\n... and so we can do twenty five FBI investigations unless there's one where they can hang our hat on it's not going to matter\n... these are the same people who said the man is guilty ... job interview and that ... the ... and ... and that the uh\nUh the due process doesn't apply because it's a job interview does anybody really think that if it looks better the FBI interview the two others that somehow you'll bring over Chuck Schumer Chuck Schumer is a bomb thrower\n[laughter] that's what we're up against against truly diabolical

this guy's got problems right here we are two years later I might tell you that this guy is a rock star and a genius and and is is bearing these guys which is very very fun to watch but anyhow\nAnd then they carry four to eight curious force that doctor that he\nThat that was the one that did all this uh investigation on itself because tropic forced Trump to go through all the medical hoops and from that and this guy gets left and carnage as well because he came out said they didn't have all that he was very sounded very held right right and what a what a bunch of\n... says it's maddening as you as your conveying as well but ah anyhow that's a bunch of people that will work with a nobody ever came I Apologize for for saying that Trump was the manager or has all that that's a crazy

majority of the Senate you're not going to get the Three Stooges so it'd be a sideshow\nAnd uh my my next question would be if you could give us a sort of a thumbnail sketch of what a what happened with a Forman a Supreme Court I mean as far as\nVoting for now ... or ... or for person sorry well\nIf they vote for the for that means the holding in the circuit court below stands\nOkay and and there's there's there's no such thing as a recess appointment for Supreme Court now there could be that well I mean that would\nBe it could have a recess appointment for court wouldn't last very long which is why they don't do it [noise] oh you do is you get a certain senators including Republican senators angry but or you could do it but the goal here is a lifetime appointment not an appointment for a year or two\nThat just [noise] you know hopefully something that would be a phone and their side and\nWe need to listen and we need to we need we need to stop acting like losers and be on the defense here we need to ram this through now worried about recess appointments and ... and all the rest these people need to be crushed\nAnd so if you really want to do something you call one of the Three Stooges are you'd be polite to them and civil to them and I don't have to be on the air but you should and tell them that this is very very important to you and you're going to be watching what they doing in the case of member Cal skin Collins a true or you take this very very seriously\n[noise] All right my friend thanks for your call Frank Philadelphia, Pennsylvania the great W. P. H. T. go\nMark thanks for taking my call for me I'm very concerned that I don't think\nUnder and the impact that this Kavanaugh hearing is having on due process in this country and on and folks should be weaker out rates because your process is gone then the country's gone you're somebody who who are\nHere's judge Kavanaugh of a crime and rather than the burden of proof being on the accuser which is due process the burden of proof is on the accused and not only that but now the accuser gets to determine what is\nJustified proof he has a calendar well that's not good at all the witnesses say that that he didn't do it or he wasn't there that's not good enough we need an FBI investigation that's not good enough and then he's not even allowed to point to the inconsistencies of the accuser\nFord and all the lie that no no no you're not allowed to talk to her she's she's the victim mark if I can just go around accusing people they don't mark you hate women well I have a daughter yeah but that's not good enough well but I work with yeah but that and now it's up to you to prove to me that you don't\nDo process has done and and I don't know ... I mean I Want to have it ought to be voted but this is so much bigger than justice Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court this is the country and I and I don't feel that folks really understand the impact of\nI think a lot too I really do maybe not enough that I think there's a rising tide here and you put it very very beautifully Frank very well put thank you for your call we'll be right back was\nWashington Mall W.
