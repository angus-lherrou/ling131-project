is give Brett Kavanaugh due process the right to cross examination the right to get in front of the six users the right to be in the same room and look her in the eye which the Senate denied and now that we took ... know Jeff Flake\nOddly enough it was a good thing it took an extra week because conservative media tore apart the story of Christian afford improve that she was either a ... or or lie

I got the picture and immediately hurried off\nAnd um that was it and other people came up their picture taken with him and he was uneasy didn't want it to happen seat Neil Armstrong was an engineer\nHe didn't see themselves as a pilot and the furthest thing from the truth was a hero he taught for seven years at University of Cincinnati in the school of engineering and every student had him said he was a wonderful teacher a great professor very bright\nBut when you see the University of Cincinnati approached him do named the skilled of engineering that Neal a Armstrong school of engineering but that makes sense\nBut that makes sense that the school of engineering after Cincinnati so Neil Armstrong answer it but yes but Neal said absolutely not I don't want my name on buildings I don't want that and within a few months he left you see\nAnd what he did at that point was simply serve on boards of directors had a farm in Warren County which is a county north of Cincinnati\nAnd you see I see I'm Out now and then it events but nobody would ever know that that was Neil Armstrong that was the man who walked on the moon because he never carried himself away in any way that Neal was any special than anyone else\nSo in the movie comes out on friday you're going to see the actual real depiction of nice\nIn any way that Neal was any special than anyone else\nSo when the movie comes out on friday you're going to see the actual real depiction of Neil Armstrong and al ... was to go to the moon and Nineteen sixty nine when there was less than a fifty fifty chance it would come back alive and in fact NASA drafted a two page statement\nTelling the American people that Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin did not make it\nAnd that there forever lost in space because that was the probability of what was going to happen the odds are going there and coming back and being successful and living was less than fifty fifty but Neal took that risk in fact could live with other men took it over the next three years\nAnd we're not going back to the moon since [noise] continue with your call\nBack to the topic was a talk show hosts a privilege to call his eight seven seven three one tree aid wouldn't want to\nSee that movie hit a fabulous movie movie reminded me of the ten commandments counting of the great American Richard while to my point nine cats at\nJimmy let me explain there's the also in the beginning you might recall the first few weeks the Trump Administration was traditional temp telephone calls with world leaders\nAnd so they organize left inside the federal government would release transcripts of the president's private telephone calls with world leaders in order to debase him diminish him\nAnd to marginalize our new president he never had a chance to get his feet on the ground to do the traditional things that were presidents had done because the radical left inside the federal government worked against them from day one\nRight and that helps that helps Iran North Korea Russia and China in fact the senator from Beijing which is what Dianne Feinstein is known as in New York by the Chinese here\nThe senator from Beijing this is foreign influence in our government a foreign agent of red China ...
