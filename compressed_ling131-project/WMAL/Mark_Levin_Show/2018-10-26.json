Freeman and so forth\nAnd then for him and his party to suggest that true supported by neo Nazis when in fact you're the biggest voice for the state of Israel in the United States House of representatives my jaw hit the floor\nAnd I think it was so ridiculous that I think voters just just flat about all I mean give me a break and this was from a guy who actually opposes having our embassy in Jerusalem he opposes recognizing Jerusalem\nIsrael's capital and he's been endorsed by this radical left wing group dream defenders they actually signed a pledge to the group\nSaying he would support this radical manifest so they are ... and this group dream defenders one of their main things\nIs boycotting Israel bbs they say Israel the genocidal apartheid state so that's the group he stands with he will not disavowed which group that that is who he is\nAnd I'm actually just today there was a group of we're thirty eight sheriffs\nIn Florida right give them a letter asking him to get sort of our dream defenders because ah the pledge that Gillum signed a sad that police in prison have no place injustice they want to abolish\nAre basically traditional law enforcement get funded and then spend the money on welfare programs at the very radical stuff it's drifting what's hatred for men and women\nAre in law enforcement and it's just totally unacceptable and go I'm he will not budge I mean we can buy that and and that's just unacceptable presser yeah for him to say that I was I'm\nSure are they going to the total ... voters are sick of\nPeople on the left or just lashing out why grad at folks and and I could get really backfired big time [noise]\nYou know when you sign a petition you know you're putting your signature to it so there's no confusion [noise]\nAny signs of petition in favor of boycotting Israel he signed a petition in favor of moving police officers outta prisons and more than that as you pointed out but I don't think the moderator quite comprehended what you were saying [noise]\nYou're talking about he says abolish ice and moving under the Justice Department I don't know how that changes anything moving ice from one a building to another building as somebody who served as chief of staff to the attorney general his problem is he rejects law enforcement\nAnd your point was this one is a criminal alien served time in a state prison in Florida\nThe doors open and they're either turned over to the fetch who deport them or they come into your neighborhood and he supports that person going into your neighborhood and not being deported isn't that basically his position\nYeah I asked him on Sunday night's debate of cayenne will you honor a dictator requests they're called Decatur is when the federal government wants to take a criminal illegals coming out of program\nWill you honor detain requests from Donald Trump's ice agency he would not say he would do about it so if you say oh I don't want criminals on the shape of the matter is he pledged not to cooperate with by this idea that all he wants to do is move it under the Justice Department mark you know about him trying to backtrack off its position\nYou know where he was running ads in the primary thing abolish I equate bay one open borders that's what the far left one\nAnd he was playing to the bay so the idea that all he wants to do with like administrative tweak a he's lying when he says that ah he wants to abolish the agency because he doesn't want immigration enforcement\n[noise] now when we come back after the bottom of the hour run to scientists by the way what is your website Ron\nRon ... dot com\nI was going to put it up on my social sites ladies and gentleman runs being big time outspent\nThis guy's Soros behind them you've got Styron behind them all the left wing billionaires and left wing groups they're targeting Florida they know if they take Florida it's going to be very difficult to win the presidency and the future and again behind a true\nBernie Sanders George Soros people for the American way which is so he works\nFor radical when we come back I Want to ask Ron to censor certain FBI investigation that's been taking place in Tallahassee where this guy was mayor and Mr Guillen connection to it and there is a connection to it will be right back won all five points on FM in\nSee where this guy was mayor and Mr Guillen connection to it and there is a connection to it will be right back on a five point not F\nSo it's it's it's definitely an ongoing investigation I mean by that much richer um interesting we re ran an ad uh basically uh talking about all this problem and his attorney wrote a cease and desist letter to the station and then the letter the attorney said\nA public reports have said that Andrew is not the subject\nOf the investigation but as you know mark some of these bugs words you can be a subject of an investigation you can also be a target of the investigation his own campaign attorney\nDid not put in that letter that Andrew is not a target he just said he ... about a subject so that to me is is a is an interesting mission uh because the bottom line is\nWhy would they be investigating corruption in city hall if it had nothing to do with the mayor you wouldn't have had those FBI agents around him on these trips like they round\nAnd round ascendancy immediately tried to racialized suspicion that the reason you were bringing it up and for that matter I guess a local media is bringing up is because of his race\nNow last time I checked it has nothing to do with somebody's race when there's an undercover agent giving somebody I'm of value to try and see if they'll take it any tuck it has nothing to do with race and I notice he tried to do this over and over and over again in this campaign to me asking question your running mate who is your running mate\nOh her name is Jeanette noon yeah she's a state representative from Miami\nShe's a Cuban American\nCuban American and then when we get elected she'll be the highest ranking female Hispanic I'm a history of Florida government\nI noticed the media doesn't talk much about that\nOf course not but I'll tell you with Andrew lashing out like this I mean when you start talking about corruption people understand about black or white it's about right versus wrong and if you're using this office to feather euro ness white games are dead\nAnd math problem it's interesting mark there wasn't just a the illegal stuff that he died when he was on the Tallahassee city commission or he did vote to raise property taxes on people but he also voted to increase his own retirement benefits\nBy tens of thousands of dollars basically doubling his pay fine so he wanted people how happy to pay more and he wanted somebody to go directly into his pocket so he's always been a self dealing politician or whether ... whether it's legal votes like that which are corrupt anyway\nOr illegal activity like accepting the Hamilton ticket and turning around and given the guy the deal they want it\nAnywhere for this group people for American way is that correct\nAnd here's the thing about that that's a very ultra liberal groups so if you look at people for the American way filing may say they pay Andrew Gillum Mrs ... mayor a hundred and thirty thousand dollars a year to work forty hours a week\nWell the mayor of Tallahassee if the full time job so how how was he working forty hours a week\nFor people for the American way so one of two things are true either he is actually doing that in which case he than black thing that people have power happy which may explain why they had the highest number of murders and the history of the city last year and have one of the most part they have the highest crime rate in Canada or\nHe ain't working forty hours a week and that's all just a fraud and he's basically accepting money without performing services so one or the other uh is problematic no matter which way you\nKnow I'm a little confusing I bet the nation is in the Floridians are too [noise] you can be mayor and have a side job with a group like people for the American way founded by Norman Lear at a Hollywood entered a hundred and forty thousand dollars on the side\nWell yeah and I think the big question is their\nPeople for the American way so that was in exchange for him working forty hours a week I think he probably wasn't doing forty hours a week I think they were just trying to funnel money to them but if he was working forty hours a week to them\nAbout make the people tell me feel you know they have the just out of control crime problem he's raising their taxes he's doing all these gang\nAnd yet he's working for the left wing group so it's a problem either right but it's interesting even though the documents are out there\nUm journalists do not pursue that at all I mean if I if I Walk on the wrong side of the sidewalk you know they tried to do a do different stories on me so it's definitely a double standard I mean it's an obvious question that would really that should be investigated by the press\nI Want to hit to other things before you go and then is health care and taxes [noise]\nHe uh has talked about Medicare for all this is the big left wing push Medicare for all and it's been pointed out Medicare for all means everyone on Medicare loses Medicare\nEveryone when they don't employ your private employer health care plan loses their private employer health care plan every union member who's union as they go shaded at ...\nDon't employer private employer health care plan loses their private employer health care plan every union member who's union as they go shaded healthcare plan they will lose their health care plan everybody will lose their health care that they have now with\nSome theories some ... some concoction they'll create or Washington DC will have the scientists that system whether you like it or not whenever you have today disappears and what does this response to this and he would eliminate all existing health care plans for everybody that's on them including Medicare\nOne little correction market it eliminates I think that for about three hundred million people the two things that Bernie has built keeps\nOur the VA in the Indian Health service so now I guess that means that all that Elizabeth Warren has a one one thousand percent her health care if they do there but bottom line is right so here's response is when I called them out on that was basically to act\nLike he didn't know what I was talking about he was running for emotional saying single payer Medicare for all two months ago but he realizes that that is toxic and Florida because we have senior citizens who have their arrangement they've been paying into Medicare Medicare Advantage program\nWe have obviously millions of people who earn their health benefits through their employer um through their employment\nAnd he would take all of that way you have no choice you get dumped just as you said dumped on a single payer which we know will cause a tax increase it it will bankrupt ah\nIt'll hemorrhage money and so they'll have to ration and so yeah you may have the right to have all this great stuff but you're not going to find a doctor that's got to be able to perform that there'll be waiting lines and we know the drill and all that so\nThat is not popular once people know what it is and so basically he just tried to run away from it as much as he can even go in the primary he with gang they got the way to get your when we're in Florida so we're going to keep reminding voters\nAbout let me think about that taxes now I mean one one of the reasons a lot of people come to Florida from these blue states as you don't have an income tax\nAnd that's also one of the reasons you have such a dynamic economy and such a diverse economy in Florida and I have a home in Florida so I've seen I've seen the difference between a no tax income tax day and I have a home and I my primary residence in Virginia and an income tax state\nI cannot believe with all the proposals he's making says I've never supported a state income tax that's what these guys do I saw an in Connecticut years ago and so forth so I'm not an favorite and then they push and push the spending and the debt and then either\nThey push for an income tax or some court orders an income tax he supports an income tax and in truth Disney\nSo there was a study done a nonpartisan studied and analyze all his spending proposals and the conclusion of the study was here in order to make it work he would either need to do one or two things have a state wide sales tax\nOf thirty eight percent or impose a state income tax which could reach as high as thirty five percent so those are the only two realistic routes\nHe would be able to pay for because you know he wants to pay for single payer health care he wants to pay for free college he wants to do all this other stuff and that's what it would cost so you go down that road a Florida is done economically I mean it would totally critical our economy and cripple our state and we obviously can't let that happen um at all\n[noise] Fifteen dollar minimum wage Seattle tried it it's been a complete failure\nAll these cities at trying or what they wind up doing is the the the people who are earning minimum wage or low wages they're the ones who were punished\nBecause what happens is people get fired small restaurants can't afford it even changed can't afford it\nAnd so the price of food goes up less people go into these outlets and go into these places and people lose jobs they lose tips I mean this doesn't help people actually mandating at Fifteen dollar minimum wage when it has this consequences does it\nSo mark I started off blue collar kid I had to work forty hours a week before I got to college I work all these jobs for six bucks an hour through college\nI wouldn't have been able to get through without that and it Illinois policies were in place\nI Would not have made Fifteen an hour I Would have made Niro they would not have had the opportunity for any of those jobs and so what he will do is he will put hundreds of thousands of people out of work he will cause businesses to shut down businesses to leave the shade on but here's the thing markets Seattle thing you mentioned\nA lot of the people who who who kept their jobs and they get a pay increase to five Fifteen they still ended up with less take home pay because their hours got reduce by the ... so it's really been counterproductive and all the evidence points that way but yet he's ... he doesn't care and this is what he's running not\nParticularly a harmful to young people are trying to get their first job particularly harmful in minority communities people trying to get their first job [noise] same with his open borders policies that particularly\nFirst job particularly harmful in minority communities people trying to get their first

you're Gillum mentioned it and one of the debate summer pushing for the right of felons to vote while they're in prison\nBut let's talk about the facts here it's Florida\nPushing for the ride of felons to vote while they're in prison but let's talk about the facts here\nIt's Florida he should have\nBeen removed from the voter registration list because he lost his right to vote and it could not be restored until and unless he applied to the Florida clemency board and was approved\nFlorida is one of the states that does not does not automatically restore the ride of felons to vote when they get out of prison even though it's to Mike by the way they go so left but a referendum on the upcoming November ballot Arnie of honor nice to do exactly that\nWith other vehicles for the federal

cops Wednesday\nWhen a pod cast ... to ... you can listen to this Florida listen to this America cut Thirteen go\nUm I've got to let them know and I find I totally know on both police accountability\nBut law enforcement society cannot work quite frankly law enforcement can do it John heavy trusting relationship with the community at the time that a law enforcement official and go to a weapon to a gun to all the time to a taser they may have already have to go too far by their very presence\nBy the very trust that they had a fire in community and inside he is supposed to be able to bring most situations you\nKnow this is sick and this man is sick from a a philosophical ideological perspective eased a radical\n\nHe's sick from a philosophical and political perspective\nHe knows this not to be true\nYou have\nCriminals in society including in poor neighborhoods who cannot be reason with rapists\nMurderers would be rapist would be murders robbers wouldn't be robbers and so forth and so on\nAt the time that a law enforcement official has to go to a weapon to a gun to a baton to a taser then they have already gone too far by their very presence by the very trust that\nAlready gone too far by their very presence\n\nBy the very trust that they inspiring community and its society they are supposed to be able to bring most situations the he'll\nHave this incredible\nAnd Debbie Wasserman Schultz has no problem with this she thinks he's great because of the news conference today in support of Andrew Gillum here's what she had to say cut twelve go\nI just want to share with you [noise]\nWho are taking care of the people I represent every single day [noise]\nHail with that kind of\nWhile serving like a six [noise]\nAnd so we're going to make sure\nIt's one of the reasons that we have to like the Andrew Gillum\nGot\nScores were saying that we can stand up for the values of this community\nAnd the values of the community is to trash the cops even in the face of\nThis that's a press conference today and they weren't\nDebbie Wasserman Schultz to know that she's a victim that her staff\nOr staff victims\nBut so it was Donald Trump junior victim and so is that Rick Trump a victim and so as Donald Trump of victim and so as Lara Trump of it and so it was Marco Rubio victim and so what Susan Collins a victim and so was general\nMattis a victim\nAnd I just don't remember all the outpouring of anguish by the media I just don't remember it day in and day out oh this isn't about moral relativism ever anything of this or this is about absolute ... face boy ten hypocrisy\n\nAnd Steve ... was actually shot and almost murdered as others were shot\nLuckily this coke either didn't know what he was doing or didn't intend for these bombs to go either way he says terrorists and the New York times titled says he's a registered Republican I'm trying to figure out how that can be I'm not saying he's not I just want to know more\nBecause once you're a felon in Florida you're not automatically return to the voting list you're not allowed to vote unless you go specifically to the far like clemency board did he do that did he get approval\nI mean this guy in two thousand two in two thousand two he made a bomb threat [noise] he made a bomb threat in two thousand two he's not a clean slate\n\nThe way he was or the perpetrator before he was caught was portrayed\nThe insinuation from Schumer and Pelosi the insinuation from CNN and MSNBC was there was a direct line between Trump and his rhetoric and whoever was doing this\nThat was the insinuation that pushed him over the edge\nAnd that this is what causes it sort of know it doesn't but has multiple felonies in his past the guy threatened to use a bomb and two thousand two\n\nThat's pretty uh long before Donald Trump even flirted\nWith the idea of running for president United States\nHe was arrested in two thousand two according to the Associated Press on charges of threatening to throw place projector discharge any destructive device\n\nAnd it was pointed out in the Washington Examiner he made the bomb threat\nBecause he was angry at a Florida utility worker St people do not make these threats\n\nAnd commit these other felonies and I suppose would be governor Andrew Gillum ... Andrew Gillum\nWhat say well the police should pull out guns are tasers or Billy clubs or anything of this or no no no they should figure out how to make\nThe guy he'll be more you know community relations mark community relations\n\n[noise] I'll tell you what [noise]\nI'd like to know a hell of a lot more about the situation I really would not send my conspiracy perspective or anything else I just want to know more of the facts\n\nAnd I'm sure now that the New York slime so Washington compost\nFacts\nAnd I'm sure now that the ... of Washington compost constipated news network MSL or stay in all the rest of them are working feverishly to figure out how he became a registered Republican or retain that and I think the New York times is obligated since it was the first report does that tell us how\nWas because Florida\nIs not allowed to clear up it's a voter rolls because of all the left wing or assuming is because ah\nPeople on the uh Florida clemency board game as registration what exactly are we going to rethink this idea that that one should be able to vote [noise]\nBut here we can accommodate everybody\nOK well use humor to I don't care if we can use ... can use taxis greyhound whatever I'm not particular about these things [noise]\nWhat Mr producer my call screeners down why don't you give me a hand and tell me the number one if we ever lip and number two if not if we have a regular American\n[noise]\nMike in Maryland and the great WMA I'll go pay more great talking to you a\nDime color on ... on the war rhetoric that going on um one thing I noticed that um it seems to push the buttons to push a guy but was that um you know it's the first time where supporters of a particular candidate have been directly or ... of the attack\nAn attack regularly for a long term and you know and that's a thought things to people when they when they pick a side and then they're attacked by the fact that my point is you know they're going back and forth that at the rhetoric between what Donald Trump that and and what the media and the Democrats say\nIt it's true it's directed to I don't ever remember Donald Trump I'm doing something to the supporters of the Democrats the way that the\nDemocrats I think I think you're giving this not way too much credit ... two thousand two we threatened to bomb a or a public utility because he was angry with a worker\nSo I'd be very very careful about playing into the less hands that this is uh some guy who who's angry about what the left is doing and so forth and so we're all angry about what the left is doing but we don't send real are fake bombs to a bunch of people\nNo I don't support that at all the more the case though you know you're you're asking why do we push peoples' buttons why go there anyway why ever attacked order that doesn't have the right way to do things the way we're fed off\nWhile the media like to do this they attack or all the time because you see Mr Zucker overt CNN and uh the clown that runs MSL us they they've decided that they are political operations in that they want to um [noise]\nUh they want they want to play to a base the radical left coup democratic base and that's what they've decided to do\nOr they're not really news operations they know damn well that Don limit is a joke they know damn well that Jake Tapper more and more has become a joke like what they run at night Steven Kobe or the Spock of ah\nWith the goofy years may I yes I Will be a spot of a late night comedy it's not even comedy it's stupid and look at Kimmel and bits another more on\nThe way several of these people are including came a little bits and others have done blackface I'm a ... if you'd call it that\nIn the past how come they're not fired like making\nKelly's fired how come they're not fired half I'm joy Reid hasn't been fired from MSL as the given everything that she posted means seems a little odd to me thank you for your call sir\nSeems a lot of odd to me\nI'm not interested in the in the conspiracy theories finished your call screener like caller number for let's just to sit the sun um called different shows I'm not interested in that that go to a Todd Rockville, Maryland WCBS and go\nMark great to talk to you thank you and I have one solution I haven't done the math on this and it's pretty incredible you and I and everybody else pay into Social Security trust fund or about what is it six point eight percent seven point two percent out your way out or if they\nHave that we Institute for near citizenship in this country for a period of four years\nYou've paid double that rate\nAnd then you work your way to finish up your rate come down to a normal right I think for math on an\nOutlet let let let's let on you say there's a moral issue here so\nI don't think people should be able to pay their way out of the illegal behavior or not somebody and and what she'll also sees because many of them are and very little in terms of wages and many of them get paid under the table or because the employer doesn't want to be revealed as a crook\nWhat I'm saying is I don't think this would work because it's already lawless and so you're saying okay let's tax will of such already lawless and they're not paying any taxes to begin with the employer and so forth then how do how do you push them into that system\nThat's tax at well if that's already lawless and they're not paying any taxes to begin with the employer and so forth then how do how do you push them into that system\nBomb thing even for legal immigration coming to this country we gotta have something going instead of thought\nWhy we need is to limit the number of people coming into the country legally and illegally that's it\nNot this is not Nineteen Eighteen twenty eight team it's a new ball game I don't know what that means I mean it's a new economy we can't way of by the tank\nBearing the Nineteen twenties during colleges presidency we had a during that period before and slightly after we had like a twenty year respite on immigration you aware of that\nI Wish it was to some extent\nOr a matter of us being able to just slow things down assimilate people within our system to take a look at how it says shaking out in terms of our school systems\nTurns of law enforcement turns the local health care in terms of jobs and so forth but what's happening is the leftist flooding the field more and more and more we've never had a fifty year period of immigration like we have right now never in American history\nAnd we actually have a political party that's cheering illegality\nCheering so I I I don't but I appreciate your call people come up with tax schemes and everything else it's beyond tax games it's beyond well let's have them pay three times and no no that's enforce the law\nThat's enforce the law and many people who come here people don't wanna hear this many people come here don't work\nThere's a whole underground economy [noise] with uh with fake Social Security cards but people getting Medicaid aren't supposed to get Medicaid there's a whole massive underground economy going on in this country\nAnd everybody knows everybody knows\nAnd again you have a political party that it it not only won't do anything about it it celebrates\nIt celebrates I'll be right back\nWashington Mall W.
