naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states and the state where they reside we need not speculate what subject to the jurisdiction there are means as I said the other day\nSenator Lyman Trumbull of Illinois the chairman of the Senate Judiciary committee at that time\nSaid during the debate over the fourteenth amendment quote subject to the jurisdiction unquote of the United states means subject to its complete jurisdiction quote not only allegiance to anybody else on quote\nOf course persons present inside American territory are subject to our partial jurisdiction in the sense that they have to obey our laws and our subject to criminal prosecution for disobeying our laws but one congressional drafter is added the second phase of jurisdiction to citizenship clause\nThey require it clearly limiting citizenship to those who in the words of one of the three key draft ers were subject to complete jurisdiction as Americans\nSenator Jacob power to Michigan the principal author of the citizenship clause of the fourteenth amendment in the Senate explicitly said\nThat candidates for citizenship must be born here and\nNot owe allegiance to any other authority echoing Trumbull\nHe said a full and complete jurisdiction means that same jurisdiction in extent and quality as applies to every citizen ... of the United states now he made it clear allegiance quote will not of course quote will\nNot of course include persons born in the United states who are foreigners aliens or belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers I credited to the government of the United states so\nSimply put the history of this amendment is not in dispute it's not about ... and that it's not up for
