something that should be earth shattering but unfortunately in Washington DC it too often it is\nAnd we all know when we get out here on the campaign trail and you and your listeners know that the failures in Washington stem from their failure to do what they said they would do that is why Trump is successful and why people are a proud to support them is because when he said you're going to do something he endeavors to do it for Republicans in Congress\nFailed to do that they're failed to repeal Obamacare they failed to balance the budget and they run away from border security and the

the Bush administration right we had a decade of economic growth that was on average and you know this is somewhere in the one percent two percent range depending on the year\nWhich was causing the continued stagnation what's causing the lack of the ability to bail building have the jobs that we need a lack of economic growth which obviously harm to the deficit and debt as well\nAnd now what are we saying we're seeing four percent economic growth forcing the United states for the first time in a decade label as the most competitive nation on earth right we're seeing a jobless claims of all time lows but not just for everybody but for groups like Hispanics and black business owners and other folks\nThat we're seeing incredible successes\nAnd that is not rocket science if\nYou leave money

list\nRight down the list\nNine things you need to know about illegal immigration and crime this is two years ago the daily wire Byron\nBand blur number one federal state and local governments keep data involving illegal immigration and crime out of the public purview\nFox News reported in twenty Fifteen that a source from immigration and Customs Enforcement ice and I love ice\nI've said that quote that comprehensive statistics on illegal immigrants crime are not available from the federal government had suggested contacting county state and federal jail and prison systems individually to compose a tally a process that would encompass thousands of local governments so in other words\nIt's the official position of the federal government not to provide you with the crime statistics\nNot to track it they track everything except that\nNumber two available evidence suggests that illegals are in fact more likely to commit crimes and the rest of the population [noise]\nFox News ... married local state and federal statistics and found that illegal immigrants are three times as likely to be convicted of murder as members of the general population and account for far more crimes than their three point five percent share of the U.S population would suggest\nAbout why isn't this information reported today on good morning America on the today show\nBy Shea Smith by Wolf Blitzer why not\nThe percentage of illegals committing the number of crimes are as follows according to Fox thirteenth point six percent of those sentence for all committed crimes in the country ... percent of murders sentences sixteen percent of trafficking sentences\nNumber three this is a deli wire almost fifty percent of federal crimes committed near the Mexico border\nA report from the department of justice in twenty fourteen found the following via judicial watch\nAnd it gives the specific statistics\nNumber for illegal immigrants account for nearly Seventy five percent of federal drug sentences in twenty four again this is according to the United states sentencing commission which also found that illegals were involved in nearly Seventeen percent of drug trafficking sentences and over thirty three percent of federal sentences overall\nPark how do you know these people are committing crimes while I don't know about specific individuals but these are the statistics I thought big government left us like statistics\nNumber five a disproportionate amount of illegals are in state prisons Peter cursor now and members of the U.S commission on civil rights lawyer review statistics from the government Accountability Office and pure Research Center\nAnd compared the number of illegals and not illegal in prison for murder related offenses any twenty Fifteen National Review these some of the findings\nThey're almost Seventy thousand illegal aliens in prison for every one hundred thousand illegals in Arizona\n\nLet me correct that there were sixty eight point five seven are illegal aliens in prison for every one hundred thousand illegals in Arizona compared to fifty four point oh six citizens and legal non citizens and it goes on but you can imagine what the statistics are [noise]\nKnowledge that while comparing murder incarceration rates isn't a perfect measurement it's difficult to contend that illegal aliens or more are law abiding that legal residence at least when it comes to major crimes\nBut the more disturbing fact was the approximately two thousand four hundred and thirty illegal aliens who are in prison Jasper homicide related offenses and California alone\n\nNumber six tens of thousands of criminal illegals have been released by ice and aren't large in the country\nAnd twenty Fifteen ice released almost twenty thousand illegals that committed sixty four thousand crimes that involved over twelve thousand drunken driving convictions Seventeen hundred and twenty eight cases of assault two hundred and sixteen kidding\nCommitted sixty four thousand crimes that evolved over twelve thousand drunken driving convictions Seventeen hundred and twenty eight cases of assault two hundred and sixteen kidnappings and more than two hundred homicide or man slurry convictions\nAnd this is why when you have a fool like the mayor of Tallahassee Gillum who says that they will not turn over\nConvicted\nIncarcerated and then fried illegal aliens to be deported by ice they will not turn them over to you understand that Florida you understand what I'm Talking about\nWants to be your governor I got more when I returned\nA very close to the sheriff's department and they told me that this MS thirteenth problem is a significant\nProblem but you wouldn't know that because when the president raises it and he's done a lot of work\nOn the search for them is Thirteen so it was attorney general Jeff Sessions ... the U.S attorneys all across the country when you raise it they blow it up well everyone is not um as I watched the big day I was only a small number you're everybody's not um assert\nThese insane inane arguments\n[noise]\nThe hearts of them is Thirteen of extended Brentwood community\nIn Long Island New York and they've committed horrendous crimes in Virginia on Long Island and in other cities the west coast around LA\nNumber eight sanctuary cities have hampered law enforcement and cracking down on gangs the great Heather McDonald documented the frustrations of Los Angeles law enforcement officers\nAll the way back in two thousand for when they couldn't touch known gang members because of their status as well eagles\nWe can't even talk about it says are frustrated LAPD captain people are afraid of a backlash from Hispanics and other LAPD commander in a predominantly Hispanic gang infested district size I Would get a firestorm of criticism if I talked about enforcing the immigration law against illegals\n[noise] the issue is that these gang members\nTended to sneak back into the country even after they were deported for heinous crimes and police officers couldn't enforce immigration laws against them would have to resort to surveilling these gang members until they committed a crime\n\nNumber nine\nClimate was also increased among major cities that are immigration hubs\nDeli wire editor in chief Ben Shapiro's written quote David from the Atlantic\nNo hard core to immigration opponent and a kind of a cook but anyway I wrote in twenty Fifteen\nThat as a twenty eleven there were twenty five thousand illegal immigrants serving murder sentences and nearly three million offenses committed by illegal immigrants between two thousand three and two thousand nine including Seventy thousand sex crimes and hundreds of thousands of other violent crimes\nAfter years of welcome declined from pointed out crime rates are rising in immigration hubs including Houston\nMold walkie Phoenix San Diego you got that Gloria border you\nIdiot\nAnd New York it was thirty four percent Arizona seventeenth birthday present during those years criminal aliens accounted for thirty eight percent of all murder convictions and the five states of California Texas Arizona Florida and New York well illegal aliens constituted only five point six percent of\nThe total population in those states\nNow there's no denying the fact is you've got a guy running for governor Gillum in Florida that the problem with this was a\nCriminal illegal alien is released from prison rather than having a dictator do hold on for the feds to deport them Gillum says abolish ice and no we're not gonna work to get
