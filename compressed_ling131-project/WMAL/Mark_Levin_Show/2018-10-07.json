the Washington Times you just died your dream for weeks like Stephen ... have you gotten any rest yet\nI Dream may be a nightmare as though they are not very much rest it doesn't look like there will be much rest for the next forty eight hours or so it was what we live for but I Know when you're in the middle of it you know you do hope it would a would come down\nYeah chairman Chuck Grassley along with Aaron Orrin Hatch in a couple of other senior Senator Mike Lee from the G shirt committee they just gave a press conference what's the message coming from the Republicans right now so they've\nBeen briefed on some of them have actually went through as much as they can do these forty six pages of new FBI reporting on the background check your background check on judge Kavanaugh\nAnd or their messages that there is nothing in there that advances or the corroborate a Christine Blasey Ford's allegations or Deborah Ramirez has allegations\nRepublican so they're limited in what they can say because of the all the details arrangements about getting this information from the FBI and the all the memos of understanding that control what they're allowed to talk about they're not supposed to talk about very much but it all\nBut a couple of the senators Republican senators who emerged have actually been quite angry at a at the fact they can't talk about it and say you know I really wish you all could see this huge see what you see what we see and you know that this stuff is uncorroborated so very strong from that standpoint\nThat's very interesting and and also if you just give us a little background there so people understand why this needs to be kept quiet because what an FBI when the FBI conduct a background check for U.S Supreme Court nominee any cabinet official or anybody who requires a background check there are a certain rules and protocols that that sort of surrounded that entire\nEndeavor right that's how the FBI is able to conduct the the very candid interviews that they conduct\nThat's exactly right and it's worth noting that the rules that they're operating under right now date back to a memorandum of understanding from van and attorney general Eric Holder\nIn either two thousand nine or two thousand ten so this is not the Trump Administration policy this is a a an Obama administration policy on that information being able to be shared from the FBI to the Senate and\nYou know it it's not to go to deep into this but obviously there's a separation of powers issue here the FBI is a a ... is an executive branch agencies and sharing that information with the Senate and they they have to have these sorts of arrangements so that they know what happens with this very sensitive information and so with the FBI's request hey will\nAnd he's putting not to use here and it's it's it's a it's really interesting to watch 'em at play but real quickly though I said the other story\nOn this but I think probably deserve more attention is the rest of his Democratic staffer last night for a being charged with boxing Republican senators it was a democratic staffer for congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee\nWho is actually posting this private information of senators and I'm surprised us not getting more attention\nAnd all you know I didn't know you were on that story as well because I definitely plan on talking about a little later in the program did give us the latest on that it was a state ... isn't that keeps a former staffer is it is a former staffer like as of now because this person got caught or had they been a former staffer you know\nSo he he was a former staffer in the Senate and according to the affidavit that was filed his mother this morning in this case\nHe was asked to resign by a senator Maggie Hassan from New Hampshire a Democrat from New Hampshire he was asked to resign from her office earlier this year and the the affidavit doesn't say what that was about and it'll be interesting to figure out why they ousted him\nBut he was apparently scooped up by congressman Jackson lead in Texas and you know the the reporting right now is that he was employed up until this this arrest of this week and ah\nThe affidavit actually says a key snuck into the reason he got caught apparently as if\nShe snuck back into senator Hassan office late Tuesday night like ten thirty at night on Tuesday and one of the other employees and other staff were there it was like you weren't supposed to be here what you're doing and called the police on him and then they started tracking things back and have a tie him to the ... from uh from earlier from a bunch of different house networks\nIncredible uh Internet you're right that deserves a lot more attention and that will certainly try to continue to focus our or light on it Stephen Dunn and that's and then again this is something you would think that both Democrats and Republicans could join together and condemn because uh the Democrats don't want to walk down this road they don't they don't want staffers doing this kind of thing to them\nOn the other side given to how we could just talk to you my friend and I keep up the good work you're

N. A. L. more Washington comes to talk\nYou're listening to the best of the Larry O'Connor show right now I got a question for you should we have the citizenship\nTest\nOr citizen is right now would you become the United states citizen and we applaud all of those people who choose to become United States citizens and actually\nFollow the law can we just have a quickie for those who actually legally under our country and become United States citizens you betcha but they don't get the boat they don't get the passport they don't get the honor of paying federal taxes until they passed the citizenship test\nAnd that's a good thing you should know some basic things about this country before you get that vote in all those things once called the dart our power over at the Washington secrets column at the Washington Examiner has a a report on a terrifying new study from the Woodrow Wilson national fellowship foundation\nA one in three Americans would pass the U.S citizenship test\nAnd and if you're a forty five and younger you know our our our mobile I guess that's part of genetics but if you're forty five and younger\nOnly Nineteen percent of you less than one in five Americans under the age of forty five can pass the basic US citizenship test and I would cause a deal that that's\nKind of part of the problem\nI mean honestly if you just watch the schoolhouse rock cartoons for a good couple of days and binge the heck out of that you would do better than most Americans right now on the citizenship test\nSo it just got me wondering it got me thinking that got me you know scratching the knocking on the top of my shoulder blades\nLittle higher than the blades but sometimes I you know ... should we Institute of citizenship test before you get the votes ate at age six zero nine six two five should someone have basic working understanding of our government before you know they make the decisions affecting that government\nAAA six thirty there'll be a male I guess the thought process has always been that you know you get the but when you're Eighteen and all of us as seniors in high schools we have to pass we can't get our diploma unless we passed a civics class right that's still a requirement isn't it\nPlease tell me they haven't changed that I remember I had to come back for my senior year in high school I wanted to graduate are really just 'cause I hated school it's only about smart\nOh please I already knew it wasn't going to college All right I didn't I didn't have the grades to get into a College of like a big I I'd I'd ... other opportunities All right\nI just want to get a high school because I hated it for me I hated being in school and I wasn't excelling and I had all the credit site needed graduate except for my civics class so I came back that year I could have taken it over the summer but as you know Southern California and it was you know the beach and you know\nIt was the eighties fast times of Richmond high I had other things on my mind so I came back I like beer\nI drink a lot of beer I came back and did that civics class for the only reason I came back for my senior year according to my high school was to take that step express please tell me they haven't taken that off the agenda and my guess is that if they figure okay you can't get your diploma unless you pass the civics class [noise]\nAnd said this is going to teach everything you need to know about being a citizen and all the things about our government so if you've graduated high school and you're Eighteen I guess you know what you need to know of course the fact is you don't need to have a high school diploma devote I mean\nGraduated high school and you're Eighteen I guess you know what you need to know of course the fact is you don't need to have a high school diploma devote I mean you could have dropped out of school at sixth grade as long as you're Eighteen and breathing you can vote right\nSo obviously that ain't working out for us and some of the things that the people in this a report don't know is clearly terrifying Seventy two percent of the people in this survey\nIncorrectly identified the Thirteen original state\nWhich is kind of funny because I really honestly the other day I remember yeah I always get if I make a mistake I hear about it immediately I had originally either ... or erroneous decide Vermont was one of the thirteenth then I knew it wasn't it was just a sort of the twelve percent\nThought a general Dwight Eisenhower led the troops in the civil war twenty five percent of Americans think Dwight Eisenhower was Ulysses Grant although I doubt they know who Ulysses Grant is\nTwenty four percent only twenty four percent could identify one thing Benjamin Franklin was famous for here's what's even more thirty seven percent think the Benjamin Franklin invented the light bulb\nThis is my favorite one this entire statistic two percent of Americans who are currently voting two percent said that the Cold War was caused by climate change I Am not making that up\nSo before you get the right to vote\nShould you have to pass a basic citizenship test AAA six thirty there'd be a military

M. A. L.\nWashington comes to talk\nBut first it's time for asked the millennial\nMillennials are the biggest demographic group of them are potentially the biggest homeowners ever\nSo much talk real estate now with a genuine member of the millennial generation drained all under Jane\nHi Steven thanks for having\nMe so glad you're here so Jane what's on your menu today\nWell even when I started doing the segment the number one question I always got was why aren't millennials buying houses and now about three years into it and hours of material recorded later the number one question I get is millennials buying houses\nAnd want to have certain extend millennials like myself have started buying homes we still aren't doing so at the rate that jet actors in baby boomers day when they were our age so I spoke to a few of my renting friends about the top reasons why they haven't joined the is deemed ranks of homeownership poll just sounds awesome\nFirst money they don't have enough of it this teams like the obvious one and you know if they're seller's market and homes are getting more expensive and I mean down payments are getting healthier and healthier\nMost of these people could easily paying mortgage but sky high rent and the majority of my friends in D.C are paying between sixteen hundred and twenty four hundred dollars a month it making it nearly impossible to save that initial big down payment\nNext a lot of people I spoke to aren't sure where they're going to be in the next couple of years and millennials\nImpossible to save that initial big down payment ...\nNext a lot of people I spoke to aren't sure where they're going to be in the next couple of years\nAnd millennial get older and we're in our thirties now well hopefully start settling down more but for now many of us need to go where the jobs are the recession meant that most of us started our careers a little later in life than most generation but that means we're still stuck in entry level jobs chasing the
