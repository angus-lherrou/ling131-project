nicest people I Know as\nDavid Limbaugh [noise] he writes great books and he's got one out right now called Jesus reason [noise]\nNow this isn't exactly my area of expertise but it's become his area of expertise he's written a lot about politics and so forth but he now has written extensively about Christianity David Limbaugh how are you my friend\nMark how are you a thank you so much for having me on\nWell it's a great pleasure in the book as as I say Jesus risen first of all let me ask you this you are more and more a writing you're really you become a bit of a scholar in this area of Christianity and so forth how did you come to this point\n[laughter] when I was a young adult I wasn't really a believer I I was always believed in God but I I didn't quite a branch of the Bible until I really started studying it and and I had to overcome some obstacles of an oval overcome some doubt and when I finally became a believer I\nThought OK I'm holding in my hand the word of God with the Bible and I was\nSo in all of that and so ... that I wanted to inhale it and gobble it up and read as much as I could learn as much as I could about the Bible and theology and I I wished at that time\nThat there were some short cut that there were some a guide some parameters that would help me get a hold of a handle on the Bible more quickly than I did takes a lot of work if you do it on your own takes a lot of work anyway and and it's worthwhile work but as I\nStudy that I I I wanted to share what I learned because I was so excited about it so I tried to write a book on it and this was before I had any platform hadn't written any columns and written any books and it didn't really go anywhere it was premature but then I started writing a column and\n... and probably ten or Fifteen Years later I'd written all those columns two pounds a week every week and I got five books under my belt and I thought well now the platform I've got a little more confidence\nUh and I might just try this again so I wrote my first Christian themed book again\n... explain my faith journey and why I Believe in Christianity and then for men I've just gone on to write other books and the last one was a book about the gospel uh where I go through the gospels and explain what the text is in a kind of paraphrase it in chronological order\nAnd then uh also interspersed commentary from some of the greatest Christian thinkers and some of my own inside and I wanted to continue with the New Testament after that because I ran out of space literally on that book so I started with the book of acts in this book and it has a history of the early church\nRan out of space literally on that book so I started with the book of acts in this book and it has a history of the early church\nAnd ... of Paul's Thirteen of pistols his letters to the early church is so that's what this book is it's just a continuation of mine a trek through the New Testament\nAnd I've got more to go and the next book of ... my publisher agrees to do it so what what the short answer the question is I was on fire for the Bible remain on fire the Bible study that really pretty hard for a white person\nOr the last Twenty years on and off and I wanted to share that passion get help people where I was who are who are ... and wanted to learn more\nAnd give them some kind of a primer and and a deep dive if they wanted to go further I Hope this book is both deep and accessible at the same time and will help people learn about the Bible and most of all inspire them to read the Bible for themselves and learn about it\n[noise] let me ask you this question when you look around the world\nYou see Christianity under attack even in our own country it's under attack in different ways you look in the middle east\nAnd same with Judaism you would think that the only religion that ever existed in the middle east was Islam yeah it is the third religion to exist\nAnd Christians had been pushed out of most of the Arab countries obviously there are individuals who want to push the Jews of sort of Jerusalem in Israel but when you look at our own country talk about the Supreme Court in the courts generally there is a growing hostility\nTowards Christianity [noise] do you think your book will help people better understand\nThat they don't have to be afraid of your face or their face\nYou know that is such a good question I I really believe that the Judeo Christian tradition is\nAt the bedrock of our constitutional principles and I realized there's in white and that influences and Judeo Christian principles are behind the constitution and our liberties\nAnd what our tradition stands for the Judeo Christian Church tradition stands for freedom we believe were made in God's image we believe where we have these innate rights ... writes that come from God that comes from our religious tradition\nAnd ... as a result of really believing that from the core of our soul that we all men are entitled to that freedom we by definition do not want to suppress the freedom and liberty anyone else their religious or political liberty and that includes people whose views are and that the U.S\nThere for the last in response to your question has nothing to fear for it for much atheists have nothing to fear from about Islam as long as it doesn't attack us has nothing to fear from us\nAnd yet the the ... the ... the the totalitarian the authoritarians a suppressor of free speech and liberty come from the left\nAnd we do have something to fear from them and so I don't like this notion that Christians should or Jews should sit idly by while the secular left destroys our liberties destroys our way of life destroy those sacred values that that underlying under guard all of our freedoms\nAre and we can't just have some Christian some passive Christian suggest we can't just pray and expect God to do it all of course we pray and we put it under his control but he put us here for a purpose we didn't just we ... we weren't just placed on earth but he passes by standard we need to be active and there's nothing\nIncompatible between Christianity and political activism as long as we are acting in accordance\nWith our principles and that's what I think we try to do and I we have to fight the left as hard as they buy that we don't have to be as dirty as they are but we do have to be as relentless and it didn't chance and that's what we need to do and yes they have nothing to fear for much we have a lot to be concerned about in terms of what they would do to us if they had the power\nThe book is Jesus is risen it's by David Limbaugh or you can get it at Amazon dot com or you can go to my site secure they're already ... show Facebook ... Twitter we have a link to it it is really a fascinating and um\nI went into the er the audience little interesting discussion you and I had when I said I Want you to come on and discuss your book and David is so respectful of other space and other beliefs and other people he said well\nAre you really short because you know I'm I'm Talking about Jesus and you know and you're Jewish and so forth [noise] and I said I get it it's okay I Want you to come on my show I Want you to talk about\nThis I'll tell you why David and we're going to come back in thirty seconds I think more vibrant some more rigorous evil are in the Christian safe better society as I feel the same way about my own religion Judaism so let's discuss that a little bit when we come back we'll be right back\nSo let's discuss that a little bit when we come back I'll be right back [noise]\nAnd so well people may say well I'm an atheist well I I I you know I'm I'm this religion I'm of that and I differ and I don't agree with you [noise]\nThey can say that as you point out and they're free to do whatever they want but what they cannot say is that the founders of the country the frame or is that the constitution were not a religious men they were religious in their own way and to different degrees but these were men of faiths were they not\nYeah ... and that's been documented him and a lot of people want to do that because it has in the interests of the secularists to\nAh say to rewrite history to revise history and say that the framers were not religious men that they were secularists and that\nUh they they say that as a result of that we should get back to our secular values and that when they they want a radically transform fundamentally transform our nation\nOr back to secularism and those kind of values that but because they distort what really it really was but we know for a fact what they want to transform us back to is something that's anathema to our founding principles and we watch the totalitarian tendency the left\nAs Obama tried to bring on and he wanted to fundamentally transform the nation and then nothing like it appeared at the time nothing like it was founded and you've written eloquently about this and you know that his son in middle transformation was not a restoration of where we started about a radical transformation away from it\nAnd the completion of the destruction of our founding principles in my view\n[noise] now again not [laughter] I Want to say I'm an expert on this subject won't even say I'm close to that [noise] but the way you're dividing your writings on this and you kind of touched on at the beginning\nIs how his house and then where do you go from here [noise]\nOkay I Am\nA again wanting to complete my Journey Through the New Testament I'd already written some of the Old Testament and I want to help readers really understand the Bible so these\nThis and I want to give them the historical perspective and so the book of back to the early church the history of the early church really happened in history these are real people\nAnd and I wrote and I and I included the book of acts as I say with the history of the early church and then six of the apostle Paul Thirteen of pencils he writes each forms the Iraq sees letters to the churches after he had planted these churches throughout the Roman empire and they're falling away from the religion they're falling prey\nTo the secular influence is just like we see today the secular influences a pagan city of corn which was\nDominated by a sexual immorality and I'd olive tree from me\nMainly featured a the the love God it's after ...\nAnd Paul it right that these churches in such a personal and intimate way saying look I've formed us up I Would birth a baby and I told you the true gospel and here you are deviating listen to the listening to these\nPagan influences and following year less will desires and he told them what they needed to do to get back on course not follow the false teachers but remember what he told them when he was there\nAnd then he gives them instruction on practice a Christian living how to live right\nNow to be good and moral people listen to the Holy Spirit of a bay the Holy Spirit\nAnd then and then continue to do what is right and he also expanded on the back of the Christian doctor and what's interesting mark is this really happened in history\nAnd I want to give readers a sense of that history because when when they when they read it they will understand it really happened then although Paul wrote these letters to particular churches\nHe didn't know that though they were inspired by God they would be a ... to all of us\nFor the next two thousand or however many years the world exist\nSo they're of universal application to all churches and all the people who read these letters even though they were written to individual people at a specific point in time in history we've still profit for men today as a Christian wave their holy scripture the New Testament they become part of the the New Testament and God's word in our view\nSo it's just ... miraculous how this has occurred and people can really profit from these from these words which we believe are God's work so I Want to help all my book is not\nA God's word it's a book about gods were trying to sell a take people's understanding advance their learning curve reduced or intimidation about the Bible and most of all as I said again inspire them to read it and gobble it up like I've tried to do the last Twenty years\n[noise] well you're very much the renaissance man the subjects that you've written about over the years really are um [noise] a very well they cover a lot of territory and this is this is an area I Know that is very very important to you and true to you\nReally are um [noise] a very well they cover a lot of territory and this is this is an area I Know that is very very important to you and true to you and you dedicate

Want to hear from Dr for [noise]\nI thought she was handled respectfully [noise]\n... was treated like crap\n[laughter]\nOf speaking of the folks who uh stepped up in ah surprises awake\nLindsey Graham at the Atlantic given in a T fee on Wednesday we'll blow yourself after he is funny because here you had Cory Booker ... and and he told us he was having his Spartacus moment\nAnd then Lindsey Graham like accent was part of gives them the hearing and he's continued it's kinda like Lindsey Graham's it'll like the Grinch and a difference and you know the Grinch is hard grew three ... three times that day let's say that er Lindsey Graham's intestinal fortitude grew three times\nOver the past three months I Believe and so he's become a new hero in this entire process rock solid Lindsey Graham something else that I don't think many of us necessarily thought would be the case\nA couple of things I Am very much based on information on the arguments the information that provide you my opinions all based on information and one of the things I've been tracking from the word go the day after Brett Kavanaugh was\nNominated to the United States Supreme court\nGallup has always track on Supreme Court nominees and you may be a ... whatever about Gallup but regardless of what you think of their polling it's instructive because if they do it every single day ongoing you can use a baseline to get a temperature ... temperature jak of public opinion on any given issue in this case\nOur views of Brett Kavanaugh\nWhat was interesting and the very first polling done\nOn Brett Kavanaugh after his nomination by President Trump we had four percent more Americans say that he should be confirmed and not the case of that the baseline that's where we started now after we had the first hearing\nAnd we had twenty senators on the Senate Judiciary committee and Spartacus do what they did\nComing out that four percent more Americans thought that Brett Kavanaugh should be confirmed the not in other words despite the fact that a couple of months went by despite the fact that they uh you know what else for to kiss on them it didn't change public opinion at all not at all\nNow is interesting because as consistent as that was we did see with Christine for delegations a bit of a shift\nAs a Thursday morning I yesterday but a week ago the morning of the hearing we did see public sentiment courting the Gallup shift into negative territory and Brett Kavanaugh\nWe saw what what's that image shift to three percent more people believing that he should not be confirmed then should be again prior to the testimony alright that's after everything that the media\nAnd the politicians did to Brett Kavanaugh where are we today I was kind of interesting by a forty six forty five margin Americans believe that Brett Kavanaugh\nShould be confirmed now they're too soon to be learned in this entire process on this information to first as public opinion despite all the emotions oh the emotions the all the nonsense Spartacus across the board to gang raping whatever\nPublic opinion only shifted by seven percent\nSeven percent top to bottom that's it in terms of the opinion about that\nNow what's instructive inside of that seven percent we bounce back to pretty much where this country is one of the things I find fascinating is when we actually do have representatives in this country that represent us and in this particular case the United States Senate\nIs doing pretty much what the American people want to have happen near\nBy a slim margin Brett Kavanaugh\nEnded up receiving the necessary votes to advance to the final vote tomorrow and we'll end up becoming the next Supreme Court justice on a narrow vote just as the American people wanted it so that part I think is so I could graphically interesting\nThe next facet of this conversation is where to focus your energy\nBecause how many people are really persuadable politically one of the most common questions I ever receive has to do with persuading people politically how you're doing\nWell devious way is to tell you how not to do it who is it that you are most likely to engage politically\nProbably allows people in your life then oppose you\nRight how's that work out for you and let me ask you\nSo you know allows people in your life that oppose you write how does that work out for you and let me ask you for the angry leftist but you argue politics with you ever get anywhere you get angry [noise] do you think they're one of the\nFolks as part of that seven percent that was ever persuadable in the first place [noise] so I Know we wish that we could change their minds especially if they're in their lives and our universe\nPeople have to be open minded first\nComing up next to talk about that and how to be persuasive and who can be persuaded and how not to bend your head against the wall and just become really unhappy I Am Brian mud now\nA lot of folks have given up on the millennial generation which by the way the youngest millennials are I closing in on being illegal to drink the youngest one's ... eldest one's like thirty five thirty six now\nAnd I have not blame that ride along because when was it that they came of age they came of age and the great recession rang so here they went through the education establishment they were fed a bill of whatever the education establishment feeds them\nAnd then they come out and the economy's terrible\nAnd they weren't able to get opportunity and so it made sense to them yeah you know what capitalism this economy doesn't work we need change you know Obama probably made sense because hey that was what our teachers told us in here we are and things are working\nThey had never seen a good economy never seen a good economy we finally have it right now is one of the most important window of time\nWe have two really good opportunities to reach people\nEspecially younger adults that now do have opportunities three point seven percent unemployment are you kidding me right they're getting the wage growth the bonuses it's all happening and it's important to tell them how we got here\nAnd then it's also important in the cabinet situation to articulate what's on the line here hey if somebody that you didn't even know came out and accused you of say sexual assault we had the awful right\nYeah it'd be pretty bad right I mean that's what happened here and and go through information only rather than just the emotions of yeah you know Kevin on anyway just a little food for thought let's go to Archie in Ventura, California Archie go\nRight and it's it's good to hear about your ah your history and and your experience so tell me why mark what attracts you to do is show\nThe three of you and I wanted to say that uh I live in a very carefully to the uh [noise] there was a a a a Collins senator Collins is a thought about what happened and even though I'm a Democrat and I'm In California I was a quite impressed by it\nShe laid it out very precisely [laughter] he was a very methodical sorted out a little weak but it went on from there and build villages or do I get all the time [laughter] than getting a\nLink to her a conclusion with all the interviews he did and all the meetings you want to go I found it very it applying and informative and uh her stock went up ... percent with me [noise]\nI couldn't agree more I was frankly shocked at just how detailed top to bottom on every single consideration that's part of this process\nI mean she was on ... ... and point by point by point from the nomination process pointing out how many organizations were going to oppose\nRegardless of who the nominee was that one of the organizations hadn't even filled in the name and they put out that they were opposing the nominee mentioned or that even senators got out ahead one of them even got out ahead of the name being announced when they were saying that they were opposed\nAll the way through point by point by point\nWhy Christine Ford was not credible in terms of her allegations even though she did mention that she believed that ultimately she was likely a sexual assault victims no evidence whatsoever that it was Brett Kavanaugh and her eyes she could have been\nThe top of joining in the country the way that she laid out the details as she found them\nIt was about Fifteen minutes fifty fifty five minutes her speech and I would say that it is a must view if you\nMissed it uh it is definitely worth catching the entire thing it was captivating and again I have never heard a senator deliver a better speech not ever\nI didn't agree with absolutely everything she said but it was principles it was detailed it was well thought out and almost everything there is inarguable and I just absolutely remarkable Susan Collins\nWho goes to ... go to Jim Jim in Charlotte welcome to the show hey Brian\nRemarkable Susan Collins ... go to gym ... gym in Charlotte all come to the show\nHey Brian thanks ... are pretty much ... what the last caller showed up about my respect and admiration for callers I mean it's increased by water cold after ... girl for about ... minutes into that I

Chamberlain protected than what ... your your Gettysburg little round top ... preserving the junior so I really admire her and I'm Glad she did what you did\nWell that's a pretty big moments in history and I I agree that this is one for the history books as well by the way uh how are the folks in in North Carolina do and you guys are making the back\n[noise] oh yeah yeah the skaters are kind of a rapid and big but ah ah so the cold weather ... sitting down here I think er I think they should be like diminishing a little bit\nHow the folks over and Wilmington [laughter] well I'm ...\nCharlotte but the problems in the marine corps are facing over there even ... pretty good they're recovering pretty good ... Jacksonville you're real ... areas there all the water are seated in various oh I talked to a friend over there everything's everything's ... back ... slowly but surely ... normal\nAnd appreciate your service thank you for listening and uh sharing your thoughts as well may God Bless you know the folks there I Lived in Wilmington for very short time and when ... saw what was going on and heard that it was an island are pretty unimaginable so glad that ah folks starting to get back together\nAfter the hurricane and and North Carolina All right let's go to shake gates in California Welcome to the show\n... hey ah yeah I was uh I Would agree with your point about what about ... and Ford and as far as their allegations are concerned but are there for take out not so much to go after her but to ah go after anybody in the future\n... might think that they can ... people up the false allegations and not have to pay a price\nCorrect I think that's the single most important thing and the reason why I'm not willing to just give a pass even though ... clear this thing\nBecause he's always going to have this thing that he's going to have to deal with there's a certain percentage of the population that's not insignificant but it's going to believe the allegation regardless and it's not okay to perjure yourself these are principles\nAnd again you know if we're going to deal with the rule of law for going to deal with the premise that should be addressed and we know because of politics were not going to see the Senate Judiciary committee pursue her for perjury ... conduct the investigation that would be necessary to travel down that path\nBut it doesn't mean that it should go and check what she did was absolutely wrong because again when you say you I'm One hundred percent certain that break ... sexually assaulted me and you have none of your uh none of your witness uh\nWe're now the witnesses period that ... operate any of that information I mean that's the problem that's not acceptable in this country appreciate you are you listening ... coming out that will continue the conversation and also share some of\nMy final thoughts on break have it on the situation as we get ready for the vote\nAre now under a day ... will be approximately five o'clock eastern time tomorrow because once again this whole process has been much bigger than Brett cabin on the Supreme Court it's become about all of us will talk about it next time ... and for the great one mind\nHim ... mall W.

party but the governor the Democratic governor of West Virginia ... to the question is uh is mansion next maybe he wins reelection ear and and he goes ahead and and does the ... thing but uh so I was mentioning in the previous segment\nThat there is the potential that we could be an inflection point in American history one in which the norms don't apply Donald Trump being president of the United states not your typical president and the movement that he learned twenty sixteen not your typical movement which has happened with Brett Kavanaugh\nThat could certainly aid the argument that we're in this inflection point that things are different this is not your typical midterm election cycle to provide a a little more\nFuel for that fire if you want to embrace it\nSomeday and I've never seen and again I'm a student of history and I'm a student of information and to the point age began in the Nineteen thirties so we have information about what we've been interested in what we've been into their mid term elections since the late Nineteen thirties right\nNever once not ever as the most important issue to the average voter ... in the United States Supreme court it's come up with really high and presidential elections it was the number three issue on election day there were three issue and election day twenty six same\nNumber one number one right now\nTo the Pew Research center Seventy six percent of Americans say that the Supreme Court will be on their mind when they go to a vote\nHowever their impassioned to vote\nNow we are still just over a month away from election day\nPeople are fickle things can change Kavanaugh gets confirmed tomorrow maybe the level of priority comes down because it's been taken off the table I guess we can say or maybe if people are still ... motivated by because hey we could have other Supreme Court justices that come up here over the next couple of years right\nThat remains to be saying\nBut we are seeing right now and some of the internal data that's available\nWhat's driving us that's different than ever before you have the Supreme Court and management and then it goes to health care OK so after that a which by the way does that change the dynamic at all\nSo we're in this window of time that is different and anytime that politics that people are different the outcomes absolutely have the potential to be too so as we are now just over a month away from election day\nYou take a look at how many elections are out there\nThat could have the outcomes changed by seven percent seven percent\nAnd that is the potential for what could happen if there were a red wave that came out of this\nRight now if you had seven percent that moved because of President Trump because of the economy because of the progress or maybe because they are tired\nWhat's going on in this country because of backlash about Brett Kavanaugh eagle wind seven percent in the first hour I mentioned that in this entire Kavanaugh process entire process from the day after he was nominated until today\nSeven percent movement top to bottom in terms of public opinion on whether or not we should confirm Brett Kavanaugh bet that is really what we're looking at here those are the people that are persuadable but seven percent\nEncompasses a bunch of elections across this country usually voter enthusiasm is exaggerated because only sixty four percent of eligible adults or even registered to vote in the first place and where you take a mid term elections well I mean typically have around forty percent they actually show up to vote\nSo we do tend to often bake a bit too much into voter enthusiasm this and that\nBut it absolutely has the potential in this type of environment to make the difference which is why it's absolutely critical you want to make a difference you get your butt out there and vote but you find those seven percent\nYou use this potential inflection point in American history and you get out there and you're trying to make a difference because we do have a different landscape it's not all they are in the polling in the top level numbers that are discussed yet\nBut it has the potential to be and we're a little more than a month away so that is what you were in store for you get out there make a difference if you're inclined unlike those angry people that were a paid and and ...\nThat is what you're in store for you get out there make a difference if you're inclined\nUnlike does angry people that were a paid and and shouting that Joe mansion it's going to win the hearts and minds but it's I don't think it's going to winning hearts and minds\nThere is this window of opportunity a moment in time potential inflection point issues that matter more that never met her before in mid term election cycles so what are you going to do with it\nAnd uh by the way I Want to give you a heads up on something that uh you definitely definitely should go ahead and ... on your DVR\nIf you don't already have in life liberty and live in\nAn eastern Fox News channel Sunday night [noise]\nGoing to talk about the media and one of my all time face best in the business my opinion Mollie Hemingway from the federal is just going to be one be guess on the show by celebrities live and\nSunday night synagogue eastern Fox News channel are coming up we're going to continue this conversation get some of your thoughts as well here's just an inflection point by money and for the great one more clip that\nBut then she walked back through comments later in the afternoon after she started getting some of the response in so\nUh she'll be an interesting one to watch tomorrow although we should the likely be a formality which kids are covered by the way because you can go ahead and you're Lisa Murkowski in and vote in the apartment it because it's not going to alter the outcome almost certainly tomorrow All right let's go to Dan Dan is in Clearwater, Florida Dan welcome to the show\nHey thank you sir [noise]\nHey I'm I was watching and listening to a center calling speech today and at first I was I was stunned I was amazed I was impressed and then ... her speech I started going to damage control\nAnd I started going wow I mean the American public and importantly to the Democrats the independents are getting angry\nAnd they need to lessen the damage and they were in damage control they lessened the damage to that that's what I saw I think it actually hurts her speech was scripted she did not speak like the\nCortex was written so I don't think that that was genuine I I think that they were really running damage control and trying to you know\nTake the anger directed that they righteously have towards them and less of that [noise]\n... where I Can't necessarily get along with that ... the level of detail starting from the very moment\nOr that she depicted what happened at the time of the nomination\n... detailed and chronicled at every everything that she thought weighing a foul and I don't know that she would have\nHad that level of detail if she were just trying to rally here in the eleventh hour to try to save face for the moderates in the Senate\nI got this and so what took place today was truly principal and and really was something that she was that series about every step of the way in in the process including as you pointed out with all of her other previous votes so\nI I hear what you're saying but I'm just not in on the conspiracy thought process that Susan Collins he was not on the up and up I I really got the sense that uh she was in the air and genuine throughout her speech\nLet's go to Raj Raj is in Virginia and welcome to the show\nTotal tank to so much I Do appreciate your very strong emphasis on the infection points I Believe on that and fiction point but not tested in the political lady now given financially you know even the heck is he now [noise]\nThat they came to the culture is increasing and those are all the trains and I'm looking at a strong grid rain [noise]\nOn the other point two men can vote on doing more to put up with the system it has to do with what's happening locally in the seat coupe people know that ... to ... seats [noise]\nOught to be ... by two opposing party to both have to be the public and [noise] and that's why that's not seats in D.C called collections are so important to thank you very much photos that to sit for an ice cream cone heartedly with two\nI'm guessing that you are as big of a door does I Am are you an analyst\n[laughter] ... have been an engineer or my life [laughter]\nOkay I had a feeling that it was somebody who was a of a a similar type of thought process anyway I Am not an engineer though not by a long shot I Can't even change a tire effective way just as my dad about that one [laughter]\nThat was one of the moments where I ... my background is in financial analysis and business outside of radio I've been doing this Twenty one years love what I Do uh but uh but the ya ya gotta work spiritual passed away and what I end up ended up doing is taking Financial Analytics in various different algorithms and in formulas\nAnd figuring out that hey if we have history we have the information we can do a lot of different things in in life with them or beyond just a financial markets for example so anyway ah good stuff ...\nThe three way of information we can do a lot of different things in in life with them or beyond just a financial markets for example so anyway ah good stuff pretty she had Raj let's go to Phil Phil is in Vegas welcome to the show\n[noise] good afternoon you have the two things that I took away from that when I was watching everything this whole whole process with my wife the first thing [noise] when we saw the doctor giving her testimony we felt sorry for we really felt that she was emotionally disturbed\nAnd there we thought that was probably a whole plethora of reasons for that you know obviously saw sexual molestation but one of them\nBut we felt pity we didn't show anger I have no Adam is towards the woman but I think the biggest takeaway on this was the\nDebauchery that the Democrats ex expose themselves to the process that they would go to to prevent something that was normal\nWithin you know the process of the government and there should be some re ... parents from these attorneys who were directed to her by Dianne Feinstein who had animus towards President Trump\nAnd hid things from her like her being able to be interviewed in California or wherever she wanted\nThis is the thing that needs to change within the Judiciary Committee procedures and the penalties not necessarily innocent victims like Dr Ford who I really think she is\nBut the people who are behind that and directing it and and corrupting our government and I'm angry because I don't see anything on any news show talking about how the wrong people have got to be punished\nI'm going to agree with all the Seventy five percent of your point you're I I Do want to ask you specifically you say that the you're not angry at at Christine forward here\nDo you feel that uh you see anything wrong by going under oath and and involving herself in this process saying that she was one hundred percent certain that Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her\nWell here's what we don't know we don't know what was said in her um sessions for therapy sessions I don't know that some therapist or some lawyer may have talk her into it you know when when you're that exposed and you're that vulnerable\nMemories can be created all over the place I've been reading all kinds of articles about that so I I don't know enough about the woman to be angry what I Know enough is that I can see that she was used by people who didn't know enough I mean if it was really that big of a problem Dianne Feinstein whether bonded out that one\nShe knew that that wasn't provable in court and she knew that the longer she waited the bigger political bang she was going to get out of it and putting the attorneys who hated Trump to begin with and in charge of it\nShe knew that was another lose situation\n... ... the border cheap calculate wrong\nIt's interesting now you bring up a lot of compelling an interesting point I still can't get there in in terms of having necessarily been\n... into this mindset remember she's a professional in the field\nI I mean after all I mean as part of her credibility she was telling us about how uh you know emotions are are stored in and memories are stored in the hippocampus was that they only won by the way when she pulled out that went seriously this is how you're attempting to establish your credibility as a witness it was one of those moments to where it's like okay\nWhat part of the birth tactic is your uh but but anyway on you know I I still feel she's accountable you go under oath\nYou're you're involved in this process you say you're one hundred percent certain you provide all these witnesses and the thing that's odd to if she was going to end up being co worst by you know some a psychologist that these are the members that you really had\nWhere was she of received all those name because she provided as the witnesses I mean that's difficult for somebody who was a third party now wouldn't have been involved in that process to to instill in her I just\nCan't quite get there but otherwise very compelling and ah interesting thought All right I Am Brian mud in for the great one month\nIn Washington Mall W.
