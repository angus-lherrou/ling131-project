would do that as a father and a lawyer so how come they're not\nWell I Can't tell you what is in their minds are what\nThey you can do if you're telling me what's in Kavanaugh's mind you told me he's guilty that's not what it is in his mind that's more online there's been a matter of being in your mind it's a process that you honestly believe that somebody rape Jew or molested you or try to do that and there's no statute of limitations word took place not\nWanna go swear out a criminal complaint\nFor all we know that that might or civil complaint might happen in the future\nThe question

and that's the insurance\n[laughter] well people have asked me that question and I think we'll see a at the outcome I think what you're going to see\nIs the Democrats if they're unhappy with the outcome they're going to start attacking the FBI they're gonna start attacking it as a uh it's not a full investigation they're already doing not and not investing enough witnesses the president's

other other cable station saying she's not scoring\nShe that people aren't paying attention to this uh I think the ... set it I'm not attacking I'm just making a point it was very frustrating for me at the time and I pointed it out last week they're dead wrong she scoring points quote unquote cheese making points points that are very very crucial and we are understanding what she's saying\nI I

piece of information critical that would tell the difference between yes or no yes or no she remember she had one beer she remembers a lot of details but she doesn't remember details that would result

April in San Francisco let me tell you that was a frightening experience because all other women in the audience were\nEating up everything she said that we need to take down the white Republican senators and law makers and she's going to spend the next six months of her time after she\nYou know there there is a great deal of sexism and racism in this country and it's all coming from the left\nWell you know look at look at the me too movement and Asia argument though\nHe had sex with a Seventeen year old boy she paid him off and yet she was the forefront woman running around with me too movement and you know what the liberals have given her a path because\nEven though she doesn't fit into their narrative she was elected started that's fantastic movement but what brush her aside well forget about her put her in a little drawer until we need her\nAnd she gets the path and I just hope that the conservative and these Republican lawmakers wake up and get I I don't think\nHave tonight titles secrets you and eight to ten million other people [noise] we've had very few conservatives running this election cycle even asking to be on my program\nWhat do you think of that genetic I don't understand it and\nYou get learn they're running scared how many of these people are actually running on their principles\nThat these the Democrats will rally around the rally around Ellison float so oh so they may have been some assault charges that's fresh satisfied I came out it was late yesterday to the Associated Press from\nTheir lawyer that they hired a lawyer Susan ... who has links to the Democratic farm labor party and I quote an allegation Standing Alone is not necessarily the fish and to conclude\nThat conduct occurred particularly where the accusing party declined to produce supporting documentation\nBecause I tell me where is Dr Ford supporting documentation\nTo exist [noise] All right\nMy friend has been an excellent call here very very sharp I appreciate it very Evansville, Indiana the great WG bf go\nLike Mark I'm your earlier and you're talking about federal worse than what we do that\nWell you do you want to twenty two years ago Washington warned us warned us basically you know his whole farewell address is very interesting and very important but ... but I'm not going to go into a paragraph fifteenth through Nineteen or basically two words you told us go watch out\nHe told us about factions they told us about those individuals that will use the engine to get into those unjust powers and then destroy the very engine that got him there and so that you know two hundred and twenty two year old warning to watch\nHas been there's been happening with us\nAnd this this is a great point Larry of the world didn't begin today\nLiberty didn't begin today tyranny didn't begin today we have a lot to learn from the people who came before us and actually put their lives on the line and you know confronting a senator at a restaurant or in an elevator is not exactly a a a courageous task\nBut these are men and women who put their lives on the line but look look Larry look how they talk of them look like talk of Washington and Jefferson and all the rest of them they just dismissed\nExactly and and ... and you can go back further than that end of the cost of cost for venture which you brought up a\nSo far away in the past I don't know if the economy ... but it's supposedly ... or ah Benjamin Franklin and Mrs Elizabeth Paul was saying it to an old white person he was saying it's a woman sandwich yeah from what do we have\nAnd um this is Elizabeth all ah it was saying it to an old white person he was saying it's a woman and when she asked what do we have a monarchy or ... ... so that warning came as well and and we're losing it\nInto the greatest extent possible we've already lost\nI think we we have lost a big chunk of it and you know all the men who were thinkers and writers at that time but many of them\nMay soon Jefferson Madison Hamilton Franklin and so forth [noise] they all said that what you need in order to keep the country\n[noise] do these people today on that committee sound virtuous\nTo user no and when you hold on hold on to these media types who go on and on and on did they sound virtuous to use her not at all\nSo we have a problem when our so called leadership certainly self identified in the Senate and in the house and in the media\nAnd also in our culture in Hollywood simply haven't overture they have no decency\nThat's correct and you mentioned uh once before when he brought you enter into it when I look into the eyes of these people that showed that the the the the the eyes of the nearest this whole I look into the eyes of these liberal Democrats and effect which Republicans I don't see anything\nHuh thanks for your call Larry\nHi said Dr for when you go through her testimony we did it when we listen to them and the prosecutor right from Mitchell asking questions and she put out the memo which we discussed at length yesterday and we'll ... TV Tonight [noise]\nThat the doctor for does not in any way have a credible case against Brett Kavanaugh\nAs I say I do not doubt\nThat she was molested\nBut not by him\nBecause she hasn't presented anything anything whatsoever that can be corroborated nothing\nMore over her own memory has failed her own key pieces of information particularly as relates to collaboration\nIn her memory is failed her as recently as July of this year in her discussions with the Washington Post\n[noise]\nHer memory fail or in terms of her willingness to fly and I could go over a number of things I didn't find her credible in the least when it comes to Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd neither do the people on the left which is why they're trying to destroy him in the ... of her allegations\nThat the most outrageous and stupid arguments imaginable\nTaking up friends quote unquote digging up associates quote unquote\nSlowly through ice\n[noise] wow\nWell we'll send them to Guantanamo Bay except we only send terrorists there in the liberals hate it when we send terrorists there so I guess we'll send cabinet ... do you notice how the left hates us more than they actually hate\nOur enemies\nUCLA hate Donald Trump more than a hate any other state you're walking on the face of the or how they hate cabin on more than they hate any terrorist any mass murder any of them look at the ACLU the ACLU was disgraced itself it's actually running ads comparing him the bill Cosby among others\nThe ACLU yet expose it just sounds that were there and boys and girls due process only for Nazis prints on ships survey of innocence only for klansmen but when it comes to Brett\nKavanaugh no he's a real threat why are the reasons I said in the first hour he actually believes in the constitution I'll be right back\nIn Washington Mall W.
