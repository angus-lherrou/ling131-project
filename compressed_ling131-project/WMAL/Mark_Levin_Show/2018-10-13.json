mean just incredible I Wonder what she was really taken by the end of that interview by the way and it's fascinating to do what ultimately didn't make it because lord knows how much they had that they went ahead and edited out but anyway uh so we're talking about the lack of climate credibility at the United nations now\nShared with you really well done um piece from the specter that put in context how wall United Nations says bad on their climate predictions every single year for years\nYet for some reason they retain credibility for some reason we subsidize this nonsense for some reason and we know what the reasons are all political it's embraced by those on the left now\nI think any honest in decent person you are wrong if you are white heck wrong for your entire professional career somewhere along the way you you have a sense of you know maybe I should do something else\nBut if you are part of the left is climate science crowd\nYou're gonna keep on keep it on and they're gonna keep on federal and your your nonsense and that's exactly what we've seen it's fascinating as you take a look at the entire way this thing came full circle you go back to the Nineteen seventies what was that it was the big global cooling and the ice age ...\nSo I uh actually pulled earlier this week and the un report came out in the June twenty fourth Nineteen Seventy four times article it was based on this climate science called another on stage\nAnd then on April twenty eight Nineteen Seventy five Newsweek they published a story that calling the world because that's what was going on\nManmade global cooling\nAnd then somewhere along the way it was like oh crap well that's not working out\nSo then it became one in the eighties and nineties you'll remember what it was remember now every aerosol can every little puff of that hairspray for that big eighties here that was another chunk out ozone layer oh yeah the elimination of the ozone layer\nAnd then somewhere along the way are like oh you know what it's not actually has something to do with the ozone layer and guess what if we actually dedicated the entire effort of this world towards eliminating that we probably couldn't because we're probably not going to be highly effective at taking out the sun oh and by the way some of those are holes [laughter]\nFunny thing how it's done spots you know [noise] so that one way and then what did it become ... global warming and we got global warming for many years trying\nAnd then ... not buying it\nGo from global cooling we go from the ozone layer to global warming to something that actually Israel is something that's actually real to climate change\nAnd that is how they completed the corrupt circle because climate change Israel always has been always will be funny things happen we'd had ice ages we've had periods of extreme heat\nWe've had a minimum of three mass extinction events remarkably enough before we were even on this planet\nIt must have been on like the the dinosaur flatulence you know you know like a cow farts they actually are more political than than like a you know cars so if you do that if you think about it is it the pita crowds to really think about this for a moment and if we don't eat meat\nI I mean what happens you care more about the the gal or do you care about uh you know your your climate change there because you got your we're more cows who's going to happen\nThis is a real moral dilemma you should consider this so anyway apparently or what happened was a bunch of Dinah flatulence and I dunno flatulence ended up leading to a\nMatch to extinction events ... it'll be just you know following all the logic to its natural\nConclusion you say\nWas getting two sides of stories one sided back\nBy George ... will continue to bring them to you I\nAm Brian money for the gray one large live and\nAnd for the gray one marked a little bit [noise]\nBut there is something else that is kind of a an important and the cons contacts in the conversation and this is a a meeting you for anybody who could be on any coastline you'd be in the northeast could be anywhere in between you could be on the Gulf and take a look at what happened to Mexico beach\nI uh I had an idea there's one silver lining that came out a Hurricane Andrew was building codes we have what's called the Miami Dade code that is rock solid you don't do anything but concrete anymore\nAnd affected areas and it makes a difference every now and then you see the pictures to Mexico beach you'll see structures that are still standing right next to whole areas that are just completely wiped down nothing but to bring you'll what's the difference there\nHad an idea that a lot of those homes were built well before we had the Miami Dade standards after Hurricane Andrew in Ninety two went back and took a look the average home that was built Mexico beach is Nineteen eighty three Nineteen eighty three well\nBefore the standards one framed homes and so the media you is your in one of those types of homes and you're at a point to where you could be impacted by a hurricane\nKnow you you might want to think about your situation or because if you get a hurricane that's like a tornado comes near you you know think about the impact in your home the ones that are standing\nBy and large are your structures that were built\nAfter Ninety two with those upgraded and updated standards to made the difference not only in life and death but it can make the difference\nIn your home being there versus your home being wiped out can make the difference between a community that can be rebuilt and something that isn't even recognizable was mentioning Hurricane Irma last year you go to the er the lower keys\nYou'll see when you go down there every now and then it's like huh\nWow it seems like there's a lot of space where they're used to be homes\nThat's the case and are there any more Arabs completely wiped out many of them were just taken straight into the ocean and the and the lower keys were when they came through and they got others Mm couple of shingles missing\nCan be the difference a life and death big big deal so anyway\nAh just ah as you're seeing these pictures putting everything in context\nA you know you get it was a I think very very much like Andrew in I think we're very fortunate that it went in in an area that was ... as sparsely populated relatively as that area to minimize the damage the devastation where it cause because it is real\nBut thank God it didn't go into a place where you had millions of people for example at that size and that strength\nAlright uh been talking about some of the financial frauds the climate for on throughout the course of the show oh we're going to check in Todd wanted to talk about single payer Todd in Ohio do\nOr not to be honest so I just want to point out real quick what are your friends can check it out are paying ticket out onto your two birds that allowed or were Crowder\nUndercover at the Canadian health care system they have in a couple of his buddies go in with cameras ahead and try to get health care Canada is buddies are from Canada\nAnd this go watch and see how bad this is I mean it's like for our series or four hours more to see a doctor you're there like eight hours earlier pronounces her days\nThey're closed on the weekends or no care on the weekend [laughter] ah but if you go to the private sector but just the basic check up the nerve to automatic golf from nine hundred dollars if I went to a private doctor\nSingle payer health care a bird just north of us are sort of labor and people need to go see how bad of an idea this is that they're doing really good job showing it on there so\nThe our TV uh yeah you go check it out appreciate it taught\nAnd or by the way you know you're you're absolutely right uh I run a clean up being here in South Florida we've got a ton of Canadians especially starting in about a month during what turns out to be our season and a lot of folks come year round for exactly the reason you're talking about health care because yes when you are in that type of environment\nUltimately you're at the mercy of the system and the system ultimately is going to weld dictate unless you end up paying through the nose the exact a different outcome which is why all the people come here get better choice of care it's funny how that whole thing works uh yeah yeah and and let's just talk and\nUbiquitous terms for a moment because I like simple concepts to complicated topics or ones that at least have been a bastard eyes as health care has been\nWhat has the government take\nOr ones that at least have been a bastard eyes as health care has been\nWhat has the government taking over it's gotten better\nAt you know somebody that what is the government taking over it's gotten better or what in particular\nThe government had more influence on over the course of time but it's gotten better in your whole life\nIs full of that question somebody the words that you\nThink there'll be some crickets chirping on the other end there by the way talking about the er TV uh you also can check out life

giant scam that the people\nThat are lucky enough to be at the top will stay at the top and everybody else would be at the bottom and no matter what you do society is going to take you out because you

retire America One first month\nSpoke about go do one of the radio show today we're trying to cover the sad sad story of why the common person out there uh can't get ahead in life and what we're perceptions they have about the world and weaknesses they have the human beings to keep them from coming successful\nWe're doing a case study on an email the gentleman sent me about how from his early life he's changed his\nHis skill set over and over and over again to try to stay ahead of ah oh societies are true\nWhich were protected logical advancements and he has not been able to keep up now I'm gonna pick it back up where he says he just became a programmer and he says since there was a lot of demand for programmers background I was making a lot of money and figured I finally found the courage to rely on those stop right there for a second I was making a lot of money whereas all that money\nWhy does the on five ten Fifteen houses wandering the on the part of a complex where's all the money\n[noise] see this is the thing no matter what you do you think you're going to get ahead because you have a good job at a better job with the best job or an incredible job it's still a job and you earn and you spend in you are in a new spend you're earning your spending you're not building any wealth\nYou're not getting anywhere in society and yet you think the world is wrong because they choose you up and spit you out\nThat's because technology will always change if you were a guy that made saddles two hundred years ago you probably had a pretty good business or really a pretty good job now you're broke\nRight ... if you shoot horses back then you had a great job or business or you broke see everything changes constantly\nYou either have to change with it\nYou have to get out of line of change I'm an advocate you through this show today that you can do one or the other ...\nYou either have to change with it\nOr you have to get out of line of change I'm an advocate you through this show today that you can do one or the other you can either change with it or you can step out advocate away from it by just becoming financially free and not have to worry about where society goes\nBoth of those items work so it goes on and says that was until social media\nBecame popular and now people can share their ideas on line without needing a programmer or hire a cheap one which I predict would happen some day in the future so I got\nOut of this business so he ran again\nIt wasn't a business it was a job I change jobs again I'm a something for nothing instantaneously gravitationally diseased\nGuy that likes to hop from job to job to job or basically type a personality to not be so brutal those you know what uh type a personality as as somebody who will throw mud on the wall hope something sticks he changes\nHis mind or her mind over and over and over again they start a thousand projects finish none of them right these are the typical Taipei People\nThat are they're just always looking for a way to make a fast buck there's no investment in the future in this type of mentality none what has he done to invest in his future and why should he deserve do not have to work hard for the rest of his life he's done nothing to change that outlook\nGoes on and says I figure I Need to have the skill where I Do not have to compete with the whole world that is high demand\nSo think about that statement I now figure I Need a skill that I don't have to compete\nWhile\nIs that not complete and total giving up\nI mean that's just I gave up I needed skilled is so low that no human being would want it there's no competition for this job right and so because there's no competition for the job to job is so terrible\nThat I'll be saving right so\nWhat did he do he says and then became a truck driver push I'm currently doing a lot of it except now I hear about how they're making driverless cars and semis which I'm sure we'll workplace our job one day\nYeah one day they will and when they do you'll still be broke you'll see still be looking for another job and you know\nUntil they make guys that clean toilets there's going to be a lot of janitorial jobs around maybe they'll make a robotic limbs till Sunday then you lose that job too but what have you done to invest in the future and by the way why does he like driving a truck I'm driven trucks before mass of solitude no competition\nNo argumentation nobody to deal with you just sit there by yourself in\nTotal solitude don't have to interact with the world boy nice job great job do you make any money you know we have a future know what happens when you can't drive anymore yes you'll be out of work and broke\nHe goes on and says here's the reason for this email I hear you on the radio recently stayed in the EU or expanding nationwide and opening up new officers in other states that's a good thing for your business since you're already successful and say that you have more money than you will ever need I just wonder if you grow so large and\nAdd thousands of do prefer members that your second deal that the second a deal comes available it will be gone within two seconds due to so many people doing going after it\nWell my friend that's already true\nGood deals don't last when there was an opportunity to make a hundred percent return it doesn't matter if we had ten people or ten thousand people the deals are going to be sucked up\nRight but the reality is that what you're talking about is you're talking about the abundance mentality or lack there of you believe in a zero sum game reality of the world you believe\nFor me to have a dollar I have to take it from you for you to have a dollar you have to take it from somebody else and that there's not enough dollars to go around the simply isn't true\nAnd I'm a cover it after I finish a paragraph here says or worse a multibillion dollar company will see what you are doing and duplicate your business model and spend millions advertising worldwide to point to the point where no houses or apartments will be available as investments says they will be bought before you can even see it\nI'll let me tell you a little secret no one's going to duplicate this business because lifestyles does something that no corporate America company could ever duplicate\nIt gives back it has the abundance mentality and believes it doesn't have to have all of the business\nIt believes that can give it away to its customers a lettuce customers become rich instead of it becoming rich in other words I could have been a Donald Trump I could have said I Want to own all this real talk people investing in me I get on billions and billions of dollars of apartment complexes\nWith all the members I have but I was not interested in me being a billionaire I was interested in my members becoming millionaires\nAnd so instead of me taking all the ...\nBut I was not interested in me being a billionaire I was interested in my members becoming millionaires and so instead of me taking all the millions and adding up to billions\nWe taught people's go out and burn the millions and we help them do that no corporation in America can be founded on that kind of generosity it's impossible no company could ever survived that business model except my why\nBecause I've already rich before I started in ... I'm not greedy and you just won't find that many people do that way right most people go to work because they want to make money that you you go to work every day because you want to make money\nI go to work every day because I Want to help people and I don't go to work every day that's the beauty of it I own a business that is out there I go to work on the radio one hour a day I go to work\nFirst of all the deals that we do it lifestyles many of them could not have been done most of them could not have been done if they weren't done his partnerships so if it wasn't for a group of people being educated like mindedly tour they all understand the investment in a business\nThey're not working in the business is not a job they're investing in a business that is an ongoing concern that as a product that's pretty hard to outdated itself because think about it for just a second [noise]\nWhere did they get in that way for us to vaporize ourselves to go to bed at night and sleep we have to have a place delay our head down at night to eat our dinners et cetera et cetera so until they have vaporize Asian\nWe have housing that when the vapors Asian guess what I'm going to invest in vapors Asian\nRight but until then\nHousing has been around forever and probably will be around for a lot longer\nOkay so here it is the guy saying do you could steal all the deals no I couldn't steal all the deals because if I didn't have a group of like minded people we wouldn't have enough money to go out and do all the deals now the next point he's making is once we teach all these people all over the world how to do this there is not going to be enough deals now here's a reality\nI've been doing this in Houston, Texas for Thirty years\nAnd we're still doing deals at a higher rate than we've ever done a map before\nSo that part is why we went to Dallas we've been doing it there for Fifteen Years\nStill doing deals at a faster rate than ever before San Antonio Austin the same thing but now you have to understand is for twenty six years in Houston I've had lifestyles\nWe still have even touched the market we put a dent in the microwave scratched the edge of the market\nBecause there's so many apartment complexes there's like three thousand apartment complexes in years to three thousand dollars three thousand San Antonio and Austin and that's the only just Texas\nThat's our count Midler counting the nine we own down in Corpus Christi et cetera et cetera so here's a point when we expand to a new area like Atlanta where we're going\nThat whole city has Thirty Years' worth prospect of action for us we haven't even begun it just like when they told us when we were high school when I was in high school the stupid idiots told us there was Twenty years of oil left\nTwenty years and that's it will be out of oil\nThat's the lack mentality now there's a hundred years of oil left in each of about five countries out there right in Egypt five good in fact there's probably a hundred years of all and two or three states in this country just one state and yet we still believe we have an oil no\nWe believe that there's so many apartment complexes that if we signed up as many people as we have in taxes in every other state unions are still being a business from to do that and that will be Ken lifetimes before that happens\nBut my point is is with all that said where they're being true to disguise totally miss the mark with his email my point you is how sad is it\nFor him because here is now thirty six years of age\nAnd here's what he believes it seems like the only secure jobs for those who are not already rich are the ones that take many years of sacrifice and credentials such as being a doctor or lawyer which is something not everyone is willing to do does the demand will always be high\nThere it is the only thing you can get rich doing as being a doctor a lawyer\nA thing that which most of us are not willing to do he just nailed it for himself didn't ...\nHey I'm happy that I'm not rich I'm unhappy that I haven't been successful my whole life but I'm not\nWilling to either go do something you would put me in the position that couldn't be ... or number to stick with anything and get better at it like I should have got better at electronics I should have got better at programming but I didn't I didn't I didn't I just kept running and now I'm a truck driver wow\nHe goes on and said I just wanted to see if you could perhaps way my negative way of thinking about this since it's a very sense\nWell it goes on and said I just wanted to see if you could perhaps way my negative way of thinking about this since it's a very since it seems that every money making opportunity will eventually go way of the buggy whip\nThink about it every money making opportunities he spoke of\nWas about work\nIt was about labor\nIt was about doing something to somebody else doesn't want to do that belief system which is killing them\nThink about it if you would have started investing when he was Twenty years old and real estate\nDoll houses that I bought twenty six years ago are still there\nPeople are still living in I don't know because I like this guy I progressed in my knowledge of my business\nSo I went from house to duplex is ... to small apartments to medium size apartments to large apartment\nHigh progress much skill set knowledge base right now I'm trying to do class apartment I'm pushing myself to progress my skill set because I Know that the old stuff will eventually be old too old to using the new stuff all have to understand so I have to be on the cutting edge ... got to be on the cutting edge of the business\nBut this gentleman doesn't want to be on the cutting edge he doesn't want to do anything he wants to go backwards\nShe wants to trade time for money secondly he has no assets the businesses will have assets\nAs inflation occurs our assets go up and dog as income goes up rents go up the acid value goes up\nWe keep growing she keeps having to pay more money his job income gets watered down by inflation\nOur asset values get increased by inflation\nBy friends this gentleman's life has been lived behind the prism of the negativity of failure\nAnd we don't know if there's any possibility that you can never be saved if he's asked for help and I took this email today live this morning and I'm

for up to the minute mortgage news\nI'm trees as ... as always with mortgage expert Shon met her first things first we want to thank all of you who called the show last week last week was booming fill many listeners ... network capital a call at eight hundred seven hundred eight zero six eight ...\nShon was that somewhat surprising being as the market has crept up a debt in terms of home loan right\nYeah one hundred percent I thought last week 'cause there was a lot of great Saturday football games there was the Conor McGregor can be a fight so I thought a lot of attention will be into the sports world but\nActually it was booming a lot of families called uh they they doubt the eight hundred seven hundred eighty six number like usual but what was surprising to me that I was telling you before the show is our social media lines blew up between the consumer affairs the network capital dot net the Google phone number\nAnd those type of resources was definitely a spike a lot of families were interested in cash out pay off credit card debt cash out home improvements\nCash out to afford ball holidays I mean I'm not surprised that people are saying yes right now I was surprised with the amount of phone calls that came in so usually around right now people can afford their Christmas they like a month off the mortgage there's no real better month\nTo have the month off the mortgage payment then right around the end of the year you get a lot of people that start or New Year's resolutions around right now so I'm excited about this week I have a feeling the need the trend is going to continue to fill in a lot of families are really going to kind of digest the market that we're in they're going to realize hey this is what it is like the numbers aren't going to change\nIf anything they're probably going to go the other way on us now we can actually maximize our benefit we can see results today\nLies hey this is what it is like the numbers aren't going to change if anything they're probably going to go the other way on us now we can actually maximize our benefit we can see results today and one thing I like is\nNetwork capital really has a package deal that most families are going to say yes do one thing I like about him is the lender on money which means you get access to amongst the lowest rates in the business they lend borrow money which means\nYou guys get access to the fast during times like a ten day close\nPeople are always on board with getting rid of this quickly um I also like that they don't charge the lender fees like processing underwriting origin nation no re lock the new Adnan feet so this week I Want you guys to be ready to dial this phone number ... to give it to your twice I'm going to give you the special offers\nAnd then we're going to kind of dive in a sense some things that I really think it's got to really pique your interest so this week\nWe're calling eight hundred seven hundred eight zero six aid to register ... tenure fix four percent interest rate would be a PR the just dropped the four point two five oh you have to do is say hello and eight hundred\nAnd that we're capital on Google on consumer affairs on Yelp on Facebook on the better Business Bureau and so many folks called eight hundred seven hundred eight zero six eight it was just a great week and of course network capital\nDid some research they did some pretty sophisticated research actually they wanted to know\nHow was this show doing the people who called how how much were they saving were were were network where are the folks who called really saving 'em enough money to make it worthwhile and what they found was\nAn average monthly savings of five hundred and twenty eight dollars and of course that comes out to six thousand three hundred and thirty six dollars a year\nNot bad for making a simple phone call to eight hundred seven hundred eight zero six say they have mortgage banker standing by right now I live we do this every week Sean and I this is our two hundred and first\nShell can't believe it and I just want to let you know that if you call that number to pursue answers the phone will be a mortgage banker and not somebody to take down your information and make an appointment as somebody get back to you know\nThe person to answer the phone will be the person who answers your questions because if you've been listening to our show for a few weeks or a few months or even just today you have some questions like for example what would your specific\nMonthly payment look like if you shorten the term of your loan\nUm but we before we get to that 'cause I I Love talking about short term loans ten years Fifteen Years and how much that can really change change your life in saving money but first before the break John brought in a recent result a family that went from a thirty or thirty or fix ended up saving\nTwo thousand seven hundred and thirty dollars a month now like I said\nAverage savings five hundred and twenty dollars a month but there is just over the top so I was so curious about so many things first of all you mentioned they had thirty one thousand dollars in credit card debt and forty thousand dollars in personal loans and car notes\nIs that right so they were walking around with this humongous amount of high interest that\nYeah one thing about that resolved that I'm really want to do a better job of explaining as as the customer only owed a hundred and two thousand on their house okay so on the personal loans and the car note the about forty eight thousand soldiers called half\nIts quarterly closed so half of the balance what it was more than triple the total monthly payment on those that because of the alarm and interest rate so what happened is is a lot of families might not have the best credit position or income position or equity position so they're backed into a corner\nTheir family had to take a personal loan and we're going to die in a personal on throughout the show you're going to see why I'm so against it but unfortunately they were having the spent over two thousand dollars on just that dead so by eliminating that debt getting them much better interest rate\nThey were able to really achieve maximum benefits so what I like about this result is gone are the days of ... over paying for for these high rates\nGone or the or the credit card debt gone as the days of let's say damage credits something white the financial sleep clean now they don't have to worry about things in the past like a focus forward this family now has one payments to make I think\nYou know I tell my head was somewhere in the twenty amount of twenty dead so we eliminated all into one so instead of writing corny checks I'd rather just make one low six payment\nUm and that's how this family was able to save so much money no like me I'm In the position with my age I'm thirty five years old I don't really care right now about going back to Thirty years since even twenty seven thirty even though there's a lot I can do with twenty seven hundred dollars in savings with investing and different aspects out there that\nA lot of people can teach you guys what to do but I Would actually go with this approach I'm already able to afford to keep my head above water what I'm doing now not a penny more pending less goes out of my pockets but I'm able to pay it off in\nFour years a lemon months member they were sixteen months into a thirty year fix oh I see much more benefit by by going that route I could have this thing paid off you know before I'm forty years old apple find my savings a foreigner Seventy two thousand\nNow I got incredible credit the next car I buy get better you know better reads the next time I Need\nIt off you know before I'm forty years old apple find my savings a foreigner Seventy two thousand now I got incredible credit the next car I buy get better you know better rates the next time I Need to go and sort of credit card I get better rates if the gift that keeps on giving the month off the mortgage can be used for Christmas\nThey didn't even have to pay for an appraisal so this thing was done in ten business days\nThe Esther refund money is cash money into their pockets so these are the type of results you guys can expect when you dial eight hundred seven hundred eight zero six said now that was more than five times the average savings of her mortgage radio listeners though you know for the average\nCustomer when you dial eight hundred seven hundred eight zero six eight I Want you expecting the same about six thousand three hundred and thirty six year if you were to do with the thirty year fix\nCash out pay off some debt and really just set it and forget it and work with nowhere capitals so I Love their programs I Love the people behind the scenes I Love the business model that they structured I think it's going to be quite a wonderful resolved as time goes on you're going to start seeing this Teresa as rates continue to go up more and more companies are going to either raise their interest rates\nAre even more they're gonna raise their margins are going to\nAdd in lender fees they're going to try to supplement the loss of clientele so I don't want anything to do with that I don't want you guys have anything to do with that and for that reason I Want you to work with network apple dial this number\nEight hundred seven hundred eight zero six said one percent mortgage professionals available at eight hundred seven hundred eight zero six eight\nAnd the one percenters and know how to make it fast how to make it efficient they understand if your weekend and they don't want to spend forever on the phone\nThey can help you in terms of a lot of the paperwork gathering using pretty sophisticated software so if that's keeping from calling let me assure you they understand that your time is precious and they can make it real fast\nAnd number eight hundred seven hundred eight zero six eight one thing a lot of folks asked about and we touched on it\nThey're curious about at ten years or Fifteen year to shortening the term and of course there are tremendous\nBenefits but not everyone is a great candidate a lot of the reason people call the number\nThey want to know what their specific monthly outgo would look like the tenor of the Fifteen I personally think that's a great use for the number maybe it's something you could afford because the rate break can be pretty steep so who's listening should be thinking about possibly going down to maybe a twentieth Fifteen or a ten\nI'd say somebody that likes paying less interest I happen to be one of those guys like\nYou know when you showed me the numbers I was on one of the articles that you found that the difference between a thirty year fix\nAny Fifteen year fix was sixty five percent difference on interest alone so\nThat's alarming to me that got me like that was like the stamp of approval with major easily you sold me hardcore on that I'm also I'm a control freak with my mortgage I Want to when I make a payment I Want to see principal reduction I Want to see noticeable results I Want to see that this winter something of value not interest I don't want to make it rain of interest to my lender\nLike they're not given me Christmas cards they're not you know scratch my back they're not there in a time of need so I Want to take control and that's why I Love a shorter term loan I'm also credit guy I Believe in not only can I help my customers\nSave money on their mortgage but I can show them techniques to what to do with the month off the mortgage what to do with the U.S to refund I like to try to funnel that money towards increasing my credit scores maybe paying off delinquent dead\nMaybe you know offsetting something like a meeting my in my refrigerator needs repair to need a new stove I Need to upgrade some appliances within my home\nThat's great to use the leftover money for like a lot of families love that idea I'm also big on building a security nest egg of equity for a rainy day when you build equity you pay off the loan and when you build equity you all a little bit less which means you own a little bit more and that's why it's called a home owner and own a home oh we're so\nSorry what shorter term doesn't mean you have to do it a lot of our customers like starting with ten
