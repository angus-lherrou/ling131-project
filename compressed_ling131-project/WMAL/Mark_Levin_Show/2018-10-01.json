together every ten minute weekday morning\nAnd I yell for Washington comes to [noise]\nLet me see if I understand Dr Ford has a score or to score of inconsistent\nStatements chase credible\nButter Brett Kavanaugh judge Kavanaugh said something about his drinking days that's inaccurate he's toast\nHe's denied the Supreme Court glad that about right\nNow let's go through a prosecutor's memo like Sherman through Atlanta just stick with me no science Elana\nCarriage Dr Ford is not offered a consistent account of when the alleged assault occurred in July sixth text of the Washington Post she said it happened in the mid eighties\nEnergized thirty lighter to Senator Feinstein she said it happened in the early eighties her August seventh statement to the public refer said that it happened one high school summer in the early eighties budget crossed out the word early for reason she done did not explain\nThis is because the lawyers get a hold of her you see and they're trying to make sure everything's consistent in order to get Kavanaugh\nSeptember sixteenth Washington Post article reported that Dr Ford said it happened in the summer of Nineteen eighty to notice July six mid eighties July thirty early eighties August seven\nEarly eighties but then crosses out early but September a sixteen when she's being a lawyer the summer of Nineteen eighty two wow she not only remembers the year but she remembers the season\nSimilarly that September sixteen Arnold reported that notes from an individual therapy session and twenty Thirteen show her describing the assault as occurring in their late teens\nBut she told the post and the committee that she was Fifteen when the assault allegedly occurred she's not turned over her therapy records for the committee to review and yet ladies and gentlemen she's wave any privileged she has on those records because she either gave them to read them to the Washington Post there is no more attorney client privilege\nBut she's withholding why\nLowest common for victims to be on certain about dates Dr Ford failed to explain how she was suddenly able to narrow the timeframe to a particular season any particular year\n\nWell let's say the shoe was on the other foot and it was Kavanaugh would they tolerate that and say why he's credible no they wouldn't this is a big deal ladies and gentleman\nEarly eighties mid eighties early teens late teens\nThat's not memory loss\nDr Ford has struggled to identify judge Kavanaugh as the assailant by name NO NAME was given in her twenty twelve marriage therapy notes NO NAME was given under twenty Thirteen individual therapy notes\nWhy not\nDr Ford has been claims to recall that she identified judge Kavanaugh by name and twenty twelve by the way before I read on that's her husband ... relevant\n[noise] at that point judge Kavanaugh's name was widely reported in the press has a potential Supreme Court nominee if Governor Romney won the presidential election in any event it took doctor for over Thirty years the name or a sailor delayed disclosure of abuses common so this is not\nShe writes she's nicer than I Am\n\nOne speaking with her husband Dr Ford changed her description of the incident to become less specific Dr\nFord testified that she told her husband about a quote unquote sexual assault before they were married but she told the Washington Post but she and former husband that she was the victim of a physical abuse at the beginning of their marriage she testified that both time she was referring to the same incident\nSoccer Fort has no memory of key details of the night in question details I could help corroborate her account we talked about this last week the memory to me as quite selective specific details\nSpecific details that are most harmful to Kavanaugh no details at all oh cooperation\nShe does not remember who invited her to the party or how she even heard about it she does not remember how she got to the party she does not remember in one house the assault allegedly took place are aware of that house was located with any specificity\nPerhaps most importantly she does not remember how she got from the party back to her house\nHer inability to remember this detail racist significant questions\nShe told the Washington Post the party took place near the Columbia Country club the club is more than seven miles from her childhood home as the crow flies and she testified it was roughly a twenty minute drive from childhood home\nShe also great for the first time in her testimony that she was driven somewhere that night either to the party or from the party or both but she couldn't remember\n\nDr Ford was able to describe hiding in the bathroom locking the door and subsequently ... accepting the house\nSitting in the house she also has also distraught and wanting to make sure that she did not look like she'd been attacked but she has no memory of who drove over or when nor has anyone come forward to identify him or herself as the driver no one\nGiven this all took place before cell phones arranging a ride home would not have been easy indeed she stated that she ran out of the house after coming downstairs and did not state that she made a phone call from the house before she did but that she called anyone else thereafter\nThat's convenient because then they can't look at phone records\nShe does however remember small distinct details from the party unrelated to the assault for example she testified that she had exactly one beer at the party\nWas taking no medication at that time of the alleged assault and I will continue\nThis after the break but as I said last week during the course of this questioning by the prosecutor was devastating\nAnd then we have the X. prejudicial analyst and a host to another one is she doing what is she doing she's growing up I thought I mean that doesn't mean anything to the American means everything\nEverything as it did you\nListening to these more on after she testified they said Kevin our son he comes up and he's not done and they tell you this woman's incompetent incompetent she's confident\nLobby right back\n\nThe national debt is now over twenty train dollars what happens next rising inflation drops ... some experts say another crashes coming what will be left of your investments for your children are your grandchildren will you know you can't fight this not with stocks or bonds but with gold and silver coins and an IRA for about ... precious metals\nOffered a consistent account of the alleged as all writes the prosecutor\nAccording to her leaded to Senator Feinstein Dr Ford heard judge Kavanaugh and mark judge talking to other party goes downstairs well she was hiding in the bathroom after the alleged assault but according to her testimony she could not hear them talking to anyone so in her letter the Feinstein she heard them talking to others\nIn her testimony she could not hear them talking to anyone\nIn her letter she stated I lock the door behind me both loudly stumbled down the stairwell at which point other person's at the house we're talking with them\nQuote unquote but she testified that Dr ... excuse me the judge Kavanaugh or mark judge turned up the music in the bedroom so that the people there's could not hear her scream\n\nShe testified that after the incident she ran into the bathroom lock the door and heard them going downstairs but she maintain that she could not hear that conversation with others when they got downstairs instead she testified that she assumed that conversation took place\n\nNoticed she never said she turned down the music either that any of them turned on the music [noise] her account\nOf who was that the party has been inconsistent according to the Washington Post's accounted for therapy notes\nThere were four boys in the bedroom and what she was assaulted\nShe told the Washington Post that the notes were erroneous because there were four boys that the party but only two in the bedroom and elected a Senator Feinstein she said me and for others were present at the party\nEntered testimony she said there were four boys an additional labeling Kaiser and herself she could not remember the name of the fourth boy and no one has come forward Dr Ford lifted Patrick PJ ...\nAs a bystander quote unquote in her statement to the political refer and enter July sixth tax to the Washington Post although she testified that it was an accurate to call him a bystander she did not lists legal in Kaiser even though they are good friends labeling Kaiser's presidents should have been more memorable than PJ ...\n[noise]\nDr Ford has struggled to recall important recent events relating to her allegations in her testimony regarding recent events raises further questions about our memory raises further questions about her credibility because we're talking about things that are recent a few months ago not thirty six years ago\nDr Ford struggle to remember her interactions with the Washington Post\nDr Ford cannot remember she showed a full or partial set of therapy notes to the Washington Post reporter she does not remember whether she showed the post reporter\nThe actual therapists knows her own summary of those notes the Washington Post article that portions of her therapists knows where it provided by Ford and reviewed by the post but in her testimony doctor for it cannot recall was that she summarize the nose for the reporter or showed her the actual records actually was even more and I took notes during the testimony to\nShe thought she may have summarized them over the phone or couldn't remember whether she physically\nHanded in anything over I mean it was really preposterous we're talking about July, July sixth she\nDoes not remember if she actually had a copy of the notes when she texted the Washington Post WhatsApp account on July six Dr Ford set in her first what's a message to the post that she quote had therapy notes talking about unquote the incident when she contacted the post tip line she testified she'd review\nHe testified she'd reviewed a therapy notes before contacted oppose to determine whether the ... whether they mentioned anything about the alleged since then because I remember she had a copy of these notes and she said in her ... message or merely review them inner therapists off and on wait a minute\nSo she couldn't remember on July sixth if she had a copy downloaded a copy of her therapists notes or had review them in her therapist's office does anyone believe that\n\nShe's providing information to the Washington Post and she can't remember a few months ago she downloaded them from the Internet or if she had reviewed them in her therapist's office\n\nCan you imagine if Kavanaugh said this about drinking back in high school I Can't remember if a white drinking\nAt night I don't remember I had three cans or six I don't remember too are far and we getting here called me saying and I learned a lot of big things so I Would ask call me and I would ask Blumenthal Mr Vietnam vet not I would ask\nHim is a low why\nWhat does that evidence they say more or less\nLadies and gentlemen I'm here to tell you this is not a memory if\nThis is an attempt by her lawyers and I think her now to put a round peg in a square hole or square peg in a round hole you get the point\nIt makes no sense this was July sixth there wasn't thirty six years ago wasn't even six months ago\n\nDr Ford refused to provide any of our therapy notes that the committee and that is outrageous they should be subpoenaed she waived her privilege from these therapy notes\nDr forwards explanation 'em by the way I'm sure Shelley White House White House ... what are we supposed to do rely\nOn a lighter can't rely on\nTrack where they're from by God\nBy the way I have another drink wait a minute not in the public Dr\nFord's explanation of why she disclosed her allegations the way she did raises questions\nShe claimed originally that she wished for her story to remain confidential\nBut the person operating the tip line at the Washington Post's was the first person other than her therapist or a husband to home she disclose the identity of her alleged attacker she testified that she had a sense of urgency to relate the information to the Senate and the president quote unquote she did not contact the Senate\nBecause she claimed she quote did not know how to do that unquote it's very hard\nTo contact the Senate\nYou could what we called Google you could call what we could bang you could what we call call even for one the one you could call or asked one of the people on the beach who you've consulted apparently frequently uh millions of people\nContact the Senate every every year we have our living surges diet and Google on the phone number for the Senate is right there she did not contact the Senate didn't she did not explain why she knew how to contact or congresswoman but not a senator\nSpecter Ford cannot remember of she was being audio or video recorded when she took the polygraph she could not remember whether the polygraph occurred the same day as a grandmother's funeral the day after her grandmother's funeral\nAgain these are all recent don't also been inappropriate to administer polygraph to someone who was grieving says the prosecutor Dr forge description of the physiological impact to the event raises questions\nSays the prosecutor she maintains that she suffers from anxiety claustrophobia post traumatic stress disorder PATS the\nThe day to the hearing was delayed because the committee was informed that her symptoms prevent her from flying\nBut she agreed doing her testimony that she flies quote fairly frequently for her hobbies and work unquote she flies to the mid Atlantic at least once a year to visit her family she's flown to Hawaii French Polynesia Costa Rica she also flew to Washington DC for the hearing\nNo to that her attorneys refused say private hearing or interview Dr Ford testified that she was not clear whether investigators were willing to travel to California interviewer\nIt therefore it's not clear that her attorneys ever communicated chairman Grassley has offered the Senate investigators the meter in California or wherever she wanted to meet to conduct the interview\nWe pointed all these points out they're important she alleges that she struggled academically in college but she's never made any similar claim about her two years of high school\n\nIt's significant that she used the word contributed contributed when she described the the\nIt did when she described the ... the psychological impact of the incident to the Washington Post use of the word contributed rather than cause suggests that other life events may contribute to her symptoms and one question on that point said that she could think of nothing as striking as the alleged assault other word she would not\nHave the prosecutor ads the activities of congressional Democrats and Dr Ford's attorney is likely affect the doctor for its account\nAnd she attached a very detailed timetable\nOnce the lawyers and the Democrats\nGot a hold of events I'll be right back\n[noise] mud\nIn Washington Mall W.
