narrative\nAnd others don't follow media narrative I don't follow the median Arab I follow my own conscience my own principles my own belief system I\nLook around the world\nThe coverage of this ... matter as horrible as that murder is\nIs well beyond\nThe kind of coverage that other human rights abuses that take place in this world which are far more expensive and systemic\n\nHow many other people have been murdered by the Saudi regime I'm sure many others do we know who they are no we don't have the finest idea of who they are but we know how many no we don't know how many well why not because of media could give a damn that's why\nThey could give a damn as I speak to you right now\nBlack Christians in the city and her being slaughtered and rape and torture and the most horrendous

anything at all\nAnything\n[noise] have you heard about how Hezbollah and Hamas torture and murder their own people\nIf they don't toe the line have you heard any of that no yeah I haven't heard a damn thing about Iran the Iran deal our government facilitated the delivery of a hundred and fifty billion dollars to a terrorist regime\n\nOur president of the time Obama oversaw and was intimately involved in every detail of the delivery of one and a half billion dollars in foreign\nUndercover darkness delivered on an airplane a non American airplane hoping they wouldn't be seen\nTo the slot all Nazi regime in Tehran which has one of the highest execution rates in the world\n\nObama didn't come under criticism from the same people who are involved in criticizing our president who's had no role whatsoever in any of this so that media use to attack him the media use it to attack conservatives\n\nI think I read some way or the or the pro Saudi conservatives who the hell the pro Saudi conservatives somehow\nI wound up in that group Mr but it was if I ever say anything that makes me a pro Saudi anything\n\nI said nothing the last two weeks I wasn't on the air\nThe media are diabolical\n\nTheir disgraceful\nI don't know of anyone that's possible who's making any excuses for what the Saudi regime which is an incest us throwback\nRegime I don't know anybody who's making any excuses\nFor the brutal assassination of this journalists but what people are asking is about the coverage\n\nOn the one hand it's non stop on the other hand or they're reporting everything about the gentleman who was murdered\nYou're not allowed to ask and by the way it while you're out of don't ask about climate change down you can't ask don't ask about anything\nYou\nKnow there are legitimate policy questions can we debate those\nIs the president right when he says I'm not going to forfeit a hundred and ten billion dollar purchase of American military armaments which the Chinese or the Russians would sell otherwise why is that a controversial statement\n\nThe purpose of that cell is the benefits us if it purely benefited the Saudis that would be one thing but if benefits America\n\nI mean as I said earlier in the front of what the hell we open an embassy in Cuba it's police tape it portrays ... murders\n\nPresident's been attacked because of his heart policies on China\nI told you Iran has one of the highest execution rates in the world China has the highest execution right in the world as the Tibetans\n\nAsked the other religious minorities in China\n\nAsk any of the political dissidents how they're treated in China\n\nAnd these aren't real trials that take place in China at all\nAll right so what should we do what should we do\nThese are legitimate questions that ought to be engaged discuss\nPolicy thoughtfully considered\nBut who is neat jerking around now the media and all that the president mustard gas resident muster that President said Thirteen to run positions on this\nIt's a non American citizen in the Saudi\nConsulate Saudi territory within the country of turkey\nWithin the country of turkey\nTerritory within the country of turkey\nWithin the country of turkey\nI despise the Saudi leadership I despise the turkey leadership\nDespise them all\nBut I Know how dishonest the media are when my name is thrown around when I'm off the air for two weeks as I said something which I didn't is if somebody see our TV who said something is monitored are managed by me which he is not\nThat you're media socks\nAnd I'm not involved in any whispering campaigns I have a microphone for God's sakes eight and a half million people can hear what I say that's a whisper campaign\nRight back\nWith ... together with talk radio that would be a partnership it could be a tremendous force is changing what we talk\nRadio is not free to just spend all its time partnering with a political party or something like that [noise] so that's an impossibility [noise] and what I'm saying here is we have millions and millions of people listening to this ... let's let's pretend right now five million people or listen [noise]\nGive all of you listening to me right now make sure that five or six people vote on election day we will have a massive landslide\nNo thanks for your call I don't know what he's rambling on about talk radio partnering with somebody or other ... let me explain talk radio talk radio is not this\nYou know it's not it's not the or this isn't the wizard of Oz were behind the curtain there's talk radio and there was Mr Big and all the rest of it and and uh there's the person behind talk radio talk radio is hundreds if not thousands of local\nRegional and national hosts the vast majority of whom don't know each other that are owned by different businesses different companies that have different affiliates so it's not like hey talk right or let's all get together and work with so and so it doesn't work that way\nSo it's not rational to begin with that's number one number two if that's what we did then we wouldn't be talk radio anymore we'd be GOP radio I don't want to be GOP radio\nMy whole point in the first hour as this is an election about us you need to go out and vote about partnering with this winter that one each and every one of us has power each and every one of us has power\nLet's just do things differently this election day you take it upon yourself to make sure that four five six or whatever the number of individuals in your circle family circle church or synagogue circle your employment circle\nFamily circle I think I said that they don't that's all and we will swamp them they won't know what the hell it's very it's not complicated very simple\nNot complicated at all Jay Bakersfield, California the great KFYI will go\nYeah uh yeah I I on the whole ... thing and Trump right I'm really just served as their surveys that ah you know Trump throughout it right has a very ... it's not about the gay sure number one number two he repeatedly defended the Saudi rulers throughout it\nOkay hey buddy on leaning on our on our own intelligence you know it's\nLike a farce of all what you're saying is dishonest\nHave said over and over again he wants to know the facts this is a moving target that's the way it is he wants to know the information he wants to know that you see unlike you and I'm like these cheap shot reporters and commentators on TV this president has a country to run and he has to figure out as best as he's able to [noise]\nWhat's the best interest of the United states of America and the citizens of the United states of America\nSo he's not going to call a talk show or or get on a cable show or or pop off about about this that and the other and he's here he's been sort of adjusting his message is more information comes off that comes in and as he gets more advice on what to do\nPlus there are things going on in the middle East that he's involved in in his stamps involved in that you and I can't even imagine so what do you want him to do\nPlus there are things going on in the middle East that he's involved in in his stamps involved in that you and I can't even imagine so what do you want them to do well let's say the royal families guilty I Know they're guilty or cutting off all relations with them was that make you happy\nNow oh I totally agree and the first part of what you said but that last thing that you just set a second ago you're right it for that investigation found my the big point is you know it's not over\nGet the information number one and then make some decisions right but he keeps defending those guys the Saudis they've got a nice guy the that really bad guy they do a lot of bad stuff and wave going what he kept the fan than those guys\nWhat what is who keep defending those guys spies those guys have they found like he's defending those guys I mean again I I've been sort of observing this from afar over the last the period of time since uh since the Turks put out the information that he was murdered\n[noise] I don't seem defending those guys if he's defending those guys why did the old man the king step in and take the power back from the sun to try and deal with that situation\nWhere ... you know have already come out several times for he came out with that role excused early on that from that so\nThat's all wrong you know you have no evidence yet okay let me thought for all why are we so focused on this\nWell because it's important it's about truth\nAbout honestly it's not that important it's a horrible thing that took place a horrible thing that took place but I I hate to say this 'cause I Know it will be twisted in four thousand different ways but for the United states it's simply not that important\nI mean giving a hundred and fifty billion dollars to the Iranian regime which killed which was involved in killing thousands of American Soldiers that to me is a big game deal\nBut you know the media and the ... supported that deal Obama supported that deal\nThat is a terrorist regime that is an enemy of the United states now I'm not making any excuses this man was Florida and in a horrific way great\nHorrible horrible horrible horrible but I don't know why are the coverage [noise] is is is so massive and neither do you\nObject looking for truth Perrier okay and I don't hear a great man no matter what\nThey say [noise] All right thank you sir\nThe truth is the Saudis murder\n\nThat we know\nAnd do I believe the royal family was involved certainly part of it is certainly the crown prince in my view how the hell are they do this without knowing some of them were his right hand one of them was his right hand ... when I Believe one of his intelligence guy senses top forensic guy over there isn't really any doubt about this\nNo there's no doubt about it\n[noise] but we'll wait for the investigation will get all the facts you know [noise]\nSo what do you want the president to do\nHe says they're going to be the fear that a severe ramifications but he's not cutting off the military so\nSo what else do you want them to do\nI'm quite serious about this I hear that criticism any suggestions what do you want him to do\n\nAnd uh I understand the Washington Post as all worked up about this and sorrow other media outlets I got I understand it and I understand\nThat people are upset about it I don't like it at all I think it's outrageous I'm no fan of the Saudi regime and I never have been\nBut I'm not talking about any of that talking about the reporting is over the top in the sense that it is nonstop\nAnd there's so many other things going on in this country in the world that at least deserves some attention\n[noise]\nI don't know that they'll ever get to the bottom and hopefully they will\n[noise]\nI'll be right back\nDid you do that homeowners now control fourteen point four trillion dollars
