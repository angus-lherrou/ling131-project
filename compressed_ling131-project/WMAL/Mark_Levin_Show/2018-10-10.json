care how well they are even if they were fifty there one that we were street I Would I Would flip out that joy when I taught them\nI'll tell you I think there's two aspects of this first of all I mean you saw this with the kids in the high school that had the shooting last year down in your state where you know they almost immediately they looked like they were media trained professionals with the anti gun anti Second Amendment narrative\nAnd that didn't happen by accident this is what they learn in school in our public schools they they they learn all of these talking points and tactics they

march a year and it's the march for life maybe a second march\nUh here and there but usually eat and that's not our style right we don't have the big Soros groups who were handing out walking around money and passing out the pre printed slow sides\nTo march do you think we have it in us do you think that will set our jobs aside in our in our in our families aside so that we can all come to this country say can town Washington DC and march\nOr do you think that we let our voices be heard by actually being good Americans living our lives\nIf we do not do that\nWe do not get down there and present are cases these people that are voting on stuff will put in there by the people for the people ... themselves fat one at a thing is that common that\nPeople put it the power they start taking

Packers a tough one a couple of weeks ago Tom you W excuse me you're on the mark Levin show\nYeah it's a once in a picture and old western you've seen in the past with an angry mob with torches marching toward a jail cell demanding to hang a man has actually innocent inside that man side was justice cabin on the person that prevented it was sheriff Trump\nOutraged [noise] it's a beautiful image time because that's exactly how it came to you know do you think there's any other Republican maybe Ted Cruz maybe take his butt of the of the sixteen Seventeen Republicans running for president\nI think maybe Trump and crews were the only ones who have the fortitude and the I don't give a crap attitude about the media and the left and the Democrats to stood by justice Kevin uh do you have any doubt that any of those other Republicans would have folded like a a a cheap tent\nI Would have faith and ah Tom Cotton as well but\nHe just he just wasn't running last time I was talking about the the ones who were up yeah\nI Know the ones that are out but you know what can we do about this angry mob mob is led by Chuck Schumer and make no mistake about it and nobody could have made this decision accept him because he had a big choice\nYet either take that chance and roll dice and makes an outrageous claiming and plotters innocence man's reputation or does the reasonable thing and gets five senators four Democrats to vote with the judge he gamble and lost and what's the consequence for Chuck Schumer\nKevin McCarthy is going to roll out legislation to to for the house arrest to fund the wall and all the Republican senators need to support that by going up to the microphone saying if we win this election we support passing it in the Senate by simple majority that should be the consequences for Chuck Schumer\nDoing this filthy nasty evil thing that he did to Kavanaugh because our ... what the Democrats as completely gone now there's no reason to have the stupid filibuster and Chuck Schumer needs to have his deal with it completely taken away\nWell said Tom well said you can drop the Mike on the one except for one last question is your great Governor Scott

going to pull this one out that he got a pretty good pull the other day but it's still looking pretty close what are you hearing on the streets\n[noise] it's hard to gauge the state the state has psycho because it it\nWe had when we had our great Governor Tommy Thompson we had horrible Democrats than of terrorists and now we finally have a Republican I'm assembly and a Republican Senate and our CIA and Republican governor but there's this heidel wave\nOf Madison and Milwaukee and its counterbalance by the other people at work and the rural area I Know urban areas but it's it's I think he's gonna do it I\nI don't think I Hope so that it I don't think the polls are accurate because people shy away from\nAdmitting that Republicans because right now we are ... you know just going to get a laugh\nWhile yeah listen I Know what the cultures like up there Tom in Green Bay Wisconsin thank you for the call I Know I I think that's that's pretty [noise] I think that's the same pretty much everywhere in this country right now where people are Republicans conservatives are Trump supporters they just keep their head down there are taken a call from a poll street or who's on the other end of that line\nYou don't have time you're busy you have a job that's why the polls were so wrong almost every time that's why they've been so wrong about Scott Walker in Wisconsin from his first election to the recall election to the reelection but Wisconsin's economy is finally booming\nBecause of the conservative policies economic poses a Walker and the Republicans and Madison uh put forth I sure hope he wins is a good man\nI promise you another article to show you how the resistance in it's insidious way is a is is stopping and impeding the regular functions of our government and this one in real clear investigations this article which are also sharing my Twitter Larry O'Connor [noise]\nUh this one tells you how the hidden hand of Mike Bloomberg\nIs behind it all the headline is how Bloomberg embed green warriors in blue state governments it's by Jeff patch it real clear investigations it's a very well researched investigation it's a long article give you the synopsis of it though in New York University school of law program funded by billionaire Michael Bloomberg\nWho by the white wants to be president he's officially he will be running for the Democrats are going to be like twenty twenty five nominees running for the Democrats their first debate\nIs like in six months it's going to be in spring of twenty Nineteen I Can't wait is going to be phenomenal to see them all ... each other alive and tried to be a ... as socialist as possible to win the nomination\nIt's going to be a complete disaster for them and I can't wait on top of the popcorn now Michael Bloomberg is placing lawyers in the offices of democratic\nState attorneys general and paying them to prosecute energy companies and challenged Trump Administration policies on energy and the environment you understand what the opening sentence said\nThis is a program at the NYU school of law it's funded by Bloomberg and they place lawyers in the offices of the state's attorney general\nAnd and their job they're getting money from the NYU law program not from the state but they're working in the state attorneys general office\nTo sue the Trump Administration\nAnd energy companies nine states continuing on the article nine states and Washington DC including New York Illinois in Pennsylvania are participating in a multi million dollar program\nFunded by the media magnate an ex New York city mayor who re registered as a Democrat this week amid expectations of a run for president in twenty twenty the fourteen current fellows in the program report to the attorneys general but they are paid\nBy NYU's Bloomberg funded state energy and environmental impact center where these these these socialist groups all have these insidious names the state energy and environmental impact center it's just a big slush fund to pay lawyers to disrupt the Trump Administration\nAnd to make life miserable for energy companies state AG officers hire these trained lawyers not students but season professionals with years of experience as special assistant attorney general D.C Howard city assistance\nThey're special assistant attorney general they don't work for the state but the answer to the state attorney general\nUnder terms of the arrangement the fellows works solely to advance progressive environmental policy at a time when democratic state attorneys general have investigated ensued Exxon Mobil and other energy companies over alleged damage due to climate change\nAlthough many government agencies have employees funded by outside sources critics say using special interest money for targeting government action is inappropriate yeah I'm One critic who would say that\nSays outrageous New York Pennsylvania are you happy with this\n[noise]\nChristopher Horner a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute who wrote a report on the NYU center said the fellowships come with specific strings attached quoting him now\nSenior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute who wrote a report on the NYU center said the fellowships come with specific strings attached quoting him now the AG offices must agree to use prosecutors to advance progressive clean energy climate change and environmental legal positions Horner set\nDavid Hey is the center's executive director did not respond to multiple requests for comment I'm sure he didn't because we got it we got 'em dead the rights we got um red handed\nBlumberg throws millions of dollars at this and why you program NYU that hires attorneys hired guns places them in the offices of the attorney general the attorney general doesn't come out of his budget doesn't come out of the state budget\nThey answer to the attorney general but you know who's bidding they're doing they're not doing the bidding of you that voter you the people in those states they're doing the bidding of where the money's coming from\nThis program at NYU funded by Bloomberg that
