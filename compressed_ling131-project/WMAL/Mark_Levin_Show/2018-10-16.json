good evidence that that person may not be guilty of the crime\n[noise] ladies and gentlemen the chances of losing their job if not being put up on criminal charges yourself depending on the severity of the allegation\nAre significant\nIt's becoming clear as day now that the FBI according to multiple members of Congress you've seen this information had information that George Papadopoulos was completely innocent of this that this Russian collusion thing was a fairy tale is made up but the information they presented to the Pfizer court\nWas not that folks was not that it was only this stuff alleged basically in the ... and hearsay based items that can never be verified now why is this important that there may be scope of tore evidence [noise]\nSupport and folks because of this whole\nEntire case right now is married to this latest narrative this is all they have if the entire reason for investigating the Trump team was based on a case where the FBI information the guy they were targeting was not guilty at all this whole thing collapses the whole thing that's why this is so critical now what's the big question here\nThe big question is what is the exculpatory evidence and I want to put to potential theories out there for you [noise]\nWhat is the exculpatory evidence the evidence indicating Papadopoulos may not be guilty that these members of Congress are saying exist that's out there in the in the ether\nI make a suggestion the right if this meeting with doubt or in the ... bar Alexander down her and the so called a you know exchange of all the Russians may have dirt on Hillary in town over so suspicious\nAnybody record that meeting do you find it even remotely interesting that Papadopoulos himself who now that he is a he has taken a plea on this lying to federal agents charge you have to do you find that even remotely interesting that that Papadopoulos himself keeps bringing up the fact that he feels he was recorded\nBy does that matter [noise]\nLadies and gentlemen what if the recordings of this meeting with down her saying nothing of the sword about Russian collusion or anything else\nOh that'd be a little bit of a problem now wouldn't it wherever that\nWe'd have a little bit of an issue you think maybe a ... a judge would want to know that there there may have been a recording of this\n... I'm not sure there is I'm just saying that's out there it's out there that there may be something what if it's a recording\nOf this conversation that's not exactly the way the FBI painted it oh [noise]\nYeah that one's things a little bit\n[noise] we make another suggestion to [noise] the guy who's\nSupposedly gave Papadopoulos this information about the Russian dirt this guy Mr should I call 'em the pusher he's pushes the information into the sphere according to multiple reports on this they interviewed miss that they interviewed him the FBI in February\nBut for the for the last Pfizer renewal for the last five or a new will in front of a judge whether they swore to a five to ... to get all Papadopoulos\nPaid we got to get these guys [noise] what if Mitch should who allegedly push this information about Russian dirt into the Trump sphere that was pulled out later what if he wasn't working for the Russians at all [noise]\nWhat if he was working for Friendly's folks to\nThe book lays it out I think it pretty conclusive case that somebody has a lot of explaining to do about exactly who Joseph ... was\nIs is potentially exculpatory evidence that George Papadopoulos was set up the whole time he was the fall guy that he was going to be the one maybe they targeted a low level guy 'cause they thought it would be easy folks this is this scandal the century and reckless interview agree to Maria barn Roma this ... is very telling\nIt's telling for very precise reasons he's indicating that the entire case the FBI is making right now was it George Papadopoulos started this thing while there's potentially information out there saying George\nMaybe instead of the whole thing altogether\nThe thing while there's potentially information out there saying George Papadopoulos may be innocent of the whole thing altogether\n\nOn believable unbelievable\nAll right let me take some calls do you want to get to the calls or if you want to get a scholarship me seven

is\nIs there a grand jury is this guy will you know he only played out to lying you know he did more than live we know elite that a felony is he in front of a grand jury well ...\n... or ... here's here's what I find interesting about walls\nWolf lawyer if you read back on some of the case documents waltz lawyer at one point had um put out there that in walls defense because remember Wolff wasn't charged with leaking\nWolf with sharks and for for folks for those those you have to understand what is a shame about James was a Senate staffer on the intel committee that was handling it Spygate investigation he was arrested by federal agents for I'm lying about basically lying about leaking he wasn't arrested for leaking itself that's fascinating\nBecause in his defense attorney was basically threatening to call who in his defense\nSenators on the Senate intel committee why is that interesting and fascinating about the case because if wolf is charged with lying about leaking\nAnd his lawyer saying no no he's not lying we're going to call the senators in his defense what does that tell you folks that maybe the senators on the intel committee may have had some role in this

Menendez he he still leaning and the ... what happened what does it take you actually have to be inside of a jail cell before\nYou will not be voted for your demographic Massachusetts or er Jersey or what happened people come on now I got to be some sense left in there somewhere so anyway ah Jeff deal uh everybody should have been gay because for many including potentially with some folks in Massachusetts might be the first time you've even heard the guy's name but he's trying to give 'em credit\nBy the way I Am by muddy inform article that gives me and Brian my radio and talking about the fund that the president has had on back of Elizabeth Warren's botched rollout of protest probably\nThat those high cheekbones she talked about really had something to do it by president out to eighty today that Pocahontas the bad version\nSometimes referred to as Elizabeth Warren\nIs getting slammed she took a bogus DNA tests and it showed that she may be one and one thousand and twenty four Indian is what he's referring to there are less than the average American now the Cherokee Nation denies her DNA tests as useless even they don't want her phony\nHe continued you went down there he had a lot of fun just worried that now that her claims of being Indian Indian heritage have turned out to be a scam an ally\nElizabeth Warren should apologize for perpetuating this fraud against the American public Harvard called her a person of color amazing con and would not have taken her otherwise and again\nThis is the important point here we're talking about the Elizabeth Warren deal is not just oh it's another politician ... it's not that number one it is\nA lie it is a fraud but she has kept up her entire adult life\nBut secondly it's not a victimless situation she committed fraud for personal gain every single step of the white educationally professionally even went in because he had a couple steps along her career path\nThese Ivy League institutions and identify her as a Caucasian\nShe made sure that she was always referred to and had would have changed that she was Native American or a person of color in the areas like seriously\nBut in the president's still isn't done he said thank you to the Cherokee Nation for revealing that Elizabeth Warren sometimes referred to as Pocahontas you can just see him in and hear him saying that to gang is a complete and total fraud and again\nYou don't have to listen to me you don't have to listen to the president United States all you have to do take a straight from the pride that she claims to be part of\nA kind of tough tough for her to rally back from that one of the way the the president in terms of choice holy cow he had all kinds of moments today including moments in with a story Daniels now to be ready for it to us I guess horse face\nThat that happened today but uh we we have a bunch of other stuff obviously it's been going on in the news including the Saudi Arabians situation will be discussing that a little bit later in the show we have the oh by the white Honduran caravan part whatever that says three point oh\nThat is on its way here and this was a really cool thing president waiting out\nThe United states has strongly informed the president upon doors but at the large caravan of people heading to the U.

L. go\nHey how you doing a good first time caller longtime listener I'm twenty two I'm a biology student I Know a little bit of an addict I'm as you said you know it's ten generation you know it's a thousand twenty fours a bit of Native American and were conservative she's like one two hundred fifty six [noise]\nNative American I mean I'm probably one thousand twenty fourth of like every race that there is\nI like the the thing that really frustrates me as a as a young young thinking person is white cat or these politicians make their careers based on their own Barrett on their own talent on their own way to them or their connection with the people and how to solve issues and stuff it it's pretty annoying\nGod Bless you that this is the first time you've gone through a main amen brother [laughter]\nThis is one of my my all time favorite calls quite honestly or is it Twenty one years of doing radio this is a moment that makes my heart saying you're twenty two you were in science and you're in Washington DC and you're making political sense how did that happen in and do you have any friends\nI have plenty of friends or where the revolution uh but uh uh I have to get a lot of credit to my parents who really are invested a lot of knee and not just to frustrate you need more ah the word pedigree\nIs actually a like a technical term that we use in genetics and it's because the people don't really see the difference between our animal than people that I think though that were you pedigree for people and animals\nTo remind me of a sad song you and me baby in Athens A mammal anyway or ... amazing Josh I mean really\nA longer view and spread your wisdom to as many people as possible lord knows we could use that they're a great call critical All right let's go to a Peter and Illinois already theater I uh I I it's a tough act to follow so you've got a up your game that was a pretty impressive call there\nWell when you were talking about the brain dead voters in Massachusetts you have to remember that these are the same people who after Teddy Kennedy left a woman to drown in the bottom of Chappaquiddick reelected him six times back to the United States Senate\nYou raise a very important and interesting point in fact the only thing that he did get caught disqualified problem was a well ultimately his presidential bid and bad points to add to your right if you can also going to get away with Chappaquiddick and you still get reelected in Massachusetts\nAh you know I'd I defer to the vet is uh that that is an excellent point which by the way that that whole thing in the end it's fascinating by the way every now and then uh because of the glass named people will think that\nUh because I'm In broadcasting I Am directly related to the person who helped break that story one Roger Mudd back then and I am not I'm not a somewhere in the very ah outer lying to a bar or a genetic silver pedigree you might say there would be a some overlap but actually\nI Am a more aligned with them for me a ... there is one\nInfamous member of the the family than I Am directly related to him that would be Dr Samuel but\nWho may be familiar was one of the uh co conspirators in the assassination of Lincoln he was a doctor actually fix the flag and end up having a whole kind of interesting deal where you went to the door to go\nIt was one of the uh co conspirators in the assassination of Lincoln he was a doctor actually fix the flag and end up having a whole kind of interesting deal where you went to the door to go and yeah then that's the story for different day but anyway that is my relation not Roger Mudd who broke Chappaquiddick which by the way it's kind of interesting people thought after that\nOh Roger must be the best Republican guy ... now\n... best I Know to this day he's still a Democrat it's just that he was doing his job at magic a bad thing actually has some people in the news business that did their job\nAnd it got really you know yeah yeah the Kennedy was running against a quarter they're\nKept in pain that it'll friendships that was my nickname for him in in Georgia by the way from suburban Atlanta so a nickname was always kept and being in fact one of my favorite parodies from many years ago was that I remember the mountains and all them enjoy commercials\nYou know sometimes you feel like an egg I kind of had some ... like that you know sometimes you feel like and that sometimes you are one you know in the plenty of Jimmy Carter is um so you could throw in there are so anyway it just a as an inside but yeah so that cleared the path for Jimmy Carter\nTo do to win the nomination again for the Democrats and get his butt whipped by one Ronald Reagan so that story at least was happily ever after for the country now so heavily app ever after for Massachusetts or for the United States Senate ah because to your point he continued to win time after time after time\nAll right how so called ...\nWomen we are taken to like three weeks away from election day\nThere's a lot to keep in perspective and one of the things that I Will frequently point out you um have hurt me anywhere along the way you you probably heard me say things like there are two sides to stories that are one side to facts tend to be pretty a\nParticular about the facts you know you don't get it it's kind of like you know ... we're really not having a conversation about you being a Native American Elizabeth Warren because what you are not\nRight so you you can't you would that would embrace of false premise which then takes me to the premise of the premise of anything is false than anything built upon it is as well\nLast friday I introduce the sliding scale of morality which means that and people always wonder how is it you don't have somebody who under best day seems like a pretty good person and then several underway wow they really are awful and they're stabbing you in the back in their line\nAnd and that's because you have some people that have the moral compass that is stronger than others you know let's say that on our best day we're in eight out of a a one through ten ten being perfect which none of us are well if you're an eight even on a bad day you're probably not going to be worse than a five therefore when you're ... going to go out of your way to hurt somebody else for your own personal benefit\nWell then you bring into somebody like ah oh I don't know\nElizabeth Warren clearly clearly under sliding scale morality one of us with worn\nPretty a moral person because she is willing to hurt somebody that's just that she's wanting to commit fraud is that she is willing to hurt somebody for personal gain and once again not a victimless crime because somewhere\nMany times over all throughout her academic career throughout her professional career leading up to the time that she was a United States senator she took the thought of it actually Native American\nSo somebody did get hurt it's pretty moral on the sliding scale of morality that is the willingness to hurt somebody\nFor your own personal benefit ah so you put it all together\nTwo sides of stories wants that affects the premise and the sliding scale morality ultimately get is that yes\nElizabeth Warren sometimes referred to was Pocahontas is a bad person who is pretty amoral and again\nTwo sides to stories on side effects if you want to be the person who defends taking this law to the actual Native American\nAnd you can justify that not bringing on we'll have that conversation [laughter] someone can also talk to the Cherokee Nation as well because they have a few things to say about it [laughter] well get paid a ... by mud in for the great one month\nWashington Mall W.

target the outcome of bin Laden but\nHey we we know that ah\nWe know that we've got problems there Saddam Hussein bad dude if he goes down I mean yeah that that that makes sense in the people that could be afraid they're gonna want to be free not understanding all the complications\nSo once things didn't work out exactly the way that we all hope to and we're kind of led to believe that they would I decided I was going to go straight to the source and read the ...\nStarts out by the way and they'll give you the Reader's Digest if you're not familiar starts\nOut kinda like sunshine law Bob sitting by the end it's kinda like hey if you don't see the world the way we do a you die and by whatever\nMeans necessary the groundwork ultimately the groundwork under ... now you have is one practice obviously many different sects some of which are positive\nBut three is not true law in all forms is evil\nAnd by the way if you want to argue this re laws not evil again I I guess you can but then you have to make the case that women are subservient to ... to men that if a woman his rights for example she should still be stoned to death because she had sex with the rape is\nI mean just details you know that if you're homosexual as well it was like about the ... come out and don't understand ... ... ...\nIf you are a homosexual against what he gets don't because you are homosexual or a you know these days they they they just got a ... sometimes they don't get the whole formal stoning thing together they they just all show buildings or whatever but the part of the problem\nIn us being somewhat immune from the realities of Islamic terror\nWe can take for granted the safety that we have day to day that is not present elsewhere in the world a little detail for you that you probably were not aware of how many Islamic terror attacks do you think of happened that have been documented around the world so foreign twenty Eighteen thing about it for a second got number\n... probably one thousand five hundred and eighty nine [laughter] probably a little bit higher than what you thought said just today for example in Mali\nA hundred and eighty nine [laughter] probably a little bit higher than what you thought to just today for example and Molly you had a terror attack a woman writing her donkey blown up by Islamic terrorists\nEarlier today in Afghanistan U.S forces citizens that were bombs by Taliban\nYou probably didn't even know that yesterday in France you had a man attack somebody with a chisel raising all probably\nDidn't know about that see even sometimes in countries like France [noise] it doesn't get reported every year there's a lot more to that story\nIs that the root of it I guess what\nThey're still didn't do that in Saudi Arabia\nOr the situation becomes that much more complicated\nTo say the conversation is getting going on\n[laughter] um I think that this lady is trying to ... herself seemed like a minority to get people would just like her\n[noise] and ah [noise]\nI was telling them you know I think that these people with the Democrats are trying to do is\nBasically turn this country to Mexico or or even Britain as well I'm someone who I Am here in the United states under the ACA program\nAnd it I think I think it really sucks you know that there's a ... these people have the nerve to actually put themselves and make themselves look like oh we're wanting to under you guys just to try to get sympathy from anybody and anybody who actually cares\nYou know have you on a ... how long have you been here ...\nI've been

in in what's your perspective\nYou know what I'm like in any any like any race there are good people there are bad people I've had good experiences and really bad ones too but overall ... ... people have in this country have it's like oh let me let me just say this\nBut the privileges or the ... everything that people have in this country a lot a lot a lot of the most if not everybody in the Democratic party picks up for grabs her you know I ... it just to me it's frustrating because\nWhat I what I remember when we're in first all Trump for president all everybody all the celebrities
