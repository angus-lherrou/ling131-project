carries much greater way being the president signs that can what about the assassination of the five policemen in Dallas\nFollowing the anti police remarks that President Obama and Eric Holder and tragically he didn't even remember that until I pulled it up on the Internet\nMost or you just said something and not even allowed to say [noise] while Trump is blamed and I told you two days ago you could see it coming they're starting to aim at Trump trying to turn the story and the Trump um that's\nPerfectly fine things say whatever they want about Trump it's just a easy just just far away\nBut if you bring up the fact that Obama was truly trashing cops and law enforcement and holder was too and they're nationalizing these ah these local police departments and some of the really reckless things that they said\nWhether it was for a good center Baltimore both towns by the way ... which have not recovered from what took place a\nYou're not allowed to say that stuff you're not allowed to say that stuff\nAnd yet the fact is the rhetoric was outrageous again I don't consider it being the reason that these are\nThese cops were murdered the guy was an absolute not and so forth and so on\nBut the media will never be consistent because the media are of Obama's ilk they are progressive idiot logs their status that's who they are and they and they reject the election of Donald Trump that's why they hate him so much Ari Craig thanks for your call Hamilton New Jersey I Know where it is it's a very very nice town it's a matter of fact [noise]\nJohnny Washington DC the great WMA yeah

of them are are regulations have another image keep the government open and fully fund our military fund the end I age you know I'm the only one in the region in the Washington region whose Republican inside the beltway and if you don't have a Republican and a Republican administration [noise]\nThis is going to be a one party town and will be like Chicago or Baltimore where you don't have different voices you know speaking up and and working for our\nLocal region and so I think it's really important that we have a voice that it's going to be able to work with the administration for priorities for the northern Virginia\nHere's here's your opponent West is not just a Democrat and I will be fine\nShe's a radical she will join the radicals in the house of representatives I mean the hard core radicals the open border radicals the mass\nOf government radicals and so forth and so on and I'm Nancy\nPelosi has put in over a million dollars in the race and now Bloomberg's coming in and doing two million because they saw what we saw in our polling which is the racist tied very close and they kept saying they thought they had it all put away but I'll tell you we're\nWe're in here we're fighting because if we can get this great record that we have of you know growing the economy getting more people back to work um you know passing the opioid legislation that the president signed this week at the White House\nThat I was there with Democrats and Republicans celebrating that we got this national emergency in the opioid crisis six billion dollars that were doing to help\nAnd the press doesn't want to talk about that so I appreciate you being a place where we talk about issues and the good things that we're getting done for the country and my opponent opposes this agenda and just wants to resist were about results there about resistance about you know getting things\nThat improve the quality of life in advance our economy protect you know our citizens public safety I been endorsed by the police benevolent association but I've also been endorsed by and supported by the federal employees pack as well as every business group involved so I brought together a diverse coalition\nWhat what kind of groups of back your opponent\n[noise] well the uh the the metro union group that is running an attack\nOut I keep threatening to shut down the um the metro in the Washington DC area and violate yeah and violate the law\nAnd they're attacking me for not raising taxes so my opponent attacks me and then people like this was this is a union that was so you know this functional that the Obama administration supported suited\nAnd that to supporting her and and other union cruise but she hasn't gotten you know any business endorsements she wouldn't even sit down to interview with the police benevolent association and this is someone she put her own\nStaff into fake parties city costumes fries\nPolice in or out to imply that she had the support of the police when in fact the police have endorsed and supported me because of my record on\nPublic safety on let me let me ask you this before we run out of time roads to big deal in northern Virginia [noise] on there's a lot of road construction going on and that's even before the president pushes through an infrastructure program but she's a heavy duty tax or on the toll road as\nIt was the was for that that they're forty six dollar told you see when you're ... you're going to Washington she was for them before she was against them [laughter] and she was on the committee that you know that they put through that but more importantly she's saying she was against them yet Terry McAuliffe who put that into place\nHow she was ineffective and persuading him now you look at something where I Know we might disagree on this but I really advocated for the I'm a pay raise for our federal employees and the president and you know the administration initially it was going to do a pay freeze\nAnd I went to them politely made my case and talked about why it was important that people who you know at the FBI the CIA all this\nAnd I went to them politely make my case and talked about why it was important that people who you know at the FBI the CIA or this or that they got their pay raises so they can do the good work they did and [noise]\nYou know arresting a character that they got today and so um I work politely with the administration and that she was ineffective and getting Terry McAuliffe to do anything\nAnd and get rid of those forty six dollar calls and so we need somebody who defected who can work with you know a Republican administration or a Democrat I'm demonstrated that and and I've always been\nSomething when advocating lower taxes ferry\nAnd public safety which is why I'm thrilled to have the support of our police and\nYou are in a tough district some marginal districts and what they're hoping of course is that they can scare the hell out of everybody in northern Virginia\nA particularly the federal workers and others and the teachers are the usual unions and so forth to turn those people out and what they've done and the Democratic party is they have selected the most extreme radical Nancy Pelosi like candidate they possibly could\nAnd they're hoping to turn the entire area blue so it's crucially important\nLet me speak to all of a nights out there many conservatives out there as well I don't know it is crucially important that you come out and vote up and down the ticket and you come out and vote for Barbara Comstock\nUm she may not be as conservative as you like but she's not a radical cook like the like her opponent who clearly is\nAnd I've known you for decades and I know you're a person of integrity and ethics\nAnd I think it's very important that the that the people come out and vote for you conservatives moderates independents at the Republican Party unite as the Republican Party's uniting all over the country 'cause this is a different kind of election I'll give you a sixty more seconds ...\nWell I I thank you mark for highlighting and really talking about the issues that matter here and we just have a great opportunity now to continue on this path to prosperity that we have with our great economy going and are strong military and national security so I thank you for letting that and\nYou know if I get my

brain dead you realize when you get off of work whatever time you get off by the time you get home and you eat dinner there still three or four or five hours left at night you can get something done\nI Would suggest to you that what you need to do is you need to start thinking about investing in yourself\nBefore you start investing money out here we're going to talk about investing money today to don't get me wrong we're going to get to that but before you spend any time going out there in investing money I think you need to invest money in education for yourself\nWhat types of education I think you need some ... ... out of the cage and motivation\nYou know where do you want to be in life what do you want to be in life where are you going in life you know you hear this over and over and over again but like I said until I got up the alcohol and said okay look I'm already where I Want to be that's a very easy thing to say I am a piece of garbage middle class human being\nI

talking about the fact that he believed that poor people in his definition to poor was anybody that wasn't rich or poor people are greedy and selfish individuals\nThat his definition is the explanation was pretty interesting you said you know poor people are all about me me me and uh that's about as selfish is going to be what can I earn what is my pay check where do I live what do I drive\nHowever my kids what grades to my kids get he said if you ever heard any more sickening and cry baby ... self centered is that\nInstead of what can I Do to improve the world well can I Do to grow\nMy resources to where I have enough to give away and he's talking about rich people are way\nWay way\nNicer than poor people now that is so different than what you believe but I'll tell you this if you go to a poor person's house and you meet their kids and their family and the white and hugs and you'll find that the husband and wife don't share their financial\nPerson's house and you meet their kids and their family and the wife and hug them you'll find that the husband and wife don't share their financial information sometimes even with each other\nAlmost always not with their kids their kids learn nothing about finances because the parents won't talk about him because the parents are embarrassed about what they're doing with their money\nThey are not growing a family legacy they are piling a little bit of money into an account hoping that some day we'll get them by the darkest moments of their life to survive\nThey are planning for\nMere survival they're already living a life of quiet desperation now they're planning for a life of mere survival\nWhere is the abundance in that\nPoint of view can you share that with me where is there something about wow my family is going to have a wonderful life because I Want them\nBecause I Want to go and have the ability to help my church I Want to have the ability to help other people like it lifestyles that thirty five thousand clients\nMany many many of which have already retired hundreds maybe thousands of them have retired\nUh how many people more can I help how can I make help quicker faster better\nThose are the kinds of things that millionaires get up and think about how can we do more faster and better for those people out there\nNo worry about quote comes back to me because it's going to come back to me\nIf I put enough out there in the universe the universe is going to bring enough back to me if you don't right now have enough going on in your life to make you where do you want to be if you're not where you want to be you're not putting enough out there are guys you're not out there putting it out making it happen creating activity in your life\nYour circle of influence is a symbol\nOf the world\nNow every time you buy something and you invest in something an asset of business you now have influence over a larger group of people\nAnd you make their lives better if you've ever read house do you have a nice red house or people happy there have you influenced their happiness if we have an apartment complex that you'll hundreds of people\nAre they happy there have you influenced their happiness are you out there producing happiness in the world so that you can and return receive your of bonded return\nOr are you sitting on the couch watching and being pissed off at Nancy Pelosi which is a complete idiot or any other one of the millions hundreds of politicians you could just look at right now you can go now to listen go idiot idiot idiot idiot idiot idiot I don't know how we elect people\nI think we go the dumber they are the better the chances of them getting elected\nBut what's worse is not only do you get elected each you sit and listen to him like they actually knows something those guys no nothing they will not help you or your family get where you want to be\nThey are out there to stop you from getting where you want to be that's what government does government doesn't tell you it stops you it takes away from you steal from you it doesn't help you in any way shape or form a\nGovernment by pure nature is something that has to suck in not give out\nRight so why do you spend all your time paying attention to these idiots it doesn't make any sense right so what should you pay your attention to you should be paying your attention to those things which will help to expand the universe\nAnd return those positive will bring back to you and your family to do that you have coming to you from putting out all these positive things in the world\nBut you can't do that if you go home at night and shell out in front of the TV you can't go home at night and just crashed yourself down with alcohol like I was doing for a couple of years it doesn't work there's no way you were at the end the second you pick up the bottle and started drinking it's done for the day\nPeriod you're over I Know I did it and\nYou would ask me well why don't you stop well my defense was I don't want us to see I could if Mitt to myself as a millionaire is actually a multi millionaire I'm not going to call myself a mega multimillionaire but multimillionaire and access\nUp I was very happy with who are out of that money is coming in businesses are working everything's operating and say well why can't died six\nI was very happy with who are dead bodies covered in businesses are working everything's operating they'll say well why kids' eyes sixty to just sit back and relax the answer is not really sitting back and relaxing what I'm doing is pickling myself\nYou were born to live my question is are you living no I'm not asking you to go out there work don't get me wrong this is not about work this is about investing and growing your badge stringent\nI don't want it there I wanted a deal I Want to buy more income so let's take a look I can take I'm going out and buy an apartment complex right now I can take a part of that money\nAnd that money right there probably are as me somewhere around three hundred thousand dollars a year in income that'd be one percent I'm actually earning two percent of most of my savings account but so let's say I make three hundred four hundred thousand a year in interest eagle boy that's incredible I could live off that there as well and good oh that's terrible\nThe rate of return on that investment is terrible\nNow I go out and buy an apartment complex\nI met in the process of by one right now when I buy that apart but itself costs me nine or ten million dollars which I'm not expecting you to understand who's just takes zeroes off of all this discussion\nAnd it will make me between nine hundred and a million dollars a year\nNow what's interesting about that is it will make it for me and tax free income\nIn addition\nTo that I mean and it's about fifty thousand dollars a month in income if you look at it that way but not counting the other auxiliary or ancillary type incomes and it makes up a little bit about fifty grand a month which would be somewhere around see fifty times twelve is six hundred thousand dollars\nBut it's paying down the mortgage another two hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year\nNow what's interesting is the depreciation on this which is the ability to earn income without paying taxes on is somewhere around a million dollars nine hundred and some thousand dollars so all that incomes going to be tax free\nRight and\nIn addition to that because of the new tax laws that Trump past I'll probably get another two hundred and fifty thousand dollars worth of deductions right out of the blocks the ride off against my other incomes and other things\nSo you think about this I'm going from let's say nine hundred thousand dollars or any one percent is nine what would that be Ninety thousand a year or two percent it's a hundred and eighty thousand you're going from a hundred and eighty thousand a year\nTo almost a million a year in income the hundred and eighty thousand would have been taxed\nAnd the million a year as tax for it you know like on Trump doesn't want to show his tax returns because he makes billions tax free you my friend every time you put into that a savings account you're paying income tax on that or if you're putting it in the four one K. and yet where you're not paying taxes this year\nBut somewhere along the line when you take it out you had to pay taxes on\nWe are going to avoid taxation both when we are in it and then later when we sell the property we're going to ten thirty one that forward and get out of paying it at that point also so you see what you're looking at here is the ability to earn ten times as much income\nEntered it with no taxation\nSo you look at a family and you say where should your money ...\nShould your money be at some place like you know when you go to your financial plan as if we can draw down four percent a year and we won't run your money out until you're eight years old nine years old me they're really only earning two percent a year and then they're drawing down on the principal and the other two percent\nBut what did you could earn ten percent now I'm not even throwing in there all the other ways ... income for example when we buy properties many times we buy them in a distressed situation and we go in and we fix them up and we have immediate income from that we call that force\nAppreciation\nForced appreciation is massive if it's wrapped around the rule the ten twenty five one hundred rule a ten percent increase in income because of the improvement of the property creates a twenty five percent increase in value since we only have twenty five percent down payment\nOr act when he's only twenty five percent that twenty five percent increase in value means we have a hundred percent\nGain on our investment a hundred percent gain on your investment can you imagine if you can increase your income or your investment network by a hundred percent a year oh\nCan you imagine if you could increase your income or your investment network by a hundred percent a year oh\nThat's unbelievable\nWe also have that thing we're thing called appreciation you know rich just keep going up values just keep going up we're getting all that well your money's sitting there and it is the inflation is depreciating your money\n\nWe have the tax advantage of depreciation and the other one is when we produce these massive cash or capital gains we can refinance and pull that money on tax free\n\nTax free do understand that so we can pull out hundred two hundred five hundred million dollars that pay no taxes whatsoever\nYou're not doing that\nYou are living in a life of quiet desperation mediocre life and you're living by a set of rules that are going to keep you there\nThe reason you're stuck there\nIs because you are not making yourself out at whatever level you're living at right now whatever it is that you get up today and said I Am me I Am proud to be\nWhat I'm saying is don't be proud to be you be proud to be the man you are becoming\nFire I'm proud to be the man I Am becoming five happy with what I've done so far from satisfied\nBut I've not done we'll take a short break be right back with the Des Walsh\n[noise] do you do\nYou're listening to the Joe ... radio you know we'll be back with more like injury principles to justify\nYou know

shopping this was in your favorite the mortgage reports that income so can you save the most thorough\nAccording to analysis from lending tree I used to work their Cincinnati and Houston homebuyers the the biggest savings for mortgage rate shopping in Cincinnati reads very sixty four basis points with a potential savings of sixty seven dollars a month\nSeven hundred and Ninety eight per year in twenty four thousand over the life alone now one of the markets we advertise and that I like a lot\nIn Houston the spread is sixty one points with potential lifetime savings of over thirty one thousand other cities with large spreads between the highest and Lois race included a San Antonio Dallas\nPhoenix Chicago Philadelphia Pittsburgh Boston and San Diego so in terms of lifetime savings California borrowers stand to save the most in San Francisco alone potential\nLifetime savings or just under a hundred thousand dollars by shopping your mortgage that's it don't risk leaving money on the table shop around and compare mortgage rate offers today with network capital and they want and value your business I feel they have the best package deal in the markets when you take him costs\nTurnaround times interest rate accuracy of the information\nProtection of your information I feel like by far there and you know leaps and bounds ahead of the competition so called this number and once you guys to see how much you can save\nYou might be shocked to find out how much are over paint on your entire situation they are lifestyle brand they care about credit they really want to wipe the slate clean levy was one low fixed rate on your entire situation not just the house everyone goes for the easy route trees and this is\nHow can I just make it really fast and easy on the customer they usually just do a simple re drop on the house but then they leave him with these ridiculous credit cards and high car notes and personal loans and damaged credit and they don't teach them what to do with the month off the mortgage and ... that can be funneled into something positive for the customer\nEvery dollar matters in my opinion on these situations because we want to reinvent their entire life we want to make sure that they're in the best known now when you become so you know call this number see exactly how much you can save the average\nMortgage radio listeners say five hundred and twenty dollars per month when they picked up the phone and dial this number ... earphones ready six\nThousand three hundred thirty six year and all you have to do is make contact here's the number eight hundred seven hundred eight zero six eight eight hundred seven hundred eight zero six eight\nAnd Sean just mentioned the average monthly savings for folks who called network capital at that number five hundred and twenty eight dollars a month network capital use some sophisticated software they ran the numbers they want to\nKnow just how much they were helping people and it turns out five hundred and twenty eight\nDollars a month six thousand three hundred and thirty six dollars\nA year for ... for folks who called December but that's the important part that's the part they can't do for you so I'm gonna ask you to take down this number wherever you may be maybe you don't need to do or ... maybe you have a friend and I should also mention that\nUh they do specialize in the ... if you know somebody who would qualify and take this number down eight hundred seven hundred eight zero six eight of course John been talking about\nThe ten year but they do Fifteen twenty and of course Thirty years and that five hundred and twenty eight dollar monthly savings\nPush on been talking about the ten year but they do Fifteen twenty and of course Thirty years and that five hundred and twenty eight dollar monthly savings is on folks who went from a thirty or fix to thirty or fix cashed to cash out on their primary residence so let's talk about\nA term sell some people um you know they have no interest in shortening the term of their loan it seems too aggressive and some people are really like the thought of saving you know if you do feel from uh thirty two Fifteen year\nYou're saving sixty five percent off the cost of your house who who should be thinking about going into a shorter term oh I\nSee a lot of attention I Know like you're never supposed to discriminate on a lot of different things like in this business for you so you have to be fair to every different style of life but one thing I pay attention to you know whether it's wrong or right I look at the age like I really mean it means a lot to me like when do you want to retire like how\nLong do you really believe in your heart that you honestly going to stay in this property those things matter because you want to make it like a made to measure mortgages\nCustom fit in I like my suits made to measure from the ground up a brown every inch of me to make sure it's it's like you know that they always say like you're swimming and your dad do 'cause it's all big you know I feel like that's just your general mortgage out there it might help you in some aspects of life but it's not\nThe perfect lawn for you so what I Believe in is making it from the ground up around your income your credit Iraq what are your goals which are looking to do how long you want to be in the home thinking big picture like we ask questions like what's up with like your appliances is there any big cash purchases you know you need to eventually make that it'd be smarter to pull the cash now while you're in the lower rate era\nCompared to where the market's moving we even talk about school like how the age of the kids\nThese things matter now when it comes to the shorter term person I was ... when I bought one property there in West Virginia I was like thirty one years old and I was thinking I don't want to be pain on this thing for the rest of my life so my goal is to do a Fifteen year fix and have it paid off and five so you know everyone has a different idea to me I like to read break\nThe raid difference between thirty and Fifteen year and those times was over ... percent and a half\nSo to me I'm like wait a second I could easily sling a slightly higher payment compared to what thirty year and I get the tremor hundred and eighty payments I get to see more noticeable results I get to increase my credit scores I'm In control and not letting the banks stretches out and milk me for every dime of interest\nI like building a security nest egg of equity for a rainy day\nAnd the other day when you get that mortgage bill and you see the principal reduction\nIt's going to put a smile on your face you feel like your money's going to something of value\nAnd that value as owning more that portion of your own that's called home equity there's a reason they call it a home owner Tony home or so you know start with a call and look at shorter term I Will not tell you guys that every single call go shorter term because not everyone's situation is is to have this thing paid off\nSome people need the lowest possible payment\nSome people need to stretch this thing out some people need to get out of jail free card and here's your opportunity\nThis week the special deal is a ten year fix more and more callers are asking about the ten to Fifteen I like to tell you that they start with a tan and usually say yes and the Fifteen or the other side\nThey start with a twenty and say yes to the thirty 'cause they're really similar ten and Fifteen are quite similar twenty
