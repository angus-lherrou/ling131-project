C. unless the Democrats win the house in the Senate ah\nI'd love for you to react to that 'cause I found that to be quite extraordinary for her to say\nWell I think it's a delusional what she said she not watch\nAs Ted Cruz and his wife are huh that at a restaurant or Sarah Sanders or as a leader of their party Maxine Waters encourages people to create crowd around Republicans and let them know you're not wanted here I mean the Democrats tests\nOr as a leader of their party Maxine Waters encourages people to create crowd around Republicans and let them know you're not wanted here I mean the Democrats have created the most divisive\nA frightening political atmosphere that I have ever seen and you don't see that happening to Democrats you don't see my going around Democrat leader that's not how we have civility in our politics and Hillary Clinton has contributed to that\nUh and what I Would say to people is if you want bipartisanship if you want to see a better functioning Washington Denver jak the resist and obstruct a dysfunction play buck that's Democrats will have to rethink how they do business and come to Washington that actually work with this president\nThat is a great point if these tactics actually uh bring them a majority in the house this November they're just going to double down and do more of it it's going to teach them the exact wrong Muslim is great but we're speaking with children run around him again to what the RMC [noise] you know talk to me about your experience with regard to these house races in particular because\nI you know I always like to think that somebody votes for the party\nSo that the party can get the majority in the house is that how the votes ... almost like a parliamentarian so vote or or is it always really down to the candidate where it doesn't matter\nI'm just going to vote for this person or that person based on how they're going to perform for my district\n... it depends on the on the on the district and the state and the voter frankly but\nI Will say most of the house races do come down to the to Kennedy and we're seeing the candidates that are running local races that are in their districts campaigning that are really engaging with their communities are doing better and so\nEvery Republican needs to go out and run like it's their first race they need to have that hunger and they have to really connect with the people in their district and the issues that face on and when you run a campaign like that\nYou'll be reelected or a elected to Congress\nTurning locally here I Know that there are a couple of races that I'm hearing a lot of ads for that tells me that they are definitely up for grabs and money is being spent I'm Talking about\nA representative Barbara Comstock we just had her on the program yesterday in Virginia and then rub Whitman are also in Virginia Dave Brat in Virginia they're really focusing on these Virginia Republicans of what's happening there\nUrging as a battleground state the and the is heavily invested in Virginia though they are going to be tight races uh Dave Brat as a tight race again\nYou know one of those uh super stars that the Democrats talent they you know they put her in the race and they say oh she's uh she's going to be great she's going to be moderate she's going to work\nFor the benefit of a her constituents the reality is that everybody the Democrats put forward it's going to focus on the ... the agenda which is raising taxes which I don't think people in Virginia why\nThey are actually going to raise taxes below the has said that and abolish ice\nUp and then dysfunction and more obstruction of Washington ... ... that's got a race that Hitler's looking good but we need to hold these dates and Virginia and the results that are happening for this country a result that the people at Virginia Commonwealth at Virginia definitely should appreciate\nAll right I Know you've got to do a we'll check in with you again before

at starting a real estate portfolio when you were still really young and right now\nA realtor in his early thirties who's been buying investment properties for nearly a decade since experience grows and using that to help his clients both young and old become successful investors themselves\nJoining us now is Philip Becker realtor and founder of Becker properties in San Antonio Texas in two thousand fourteen fella perceived the prestigious dirty under thirty award from NPR and among his investment properties is one in the U.S Virgin Islands [laughter] Phillip welcome to real estate today\nTraveling Steven it's great to be here\nWe're delighted your ear and by the way good choice on where to locate your investment property [laughter]\nIt's not not a bad place to be beautiful son and Sandy beaches\nExcellent so Philip how old were you when you started investing in real estate\nWell and I bought my first investment property Steven I was twenty four years old wow it was a piece of land outside of San Antonio Texas what I did is I bought the land built a house on it and turned and sold the house and made about eighty thousand dollars profit\nFrom a viewer also help your clients invest in real estate does your personal experience really help\nYeah absolutely especially with novice investors are people that do a lot of people think you have to be cash heavy to get into the investment game and you know when I first started\nI wasn't made my first investment was an owner finance deal when I bought that land with just ... percent down and so I helped a lot of investors especially being younger myself I'm thirty two now but I was twenty three when I got\nInto real estate in two thousand nine\nAnd a lot of younger people that are able to help with investments and it's great to show them how you know things like solar financing and even used responsibly financial products such as hard money loans can really help younger people build their portfolio\nI see no one at twenty or thirty something comes to you and says they want to invest the may have no idea how to do it how you help them\nI think just with every other Clyde it starts with you know a buyer counseling session\nAnd one of the big things I tell my client is don't be afraid to invest outside your market you know even for people that are just getting started especially if they're a little bit low on cash they might not be able to afford their first investment property and the market where they live and that's why\nI mean being involved with you know the national association and committee such as a young professionals that work has helped me grow realtors that I trust throughout the country so a lot of times we send our new or investment clients to other markets where we have a great referral partner that can help them as well\nSo here's a question of all the young people who you help become real\nThe clients to other markets where we have a great a referral partner that can help them as well\nSo here's a question of all the young people who you help become real estate investors how do they tend to pay for these places and that's\nKind of range across the gamut but it reminds me of one specific young lady that I help she was about twenty four years old when she came to me winds by her first investment property she did not have\nAmazing income but she had a fantastic credit in her case we did do the hard money route we bought the property for about sixty nine thousand dollars all and we were in for a total of eighty seven as she was able to turn that being a for a hundred and twenty seven thousand dollars\nMaking of a doubt a thirty thousand dollar profit after closing costs on her first investment which was for her about an extra year salary at that time\nThat is amazing and Philip you just mentioned getting a hard money loan which is a private individual or a private group who fund the mortgage without the requirements that a major national bank would have to tell us how do you find a hard money alone\nWhile they're there actually are lots of different hard money lenders and for the audience out there that's not the only way\nTo accumulate properties outside of the traditional financing that is also portfolio but as far as the hard money loans it's really just about\nNetworking and finding other people that have done it we started group called the broker underground and the San Antonio area and it's been a great resource for over two thousand fulltime agents and brokers that share referrals such as\nHard money individual so we've got an entire list of different people as well as feedback from agents good or bad on how\nThe experience was for the consumer and for the agent working with that hard money lenders so again I think networking is is so key for trying to find these individuals that become your business partners and I can help your clients\nFill a pet is such great information so let me ask you if someone starts investing in real estate in their twenties what's that going to mean to their life and their financial security in the years ahead\nThere simply ahead of the game you know there's that old Chinese proverb that says the best day to plant a tree was Twenty years ago and the second best day is now\nThe people that are older you know what I mean for the people that are older\nThought too late but does that got started in investing in their twenties there simply ahead of the game and they're going to be able to stop working for money sooner so that their money can start working for them", "show_name": "Mark
