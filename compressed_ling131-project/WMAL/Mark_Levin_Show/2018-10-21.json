much on the air 'cause it's a fantastic book and apparently when when when our D.C was first founded and and we first moved here to the capital they didn't even conceive a separate building for the Supreme Court\nRuled that yeah they they they when they planned out the city they have the capital and they had the White House but the Supreme Court the head of the third branch they they put it in a room upstairs in the Capitol building that's how little they thought of the Supreme Court at the end that it\nWhen you're in court that is the third branch\nRight right that's it I Know that it's very cool and I actually have never towards the Supreme Court still do I'm going to have that Kevin thank you for granted up\nData phenomenal farewell that uh I have never seen anywhere else as a circular
