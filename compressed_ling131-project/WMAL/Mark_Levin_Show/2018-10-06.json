just some of what police have to deal with [noise]\nJust talking about the importance of supporting our bullies because of what goes on out there that's gotten a crab they were dealing with today in the capital as you had the the protesters I mean and again from a political movement standpoint\nWho doesn't want to be part of that is why leave ideology and by the wayside for a moment one of the things I've never been able to get my brain around\nHow especially young people go yeah those people make a lot of sense you know what I should be due I should be part of that now\nLet's be real for a moment ... those folks in D.C are are ... ... they're paid\nThese are folks who don't have lives the rest of us we go to work we have lives and we uh you know we go about our business later the day and go oh okay that's what the losers were up to today yes those are the losers were up to today the losers that go out there and they get paid and in many cases they end up getting paid more\nIf they are willing to get arrested so yes they do they are those people but nevertheless\nJust in terms of winning hearts and minds it's fascinating\nNow us the segments talking about police talking about law enforcement and we've had obviously this immigration debate going on for ever and a seemingly no resolution inside but the other um aspect of\nThat conversation that often is overlooked refugees and I have long had\nMy focus on refugees\nFor a couple of reasons one is principal and the other the implications of refugees\nNow a lot of was made though it wasn't big in the news cycle because obviously we know what the news cycle has been\nBut a lot was made that we ended up having the u._s. refugees in decades at least since Nineteen Seventy five according to the state department oh my gosh we're not importing you know even more people are into the United states and paying for all that to happen\nOr ... according to PBS at the end of August only Nineteen thousand eight hundred and Ninety nine refugees had been brought in over the prior eleven months compared to forty five thousand that weren't dissipated oh my gosh and that was a bad thing rank\nAnd then they went on to talk about how we're only anticipating three thousand being brought in next year oh my gosh that's just terrible now here's one is often not discussed the implications\nBe applications when are we going to be compassionate to Americans before we try to be compassionate to the rest of the world\nHere's the way this works what you're not told\nWe as taxpayers pay to bring the refugees into the United states average costs tend to be around fourteen thousand dollars per refugee and according to the center for Immigration Studies a typical immigrant guess what happens when they get here where they live on government assistance for a minimum of five years\nAnd the average five your cost per refugee sixty four thousand three hundred and Seventy bucks that you're ready\nTo hear how much it costs to relocate a refugee into a safe zone if we get involved\nA thousand fifty seven bucks so we can actually relocate Bronx only sixty four refugees into safe zones without importing them into the United states\nAnd by the way Ninety One percent of refugees we bring into the United states end up on food stamps and sixty eight percent also ended up receiving ongoing welfare other programs made available now how compassionate is that\nToday we found out that we have the lowest unemployment rate in many decades three point seven percent\nHow is it that we made progress with those that have been a long term unemployed does that had the toughest time those that were not as educated that orange skilled how have we made improvement in young unemployment anybody ever think that maybe cracking down on illegal immigration\nAnd not bringing in refugees to compete for entry level work might make a difference\n[noise] something that's never discussed back on June seventh of last year I actually made the case for how it could happen\nAnd we have seen over the past year plus exactly that is it anywhere near the entire reason no but it absolutely is part of the reason people automatically suggests that we have a responsibility and that kind of cost\nTo import people in ... competed against the most vulnerable in our society\nReally cared about the most vulnerable in society [noise]\nYou'd hit men the opportunity for Donald Trump has been doing his policy once again\nIs the most pervasive form of bias in the media\nTo sides to stories one side of the fact I'm

what happened with the bad guy in Illinois convicted today what you don't hear the for cops that have been killed in line of duty over the past week\nAnd their families the widows kids without fathers that's what's real and\nIf not for us and then who's going to be so as a again every cop is a good one but now hundreds of thousands almost all of them are and God Bless them because of now for them where or any of us are any of us\nAnd uh let's say a I Believe we're actually getting in right now on the line that the police officer oh go ahead and go right to you you get to the front of the line because you're another the police officer want to hear from you in\nGo and see how are you tonight hey doing well\nFantastic now I just wanted to comment that I have to agree with all your saying I've been in law enforcement now for six years and it's especially with coming from my department you\nYou just see it face to face 'cause we are in a college town itself so I'm everything that the media puts out towards is you're definitely feeling it especially from the younger generation who only been taught that way and it's like one interaction after another where you're trying to change

become\nYeah no I couldn't agree more we're talking this even more here on a WMA ill with the C ... a talk about um and I know you're not you know we don't predict the stock market or anything but talk about any concern concerns you might have a over\nA interest rates and uh how would the yields are are ah yeah you know had been rising on the Treasury's\nWell this is you know first of all when you get an economic boom [laughter]\nEven let's face it we're liberals can't turn to distinguish between an economic recovery which we have under Obama and economic boom which is what we have right now and when you get a boom like fish\nReal interest rates rise it happens every time and in the sixties under sanity it up in the eighties under Reagan and it's happening now and it's it's not a on a on a healthy thing it means more people want to invest so the costs of capital rise a little bit because you've got such a demand on Capitol\nThe problem for though Steve is that we have a twenty trillion dollar national debt and so although that rising interest rates I think the three year treasuries now it's a little over three percent of what I remember was below two percent\nA couple of years ago so bad creeping\nUp of interest rates his job is something that's a little troubling but look I'm I'm not I'm not a I'm not too pessimistic your I actually I'm not going to I think we're gonna see three or four more corners of three to four percent growth five\nTen trending towards the four percent line I think we're going to see continued very high rates of employment you know look everywhere I go skiing I I've been everywhere from Portland, Oregon Portland Maine\nAnd the last few months I mean every city I go to Nashville or Denver or her or even Cleveland or Detroit um San Francisco Los Angeles all you see is\nIn the sky is the cranes of a building\nBuilding apartment buildings building skyscrapers and building factories and building warehouses this is the single biggest construction boom\nUnder Donald Trump in American history is you know that shape the single biggest construction around in the history of this country under Donald Trump think of the construction jobs the construction industry people tell me we got a problem we we don't we don't have the workers to do all the work\nThat is amazing ... let me ask you about the the the NAFTA deal was uh was signed a young lawyer agreed to under the wire would get in Canada and the eleventh hour last week\nUm do you think that this will make it tougher tougher my Brooklyn came out the top a tougher for China in other words\nYou know just reinforces what that Donald Trump style his approach his tactics have worked uh and then you will continue them now with China and what will the eventuality be a with China\nWell first of all this this uh Canada Mexico deal which really didn't get a lot of attention because of course everybody was talking about ... last week but this is a big big big deal\nFor Trump I mean six months ago I was ... there might be a trade war and we're going to have problems with our trade situation I'm In that we weren't you know we were a alienating some of our allies but look at where we are today and and it's a real\nIt's a real tribute to Trump one on the go mastering the ghosts\nAnd we were you know we were a alienating some of our allies but look at where we are today and and it's a real it's a real tribute to Trump but what on the go mastered negotiator this guy as you know a week ago when the stakes steep\nA Trump gives a press conference I watch the whole thing and he was asked about Canada and he saw things are not going well at all with Canada and he said you know where these negotiations have really falling apart and\nRight he toned down the one on one meeting we'll them do\nYou feel them out you know and in terms of we're not just move forward with or without Canada and go what with Mexico\nAnd and things that we might just have to slap and what the twenty five percent auditor but what happened just the love of the clock on Sunday night before the before the deadline\nWhat happens cattle that comes out man makes the deal with Trump it's a it's a big big win for Trump and it's a good one for all three countries for Canada Mexico and the United states so I I think that's one of the reasons that people are feeling optimistic or not you know ... ... and to be optimistic because we're not going to have a trade war\nOr continue to have a free trade written by the way that's a that's a base and that goes back to Ronald Reagan but all of North America should have free trade and and that's a big deal and by the way it puts the pressure on China\nIt it it really strengthens Trump's hand as he negotiates with China you as you know Steve I think China's a bad actor I think we got to get really talked with China and I don't think Trump is going to back down I Try and\nIt's going to be very interesting to see see but it's always great to talk to you my friend thank you very much\nSteve Everytime I don't think the news can get better on the economy\nI mean you mean but getting tired of winning is that\nSomething like

all of his great to have you\nMarry a ... it's great to be here thank you so much for having me\nRight off the bad for a ... as as a lawyer as as an attorney yeah what were they would do the highlight the highlights and the low points of yesterday's testimony is between the two\nWell I thought the highlight\nWas Brett Kavanaugh's opening statement which was something I didn't think he was it was capable or at least to act for after watching his interview earlier in the week with a more from a column on Fox I thought he was going to be a little bit to get up\nFor this process and yet he gave a about an hour presentation which was moving combative\nRighteously indignant but all in all I think in in probably a pitch perfect measure but a lot of us wondered if he was if he was really a up for and I think it actually after the\nTestimony of Dr Ford who who by the end of that testimony or seem very earnest and some fear because if we can get into this partially I think because of how poorly or she was questioned in the uh\nSincere because if we can get into the ... partially I think because of how poorly or she was questioned in the uh in the early in the morning session I'm a you know I I thought\nReally that Kavanaugh's nomination was on the brink of of going the wrong way 'cause we're obviously talking about\nAn audience of a ... that really matter is probably four or five Republicans who if they you know who were teetering and if they if they go go the wrong way from the Republican perspective Kevin can't be confirmed so I think his opening statement really saved\nHis nomination and yeah and obviously but you know Lindsey Graham's speech was a barn burner and very moving but I don't think it would have mattered as much if Kavanaugh hadn't been so convincing\nThat writing Brett Kavanaugh really the only person to stick up for himself into Lindsey Graham said something I and I and Andrew McCarthy I'm really interested and you kind of broached in a moment ago in your thoughts on this question how do you think Rachel Mitchell support the Arizona prosecutor I did yesterday I really\nOne of the highest quality people that I've ever met and everybody that knows him says the same thing\nAnd these are oral falls to me these false accusations in certain cases in certain cases even the media agrees with that I can only say\nWhat they've done to this man is incredible\nI that was the president yesterday discussing Brett Kavanaugh and his accusers during his oppressor he also went on to say that this doesn't happen tomorrow will be watching I'm going to see what happens I and and see where we go from here to discuss this with a gym Gary senior political correspondent of the national review Jim\nMorning look back to mornings on ...\nVince Mary thanks very much for having to guys had said the president did say that he wanted to see what happens tomorrow he was asked why it's it's nice to be the\n... or liars and the president had a little bit and I think he had to had a little bit because of the the the me too atmosphere in which we we currently live how did when when he came to that hedging is the president's maybe wavering in his support for Brett Kavanaugh did that come through yesterday\nI don't think that's necessarily the case but last week I had a chance to speak to a couple of Republican senators including a folks on the committee\nAnd they all have this attitude is what we visit back when it was what they were regularly scheduled to be on Monday a while waiting to see what happens on Monday it was kind of a wait and see attitude because they they want to leave that opening for\nMaybe a new sport really would come across as extraordinarily compelling and truthful and and offered account but had a lot of detail and matched up with the available evidence\nOr ... or whoever it is already seen Brett Kavanaugh testify but there was always a slim possibility that maybe his explanation or his account a wouldn't seem plausible or something like that now says that we've seen capital not just as hearing but in the interview with Fox News and I think most folks would say that he's\nJust he's been very consistent you always always said this is this is nonsense none of this ever happened I have no idea what this woman is talking about\nToday will be really something maybe the first time we've been talking about is for for about two weeks now a this'll be the first time we will hear her voice will be the first time we will see beyond the one or two photos have been floating around I'm On the Internet and I think you know this is a great deal of the Anita Hill Clarence Thomas hearings that sense of\nSeeing these people listening to their accounts and very much like you know the public being a jury or you know decide who who's account they find more credible\nDo you think that the increasingly disgusting allegations that have come out about Brett Kavanaugh but of course in the past week and increasingly hard to believe by the way I'll just say uh from from the New Yorker article to Julie sweat Nick in the last twenty four hours from me and my ... has that all\nImproved Brett Kavanaugh's hand here in terms of his ... his credibility or make things harder for him\nAbout a week or two ago when a attorney Michael happened daddy at first come forward with his you know carnival Barker acts I said that that was sort of a better turns of fate [noise]\nUh for judge having all of this process that having that he came across as\nExactly the person you would not be the person to turn this into a circus\nAh goes on out you know when you say to people ah yeah there was a ... party teenagers and drinking you know a lot of people would say okay I could see something\nBad happening in that sort of equation when you say freshman year a party drinking game somebody does something obnoxious and ah and crude and ah you know a lot of people say okay I could see that happening even if it happened to this particular specific set of circumstances\nThat description by adding that his client or that there were these ongoing weekly events which assault was occurring on a massive scale with\nLots of guys involved lining up to partake in it a queen Luther being used to uh to drug people and this was going on according to her account once a week for about a three year period during\nAnd it's a quaint Luther being used to uh to drug people and this was going on according to her account once a week for about a three year period during the school year\nUm that she by the way to apparently without a college age attending a high school a age party all around Georgetown that'd be great or DC area\nI'm and I'm sure a good portion of your listeners were alive during that time period the idea that no one ever went to the cops the idea that no one ever went to a parent the idea that no one ever went to a teacher and the other responsible adult\nAnd the idea that according to her account there would be dozens of victims and dozens of witnesses [noise] I mean this this is bigger than you know pick your comparison of a busy of grand criminal enterprise you know it sounds like something out of eyes wide shut or something like that and it's all being organized by than Fifteen year old Brett Kavanaugh really okay\nWell along those lines she was an adult at the time and she witnessed underage drinking she ... she alleged she witnessed a drug and she she alleged she witnessed basically a rape ring a in it says she ... she criminally liable he or she did nothing and she was she was an adult I Know that that's a better\nQuestion for a prosecutor for myself\nI was just it was just curious you know and and you also bringing in the fact that she knew she alleges she knew that they were they were drug in putting drugs in in in the drinks\nYet she didn't drink the the the pine sure she drank what she knew supposedly had drugs in claims that she was um yeah\nShe was a big them fell victim to this\nI Want to ask you a question about two men now who said he came forward and we now here of two men who have come forward who say that that day it may have been them that they think that uh Christine Blasey Ford um that that she is mistaking identity said it might have been done we know that one of them has been interviewed twice\nBy did you did she do this year he can many Republicans can you tell us any more about this one gentleman who has been interviewed twice you know any more\nOh no I've I've only what I what came out yesterday I Do think what you see today though up side by by the way all these long people said oh I don't think she's going to show up to testify at least as of this moment a Thirteen in the morning on Thursday morning at a pure she will there your individual pretend I Am\nUm I don't know if anybody for any money down on that but you know I think there are a lot of people who are skeptical is going to come out to that she's going to claim that she is certainly it was capital I'm but we're going to be saying you know her memory from thirty five to thirty six years ago or was she was a teenager she set by her account she'd had a beer at that point um that her memory is correct\nAll the four people she named at the party Kavanaugh mark judge Peter Smith legally Kaiser uh all of them say they have no memory of attending that party and now we have not one but two mad to come forward and say I think she's thinking of me I'm One of my colleagues are jokes that just began with Cory Booker claiming I Am Spartacus\nAnd now we have this weird twisted have sparked get small but there were multiple geyser coming forward and say oh no it wasn't Kavanaugh was me I'm no look if for memory if I go with ... razor here what explanation seems simplest\nBut this is a vast conspiracy to discredit her uh that are designed to cover up the the evidence that everyone's including friends of hers are saying oh no I you know nothing happened we were never there or that she simply missed remembering which guy it was um one explanation does seem a lot simpler than the other one doesn't it\nYeah absolutely it's going to be so interesting I think\nEveryone is going to be a listening to the radio which by the way we will carry this ... this today on WBAL and the website if people are interested in listening to this if you

far he's also the former deputy assistant to the president's Dr ... the warning welcome back to mornings on them all great to have you good morning America comes up two weeks today\nAh two weeks [noise] today fantastic well we'll be talking about that I'm sure the president heads to the un today to the general is\nI can weeks today than deck\nWell we'll be talking about that I'm sure the president heads a kitty un today to the general assembly he's going to be giving a speech to the general assembling what to expect him to say what's going to be the theme\nWell I think it's very clear that it's going to be a reprise of his last address and that kind of\nYou know question a rhetorical question off look what happens when American leadership is re associate I just just go back a few months and let's remind ourselves how everybody was talking about how we're going to get into war with North Korea\nWhat what's the situation today does anybody even talk like that as anybody taken seriously so it's it's really going to be a lot of my told you so but no this is the state of play when American interests are prioritized over some kind of\nMultilateral globalism added does good things for everybody so it's it's the translation of the ... agenda the make America great again agenda on to the global stage\nNow how receptive will the audience does now that he's ... he's the second year of his presidency second time addressing the United nations he's expressed before then against people like NATO secretary general some burned cars are very happy with his influence in the world community that's not a ubiquitous assessment or will he find a receptive audience\nIt really depends upon who we're talking about if it's individuals if it's the representatives of countries such as\nItaly Poland Hungary all those people who voted for Brexit in the u._k. then they will fully be on board and they'll understand that yes this is you know the world is a safe place undoubtedly when America is active and when America is engage with America withdrawals as we saw all run to the Obama\nRegime for eight years we had this year the absurdity of the leading from behind which means not leading the official placing within our national security strategy of strategic patience which means we do nothing\nWell then what happens then you have the rise of the China's then you have Russia invading its neighbor then you have Iran becoming one of the most the stabilizing forces in the middle east is long globally\nSo I think the countries that don't live in a fantasy land or don't have some kind of utopian dream of the future which is impossible will receive it warmly those who still think in some kind of global whom by that he has never existed they won't like it then that's less surprised\nI'd Sebastian I ask you about what you think though of the Trump Doctrine you know we've talked about this a couple of times it interesting that you use the phrase is engaging withdrawn because we often talk about Donald Trump in the end of quote isolationist and how he's been ... by his presidency\nHasn't quite been that you know he goes to the foreign policy addresses and he talks about the importance of national sovereignty and how he looks out for the interest of the United states and other countries should do the same thing but what is the Trump Doctrine precisely\nYou just nailed it this is what most people miss during the campaign and even in the first few months of the administration of what ever the platform was whatever the issue was\nWhether it was crushing ISIS whether it was building the wool or whether it was a reframing our trade relations all of the key Trump platforms were United by one philosophical concept and that was national sovereignty\nIs a good thing not a bad thing and that's really the bedrock of the Trump administration's foreign policy doctrine beyond that if you want to get more technical there's an incredible document out that I was in the meetings what it was being written the Penn was held by one of my former colleagues not ...\nGo on line read right now the national security strategy of the United states written by the Trump Administration is the first documents\nA name that truly deserves to be called a national strategy and it is about American leadership is good national sovereignty is a good thing\nA lot of people are watching we're all watching to see the people that foreign leaders who knew president cheeses can meet a lot to be made about him not meeting with Justin Trudeau Canada also there's no meeting with Rouhani the Iranian President either what kind of message are we supposed to get from that\nWell number one a treat your enemies as they should be treated with regards to Iran with regards to Canada or it's very simple if you wish to call yourself a friend and ally\nYou better act like it the idea that the northern neighbor thinks it's okay for example to put a tariff of more than two hundred and fifty percent on us very good\nFriends don't do that to each other sort of quote a ... a famous Marine Corps phrase that I'm sure it was very familiar to Vince but no better friend no worse enemy that the marine corps and really it's a great descriptor of the Trump administration's attitude\nCould just be though that the ...\nAnd no ... that's the marine corps and really it's a great descriptor of the Trump administration's attitude\nCould just be though that the president and Justin Trudeau are in contact all the time anyway so there was no no reason to have that meeting or is this a signal\nA touch of today okay [laughter] I just carrying his little little Justin or less a duck let's talk\nAbout the Iranians though because he the president did announce this morning despite requests I have no plans to meet with Iranian President Hassan Rowhani maybe some day in the future I'm sure he was an absolutely lovely man said the president but additionally the he's expected to make some remarks about\nThe Iranians are in his meetings with European ... European leaders and he's urging these countries to basically follow suit on what companies around the globe and already done and cut off business with the Iranians should the Iranians\nBe nervous or are there enough back doors for them to exist with these punishing us sanctions on them\nKnow the very very already all nervous they rightly should be a ... just it's not of course it's not on the cover of the newspapers of course the of at isn't talking about it because I have a political agenda but look of being credible turn around", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show", "city": "Washington", "day": "06"}
