Portland and New York Hillary Clinton is back in a worse than ever but we begin today\nWith the greatest story of the last several weeks Elizabeth Warren has come forth with her proof or proof that she is indeed Native American Well Elizabeth Warren today decided that she would engage in the most humiliating cell phone I have ever seen in American politics\nI mean this is like ... own of all time but this is a really bad owned goal my goodness so\nWe have to travel back in time what time it was with Lauren claim that she was in fact Native American she said that she had high chair the cheekbones she suggested in a in a recipe book called powwow chow I kid you not that she was a Native American\nAnd the recognition submitted to ... a recipe again I can you not for Krabbe bits\nBecause clearly that was something the Cherokees made back in the day crab bit\nNoted crab herds of the Oklahoma planes that her ancestors used on the board and told the story over and over about her Native American ancestry and what she said was that there are racist members of her family couldn't except for parents romance because\nHer mom was partially Native American here's Elizabeth Warren telling the romantic story\nActually if you haven't wrong about what it is I Believe when we're starting to ask\nMom and dad all were very much in love with each other and they wanted to get married and my father's parents sent absolutely not [laughter] you can't marry her because she's part Cherokee issues for Delaware and\nUm [noise] after finding as long as they couldn't my parents went off they all oh\nOkay so our parents alone because her mom was part Cherokee and Delaware\nWhich means you would think pretty hefty dose of Native American ancestry right there right I mean if her family is worried about it then it sounds like it'd be two significant Native American ancestry\nSo President Trump didn't believe this because it's nonsense that people actually checking her background that down there is no Native American ancestry anywhere in the in the in the time horizon of rationality\nSo President Trump went out on the campaign trail this is back in twenty Seventeen up early and he was holding a rally in Montana and he suggested that you would give her a million dollars and she can prove or Native American ancestry\nAnd we want to say I won't\nDollars for your

is Native American\nCling to our American status and cling to our borders and according to our language we cling to all sorts of terrible thing to remember Brock Obama blamed evil Republican his

was be on it\nThey can't even do that now they just have to lie openly about what President Trump that the evidence and that's over the weekend there were two separate major media story that turned out to be basically falls Saudi number one here is eight and NBC tweet about a rally the President Trump get ugly friday night says what\nPresident Trump says Robert illegal hey great general during Ohio rally calling the Confederate leader incredible now you'd think well that bad stuff you probably shouldn't call it Confederate leader incredible but here is what President Trump actually said about robbery here's a clip of president from talking\nAnd one day it was looking really bad and what did you just said you\nHardly knew his name and they said don't take him he's got a drinking problem [noise]\nAnd like you said I don't get what probably as you guys aren't winning [noise] and his name was grant general [noise]\nAnd when he said [noise] I don't care if he's an alcoholic frankly give me six or seven more just like\nOkay so there is from actually talking about Brett when he was saying that Roberts Lee was a great general who was overcome by grand he was not saying the robber who was a wonderful wonderful person standing firm wonderful thing so NBC has to actually correct in pointing out he says you guys you got this wrong\nThey got this wrong so here's President Trump's tweet NBC News has\nTony and pipe and sneak changed the pilot and many of my story about ... any and gender Ulysses Grant was actually a shout out to worry a grand and the great ... in which he was dying as usual based on his reporting even mainstream media embarrassed and be the head and we'd have a correction it's we had a full correction corruption\nAnd earlier it's we missed identified the general President Trump described as incredible at a rally in Ohio was general Ulysses Grant not General Robert e late and attach video clip whack a mole contact sport from some are there was a full clip\nIt took NBC News to whole days for a tractor and it wasn't the only example of ridiculous media bias in the last forty eight hours\nSo CBS tweeted this out about President Trump on sixty minutes last night President Trump was on sixty minutes here's what things we did they painted President Trump on his print and of course being lazy forward at rally at the accuser of just now justice Brett Kavanaugh it doesn't matter we one makes it sound like the question was\nDo you care the mock Christine Blasey Ford in front of it doesn't matter we won but only one problem that is clearly not what Trump was saying like clearly not what Trump was saying here's President Trump actually talking we need the actual clip of President Trump talking from from the minute\nI here he is in contact that is absolutely no anything\nProfessor of philosophy forging mimic had\nMade a speech we would not have one [laughter]\nI was just saying she didn't seem to know anything [laughter] you know and you're trying to destroy your life of a man who has been extraordinary why didn't you have to make fun\nOf I didn't really make fun of everyone laugh at is the person that we're talking about getting no the here at the time the plays protests are they for God before the Senate and ... and was asked what the worst moment and she said when the two boys laughed at me at my expense [laughter] and then\nI watched you in a car and thousands of people were laughing at her [noise] they can do what they I I Will tell you the way [noise]\nAnd thousands of people were laughing at her they can do what they I I Will tell you the way [noise]\nNow justice Kevin always treated it has become a big factor in the midterms have you seen what's going on with the bulls did you have to\nIs monarchy they chop people's hands up regularly\nThey imprisoned dissident they're not a human rights friendly country mama been so kind was supposed to be a reformer but even as a reformer\nHe's still the dictator of Saudi Arabia this is not a supremely shocking story on any level other than we know the name of the guy who was disappeared as opposed to presumably many other people whose names we don't know who have been disappeared second the Turkish government has a pretty strong interest in trying to humiliate the Saudis because the Turkish government\nHas basically been anti Saudi for years that are in bed with the Iranian government at this point\nAnd to a certain extent in bed with the Syrian Government as well\nAll of that said the Turkish government releasing evidence in an attempt to make it look like they are our friends\nAired on his leader of turkey also an Islamic thug who has imprisoned dissident and killed dissidents too so they're no good guys in this part of the world or at least not in leadership positions in any case\nWe call for the United states to distance itself from the Saudi Arabian government after all that I think is appropriate but I think it's also appropriate to know that the outsized consternation with regard to cars jogging which has ties I don't mean that is inappropriate totally appropriate but when compared to the amount of consternation\nTurkey imprisoning thousands of people and and told a minute ago when president a youth pastor\nOr Syria murdering ... half million people or Ron pursuing terrorism across the region\nIt's it is amazing how the human brain has the capacity to hone in on a single incident an evil in a way that it doesn't on literally hundreds of thousands of incidents\nOf evil but with all that said the United states does have to do something if the Saudi Arabian government is calling descendants back to conflict in the marine them that's not a good that that is that is a bad thing here is president from on sixty minutes talking about it he changed his tune a little bit today\nThey ordering military equipment everybody in the world wanted that order Russia wanted it China wanted if we wanted it if we got it so would you cut that off what what I don't want to do [noise] flowing lucky ratio and all these ... I don't want to\nHurt jobs I don't want to lose in order like there are other ways of a hung on your shoes they use the word is pretty harsh words which is true\nOkay so you know when when he says that he wants to maintain certain economic ties that's not great from right he needs to actually being sorting pressure on the Saudis for harm\nNow he has to do that carefully because he also doesn't want to give a lot of leeway and leverage to the Iranian who are enemies with the Saudi regime and have been fighting a proxy war in Yemen with the ... I think they're again they're no good guys in this particular area of the world but with that said\nYeah the president ought to be signaling some pretty harsh rhetoric with regard to the ... situation is not that one files under bad from today he said that the Saudi Arabian government denies it they say that it's not real so we're just going to ignore it that is not\nGreat stuff from the president okay other stuff that the president said during the sixty minutes interview there is some other bedroom here's President Trump and Kim Jong own uh the the dictator another evil dictator and he has more and more is for him\nAnd I must say I love that guy so [noise]\nThan him so that just like any of your life but you know it's like an ... will let it be under British let it be whatever it is he is a bad guy flipped\nThe whatever it is I get along with them really well I have a ... interview with him I have a good chemistry with him [laughter] look it's a horrible fresh or made\nNo more stretch for me so\nKnow him and talking about him that way is not good either you actually have to demonstrate a strong hand President Trump did that early in his presidency with him but he's not really doing that anymore so there is a lot of good from bad from happening uh with with regard to sixty minutes but that's who the president is and it's important to note that his ups and downs\nAre indicative of the man's mind I mean that's just to President Trump is than just a second I Want to get to the other big story of the weekend which has these violent clashes happening in Portland and

the good from bad from pertain to President Trump has been Trump and bad from\nHillary Clinton just has bad bad Hillary there is no such thing as good Hillary Hillary came out over the weekend and said that Bill Clinton should not have resigned over Monica Lewinsky because he did not abused his power in any way I Do love that she is considered a hero or heroine of the feminist movement pretty spectacular stuff from the left here here as Hillary Clinton\nIn retrospect do you think [noise] ... should have resigned in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky scan absolutely not it wasn't an abuse of power no\nNo there are people who look at\nThe incidents in the nineties and they say a president of the United states cannot have a consensual relationship within ensuring the power imbalance just to water in adult\nBut let me ask you this where's the investigation of the current incumbent against to numerous allegations have been made\nSo good so good so I I Love this Trump should resign because of allegations against him but her husband should resign because of allegations against him also he didn't have used our when he's forty nine year old president to the United states was being service by twenty two year old intern in the oval office\nNot abuse of power and anyway good you know the power imbalance is no longer a concern for feminist on ... very exciting stuff also Hillary came forward and said President Trump is effect is of course the reason that she knows from his insecticides because Trump was mean to her\nIf you watch the way Trump debated me it was just interviews with sex is making fun of me for preparing well you know that's the old like oh yeah the girl in the class who's always prepared I don't need to be prepared\nThat really was how it happened in those debates what\nHappened to the Trump was as much of a jerk or is he has to every other human being on the planet and it didn't play well with her because she's one of the most deeply on likeable human beings on planet earth\nJust what the Democrats have decided to full scale embrace the most radical version of themselves you know they say enacting we have to get in touch with your authenticity Democrats are certainly getting in touch with their authenticity the problem is that deep down democratic leadership not particularly charming\nBernie Sanders is is another example of this so Bernie was on Jake Tapper show on CNN and Jake Tapper asked him about the inflammatory rhetoric on the part of some folks in the Democratic party and Bernie\nFollower of who's shot up a bunch of Congress people last year came out and said that it's not that bad if people get mobbed in public places like this amazing the brain doesn't feel any necessity to say anything here about the sort of action\nYou know I listen again I don't blame Bernie Sanders for that incident last year because unless you are openly calling for violence I don't blame you for somebody going and doing violence but\nWhen Bernie Sanders refuses to condemn mopping in public spaces you certainly is not making the country a better place\nWell I'm I Am very strongly in favor of mobilizing the American people\nTo stand up and fight for economic justice and social justice and racial and environmental justice but I think we have to mobilize people I Am not a great fan of being rude or disrupt doing activities but this is what I Will say\nThis entire year two thousand election campaign is going to come down to two words and that is voter turnout\nSo ... he's not a big fan of people getting on but if people get rid of that sort of the way that it is and voter turnout and don't want to dance and enthusiasm it just shows have Democrats are willing to flirt\nWith my politics they've been talking about for the last several months really since Maxine Waters broke out into the open with it and they're willing to do so on a on a regular basis or even willing to validate mob violence on a regular basis\nOver the weekend the Washington Times reported that Portland mayor Ted Wheeler came under fire over a viral video showing antifa protesters blocking traffic and harassing drivers but he says he supports the decision by police to watch from a distance without getting involved\nBecause I was appalled by what I saw in the video but I support the Portland police bureau decision not to intervene the whole incident will be investigated the video was posted by journalists and you know go and it showed protesters including members of antifa and black lives matter locking an intersection and attempting to direct traffic well officers on motorcycle watch from a block away at one point\nThe activists chase down Seventy four year old cat Hauser F remain a right turn against their wishes pounding on his silver lessons and breaking a window the cars insane thousands of dollars in damage he told the Oregonian but Mr wheeler insists the motorists should feel completely safe coming into downtown Portland\nOh the cars and downs of dollars in damage he told the Oregonian but Mr wheeler insists the motorist can feel completely safe coming in downtown Portland or all of this this lack of a law enforcement that lack of crackdowns on antifa it leads to\nGreater heightened violence when other people who are ready for violent show up in places where he is now here than my recommendation for very long time I speak at a lot of public events where protesters show up and some of those protesters\nStations federal issue\nAnd ... and then he should investigate every one of these incident and the people who instigate violence and go to jail if the city was doing that in the first place and brawls would not be breaking out we have seen them now in New York City is it all ugly stuff\nYes you're ready to defend yourself don't go to events those boiling for being there in coordination with the police if you're on the side of law enforcement you're doing something right and if the less refuses to allow law enforcement do its job this sort of stuff is going to become more and more prevalent and it's horrible for the country truly truly awful for the country\nWell we'll be back here tomorrow with all the latest updates including perhaps maybe will track down Elizabeth Warren's actual native\nAmerican ancestors who may or may not be a character from his name of that and the hair of\nEleven would which do you uh Mayo Washington shot one thousand dollars a\nDay I Am A L K\nMicrosoft come down I mean can't\nCNN is reporting that Saudi Arabia will acknowledge that missing

I mean it's only one poll but it's a solid one\nUm the Democrats have a generic lead of almost ten of that poll but I'm sixty six swing districts twenty four which went for Hillary Clinton twenty sixteen the Republicans are hit\nBy one point the Republicans no other polls don't quite show that but they show the\nSwing districts are much closer because Democrats are going to waste a lot of their enthusiastic votes in district they were going to win anyway so I think\nIn CBS back the CBS background poll also believes that if the election were held with normal turnout today they will be a two hundred making two hundred and Seventeen split not clear which party whatever majority I think we're getting too much closer house\nUm result than people anticipate because the battleground districts are not the country\nThat if you have institutional memory because you wrote through the tidal wave for the blue in two thousand and six and you also saw what a block Obama as a candidate he did in two thousand and eight how do you read how do you interpret this way it's one poll I understand that it's moving\nA block Obama as a candidate didn't two thousand and eight how do you read how do you interpret this waste one poll I understand that it's moving story but how do you interpret this this unusual fact that the battleground districts the Republicans do well in\nMuch better now than it was back in those six and always as Mr funds and tell you and I made it exceedingly difficult for the Republican majority in two thousand six for Republicans in general in two thousand eight because we've already lost the majority in\nIn the prior election uh my question for Mr fund is you're talking about the house one about the Senate [noise]\nOf the Senate is very interesting because there's poll movement in places you didn't expect\nA there's a new poll out a conducted by a democratic for that shows the Minnesota special election for the Senate can be competitive in clear single digits New Jersey there's a very hard hitting ad out attacking so determined end as the Democratic incumbent for\nSex with teenage prostitutes quoting FBI reports from the Obama Justice department um I think that the Democrats are now defending more seats than they expected and if I had if the election were held today I think Republicans would gain Senate seats\nAnd gain that clear advantage it can vary more judges including a possible mothers Supreme Court appointment next year\nMystified and the Democrats were doing very well talking about health care health care health care I saw that on ads for the last two weeks and yet these other issues have come up a it's a puzzle to me\nIs is a lack of discipline or is this because in two thousand and six to Democrats in the house had the leadership of Nancy Pelosi and as far as I can tell she's completely disappeared I Can't find her\nWhat remember about forty democratic challengers have said they're not going to vote for Nancy Pelosi should they get elected\nSo the last thing that she wants to do is remind voters that um she's there it is trying to become the next democratic speaker even though many members of her party clearly recognize uses liability on the campaign trail\nSaturdays made me realize that as you well know John but when they get there and they started getting shall we say acclimated to their ... those votes can change can't the\n... yes but what if you have only two hundred and twenty Democrats or two hundred Nineteen or two hundred and Twenty one you know Thaddeus it has been since Nineteen fifty two that we had the congressional majority that was less than five seats\nAre from two hundred and Eighteen we've never before in our living memory had an extremely close house where every member counts because the speaker has to be elected with two hundred and Eighteen the majority of the entire house\nI watch Tony clips from CBS the sixty minutes interview between the president and the correspondent but I was struck by one thing John and I'm puzzled whether this is too late or too little\nThe president is acting very presidential these days he's quite he's quite clear about its accomplishments he's expansive about the policies that they've initiated there's nothing hesitant about 'em at all is that is that showing in the polls job [noise] well actually\nLeslie stall who conducted the interview set I interview the president three times as candidate is president elect and that was president the the change in his level of self confidence and assertiveness as dramatic a she says he's he he seems to have grown into the job and he was the country may not be comfortable with him and the job but he's comfortable and if\nI didn't see a president shooting from the hip I saw a man who who was prepared for the issues you know how he makes a little pyramid out of his fingers you and he's confident that's the man I saw in that to end that interview\nHe's on this message discipline I think through the election if it stays that will only help his party that is\nJust got a counselor Mr fund that's the greatest thing I've heard tonight the country may not be comfortable with him as comfortable and the job [laughter]\nWhat what do you do you think that this will translate in the next couple of weeks the the messaging the tight messaging of the president and more parents whose because he's not going to stop campaigning for the rest of the Republicans [noise]\nNo but I think that the Democrats submitted enough mistakes he's just going to remind voters over and over again that even though they may have difficulty with him look at the other guys\nAnd by the way given you know Elizabeth Warren and given Hillary Clinton them given ... Kavanaugh given Michael have an id you know the other team doesn't exactly look like professional paragon of governing virtue\nI Know John if if I was struggling with comparable actors on the Republican side I think I'd change the subject my goodness what a mo law especially mentioning Ava ... who's now a who's now a\nCurse if he raise money for you everywhere he goes good heavens Johnson he's in Budapest, Hungary\nThe Democrat political science says gain a house that's going to happen or is it\nThat is McCotter W. J. all the great voice of the great lakes I'm ...\nThe Democrats political science says gain the house that's going to happen or is it\nThat is McCotter W. J. are the great voice of the great lakes I'm John bachelor [noise]\nWildlife point nine at them [noise]\nIn favor for yeah doing but but the\nPoint is that he's being rewarded for an injustice that he is that they had imposed on pastor Brunson and the administration has made clear that the accusations consumer baseless I don't know anybody who has said that I mean he he admitted what he did which was to preach religion and and but never did anything\nCurrently persecuted Braun they persecuted Brunson and they doubted let's put this way they were ... and ... and ... do not see the same book the same way let's put it that way our idols and let All right I'll let me let me throw another one down near Iraq\nLast time I checked a I Ankara and Tehran and Moscow we're having a meeting about defeating oil things and that seems to be relevant here how they doing Malcolm\nWhile it is ... all these things are open and what's most important John is that everything is interrelated you cannot separate anymore any one of these\nIssues what we see Iran and Russia now reaching a deal to circumvent us sanctions according to a number of reports that they'll supply crude oil Iran to to Russia's who the Caspian and then it would be exported worldwide\nWe've seen reports that I'm Indian vessels were taking on Iranian oil then going to to ... to um Kuwait filling up and then selling it as if it is a it is Kuwaiti oil and the agreement with the Russians were supposedly reach last month\nWhen put president a potent and Iranian President Rowhani met in Tehran\nAnd the the the other sanctions the other um\nAt this exposure about the efforts by Iran to ah to impose sanctions to to avoid the sanctions in the administration warns the world's banks\nThat they may try to use these too close to this means to minimize the sanctions impacting continue to fund terrorism and there's\nScience that the the flow of oil seems to be according to new data from September that the oil industry is still quite robust and and it means that they are using a subterfuge and and other means like the example of India um\nTo uh to bypass or to cover their uh their exports so sanctions banning transactions with the Iran central bank the ship and comes to oil companies are all scheduled to take effect on November fifth\nSo it could be that they're trying to rush to these things these as much as they can export now but it is certainly indicative of the weakness of the Iranian economy we know the teachers went on strike today we know that the price of milk has has gone up sharply and other goods that cannot tomato paste\nSold for sixty thousand ... in March is now a hundred and eighty thousand ... and the reality self that currency as a has fallen so dramatically I think it's a hundred and forty six thousand to the dollar now\nAnd the projection is that the Iranian economy will shrink by one point five percent or this year and maybe almost four percent in twenty Nineteen\nSo Iran is under a lot of pressure that the sanctions will work the new sanctions could be very significant and the U.S has to find ways to close these loopholes\nThat in American looking you guys are ... recent reports show the Gazans believe the PTA is a bigger problem than from us\nIt's exactly right I think Palestinians over all a blamed the PA by a bigger percentage than than the blame the um ah the Hamas for for\nWhat is happening in it and and it's reflected his lack of confidence and it shows that an election or change is not going to bring about any ah any dramatic or a difference\nSo we were seeing the uh the the numbers that that came out that the more than ... almost fifty percent almost half\nA do not trust the PA they don't trust come us necessarily but they certainly don't trust the Palestinian authority and this is a you know a very significant figure when you're looking at what are the prospects\nFor a changing things in in the um [noise] um and the guy in Gaza for instance because it forty three percent of Palestinians say the ... are responsible for the bad situation and only a quarter blames a Hamas\nAnd that and that's why they don't want to demonstrate against Hamas 'cause they don't like the alternative and they don't want to ... to take over and and especially don't like it measures against its own citizens\nThey don't like the alternative and they don't want the ... to take over and and especially don't like its measures against its own citizens the fact that was another study that's coming out that shows a tremendous number of arrests by the\nPalestinian Authority figures against those who oppose it in the west bank so they they seem to accept Hamas control of Gaza\nIn Europe outcome I have learned because you've talked me\nThe Europeans have a profoundly different understanding of anti Semitism than we do here in the United states I don't know where it started but I Do know it's here today\nAnd Israel has always struggled against that anti Semitic tone in all of the major France Germany Great Britain\nOr Italy we struggled with it by you indicate there is there a change is there an enlightenment in Europe are they pulling back from their exploitation of uh the the tragedy of the twentieth century\n[noise] uh it's it's a good question but I I think it goes too far to think that the the tail pulled back what we're seeing according to this latest survey that the Israeli foreign minister\nDid in in major European countries show a clear rise in support and this is the first time in memory for me that\nUm there's been a turnaround in in Germany in Spain and Portugal in Romania\nWhere more maybe the support for Israel grew to fifty six percent in Portugal or it went to the forty eight percent and and uh versus thirty percent were not supportive in Spain it was forty percent in Britain it went up the eight points to forty percent\nAnd this you know in the court urban area or a red and everything else and with all the negative media and and measures that were adopted into campaigns\nIn Europe against Israel to see this turnaround I think it's it's really remarkable and it will tell you some it is not something I Would have anticipated\nOr the fact that in all these major ... countries in Europe or sympathy for Israel is increasing maybe it's a greater understanding of the um of Israel's unique position maybe it's because today the middle east includes said that they see what's going on in Syria they see what's going on in these other countries that have come\nTo realize that you have one source of stability and um you will have to see whether this is borne out over time but it's certainly a a surprising developed\nWe have a minute ... yes but let's remember that the people here are different than the elite that would be ... to govern one correct\nThat is true in the countries like Britain and France which starts top down France tendency is to be bottom up but I think you're quite right that that that is a distinction and and still the numbers are not as positive as they should be\nAnd we see the campaigns continuing but this split the left right split that is exacerbating things may also tend to benefit the understanding of Israel\nJeremy Corbyn notwithstanding correct about that would be a tragedy\nVery much a tragedy and and the very fact that that he continues and the and the current path in Britain is very disturbing may be part of this is a reaction to that\nYes our cousin in London you're aware of the fact that Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister would\nBe a disruption

couldn't be taken from it\nYou give us freedoms that we take so much for granted we don't understand what\nWhere they come from or we don't worry about the fact that they couldn't be taken from us now there is a word rights that is very attractive the French Revolution used the rights of man Tom tom Paine used it in his in his what you'd have to say very long pamphlet about the rights so\n... and Peter why did Edmund Burke the uh the parliamentary in addressing parliament don't do this to the American revolution and don't mistake the American revolution for the French Revolution what did he make all these claims have rights in the French Revolution and elsewhere Peter\nUh he was appalled by their claims the price but this\nIs funding needs to be emphasized not because he was opposed to the what he called the real rights have been because he was opposed to the fake ones what were the fake ones\nFor odd abstract claim\nUntethered to any historical experience with supposedly gave individuals' authority to protest\nTo overturn any institution that this please them [noise]\nTo this Burke objective profoundly but he said the ... of the real rights of man I'm friendly the real rights of men are the ones that become they get re frack that he writes who've been dense medium of politics\nThat are rooted in experience that are interpret that had been in this case interpreted by the British common law courts for centuries and provide the guidance\nFor a living within political side in a way that protects\nAll the more or less all the um [noise] uh all the good and the private sphere the John Locke would like to see protected but Burke is a Paul again appalled by the notion of rights that turns them into revolutionary cut deals\nFor um destroying all of inherited political society\nSplits connected to the twenty first century now Peter\nBecause you also have a recommendation of what needs to be done our college campuses are political parties and the television presentation of a most recent very unhappy advise and consent in the U.S Senate Judiciary panel\nHave descended into these abstract false claims of rights that are pending as to and\nWe have people telling us what we cannot say we have\nPeople chastising as for who we are for well how were born\nWe have people right now so fearful that they whisper as if there were being overheard in our politicians\nAre I'd have to say at this point acting other pursued or under under assault there it's a simple Washington's under siege what can be done how do we how do we re start liberalism and at least in the conversation for the young people Peter\nWell the answer is no way a simple\nBut it all from Haines a formidable challenge all the conduct that you've been describing John ah it flows almost directly on the kinds of at at the kind of education that uh we have been delivering tourists students for more than two generations now\nIt's an education that trip from the curriculum including the curriculum of higher education any serious study of the American political tradition [noise]\nAny serious study of the principles of free speech and limited government\nAny serious study of due process and and religious liberty it's an education to treat the American tradition as an almost I'm On the scene saga of discrimination against people on the basis of race or sex or class\nAt it in other words it's an almost and he's in [noise]\nIt's it it's a false suffocation in that it takes ugly aspects that indeed are part of our tradition and presented as the whole truth\nAnd it excludes the glories the achievements of the modern tradition of freedom so that's a long winded answer the short at ... ... ah the short answer is that we must undertake a dramatic reform of our educational system so that once again\nWill produce students who leave our schools informed about the American political tradition its strengths and weaknesses it's cost\nAnd benefits are and who understand the blessings they can say well received by maintaining a the institutions of a free society\nAnd embrace liberal is not serious version called liberals but liberalism the idea that you don't you don't retain you don't\nYou don't protect your freedoms by by chastising others about their about their speech or their conduct that is not freedom that the French Revolution\nSo as you know from a from your current study of Benjamin Franklin in ...\nDoes not freedom but that the French Revolution\nAnd as you know from from your study of Benjamin Franklin in his autobiography Franklin life that I think it is Thirteen virtues of character\nPeter Berkowitz the Hoover Institution for the Manhattan Institute Peter will be at the end of continental hotel the end of the month October

I haven't seen anybody ... able to come up with a study that would demonstrate that\nWell they purport to do so the number the size of the game that they claim which is roughly twenty six percent of the economy piece opposes that women all of a sudden or identical to men in their productivity stability in the school but\nThen there was nothing to show that the current pool of women\nIf in fact put into these positions would be able to create that sort of game\nUm and in fact nobody believes it's possible if you make a major reform in various areas of wall and you could cope say one tenth of a point GDP gain out of it you're doing well and if you get three or four or five of them together and you could sort of get a half a\nTrillion dollars in that Israel money other thought that somehow or other by changing the rules on employment or that you can get a twenty six percent improvements means that you think every business just colossally stupid in a way in which is organized itself bypassing up this pool of talent to start looking at many firms and medicine on Wall\nWhat you've seen is that the entry level the number of women in the number of men are roughly imperative\nAnd as one of my female friends was a very accomplished surgeon told me she says when you reach her lead on all of a sudden it's very different she says instead of being roughly the same number of us women as men I'm now it turns out if she goes into a room with forty people therefore women than thirty six men what happens is many of the women\nOpt for family and change their career paths in order to make the laws more sensible same thing happens in ... to go to the major firms and you start with an entry class of about fifty fifty the partnership stuff depending on the farm and the specialties or the man's\nMaybe eighty five Fifteen if you start looking at women in universities where the hours a more regular and consistent with family life they will be older representative relatives demand\nEssentially the basic inside is if you don't see any form of sex separation as a function of various jobs and you see rigid uniformity you know the market is not a fish\nBecause it's going to treat like cases alike but it is not so good the two different cases as though they were like\nAnd what happens with all the feminist on this issue is they assume that every time you see a difference and balance whether women are underrepresented it's never a matter of individual choice it's always a matter of institutional\nDiscrimination but it makes no sense if you're thinking about it analytically I'm so for example if you look at an engineering school and you're talking about the abstract science computers you'll get ten or eleven percent women talking about environmental\nAnd you know bad engineering is now fifty percent female does one really think that the same university has a huge discrimination in one area no discrimination and the other or is this a matter of preferences\nAnd choices by the applicant sort of question I'm very much for the second point of view and I think it's demeaning to men and women alike to assume that everybody is shaped by a series of external forces which have to characteristics when they are and mislead powerful and to the early invisible\nRichard ... the way this case Richard at the Hoover Institution speaking of the California law that will mandate a percentage of women represented on corporate boards when we come back\nInstitution speaking of the California law that will mandate a percentage of women represented on corporate boards when we come back we're going to turn to another subject that's as hot as it gets right now in twenty eight team that is the Supreme Court I'm John bachelor this is the John bachelor show\nOn a five point not ever him and his hand are a lot of these are asking for and wanting to an A.

army has one of each and they mix and match them depending on what continent they're landing on\nThe marine corps however in the first World War was a new story to the American people to the American fighting man what place does it have in the first war next to John ... American expeditionary force a new book\nI Will hold its the story of the United States Marine corps legend Clifton ... case this is one of the founders of the marine corps legend\nFrom ... to victory in the great war will begin our story with Jim Nelson\nIt's February Nineteen Eighteen and we're in France with the marine corps they're they are the second division all of them and the sticks regiment is the one we're going to follow because within that\nThe regiment and within that the battalion and within that the company is uh the protagonist cliff Kate who has joined the Marines\nAre not knowing exactly what it's about where it's coming from is a Marine Corps that fought in China it's fought in Haiti in Cuba I it's been part of the Mexican war but it doesn't have a big story to tell the American people\nSo much so that when you first hear of it yes what's the marine corps a gym a very good evening to you congratulations and we begin in February\nNineteen Eighteen in France this is what they call the manure sector here we are case is young officer he commands the platoon\nHow did he get here where's the come from where his people and why did he joined the marine corps good evening to you\nCould do a good case was born at his family's place at the quakes landing named after his family in the far northwest Tennessee what on the Mississippi River\nAnd farms at a general store they had a landing for river boats to come by and drop things up things up he's got things and it was it wasn't a wealthy background but as well as well to do enough later in life or one person one writer would describe as being Eris aristocratic um\nBut he did well enough he didn't do that great in school you went to some country school out is uh they ship them off to them as a military academy when he was a teenager and then from there\nHe entered the University of Tennessee in Nineteen twelve studied law uh graduated in Nineteen sixteen and as war was approaching the spring of Nineteen Seventy\nSyrian Debbie Reynolds lead the industry with getting your homes sold fast and for top dollar\nSyrian Debby will even guarantee if you're home doesn't so they'll buy it for cash at a price acceptable to you hold the rentals seem direct right now eat for for three four four sold that for for three four four sold or\nVisit Debby has the buyers dot com that's Debbie has the buyers dot com\n\nWon all five point nine ... than I Am [laughter] [noise]\nI'm John ... this is John bachelor show\nImagining ... men were that even some of the American people in the headlines we're now in early June Nineteen Eighteen second division twenty seven thousand five hundred\nI'm following the reporting of James Carl Nelson Jim Nelson his new book I Will hold\nAnd our protagonist cliff Kate's commands the Ninety six company that's part of the deployment of the overall six regimen but they are told\nThat they are going to hold the line and advance in a particular place where there's off hunting for us to his own aristocratic hunting for it's called the ... woods cage is given the role of advancing on a village Bora Shay\nAt this point Jim\nCases understanding moving into the wheat fields because that's what surrounding him\nYou make a special case that the Marines were completely out of date they were believing in a mass mosque a tree and advancing in a line not taking into account that they were going up against machine guns and artillery\nYeah they had a an overpowering belief in overpowering rifle power I shouldn't use power so many times but they believed in the rifle and they believe the marine marksman ship 'em\nSo they they a lot of different forces learn listen to the first World War doesn't work you know the dancing rows and being mowed down by machine guns is not a good way to to a fight a battle [noise] um I Want you to ... Bella would a close case was still he was a second lieutenant um the\nCompany commander was Donald Duncan um but they decided they made a decision to attack fellow would which indeed was a it was like a royal hunting area you have to keep deer and stuff in there the Germans were coming to south and then they were heading east they're thirty five miles from Paris so they were getting very close\nAnd they sent the second division in a to a bend them off and the first to where I was I Believe the U.S twenty third regiment so they put them at the far eastern end of the line to block the road from many Germans coming from that way I guess by happenstance the Fort ... regiment ... were first and then the fifth regiment was came in after\nTook a line in front of Belo would otherwise you might not have heard the Marines um the regulars got kind of a of shut out of the picture from that because it didn't really assault della with themselves anyway John harbor James Herbert who was the fourth a brigade commander was\nCertain that they were hardly any Germans and the word he was a certain of it but in fact they\nHad infiltrated chase the French outrun it built strong a machine gun position central lady ... positions all through it very rocky craggy place on June sixty Americans decided to attack it so they sent the fifth regiment basically on the left in the morning to try to do that\nThan a general's movement assault was order for the afternoon\nAnd that was at a salt on the far right or east end of a line that the Ninety six company carried out in the village to village of ... it was about five o'clock in the afternoon and basically like you said that kind of spread out on line across the five hundred white yard a yard wide open field and attacked this\nVery powerful a German position that precious many machine guns artillery a rifle man and a Kate's but leading his platoon sport but soon and that\nThe men were literally bent over as if they're walking to a rainstorm and as he has bent over a bullet cranked up his helmet and knocked and cold that let this huge tend to get the helmet throughout the rest of the war um\nBut he ... he didn't even know how long he was out and said its first impulse was to run away [laughter] so it's kind of unusual there's a very real character but his first battle really it looked to his right they saw some of his men over there being and he made his way through a severe a rifle power and machine gun fire to them\nAnd one of his men started pouring a wind from the canteen out the window on his head and Kate said hey you end up in my head give me a drink so he took a long drink of it [noise]\nFortified he picked up in a band in French rifle that led twenty men into brush Ryan\nTwenty I'm I'm fifty six men that ... up the platoon that started a gyms reporting thirty two casualties so twenty four reached village of note here at this point a surround there's no way back they can't go back to ... that they just

are mass before machine guns that overwhelm them they capture the village and yet at this point there is no good communication and they're missing their company commander Roberts and continues to ... to disappear I have a headline to supplement gems book because\nI it's great fun to read a book that this well researched and go and go to the New York times headline of him or member now this is introducing the marine corps to the American people and nowhere in this story do they mention that the United States Marines who take these villages new advance by our men goes they head\nTowards the end Bora Shay stormed into drive on six miles from enemy losses very heavy each men get a German don't let him get you was the victors slogan\nNothing stops are they're rushed twenty five of them fight two hundred in towards the German debt free deepen places and then this from the story\nAre captured German says he did not know that it was the American supposed to the Germans he thought the troops were British as they weren't English helmets he added that the German soldiers no longer hope to reach Paris all of them are sick of the war and he was glad he had been made prisoner\nSo the Marines get no noticed here Jim and that's the part of your story is that the Marines' fight spectacularly and these massacres and yet or the army and pushing overall get all the headlines\nWell in a way um\nI Would tweak that to say that actually uh they they did start getting a notice to the chagrin and anger of the army regulars regularly is the first division not not in the second the parents to watch but ah what\nHappened was there was a correspondent for the Chicago Tribune went in with uh the\nFloyd given the one who is Chinese media yes\nWent in through the we feel took a bullet me I knocked out and before the fancy been tipped off about the advance or get written a story that\nMentioned the Marines are pushing it lay down where the no units where the identified\nThis is the Chicago Tribune is that what it was yeah\nYeah so one out on the wires ... story about marine storming Bello would and this kind of stuff and uh everybody thought given was dead so it gets to the censors off as a person's headquarters in Paris and he says well I'm a I'm going to let this through because it's the last thing I can do for general Floyd you know see what it through that the Marines\nAre wanting to re victory that's why the ... story here doesn't make any mention of it because this is via Chicago I think it's yeah it's a ... meter had right\nIt it it it made you know everybody but actually it was like the Marines were the only ones fight the war after that to a lot of people there was like you know they never really heard that they captured the American imagination let's\nTake them into the village themselves because one one of the aspects of gyms book that is always worrying is that once they capture a mission once they complete their mission and capture a point it's going to get worse because the German counterattack and in this instance while they park themselves in this village the Germans then start using\nMustard gas over these next days and\nThey are the mustard gas is especially bad in the villages June eight through eleventh gym as my notes here that's when they just get rained upon by mustard gas and they don't retreat they they try to survive and their math than many don't make\nNo what happened was they were in the village and uh they were getting pretty well pounded by artillery and they were really worried about Germany counterattack [noise] um there's a very vital point\nEastern and below what they could have a lot which from there any Americans attacking it so it was a real it was a strong point they needed the gas was not actually used in till later Kate spent several days with his men by the ... by the night of June six\nHe said you know he had like an entire regiment of people that are basically he held any doubt with a number of people who came in reinforcements um it was on the night of June thirteenth he's actually been pulled to the back lines and sat around and there's cops and trees basically what this is a company and Seventy eighth company and they were spotted\nBy German a balloon is all day and write as they were getting the last feed it about midnight or all hell broke through a mustard gas a high explosive shells just rained down on them for about an hour\nAnd basically what it was all over ... home that his company was to form a base it was just as there was a bloodbath\nI Will hold the book were going on the worst battles they had Jim Nelson James cone Nelson is the author I'm John bachelor\nWon all five point nine of them in the Washington Mall and how [noise]\nWas learn sitting there with your very helpful notes and talking about how Eddie's experiencing flying is that this was\nTotally all the time the engine\nSo you're flying that this was completely\nTotally all the time the engine of the holy had one gear and ... was the only way to moderate the speed\nAt the same time your face is being dashed my castor oil which they move used as oil business before and aircraft engine oil exist and and that led to nauseous and often played by diarrhea when you came back\nYou know we're freezing above ten thousand feet\nAnd you had to rule the playing constantly\nAnd forth I get the feeling that you call it at one point you quote from one of the flyers so many of the less notes especially the dead ones there was like flying a gyroscope and yeah so let's go all the time Eddie ... every moment out there that he was fighting the aircraft the Newport was tail heavy right it was he always had to adjust to keep the level\nHe knows he's going up to actually fight other aircraft the Germans had superior aircraft the folk her aircraft or extremely superior to the Newport these were French belt\nBut he never backs off the presses and presses until they give them a chance to fly\nWith what becomes the Ninety ... however he's still treated with disdain by his fellow officers law the others he's a sergeant right they never make him they don't make them in a lieutenant right away is a flying saucer on the other officers there's some of America's most famous families\nI think the uh the ... family dies in the aircraft Clinton\nPam Coolidge or all of these men come from a life that Eddie has no idea yeah and they don't really accept him I Know say eventually they do because he comes in but I never felt\nThe Germans to you to look at the red beret and he was from up there it was a quite a drink ... yes exactly from quite a thing so you're you're looking at the you know these are the best and the brightest thrown out each other and then here's this kid
