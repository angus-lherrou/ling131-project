N.

A. there's still an issue with them getting the care how\nAre you progressing there and do you only been on the job for a month\nAnd are we able to open up an alternative avenues for Gary said that they're not stuck in that there are good at the\nBeauty of what we are going through now we're going through the greatest transformative period envy a since Omar Bradley ran it after World War two and\nA we're opening up the aperture of choice so that our veterans will have an opportunity to see the care that they want if that means outside of the VA we will take batch of that\nCan you do from the executive branch and how much required well\nCongress has given us tremendously ways of mission act was a revolutionary thing because it's sad it's legislated intent was to put the health of the veteran at the center of the veterans Experian\nMentioned that being revolutionary that is revolutionary not\nCentered and we are taking that\nAnd I believe the president will be announcing major reforms changes and the way we do business in the state of the union um which will be an eye opener\nBut again it will put that veteran at the center of the care not at the whim of the bureaucracy not at the whim of a protocol some of which were developed when Omar Bradley ran the place in the Nineteen forties\nYou know so often when we do our annual Fisher house radio yes I'm sure you're familiar with coming up this December and I talk to the incredible veterans and their families to uh do you know get their care\nThrough the VA they often have glowing things have say and that story doesn't get out as much because there are major problems at the VA\nDon't get their care through the VA they often have glowing things have say and that story doesn't get out as much because there are major problems at the VA but it is in this area really really strong and doing doing\nGod's world there your previous question actually hit on what I discovered coming from the Pentagon it is not the medical care that our veterans complain about the problems are administrative and bureaucratic it's getting the veteran and his family into the system\nIn there that are prescription drugs and\nThat's how it all stars and the ending is terrifying and so while we have seen a plateau in the number of opioid\nFast it's surely not enough and this is why the signing of such a place and it's so critical in addition to the fact that President Trump hasn't cured six billion dollars and opioids funding going to the state's going to these local programs\nTo help families rebuild their lives and not only about on prevention and it's not only about helping\nIndividuals who are currently suffering through this crisis but it's also about education it's about teaching argue\nThat that that opioids is it very very addictive and this is why you're having in several states some pushing forward opioids curriculum to help there are children understand the dangers of opioid\nAnd let's talk about that for a minute because I think that especially when we see the push for legalization of marijuana or these medical marijuana and various safer than here in Washington and Marilyn that's already gotten through there is a very important difference in the station and I think that uh our young people do need to learn that it's like okay your parents may be okay with pop at the same for say\n... and the reality is going into the even the marijuana component is that there are horrible dangerous with youth\nSmoking pot because what happens is is that many times you start with pot you end with opioids ends with alcoholism I mean again this is the idea that when you're dealing with young minds so important to send that message to our children\nAbout opioids one of the things I learned this week and I had this conversation you know all my children with the two older girls I might add vaping is very popular right now and one of the things that FDA I'm director Scott Gottlieb has pushed toward is looking to regulate the the vaping company why because\nThe kids are saying oh it's bubble gum oh if I Do plan to add Harry flavored well the reality is again you start with the taping leads to horrible medical consequences including lung cancer and he had a young age and then it leads to the other drove\nIt doesn't but then when they get their product that\nIs that understanding that danger than as parents we have that responsibility but one of the big points that President Trump has made in particular when it comes to opioids is the shock\nI I don't know if you've seen them they're all on television or the administration has worked with a truth commission did they launched these um public ads and it's about the shocking at like you know when you see that tobacco act as a woman who can't speak anymore\nBecause she was she just\nWell it's the same concept is this idea of seeing a person the talk\nLive going through that experience it's about the voice story of he broke his shoulder and you know what if he would do he would break his shoulder over and over again to be able to get these opioids it is incredibly addictive and we're looking to expand this research to non opioid prescription drugs to ensure that there's other alternative\nUm you know maybe it's about taking a Tylenol or an Advil instead of going into the dangers of what we've seen with opioids were speaking\nWith Mercedes slap of course she was one of the ah the senior advisors and the communication shopping for the president here in the White House floods customers thirty slept as we're seeing these are the people coming up from Guatemala Honduras El Salvador coming across Mexico and we keep hearing this term refugee an asylum thrown around these are people who have economic hardships yet\nThese are people who are coming from a country with crime but that's not political asylum you were actually the child of reminds you use fresh Cuba please make that decision it's important\nIt's but it's also very important to understand that they the the Central Americans are being taught I mean there are people who train these individual illegal aliens coming in to say when you go through the border when you go through these poor country you need to use the word credible fear\nWhat do you use the word credible feel fear they put you into the asylum category so guess what you wait two or three years together we\nCan we just say okay critical fair is no longer the key word\nTake congressional action and what we have seen President Trump for over a year\nHave made it a point to say I want to negotiate with the Democrats we need to close these legal loopholes we need to make these significant changes in the law\nAnd what the Democrats have done is they have refused to come to the table\nThey are the party of open borders they do not protect our national sovereignty and they do not protect our rule of law and that to me it's incredibly disheartening because at the end of the day where you are seeing or criminal organizations leftist groups organizing these Karen as you're seeing another one pop up and down Salvador him coming our way and we have no\nYou are seeing our criminal organizations leftist groups organizing the ... thing and the other one pops up in El Salvador him coming our way and we have no way to stop it and that to me it's so\nDisheartening because these individuals are being used as political pawns are being used as human shields and you had the cartels any criminal organization and then it's not helping to find that the ... the caravan and making sure that they do chaos within the United states and we need to\nHold on a news Bennett says we approve another Venezuela or money is coming back on his way a lot of help from this organization or from the government\nThat ... that it is for me I Can't wait to Rome pick their own people but it is part of the left wing group while I was involved that we we have sources that have shared that with us and Israel habit car cartels involved in this process they're missing children in the caravan\nCatch what they're doing is that they're using these individuals as human shields wanted so chaos within the United states and we don't have the mechanisms to stop\nBy the way it is a fascinating that the reporters who were down there marching with these people they're not asking the question here where somebody coming from now they're not actually I Believe that that would be part\nOf the store and they want to talk about the ... like I think with soldiers serving in touch\nWe have a legal immigration from\nThe president wants to push a merit based immigration which of those individuals with the skills to come in and match up what we need in terms of our economy\nBut more importantly is we're a nation of borders we our ... our national sovereignty is key and the Democrats have no respect for that they do not have respect for national coverage if they do not have respect for national borders and they're using these illegal aliens you know ... ... yes yesterday\nThe boarding cross border crossing numbers and family and its alone so for a hundred and sixty one thousand family units that have come through because they know the legal loopholes efforts to contain the United states you know what happened they come through twenty days later based on what we have which is the floors

registered Republican right [noise]\nBut he's previously been convicted of felonies according to their same store and these other stores\nSo he should have been removed from the voter registration list because he lost his right to vote in Florida\nYou know the Democrats and the blue states and the blue cities they keep pushing for the rights of felons to vote after they've served their time you've heard it over and over again you're heard Gillum mentioned it on one of the debates summer pushing for the right of felons to vote while they're in prison\nAfter they've served their time you've heard it over and over again you're heard Gillum mentioned it and one of the debates summer in pushing for the right of felons to vote while they're in prison\n\nSo let's talk about the facts here it's Florida\nHe should have been removed from the voter registration list because he lost his right to vote and it could not be restored until and unless he applied to the Florida clemency board and was approved Florida is one of the states that does not does not automatically\nRestore the ride of felons to vote when they get out of prison even though it soon might by the way they go so left but a referendum on the upcoming November ballot Arnie of ironies to do exactly that so unless he had his right to vote restored he can't be a registered Republican quote unquote so I Would

both police accountability\nBut law enforcement society cannot work quite frankly law enforcement can do it John heavy truck in relationship with the community at the time that a law enforcement official and to go to a weapon to a gun to all the time to with either they may have already have to go too far by their very presence\nBy the very trust that they are on fire and community and in society is supposed to be able to bring most situations you\nKnow this is sick and this man is sick from a a philosophical ideological perspective eased a radical\nHe's sick from a philosophical and political perspective\nHe knows this not to be true\nYou have\nCriminals in society including in poor neighborhoods who cannot be reason with rapists\nMurderers wouldn't be rapist will be murders robbers wouldn't be robbers and so forth and so on\nAt the time that a law enforcement official has to go to a weapon to a gun to a baton to a taser then they have already gone too far\nBut a law enforcement official has to go to a weapon toward gone to a baton to a taser then they have already gone too far by their very presence\n\nBy the very trust that they inspiring community and its society there is supposed to be able to bring most situations to heal\nThis\nSeem credible\nAnd Debbie Wasserman Schultz has no problem with this she thinks he's great because of the news conference today in support of Andrew Gillum here's what she had to say cut twelve go\nI just want to share with you [noise]\nWho are taking care of the people I represent every single day\nAnd hail with that kind of her [noise]\nWhile serving like a six [noise]\nAnd so we're going to make sure\nIt's one of the reasons that we have sort of like the Andrew Gillum got out of high\nSchool where it's going to say\nThat we can stand up for the values\nAnd the values of the community is to trash the cops even in the\nFace of this that's a press conference today\nAnd they weren't Debbie Wasserman Schultz to know that she's a victim that her staff\nOr staff victims\nBut so it was Donald Trump junior victim and so is that Rick Trump a victim and so it was Donald Trump ... and so as Lara Trump a victim and so was Marco Rubio victim it's so Susan Collins a victim and so was General Mattis a victim\nAnd I just don't remember all the outpouring of anguish by the media I just don't remember it day in and day out now this isn't about moral relativism ever anything of this or this is about absolute ... face bully ten hypocrisy\n\nAnd Steve ... was actually shot and almost murdered as others were shot\nLuckily this coke either didn't know what he was doing or didn't intend for these bombs to go either way he's a terrorist and the New York times tells us he's a registered Republican I'm trying to figure out how that can be I'm not saying he's not I just want to know more\nBecause once you're selling and Florida you're not automatically return to the voting list you're not allowed to vote unless you go specifically to the far like clemency board did he do that did he get approval I mean this guy two thousand two\nIn two thousand two he made a bomb threat [noise] he made a bomb threat in two thousand two he's not a clean slate\n\nThe way he was wearing the perpetrator before he was caught was portrayed\nThe insinuation from Schumer and Pelosi the insinuation from CNN and MSNBC was there was a direct\nLine between Trump and his rhetoric and whoever was doing this\nThat was the insinuation that pushed him over the edge and that this is what causes it sort of know it doesn't but has multiple felonies in his past the guy threatened to use a bomb and two thousand two\n\nThat's pretty uh long before Donald Trump even flirted with the idea of running for president United States\nHe was arrested in two thousand two according to the Associated Press on charges of threatening to throw place project the discharge any destructive device\n\nAnd it was pointed out in the Washington Examiner he made the bomb threat because he was angry at a Florida utility worker St people do not make these threats\nThat commit these other felonies and I suppose would be governor Andrew Gillum medical you Andrew Andrew Gillum\nWhat say well the police should pull out guns are tasers or Billy clubs or anything of this or no no no they should figure out how to make\nThe guy he'll be more you know community relations part community relations\n[noise]\nI'll tell you what [noise]\nI'd like to know a hell of a lot more about the situation I really would\nNot criminal conspiracy perspective or anything else I just want to know more of the facts\nThe ... I really would not criminal conspiracy perspective or anything else I just want to know more of the facts\nAnd I'm sure now that the New York slime so Washington compost constipated news network MSL us Dan all the rest of them are working feverishly to figure out how he became a registered Republican or retain that than I think the New York times is obligated since it was the first report is to tell us how [noise]\nWasn't because Florida\nIs not allowed to clear up it's a voter rolls because of all the left wing are suing is because of [noise]\nPeople on the uh Florida clemency board game as registration what exactly are we going to rethink this idea that that one should be able to vote\nBut here we can accommodate everybody\nOK well use humor to I don't care if we can use ... can use taxis greyhound whatever I'm not particular about these things [noise]\nWhat Mr producer my call screeners down why don't you give me a hand and tell me for summer wonder if we have lip and number two if not if we have a regular American\n[noise]\nMike in Maryland and the great WMA I'll go\nHey mark great talking to you a dime color on anything else on the war rhetoric going on um one thing I noticed that um it seems to push the buttons to push this guy but with that\nUm you know it's the first time where supporters of a particular candidate have been directly or ... of the attack\nAn attack regularly for a long term and you know and that's a thought things that people when they when they picked up by and then they're attacked by the fact\nThat my point is you know they're going back and forth that if the if the rhetoric between what Donald Trump that and what the media and the Democrats say it's directed to I don't ever remember Donald Trump I'm doing something to the supporters of the Democrats the way that the\nDemocrat I think I think you're giving this not way too much credit turned two thousand two he threatened to bomb a or a public utility because he was angry with a worker\nSo I'd be very very careful about playing into the less hands that this is uh some guy who who's angry about what the left is doing and so forth and so we're all angry about what the left is doing but we don't send real are fake bombs to a bunch of people\nNo I don't support that at all the more the case though you know you're you're asking well why do we push peoples' buttons why go there anyway why ever attacked order that doesn't have the right way to do things the way we're fed up\nWhile the media like to do this they attack or all the time because you see Mr Zucker overt CNN and uh the clown that runs MSL us they they've decided that they are political operations in that they want to um [noise]\nUh they want they want to play to a base the radical left coup democratic base and that's what they've decided to do\nUh they're not really news operations they know damn well that Don limit is a joke they know damn well the Jake Tapper more and more has become a joke look what they run at night Steven Kobe or the Spock of ah\nWhat the goofy years may I yes I Will the spot of a late night comedy it's not even comedy it's stupid and look at Kimmel and bits another moron\nAnd by the way several of these people are including came a little bits and others have done blackface I'm a ... if you'd call it that\nIn the past how come they're not fired like making Kelly's fired how come they're not fired how come join Reid hasn't been fired from MSL as the given everything that she posted means seems a little odd to me thank you for your call sir seems a lot of odd to me\nI'm not interested in the in the conspiracy theories finished your call screener like caller number four that's just that's the [noise] let them call different shows I'm not interested in that that go to a Todd\nRockville, Maryland WCBS and go\nMark ... talk to you thank you could I have here's one solution I haven't done the math on this and it's pretty incredible you and I and everybody else pay into Social Security trust fund or about what is it six point eight percent seven point two percent out your way out or if they\nHave that we Institute for near citizenship in this country for a period of four years you've paid double that rate\nAnd then you work your way to finish up your rate come down to a normal right I Do for math on an\nOutlet let let let's let on you say there's a moral issue here so I don't think people should be able to pay their way out of their illegal behavior\nOr not somebody and and watch\nAll also sees because many of them are very little in terms of wages and many of them get paid under the table or because the employer doesn't want to be revealed as a crook what I'm saying is I don't think this would work because it's already lawless and so you're saying okay let's tax at well if that's already lawless and they're not paying any taxes to begin with the\nI'm saying is I don't think this would work because it's already lawless and so you're saying okay let's tax at well if that's already lawless and they're not paying any taxes to begin with the employer and so forth then how do how do you push them into that system\nBomb thing even for legal immigration coming to this country we gotta have something going instead\nOf thought well we need is to limit the number of people coming into the country legally and illegally that's it\nNot this is not Nineteen Eighteen if ... if the new ball game\nI don't know what that means\nI mean at the new economy we can't way of bite the tank\nThere in the Nineteen twenties during college is presidency we had a during that period before and slightly after we had like a twenty year respite on immigration you aware of that\nI Wish it was to some extent\nOr a matter of us being able to just slow things down assimilate people within our system to take a look at how it says shaking out in terms of our school systems [noise]\nParents have law enforcement terms a local health care in terms of jobs and so forth but what's happening is the left is flooding the field more and more and more we've never had a fifty year period of immigration like we have right now never in American history\nWe actually have a political party that's cheering illegality\nCheering so I I I don't but I appreciate your ... people come up with tax schemes and everything else it's beyond tax games it's beyond well let's have them pay three times and no no that's enforce the law\nThat's enforce the law and many people who come here people don't want to hear this many people come here don't work\nThere's a whole underground economy [noise] with uh with fake Social Security cards with people getting Medicaid orange posed to get medicate there's a whole massive under campground economy going on in this country\nAnd everybody knows it everybody knows\nAnd again you have a political party that or\nIs it not only won't do anything about it it celebrates

know passing the opioid legislation that the president signed this week at the White House\nThat I was there with Democrats and Republicans\nCelebrating that we got this national emergency in the opioid crisis six billion dollars that were doing to help\nAnd the press doesn't want to talk about that so I appreciate you being a place where we talk about issues and the good things that we're getting done for the country and my opponent opposes this agenda and just wants to resist were about results there about resistance on about you know getting things [noise]\nThat improve the quality of life in advance our economy protect you know our citizens public safety I been endorsed by the police benevolent association but I've also been endorsed by and supported by the federal employees

running an attack out I\nKeep threatening to shut down the or the metro in the Washington DC area and violate yeah and violate the law and they're attacking\nMe for not raising taxes so my opponent attacks me and then people like this was this is a union that was so you know that's functional that the Obama administration supportive suited\nAnd that to supporting her and and other union cruise but she hasn't gotten you know any business endorsements she wouldn't even sit down interview with the police benevolent association and this is someone she put her own\nStaff into fake party city costumes tries\nPolice in or out to imply that she had the support of the police when in fact the police have endorsed and supported me because of my record on public\nSafety on let me let me ask you this before we run out of time roads big deal in northern Virginia [noise] on there's a lot of road construction going on and that's even before the president pushes through an infrastructure program but she's a heavy duty tax or on the toll road is\nIt was the ... that they're forty six dollar told that you see when you go into Washington she was for them before she was against them [laughter] and here she was on the committee that you know that they put the put through that but more importantly is she saying she was against them\nYet Terry McAuliffe who put that into place how she was ineffective and persuading him now you look at something where I Know we might disagree on this but I really advocated for the I'm a pay raise for federal employees and the president and you know the administration and this was going to do a pay freeze\nAnd I went to them politely and made my case and talked about why it was important that the people who you know at the FBI the CIA all this\nAnd I went to them politely and made my case and talked about why it was important that people who you know at the FBI the CIA or the other day got their pay raises so they can do the good work they did and [noise] you know arresting a character that they got today and so\nUm I work politely with the administration and that she was ineffective and getting Terry McAuliffe to do anything\nAnd and get rid of that forty six dollar calls and so we need somebody who defected who can work with you know a Republican administration or a Democrat I demonstrated that and and I've always been\nSomeone advocating lower taxes are very\nAnd public safety which is why I'm thrilled to have the support of our police than\nYou are in a tough district to marginal districts\nAnd what they're hoping of course is that they can scare the hell out of everybody in northern Virginia\nA particularly the federal workers and others and the teachers are the usual unions and so forth to turn those people out and what they've done and the Democratic party is they have selected the most extreme radical Nancy Pelosi like candidate they possibly could\nAnd they're hoping to turn the entire area blue so it's crucially important\nLet me speak to all of a nights out there many conservatives out there as well I don't know it is crucially important that you come out and vote up and down the ticket and you come out and vote for Barbara Comstock\nUm she may not be as conservative as you like but she's not a radical cook like the like her opponent who clearly is\nAnd I've known you for decades and I know you're a person of integrity and ethics\nAnd I think it's very important that the that the people come out and vote for you conservatives moderates independents at the Republican Party unite as the
