some people and giving money to other people and the people who are getting the money don't really pay much tax in the first place so\nTo continue with with Harris is tackling she's offering as much as three thousand dollars a year for a single person or six thousand dollars a year for a married couple on top of the existing tax and transfer program dispersed either as a lump sum tax refund or as a monthly payment\nAs many as ... million Americans would benefit so who is going to pay for all of this the answer is that they don't care\nThat really is the answer they tend to this is going to the job in the economy because if you give a bunch of money to people at the bottom end of the economic spectrum this is what creates economic growth that is not true it had never been true what jobs economic growth in the creation of new products and services that create new jobs and it also allow people to buy cooler stuff\nSocialism is about freezing the economy in place and redistributing all

be able to generate new and better types of pie bigger pie\nThat makes ... awesome they otherwise you can just freeze it and distribute it until there is no ... that's basically the socialist model so where are they gonna pay for all of us I Love how the Atlantic describes ... proposal\nOf course the federal proposals would come at significant cost in some cases on the scale of the tax cuts or the Affordable CARE Act\nWas not the same thing from tax cuts are not things that costs money their meat paying less money into the federal government that is not a federal cost a federal cost it use spending my money not and you're telling me I get to keep my own money\nIs not a cost to let someone keep their own money\nThe way that this measure doesn't say suggesting the Affordable CARE Act which is a government expenditure based on tax receipts at the same thing as cutting tax receipts by saying that people can keep throwing money they sleight of hand a physical sleight of hand\nThe brown legislation would cost at one point four trillion dollars over a decade Harris legislation would come in at something like two hundred billion dollars per year which means two trillion dollars over the course of a decade\nTerrorists has proposed repealing that Trump tax cuts to pay for her bell but that is not even come close to covering the kind of cost she's talking about and they're talking about universal health care and they're talking about free child welfare and they are talking about it or or for free childcare and they're talking about free college tuition none of this stuff is going to get paid for\nSo why why it has is they're all this enthusiasm for this sort of stuff in a time when we have as of yesterday seven million unfilled jobs in the United states a four percent unemployment rate and historically booming economy why are we talking about undermining the pillars of capitalism because we have shifted our mindset in the United states\nAnd this is really what I Want to talk about today we have shifted our mindset when it comes to what our lives should be like when we believe we are guaranteed things here in the United states we believe that we are guaranteed a solid level of living because we live here\nHear this from Bernie Sanders all the time the richest country in the world from we really have people who do not have enough money to buy all the ... that they could possibly want\nTo hear that from Bernie Sanders all the time the assumption there being you were born here or stop you were born here therefore America's rich therefore you get stuff\n... a baseline assumption you're entitled to things here is what you are entitled to in a free country you are entitled to adventure that's what you're entitled to your born entitled to exercise your right\nPursuit of adventure you get to\nThe title to adventure that's what you're entitled to your bowling entitled to exercise your right\nIn pursuit of adventure you get to make up your own story here that the American dream the American dream is people who are coming from across the the place they did not know environment that we're not used to and building lives for their families and creating prosperity from the ground up\nThe way the human beings have war for literally all of human ... in for literally all human history and yet now we believe that in order to facilitate people being able to stay where they were originally base we have to shift the way that the free market works\nWell that's not that's not correct\nAnd again this is not coming out of the places of lack of sympathy this is coming from a place where I sympathize with people's play and the question is what can you do to make your life better Democrats both on the left they went to talk about what can we do to make your life better\nAnd the answer is very little the real question is what can you do to make your life better because every successful ... person on planet earth\nIs the person who at some point said to themselves what can I Do to help myself America is a country of people saying to themselves what can I Do to help my lot in life what can I Do to be more ambitious what can I Do to stretch my wings and fly\nAnd then we say okay well what can we do to provide that when what can we do to get all the obstacles out of your way well can we do to remove the barriers\nThat the American way is not the American way say listen you know ... ... it's uncomfortable to structure which may be difficult to leave home it may be harder to do this\nBut it\nIs so we're just going to make sure you know you never have to buy ... we're going to Cato you we're going to make sure that your swab in the warm blanket of government benefits\nWe're going to ensure that you never have to get out there and fly again this is not coming from place to no sympathy this is coming from a place of you can't innovate your children you can't innovate your communities and you can't intervene your country on the basis of empathy alone\nAnd that is the best case interpretation of what exactly Democrats are doing here the worst case interpretation is something much more cynical purpose for innovation of an entire sector of the population specifically to gain votes and thereby political power\nAfter you look at towns like Detroit it's hard to imagine that's not what's been going on there for decades because the failure of this sort of of thinking is evident in major cities and counties across the United states if he actually wants to reinvigorate the American

know\nThat's how we become bigger that's how we become better that's held lives become better to tell the world becomes better trade becomes better is why you have cool stuff is white culture has become better because they experience and bounce off of other cultures\nThat this notion that we can hunker down now because we've reached paradise and all we have to do is hunker down and live in and redistribute what in our backpacks backpacks are gonna run out you know there's there's not any of this war okay so in just a second I Want to talk about this fascinating article in the New York times

talk about\nBecause it speaks to the lack of objectivity when it comes to the intersection with politics the article from New York Times is titled why white supremacist are chugging milk\nAnd wide geneticists are alarmed and here's what they say is from Amy Harmon\nNowhere on the agenda of the annual meeting of the American society of human genetics being held in San Diego this week is the topic plaguing many of its members the recording appropriation of the fields research in the name of white supremacy\nSticking your neck out on political issues is difficult to Jennifer Wagner a bioethicist and president of the group's social issues committee\nWho sought to convene a panel on the racist misuse of genetics and found little traction but the specter of the field digging them any us past which include support for the American eugenics movement looms large for many geneticist in light of today's white identity politics they also worry about how new tools that are allowing them\nAnd support for the American eugenics movement looms large for many geneticist in light of today's white identity politics they also worry about how new tools that are allowing them to hone in on the genetic basis\nOf hot button traced like intelligence will be misconstrued just sit racist ideology is an argument that I have a pretty frequent basis with a friend of mine Jane costs and over a box or Jane is black and ... and\nI think rightly has great sensitivity and the British upgrade sensitivity but I think Jane would suggest that her background contributes to the sense to me I'm with regard to the races past of the United states and the and the racist\nAssociation between politics and bad science\nAnd so this has led to some serious conversations between the two of us\nAbout political correctness about whether in fact there was an appropriate time to talk about I cue for example or standardized testing for example or about the natural differences between men and women\nLike when you talk about biology without being condemn infect us or racist he's a real issues that we have to discuss and take on head on unfortunately the scientific community has decided to quash a lot of actual science because they're afraid that people who are racist or going to take that science out of context and then use that to Columbus mission and minority group and\nThat's basically what this New York times articles about his in recent months some scientists have spotted distortions of their own academic papers in part right Internet forums others have fielded confused queries about claims of white superiority\nWrapped in the jargon of human genetics misconceptions about how genes factor into America stock racial disparities has surface in the nation's increasingly heated arguments over school achievement gap\nImmigration and policing instead of long discounted proxies like\nSocial circle of friends and family pedigrees according to experts you track the far right today's proponents of racial hierarchy are making their case by and misinterpreting research on the human genome itself\nAnd debate that have been largely limited to ivory tower forum the scientist whose job it is mine human the humanities genetic variations for the collective good are grappling with how to respond if there's a real way to respond all of this\nPut out the science and then defend the science that's the way to respond all of us instead the scientists afraid that there are scientists are going to be misappropriated misinterpreted or used for bad reasons\nThey've decided that they are going to simply squash all of this discussion internally\nJohn November's University of Chicago evolutionary biologists studying human genetic diversity an easier in a society where diversity is clearly valued and celebrated right now that is very much on my mind ones like Dr November his folded into his recent talks to fix a group of white nationalist trucking milk\nAt a two thousand Seventeen gathering to draw attention to a genetic trait known to be more common and white people than others the ability to digest lactose adults\nBut also shows and social media posts are going to count and she called entered the milk zone with a map lifted from a scientific journal article on the phrase evolutionary history and most of the world the article explains the gene that allows for the digestion of lactose\nSwitches off after childhood but with the arrival of the first cattle herders in Europe some five thousand years ago a chance mutation that left it turned on provided enough of a nutritional led up to nearly all of those who survived eventually carried\nIt and then the post shows a snippet of hate speech urging individuals that African ancestry to leave America saying if you can't drink milk you have to go back well\nI mean so what they're idiots in one of the great ironies of of white supremacist there the stupidest people on the planet\nThey're constantly talking about white people are superior and they're just dumb houses that's one of the things that's so funny it's like if you're going to proclaim white superiority and you really shouldn't send your best is I'm In a commentary that accompany the paper in the journal genetic section of Emory warned that research is wrapped in numerous habits that are likely get lost in translation because\nPeople are flaunting DNA ancestry tests indicating exclusively European heritage but the problem here is that we actually have to look at what science does have to say because it is a con founding factor when you look at attributing racism to America so take for example racial disparities in education\nSo there's a lot of talk these days about affirmative action and whether people are performing at certain levels eligible to get them into college\nAnd he suggested that it is historic American racism that has led to that has led to the education gap in America's higher education system in alternative would be that the test scores do not wind up equally among various ethnic groups\nAnd that is true not just with regard to black and white it's not true with regard to white and Asian white people score lower on the SATs and Asian people do as a general matter in the United states how much of that is genetic how much of that happens to be environmental we don't actually know the answer to that that's a hotly fraud question in science\nBut suggesting that racism is to blame for everything without looking at other confounding factors like for example test scores is\nA mistake and leads us to the wrong outcome and leads us to the wrong measures students and deal with those outcomes genetics is not the answer to all of these disparities but neither is racism now these are questions we have to be very careful that because obviously you don't want to give them a serial to people who\nAre suggesting that people some people are in their inherently are inherently worse or more evil or more violence or stupid or because of the color of their skin genetics doesn't line up that way but you also have to look at questions of science because we've already scientists\nOr stupid or because of the color of their skin genetics doesn't line up that way but\nYou also have to look at questions of science because you've already scientists\nDo and it is and it's fascinating to watch this debate play out in real time\nSo that their doctors who have who organized meetings and social scientists that it's a social implication of the field newest tools David Nelson a Baylor College of medicine geneticists is president of the human genetic society says it will not pay completely quiet on the issue is that there was no genetic evidence to support any racist ideology\nEvery time we close no way I look at my girls enough don't you think it's weird that no I didn't have the old witch why she needed to eat the apple Russian ...

watching\nThe new world Latin America because of the bad actors the sinister nature of the bad actors is that they hide in front of large nation states in this case we're looking at Hezbollah\nAnd Brazil Malcolm us to question it's yours\n[noise] yes first good to talk to chose to begin or what do you think about the arrest of a sudden Barakat who is a key as ... financier and what do you think likelihood that we can actually affect the way to extradition to the United states\nAs well that that's actually the second question is actually really really an important one let me get that but I thought in my ... that's the key get at the ... corps um any any government really in the region and other people connected in the United states to be very important as well I think honestly the most important for Argentina\nBecause the bar cut land in in South America and old Lebanese clan that tied to Hezbollah that's in finance things not just a little bit are caught it and things like that but the middle of finding the tears operation including the um the attack\nIn Nineteen Ninety four which is white and gotten think government should talk to her first um so what are the chance that they're going to extradite him to the United states\nThat a U.S person but we'd have to charge him with something you hear in the United states them with money laundering or something but I'm pretty sure there's there's something that we can charge and what what I think that you're not going to be anything like that happened after the election in Brazil\nAh because I think we're going to see how the political makeup is in Brazil and then the if there's\nA time the opportunity to do to do so uh so I'm not sure that's going to happen but I think this is a great kind of a symptom of the success that we've been having a more recently because I think you know the Trump dementia driven ministry and taking a complete it\nIt'd be much stronger on that even though it's not very vocal about it they'd been very strong about looking at the tear finance networks all throughout the ...\nShe drove administration taking a complete have it to be much stronger on that even though it's not very vocal about it they'd been very strong about looking at the tear finance networks all throughout the world and particularly in South America would they've they they've looked at his beloved very strongly in in trying to work but the regional governments to go after him\nLet's say in Brazil I'm reading the economist about Brazil there's an exciting election there in\nWhich a man who's described as a far right populist who managed to I was stabbed in the ... the stomach during a rally\nIs now leading contenders are he seems to be from the column of none of the above I don't know how to say his name correctly in Portuguese so I'll say both so narrow if he is he is he going to be a help\nDisrupting the protection of bad actors or a hindrance because he's a ... you know I\nThink he's going to be a tremendous help he comes from that an establishment wing that's been a wave throughout the world that you know obviously kind of a similar ah seem to have in the United states would be like the President Trump he he would that non establishment candidate he has a bit of a military background but not much of a political background\nGay he was at X factor no nobody really expected him to do much in the presidential race at the beginning of the of the election season but now he became the front runner\nAny any looking like he may may win on October twenty fifth when they when they go to the polls ... it'll be a closer election and the first round which was more candidates now it's just ... and a guy named Daniel had that and and so I I Do expect them to win I think he went and if he does\nHe's very close to two religious communities including damage eloquent Jewish community he's close to the military and he goes to other element they think they have direction only correct on who's the bad actors in South America in Brazil and I I I think he will be a tremendous ally if he gets elected\nMalcolm a designated this week the ... as a top transnational criminal organizations\nGiving more resources to targeting the law and the drug cracking ... activities racketeering et cetera and what was little notice is that just for him to justice created a subcommittee\nOn Lebanese Hezbollah and now has Ninety Days to get specific recommendations how to disrupt and dismantled because well I was transnational organized network so what do you believe are the most pressing items that they can do how do they prioritizes and how will the administration back this so\nI'm Glad you mentioned is not well this is a a you know with all the things are happening in the world and\nAnd here in the U.S is well this is very and use that and that really didn't get a lot of attention but very quietly tests that she's announce something that the major move for those that are in the counterterrorism community he put one of the biggest terrorist groups in the world had bullet Lebanese Hezbollah he put it in the category of a transnational criminal organizations\nAnd he but among the most important national criminal debate that this country's facing because they're tied right next to the three biggest cartels in Mexico is that the ... and the uh looking at as soon as ...\nSo he basically just effectively been made it has but ... they can now what does that do in Latin America that gives Latin America much more ... much more priority to put has blend a different category but they still struggling Latin America understand terrorism particularly Islamic terrorism\nBut they understand transnational criminal organized crime because they deal with it every day because it's allowed because let's get a more of a priority among a regional governments and what do I think they should do I think that it's subcommittee that are on has but it's been formed within the department of justice led by a veteran prosecutor name ...\nI think that they should focus a lot of cases that currently exists\nThere are already on the docket of Hezbollah members whether involved in trafficking money laundering counter bidding or even ... like the one I'm involved with and grew up with mom and dad the palm dark and put all the way to department adjusted to prosecute these cases and get successful conviction can they can get a quick when there's a lot of these are already on the docket\nAnd different courts Latin American power lie in Peru and ah in Panama and Colombia and as I think this is where the priority be All right now\nI Know John Venezuela 'cause we just have a minute ... increasingly under the boot of the Cuban security services does that enhance Iran's president said Cuba is the is the strength of the of the dictatorship does I Do have an in Tehran work together yeah Cuba\nIs part of the line you know just like the United states has the bye-bye England in New Zealand Australia and Canada they uh they have their own ... which is you know you're on Russia Syria China North Korea and they communicate a quite a bit including with Cuba human intelligence is very much involved in that and that intelligence alliance\nBut yet they're very much so like you're talking about Venezuela to one of the there's an important case headed back to ... as well in Colombia there's a gentleman named alec sob\nIs a front man for a president Nicolas Maduro the Lebanese Colombian who works with Hezbollah to launder all the kinds of cocaine the move multi shipment of cocaine and longer all this money and he just went missing recently the big in Columbia that's been paying the price down there and that that connection\nAnd cocaine the Mulkey shipment of cocaine and longer all the money and he went missing recently the big in Colombia that can crack down there and that that's connected Venezuelans human intelligence the thing that would that we've been talking about your show done for several years\nDoes have ... the executive director secure freedoms society and Malcolm whole line confidence presidents major American Jewish organizations I'm John ... [noise]\nIf they don't come down strong enough or they come down to strong our allies read this and one in particular and I was hoping you could comment on something that is sort of baffling we've seen how president Sisi was noted states recently met and he very positive and yet his rhetoric\nAnd some of his speeches have become a more of a throwback to the anti Israel language of the same time that they fully cooperating in in military and security cooperation\n[noise] yeah it's interesting I mean it it comes around the same time as the annual trips in celebration of their quote unquote victory in the October Nineteen Seventy three war [noise]\nUm but I think that you know there is a limit for the Egyptians when it comes to cooperation with the Israelis and I think that\nAt least publicly I think that the military to military and security cooperation is extremely important to to both parties but um she she is vulnerable politically he has been consolidated his power\nAnd one of the things that Egyptian leaders are you know they go to the well on is a is Israel and painting Israel as an enemy and and and having to\nYou know have kind of national unity uh in in a confrontation with a with the Israelis I think this is a lot of rhetoric for\nPublic consumption but behind the scenes\nA it strikes me that uh the security cooperation will continue if only because Egypt since really need it they've proven themselves to be benefits like incompetent and trying to pacify their own territory in the Senate financial and needed a significant amount of Israeli help\nAh the thing is he still I'm taking phone calls from Moscow [noise]\nBoy I think without a doubt that the Egyptians are interested in developing their relations\nWith ... and that intention to use the port for the Russians sleet is that going sour\n[noise] I ... it's very controversial in Egypt to have foreign forces have an actual permanent basing or basing\nA arrangements in in Egypt but there is after you know thirty five almost forty years of relations with the United states there is a kind of wistful romances I should have the Soviet period in Egypt and there is a natural place with Egypt and it's to want to play the great powers off of each other to extract as much as possible from\nThese great powers so there is a there's a genuine interest in developing a relationship with the with the with the Russian Federation at the expense of the relationship with the United states\nWe've seen that the problem that many of our allies or so called allies in the middle east today face our economic problems decided they'd be force even Saudi Arabia\nAnd imprison people taking their uh their goods their their assets um in Egypt where the economic problems are are chronic but also in Turkey and we saw hundreds of thousands of Turkish citizens\nHave sought residency in the United states just in twenty Seventeen to twenty Eighteen and many more in UK and elsewhere\nHow does or to one seat on what is the basis for the new turkey for the economic basis when he's losing and dismissing the academics from the universities and many of the others are are leaving\nUndoubtedly there the brain drain out of turkey this ongoing purge that has\nAffected the lives of you know almost a million people when you think about um you know family members ed included with those who have been purged or detained or a jail pending trial we're talking about large numbers of people\nWhat it says done has been a chilling effect through the business community which has now um moved assets outside the country but also kept their heads down\nSo uh I think that everyone has has cowed and intimidated the business community to the ... that um they will tell his line but protect their assets all the same time it's extremely difficult to imagine the kind of dynamism\nWe'll told his line protect their assets all at the same time it's extremely difficult to imagine the kind of dynamism that you had in the Turkish economy in the mid to thousands for example\nUnder a ... a under circumstances where everyone is essentially leads a a an elected autocracy in ... and the kind of repression\nThat continues but the business community says it though will continue to soldier on but it's it's not it's not the same as it was when things were more open in in Turkey\nIs a province said has not been in the news because of the Saudi Arabia matter there is a report that the Russians and the Turks are patrolling the border and does the DOD go along with the idea that it will be a just a permanent stain on his country or is he pushing for more action\n[noise] ah it's complicated but it seems that for now that agreement is going to hold but it really is going to do away\nA in operation in ... in it lived rather than permanently put it off\nUm the Russian military in particular\nA feels very strongly about cleaning up uh the it lip pocket they called it a a festering sore a of terrorists to an extreme is so um they're also report Saturday Night live bit despite the kind of joint uh operations between turkey and Russia\nUm that uh various extremist groups that ... which by the end of the month have to give up their weapons are refusing to do so\nUh and that would trigger response from the Russians and the Syrian Government and the Russians have been supportive of the Syrian government's desire to reestablish Damascus has control over\nOver the country so I I I think um it live is not in the headlines but I think it's going to come back into the headlines sooner rather than later\nMalcolm a quick quick could you tell us what is the impact of what happened now with Saudi Arabia and the other countries in the region the particular Iran and turkey are in in the war in Yemen will this habit direct impact will will the Saudi Arabia be reluctant to continue the bombing and the expense of aid\n[noise] I don't think so I think as long as king Solomon wants to have a crown prince Mohammed bin Salman as the crown prince\nUh this is going to be the policy the government is Saudi Arabia I think certainly um ... Mohammed bin Salman opponents within Saudi Arabia or embolden by this but you know who were ... ... how are they going to seek redress or he controls all of the\nThe important levers of power in Saudi Arabia so they can be angry about what's happened they can be angry at him and they can be angry about what's happening in Istanbul\nTo Jamal ... G but ... in the end they have no power to fact a a real change that will ultimately alter policies in places like Yemen and other places\nA final question it hadn't occurred to me that till now but a steep cuts here does the the have a say in any fashion and risk in any fashion about the subject matter is that is that a problem for Cairo are they on the outside\nI think for the most part I'm there on the outside the Egyptians have expressed their support for the Saudi Arabian government um and of course\nEgypt ... and the Turks are true tremendous odds are over ... support for the Muslim Brotherhood so uh it doesn't really affect the Egyptians directly but they can be counted upon to support the Saudis in this instance\nSteve ... the any Enrico ... senior fellow for Middle East and African studies at the council on Foreign Relations Malcolm hotline conference a president's major American Jewish organizations I'm John ...\nThe retail landscape is rapidly change\nFor leading brand cutting through the media noise is key to attract consumers turning them into custody\nStudies show that Seventy percent of the human brain is used for\nSmart digital Stein elevate the way brands engage consumers drive\nSales and impact brand value influential consumer experiences need to be powered by an impact so digital communication strategy driving consumer attention and\nA leading marketing technology company powers millions of digital times around the world leading the wave of retail transformation\nVisit scala dot com today to modernize your digital experience tune into the John ... show every Friday or listen by the John bachelor show pot or the scholar report and in depth segment about how emerging technologies lace into all areas of the economy both business to business and retail\nThe economy both business to business and ...\nCorporate profile but it it was brought here by Amarillo goal of the company building by next profitable gold mining mineral rich Brazil\nAmarillo gold is rapidly advancing as price merit roses development project with Oprah one point one million ounces of pickle reserved grading at one point for two grams for talking with a relatively low kept\nExeter production goal your and twenty Twenty one the current rate of return is estimated to be a remarkable fifty one percent per animal would annual production exceeding one hundred twenty three thousand gold ounces\nDetails jewelry is absolutely beautiful at prices that are astonishingly low and on Saturday October twenty seven\nPrices will be at their absolute lowest for the D.C jail annual sale that's right the jail has only one sale per year and this is it\nDJ oh is that family owned jewelry store where the warmth of the staffing good old fashioned customer service make the jewelry sparkle that much brighter the staff as a non commissioned said there's never any pressure just that's fine it's first quality diamonds high quality gemstones and gifts for every occasion\nDiscovered this Jen in Falls Church for yourself and see why DJ out when the procedures Angie's List super service awards five years in a row\nWarm trust fashion customer service and the very best prices of the year on Saturday October twenty seven for hours and location visit D.

escalation if not a war ah so I don't know if he'll necessarily want to let's say pull the trigger on early election kind of dissolves the or the government is\nIf the countries in the middle of a campaign um you know you don't quite know or you can get into a war but you don't quite know how how you're going to get out of a war um and that's true too that over the past week guys that has really come to the forefront and and could erupt I Would argue or today friday or here in Israel\nUm but but at the same time a show in a lot of restraints\nAre both she and and as a security cap is actually a lot of restraint or as you mentioned the the rocket ship and also one fell off the coast of Tel Aviv two days ago\nOr the response there was an idea for ... but it was a relatively measured a there waiting and seeing how amongst response today to uh to planned a you know friday Gaza border marches and that will dictate really how how Israel moves forward\nOr the government said that the rules of the game and have have changed that they're going to respond a lot more forcefully tiny tiny violence coming out of Gaza where the rockets or or border violence\nUm so we have to wait and see whether Hamas actually a push is both a he and his ruins escalation\nThe North's theory is that a no longer a priority risk because of the negotiations between Netanyahu and poked and [noise] no I\nWouldn't go that far uh it's always there uh Israel is monitoring what Iran and its proxies are are still doing in Syria but but you're right and the sense that it's kind of falling off since the big altercation on the air between a between Israel and and the Russians a number of weeks ago\nAnd as mentioned earlier the uh the as three hundred\nAre being deployed in Syria that's also complicating factor or no Israel has has said and I believe it to be true that they'll they'll act when they need to act or in Syria to stop Iran from\nFrom I'm basing itself there militarily but but it's been fairly quiet over the past few weeks um and that's one on the ground though it's interesting that the border crossing between Israel and Syria or in the Golan Heights is actually a real ... a few days ago\nSo that's also a a signal stability or the question though is how long it it can hold 'em and but it's always a priority or Israeli Martin's arguably more than about\nMalcolm we say that the Jason Greenblatt and others are talking about new initiatives or one I think that with the economical United guys in the west bank they the massive talked about the economic incentives ... where is the plan now have you heard anything about\nAny possibility in timeline given the fact of what's happening in Gaza and obviously doesn't appear to be a an opportune moment to start talking about reconciliation [noise]\nAh right I mean the Americans um you know led by green glass jar crushed and uh and the bastard here Mr Friedman are are involved with\nA you know there are few moving parts so number one they're they're peace plan I Believe that does exist or we should mention that does exist and they made a an effort I think in recent weeks to say that uh they do still plan on rolling it out\nOr I think they're going to wait eight till after the American mid term elections next month but I think more importantly I think they're going to to wait until after any uh early Israel Israeli election here in the spring\nSo I don't think that's imminent uh but ... but in a sense of ah you know Palestinian reconciliation a Hamas and Fatah a over Gaza that's also been in the works but in recent weeks that's kind of been in a dead horse a you know there's a real movement on that Abbas has\nStuck in a Hamas has shown no inclination on and on the agenda to soften its positions\nSo it's kind of a dead end as well and then I think overall diplomatically and as he mentioned economically the Palestinians have just refuse to to re engage with the Americans so that makes it a bit more difficult to kind of get anything moving\nThey cut off as money doesn't show anywhere now\nYou have to [noise] to re engage with the Americans so that makes it a bit more difficult to kind of get anything moving\nThe cut off of money does it show anywhere in the area we have about twenty seconds\n[noise] ah it doesn't quite yet the Europeans are somewhat the Arabs have kind of stepped into the breach but it is concerned it's a concern that a financially the PA will\nUh will get into trouble and then that'll dictates a kind of stability and security on the ground that's a

and again they see America First and made the reliance on the United states and I don't think they like that\nAre all that much they want to be involved as partners um and there are certain the reforms that the United states\nHas done that that that\nThey can do in the u._k. they can do in Europe uh one thing that that the report do besides just funding them more which obviously you know it it's not a a an advocacy group and not asking for more money but not doing their job but one thing that the United states that they pay a company to develop\nSomething in the research and development face all the way to orbit they'll fly hardware and in the in the pain and Europe it's usually a fifty fifty split so that the programs are a lot less ambitious and at the end of the day they don't

kick start your own industry there and they can find it interesting and really find a role in the new space economy that's developing\nWithout spending at the same amount of money that the U.S or or China would would be spending so there are things that Europe can do proactive building on the things that they're doing already which is an impressive flight record out of out of French yawning\nUm and the new hardware they're coming on line but they could do more on the regulatory sense to attach out but I think that's what\nThis or advocacy report was really trying to get at\nJoe in your

would be against the Russians and even if they were able to fight with the Serbs the Russians would intervene and so the bulk of their strength would have to fight the Russians and so they had\nPondered how would the the relatively small after Hungarian Ari fight the vast Russian Army\nAnd this is this isn't really a perplexing problem for the Austrians because the Russian Army is going to advance on a very broad front from the Baltic Sea all the way down to the to Ukraine\nSo all the way down to the Easter so where do where can the Austrian strike with any hope of victory well there was no hope of a victory in the sense of breaking through our sweet there on the Russian flag and marching to St Petersburg\nWhat the what the Austrians always plan to do is to give it a short sharp
